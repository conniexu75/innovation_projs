https://openalex.org/W2131593962,"Odor perception in mammals is mediated by a large multigene family of olfactory receptor (OR) genes. The number of OR genes varies extensively among different species of mammals, and most species have a substantial number of pseudogenes. To gain some insight into the evolutionary dynamics of mammalian OR genes, we identified the entire set of OR genes in platypuses, opossums, cows, dogs, rats, and macaques and studied the evolutionary change of the genes together with those of humans and mice. We found that platypuses and primates have <400 functional OR genes while the other species have 800-1,200 functional OR genes. We then estimated the numbers of gains and losses of OR genes for each branch of the phylogenetic tree of mammals. This analysis showed that (i) gene expansion occurred in the placental lineage each time after it diverged from monotremes and from marsupials and (ii) hundreds of gains and losses of OR genes have occurred in an order-specific manner, making the gene repertoires highly variable among different orders. It appears that the number of OR genes is determined primarily by the functional requirement for each species, but once the number reaches the required level, it fluctuates by random duplication and deletion of genes. This fluctuation seems to have been aided by the stochastic nature of OR gene expression."

Here we use a novel means, namely a chemically inducible bridge formation between the plasma and ER membranes, to highlight the plasma membrane-adjacent ER compartment and show that this is the site where STIM1 and its Ca2+ channel partner, Orai1, form a productive interaction upon store depletion. By changing the length of the linkers connecting the plasma and ER membranes, we show that Orai1 requires a larger space than STIM1 between the two membranes. This finding suggests that Orai1 is part of a larger macromolecular cluster with an estimated 11-14-nm protrusion to the cytoplasm, whereas the cytoplasmic domain of STIM1 fits in a space calculated to be less than 6 nm. We finally show that agonist-induced translocation of STIM1 is rapidly reversible and only partially affects STIM1 in the juxtanuclear ER compartment. These studies are the first to detect juxtaposed areas between the ER and the plasma membrane in live cells, revealing novel details of STIM1-Orai1 interactions.

It has long been known that Ca2+-mobilizing agonists activate a Ca2+ entry pathway subsequent to their mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores by a mechanism that has eluded identification until most recently. In 1986, Putney (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar) had postulated that enhanced Ca2+ entry is a consequence of the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, introducing the term capacitative Ca2+ entry or store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCE). 3The abbreviations used are:SOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entry pathwayERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneFRBfragment of mTOR that binds FKBP12mTORmammalian target of rapamycinPtdIns(4,5)P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateInsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateSTIMstromal interaction moleculeTgthapsigarginYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinmRFPmonomeric red fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinTIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopeTKthymidine kinaseFKBPFK506-binding protein. Most recent developments began to shed light on the molecular details underlying the SOCE phenomenon. Screening with libraries of RNA interference, two groups have identified proteins, previously known as stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) 1 and -2 (2Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S.

STIM1 and STIM2 are ER-resident proteins that contain a single membrane-spanning domain and an EF hand motif in the luminal side of the ER that serves as a Ca2+ sensor. Remarkably, STIM1 shows rapid translocation to a plasma membrane (PM)-adjacent region of the ER upon depletion of the ER luminal Ca2+ (4Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W.

In parallel studies, another protein necessary for SOCE and with a channel-like structure has been identified and named Orai1 (8Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B.

Although overexpression of STIM1 alone is a poor enhancer of SOCE, together with Orai1, it dramatically enhances store-operated Ca2+ entry consistent with the hypothesis that STIM and Orai form a functional complex, (10Mercer J.C.

Finally, three groups have recently provided strong evidence that Orai1 indeed is the molecular entity forming the channel pore through which Ca2+ enters the cells upon store depletion (12Vig M.

Several questions have been raised concerning the movements of STIM1 within the ER and between the ER and the PM upon store depletion. Since STIM1 can be glycosylated and is also found in the PM, it was of great importance to determine whether the rapid appearance of STIM1 in the form of numerous puncta at the PM upon store depletion represents a translocation of the protein within the ER from the reticulo-tubular to a membrane-adjacent region or whether it also involves the incorporation of the molecule into the PM. Some studies suggested that ER depletion increases the amount of STIM1 in the PM (5Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) and that the increased Ca2+ entry could be blocked by STIM1 antibodies acting from the outside of the cells (7Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies found no evidence that significant amounts of STIM1 would be incorporated into the PM upon store depletion (10Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R.

Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Elegant recent experiments have concluded that STIM1 translocation is a rapid process that slightly precedes and correlates with the increased Ca2+ influx upon store depletion and that there is a sub-PM pool of the ER to which the majority of STIM1 translocates (17Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This, however, does not rule out that STIM1 in the PM plays additional roles related to some forms of Ca2+ entry process (18Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 579: 703-715Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or that it can cluster at the PM after store depletion (19Hauser C.T. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the fraction of ER positioned closely to the PM has been recognized long before the STIM1-Orai1 movements were described. Co-purification of the InsP3 receptor located in the ER with PM has been described more than 20 years ago (20Guillemette G. Balla T. Baukal A.J. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4541-4548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rossier M.F. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the importance of the PM-associated fraction of the ER in phospholipid synthesis and transfer in both metazoan cells and yeast have been well documented (22Pichler H. Gaigg B. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Kohlwein S.D. Zellnig G. Perktold A. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Holthuis J.C. Levine T.P. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The newly recognized significance of this compartment in Ca2+ signaling and its suspected role in phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) synthesis and transfer to the PM prompted us to find new means to visualize and possibly functionally modulate this ER compartment. To this end, in the present study, we describe a novel chemically inducible heterodimerization approach to detect points of proximity between the ER and the PM and apply this technique to study the relationship between this compartment and the movements of the STIM1 and Orai1 proteins during Ca2+ depletion of the ER. Highlighting of this ER compartment in COS-7 cells allowed us to show that this is the region where STIM1 and Orai1 form a rapidly reversible complex upon Ca2+ store depletion. Manipulation of the distance between the PM and the ER permitted determination of the spatial requirements of both STIM1 and Orai1, unexpectedly revealing that Orai1 requires a significantly larger gap than STIM1 between the PM and ER, a difference not justified by the sizes of their respective predicted cytoplasmic sequences. This suggests that Orai1 is part of a large macromolecular complex with a sizeable (11-14-nm) protrusion into the cytoplasm. Materials—Rapamycin and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem. Apyrase and ATP were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest analytical grade. DNA Constructs—YFP- and mRFP-STIM1 plasmids were made by inserting the fluorescent proteins after the signal sequence, starting at residue 23 with a linker (KLGAGAGAGAILNS) placed between the C terminus of the fluorescent protein and the rest of the human STIM1 sequence (obtained as an expressed sequence tag clone: CS0DI067YJ06 from Invitrogen). The whole cDNA of this construct was inserted within the NheI and the KpnI restriction sites of the pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) vector. The human Orai1 was obtained as an expressed sequence tag clone (id: 3914595, Open Biosystems) and was tagged with CFP, YFP, or mRFP at its C terminus with a linker (AGANSGAGAGAGAILSRGAAAGAAGPVAT) inserted between Orai1 and the fluorescent protein based on the pEGFP-N1 vector in which the starting Met of GFP was changed to Leu. The cytomegalovirus promoter in some of the STIM1 and Orai1 constructs was replaced by the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter amplified from the pRL-TK vector of Promega (nucleotides 7-1029) using the VspI and NheI restriction sites. For PM targeting, the N-terminal palmitoylation/myristoylation signal of the Lyn protein (MGCIKSKGKDSAGA) was used (24Inoue T. Heo W.D. Grimley J.S. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and it was fused to the N terminus of the human FKBP12 protein either through a short linker (DPTRSANSGAGAGAGAILSR) or through a longer helical linker (DPTRSANS(EAAAR)9NSGAGAGAGAILSR). This fusion protein was tagged with CFP or mRFP using the pEGFP-N1 plasmid backbone. For targeting of the FRB protein to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER, the C-terminal localization sequence (residues 521-587) of the human SacI phosphatase (obtained as an expressed sequence tag clone: 3049075 from Open Biosystems) was added to the C terminus of the FRB fragment with a linker of GSGAGAGAGAILNSRV between the two proteins. This sequence was placed behind CFP, mRFP, or GFP using the pEGFP-C1 plasmid backbone. A construct in which a longer helical linker of GSGAGAGAGAILNS(EAAAR)9NSRV was inserted between the FRB and the ER targeting sequence was also created. The plasmids designed for the rapamycin-induced PM recruitment of the type-IV 5-phosphatase domain have been described elsewhere (25Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). All constructs have been sequenced. Confocal Analysis, Cytoplasmic Ca2+, and TIRF Measurements of Single Cells—COS-7 cells were cultured on glass coverslips (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) and transfected with the indicated constructs (2 μg of DNA total/dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h as described previously (25Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Confocal measurements were performed at 35 °C in a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing (in mm) 120 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.7 MgSO4, 10 glucose, 10 sodium Hepes, pH 7.4, using a Zeiss LSM 510-META scanning confocal microscope and a ×63/1.4 objective. Data were acquired with the multitrack mode with scanning in frame mode using the 405, 488, and 543 nm laser excitation of CFP, YFP (or GFP), and mRFP, respectively. The three channels were recorded with the following emission filters (CFP, 420-490 when together with GFP or 420-505 when together with YFP; GFP or YFP, 505-545, mRFP, 560LP). Postacquisition picture analysis was performed using the PhotoShop (Adobe) software to expand to the full dynamic range, but only linear changes were allowed. TIRF analysis was performed at room temperature (24 °C) in an Olympus through the lens TIRF microscope system equipped with a Hammamatsu EM-CCD camera and a PlanApo ×60/1.45 objective. Excitation with 488 or 568 nm lasers was used for the YFP or Fluo4 and mRFP, respectively, and scans were performed at every 10 s. For data acquisition the Openlab Software (Improvision) was used, and the pictures were exported as TIFF files for processing with the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Quantitation of the membrane intensities was determined after defining the regions of individual cells and thresholding. Due to the large variations of the intensities of individual cells because of the different footprint size and translocation responses, these responses were normalized, taking their maximal thapsigargin (Tg)-induced translocation as 100%. These recordings were then averaged, and their S.E. was calculated and plotted against time. For calcium measurements, cells were loaded with fura2/AM or (Fluo4/AM in the TIRF analysis) (3 μm, 45 min, room temperature). Calcium measurements with Fura2 were also performed at room temperature in the same solution supplemented with 200 μm sulfin-pyrazone. An Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a Lamda-DG4 illuminator and a MicroMAX-1024BFT digital camera and the appropriate filter sets was used. The MetaFluor (Molecular Devices) software was used for data acquisition. Characterization of STIM1 Movements in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells can provide a better spatial resolution of the ER-PM compartment, yet they have not been used in the published literature for STIM studies. When using these cells, we noted that overexpression of STIM1 has grossly altered the ER architecture and produced large sheets of ER contacting the PM (supplemental Fig. 1). This important observation may have significant relevance to the role of STIM1 in shaping the ER and, therefore, is currently under further investigation. In the mean-time, to make STIM1 studies possible in COS-7 cells, we generated STIM constructs designed for low expression levels. For this purpose, we replaced the cytomegalovirus promoter in the STIM1 (and in some other constructs) with the herpes simplex virus TK promoter. Expression of this construct yielded moderate expression levels with features of STIM1 distribution observed in other cells. Unless otherwise noted, all STIM1 constructs referred to in this study are driven by the TK promoter. The movements of STIM1 were followed in live cells after the expression of a YFP-STIM1 (or mRFP-STIM1) fusion construct containing the fluorescent protein in the luminal side of the ER between the signal sequence and the EF hand essentially as described in Ref. 4Liou J.

As shown in Fig. 1A (and supplemental Movie 1), STIM1 appears mostly in the tubular ER and in the nuclear envelope as observed by previous studies. Activation of endogenously expressed Ca2+-mobilizing P2Y receptors of the cells with ATP caused the rapid appearance of distinct STIM1 puncta in the periphery of the cells, but the localization of STIM1 in the nuclear envelope was only partially affected in most cells. However, the addition of Tg, the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase blocker, led to the disappearance of STIM1 from the deeper ER structures with a simultaneous enhancement of the peripheral puncta (Fig. 1 and supplemental Movie 1). These data suggested that the depletion of the ER Ca2+ is not uniform after agonist stimulation and that it affects the peripheral ER pools before reaching the juxtanuclear compartments. However, the difference in response to ATP and Tg may just reflect the fact that activation of endogenous P2Y receptors generates a relatively low level of InsP3 in COS-7 cells, thus limiting the Ca2+-mobilizing action of this messenger. To determine the reversibility of the STIM1 translocation process, two approaches were used. First, the agonist action of ATP was terminated by the addition of the enzyme apyrase, an ecto-ATPase that rapidly degrades extracellular ATP. Second, the agonist-induced response was terminated by the rapid removal of the PM pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by the use of our recently developed chemically induced translocation of the type-IV phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase enzyme to this compartment (25Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The process of STIM1 translocation was followed by TIRF analysis where the translocation of STIM1 to the membrane compartment attached to the coverslips can be monitored and quantified (16Xu P. Lu J. Li Z. Yu X. Chen L. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of apyrase to cells in which STIM1 had been translocated to the peripheral puncta by ATP application rapidly reversed the process, and STIM1 quickly relocated into the tubular ER compartment. The subsequent addition of Tg to such cells still could evoke a massive translocation of STIM1. Similar results were obtained when the agonist effect was terminated by eliminating PtdIns(4,5)P2 by the rapamycin-induced PM recruitment of the 5-phosphatase (25Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here the localization response of YFP-STIM1 was simultaneously monitored with the recruitment of the mRFP-FKBP-5-phosphatase by TIRF analysis. ATP-induced localization of STIM1 was rapidly reversed as the 5-phosphatase was recruited to the membrane after rapamycin addition, but Tg was still able to evoke STIM1 translocation even without PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the PM (Fig. 2A). The relocalization of STIM1 clearly required the refilling of the Ca2+ stores as neither apyrase (not shown) nor the termination of InsP3 generation by the membrane-translocated 5-phosphatase failed to remove STIM1 from the cell periphery unless Ca2+ was present in the medium (Fig. 2B). These data clearly demonstrated the usefulness of COS-7 cells for these studies and that STIM1 not only translocates to the peripheral ER compartments quickly upon store depletion but that this process is readily reversible upon refilling of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. The Effects of Tg on Ca2+ Influx and STIM1 Translocation Can Be Significantly Delayed, Showing Considerable Variations between Individual Cells—Next we examined the effect of simultaneous expression of Orai1 and STIM1 on the Ca2+ response of COS-7 cells stimulated either by ATP or by Tg. It has been shown recently that simultaneous expression of these two proteins causes a large capacitative Ca2+ influx response upon store depletion in other cell types (10Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I.

Spassova M.A. Tang X.D. Hewavitharana T. Xu W. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20661-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Here we compared the Ca2+ responses to application of an agonist or Tg. The addition of Tg alone led to a relatively rapid and small increase in [Ca2+]i, reflecting the rapid Ca2+ release from the ER, followed by a significantly delayed large Ca2+ increase indicating the opening of the capacitative Ca2+ entry pathway (Fig. 3A, blue traces). This delay showed large cell-to-cell variations but was not observed if Tg was added after the agonist, ATP (Fig. 3B). The addition of ATP to cells expressing both STIM1 and Orai1 evoked an immediate, large Ca2+ response that exceeded the increases observed in control cells and showed a significantly enhanced plateau phase. These Ca2+ responses showed two kinds of patterns; in cells that showed moderately enhanced Ca2+ peaks and a steady sustained Ca2+ plateau, the subsequent Tg-induced increase was also moderately enhanced (Fig. 3B, red traces). In contrast, many cells showed large oscillatory Ca2+ waves, and in these cells, the subsequent Tg response was also greatly enhanced (Fig. 3B, blue traces). To determine whether STIM1 translocation also shows a comparable delay after Tg treatment, cells expressing STIM1 were examined by TIRF analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, STIM1 translocation in response to Tg showed similar cell-to-cell variations and was significantly delayed when compared with the rapid effects of ATP (shown in Figs. 1 and 2). When the Fluo4 (to monitor Ca2+) and TIRF analysis were done simultaneously, there was a good correlation between the delays of the two responses (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that the Tg-induced store depletion has to reach a certain level before it results in the movement of STIM1 to the cell periphery to activate Ca2+ influx, and the variability of the delay is probably due to the different ER Ca2+ leak activity of the individual cells. Visualization of the ER Compartment Making Contacts with the Plasma-Membrane—After establishing the COS-7 cell system as a model, we wanted to determine whether there are pre-existing ER compartments beneath the PM that would be preferential sites of STIM1 translocation. To visualize such a compartment, we used a chemically inducible molecular bridge formation strategy. The FRB fragment of the mTOR protein was targeted to the cytoplasmic surface of ER in the form of a CFP fusion protein, whereas the FKBP-12 protein fused to mRFP was targeted to the inner surface of the PM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The addition of rapamycin causes heterodimerization of the FKBP and FRB modules (24Inoue T. Heo W.D. Grimley J.S. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that a molecular bridge can only be formed at sites where the ER membrane and the PM are at close proximity since both of these proteins are retained in their respective membranes. It was also expected that once such a contact zone had been established, it would be extended as more molecules are recruited to this region. Fig. 5A shows that the two respective constructs show a characteristic PM and ER localization when co-expressed in COS-7 cells. After the addition of rapamycin, both constructs rapidly started to concentrate in small flat areas at the cell surface where they showed tight co-localization. This process could be detected as early as 15-30 s after rapamycin addition. The conjoining areas developed into a relatively stable steady state within 5 min, after which the structures were stable and showed only very slow expansion (see also supplemental Movie 2). These results indicated that the FRB and FKBP fusion proteins with high lateral mobility within the PM and ER membranes became trapped within their respective membranes at the areas of juxtaposition upon heterodimerization. Although this process also extends the area beyond the initial contact points, it will still pinpoint the sites where the two membranes had been at their closest proximity. To determine the extent to which the ER itself is reorganized during the development of these membrane contacts, several markers that visualize the ER were used. These included the type-I InsP3 receptor in the form of a YFP fusion protein, a GFP construct targeted to the ER-lumen, and the GFP-fused C-terminal targeting signal of the inositide phosphatase, SacI. In all of these cases, we could observe the flattening of a fraction of the peripheral tubular ER compartment at the sites of FRB-FKBP interaction. Fig. 5B shows an example with the GFP-ER(SacI) protein. However, this manipulation hardly affected the deeper juxtanuclear ER compartments (Fig. 5B), indicating that only the peripheral portion of the ER is subject to the changes induced by the rapamycin-induced PM attachment. The Site of STIM1 Translocation Corresponds to the PM-ER Contact Sites—Next we examined whether STIM1 translocation to the peripheral ER sites upon store depletion corresponds to the sites that can be established by chemical cross-bridging. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the YFP-fused form of STIM1 in addition to the PM-targeted mRFP-FKBP and the ER-targeted CFP-FRB fusion proteins (in some cases, both constructs were tagged with CFP). Such cells were then treated with Tg to translocate STIM1 into the peripheral ER and form the subplasmalemmal puncta (Fig. 6A). Tg treatment did not alter the localization of either the PM (Fig. 6A, panel a) or the ER-targeted (not shown) fusion proteins. The addition of rapamycin to Tg-treated cells rapidly established the PM-ER contact patches, and importantly, these were always initiated from the sites of STIM1 localization (Fig. 6A, panels d-i). These results suggested that the appearance and expansion of these membrane contacts upon chemical cross-bridging indeed originate from the contact points between the ER and the PM and that STIM1 defines this compartment in a store-depleted state. A remarkable finding of these experiments was that the STIM1 puncta were almost always pushed to the periphery of the PM-ER junctional zones. Only in a few cases were there STIM1 puncta trapped within theses contact zones (Fig. 6A, panel i, arrows). These data raised the possibility that STIM1 might be part of a larger molecular complex that is excluded from the narrow gap between the PM and ER membranes as enforced by the chemical cross-bridge.

Acetyltransferase enzymes transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to lysine residues, while deacetylase enzymes catalyze removal of the acetyl group by hydrolysis or by an NAD+-dependent reaction. Propionyl-coenzyme A (CoA), like acetyl-CoA, is a high energy product of fatty acid metabolism and is produced through a similar chemical reaction. Because acetyl-CoA is the donor molecule for protein acetylation, we investigated whether proteins can be propionylated in vivo, using propionyl-CoA as the donor molecule. We report that the Salmonella enterica propionyl-CoA synthetase enzyme PrpE is propionylated in vivo at lysine 592; propionylation inactivates PrpE. The propionyl-lysine modification is introduced by bacterial Gcn-5-related N-acetyltransferase enzymes and can be removed by bacterial and human Sir2 enzymes (sirtuins). Like the sirtuin deacetylation reaction, sirtuin-catalyzed depropionylation is NAD+-dependent and produces a byproduct, O-propionyl ADP-ribose, analogous to the O-acetyl ADP-ribose sirtuin product of deacetylation. Only a subset of the human sirtuins with deacetylase activity could also depropionylate substrate. The regulation of cellular propionyl-CoA by propionylation of PrpE parallels regulation of acetyl-CoA by acetylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and raises the possibility that propionylation may serve as a regulatory modification in higher organisms.

In higher organisms, aberrant acetylation of lysine residues in histone tails correlates with diseases such as cancers and developmental disorders and may contribute to modulation of cell life span (3Guarente L.

From bacteria to humans, N-Lys acetylation controls the activity of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (AMP-forming; Acs) and potentially that of other members of the AMP-forming family of enzymes (5Starai V.J.

In Salmonella enterica, Acs is deacetylated by CobB, a member of the Sir2 family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases (a.k.a. sirtuins) (8Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Interestingly, strains of S. enterica lacking CobB deacetylase activity cannot grow on propionate because the propionyl-CoA synthetase (encoded by the prpE gene) that activates propionate to propionyl-CoA is not active (5Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 9Starai V.J. Takahashi H. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells generate propionyl-CoA from several different processes, including the catabolism of odd chain fatty acids, the decarboxylation of succinate, the catabolism of amino acids (e.g. threonine), and the activation of propionate (10Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Haller T. Buckel T. Rétey J. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4622-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Propionate is a powerful inhibitor of cell growth that is widely used as a food preservative. Reports in the literature suggest that propionyl-CoA may be responsible for the cytotoxic effects of propionate. Although the direct effects of propionyl-CoA are unclear, it is clear that cells avoid accumulating this metabolite (13Horswill A.R. Dudding A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19094-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Brock M. Buckel W. Eur. J.

The cell maintains low levels of propionyl-CoA by using it as a source of carbon and energy. The predominant pathway for propionate degradation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the 2-methylcitric acid cycle, which converts propionate to pyruvate via reactions similar to those of the Krebs cycle (supplemental Fig. S6) (16Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4703-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Miyakoshi S. Uchiyama H. Someya T. Satoh T. Tabuchi T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 2381-2387Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Propionylated lysine residues were recently identified in histones (18Chen Y. Sprung R. Tang Y. Ball H. Sangras B. Kim S. Falck J.R. Peng J. Gu W. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; Google Scholar, 19Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. Grishin N.V. White M. Yang X.J. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar); by analogy with histone acetylation, propionyl-CoA is presumably required as a propionyl donor. However, the physiological significance of lysine propionylation was unknown. We report here that the propionyl-CoA synthetase (PrpE) enzyme of S. enterica is reversibly propionylated in vivo and that this modification regulates enzymatic activity. The modification is removed by the S. enterica sirtuin CobB in an NAD+-dependent reaction that mirrors the sirtuin deacetylation reaction. Our results suggest that propionylation/depropionylation may be a conserved regulatory mechanism in higher organisms and that acylation/deacylation systems for the control of acyl:CoA (AMP-forming) ligases may be a general mechanism for maintaining CoA homeostasis in all cells. Protein Purity Assessment—Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) and visualized with Coomassie Blue (21Sasse J.

Purity was assessed by band densitometry using a Fotodyne imaging system with Foto/Analyst v.5.00 software (Fotodyne Inc) for image acquisition and TotalLab v.2005 software for analysis (Nonlinear Dynamics). S. enterica PrpEWT and PrpEK592E Proteins—These proteins were purified by chitin purification as described (11Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Pat—GST-H6-Protein Acetyltransferase (Pat) was overproduced as described (22Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The Pat used in all experiments except the propionylation and depropionylation time courses was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography as described (22Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and was 32% homogeneous. Pat used for time courses was purified by affinity chromatography using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column on anÄKTA FPLC Purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells expressing GST-H6-Pat were harvested by centrifugation at 10,500 × g for 12 min in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20 XOI refrigerated centrifuge with a JLA-8.1000 rotor. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5, at 24 °C), NaCl (0.5 m), imidazole (20 mm)) and broken by sonication using a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) for 3 min (50% duty). After equilibration with buffer A and loading of cell-free extract, the column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A, followed by 40 ml of 8% buffer B (sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5, at 24 °C), NaCl (0.5 m), imidazole (0.5 m)). A 50-ml linear gradient increased buffer B to 100%. GST-H6-Pat eluted at ∼40% buffer B and was 67% pure. GST-H6-Pat was stored in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer (Tris-HCl, 50 mm, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) containing KCl (100 mm) and 50% glycerol (v/v) at 4 °C. CobB Sirtuin—Synthesis of CobB sirtuin fused to an N-terminal chitin binding tag was directed by plasmid pCOBB31 (supplemental Table S1) in Escherichia coli strain ER2566 (New England Biolabs). Cells were grown at 25 °C in two liters of lysogenic broth (23Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bertani G. J.

Gene expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1 mm at A600 ∼ 0.4. Cells were grown overnight at 25 °C, harvested by centrifugation at 10,500 × g for 12 min as described above, and broken using a chilled French pressure cell (Spectronic Instruments; two passes at 1.3 kPa). Protein was purified and the tag removed using the standard protocol for the IMPACT-CN Protein Fusion and Purification System (New England Biolabs). Cell-free extract was incubated with chitin beads for 1 h at 4 °C prior to column preparation. After tag removal, CobB protein was stored in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) containing KCl (100 mm) and 50% glycerol (v/v) at -80 °C. PncA Nicotinamidase—S. enterica pncA was amplified using primers to add 5′-KpnI and 3′-HindIII restriction sites and cloned into plasmid pTEV6 cut with the same enzymes to yield plasmid pPNC2 (supplemental Table S1), which encodes PncA protein with an N-terminal maltose-binding protein-hexahistidine (MBP-H6) tag. Plasmid pPNC2 was moved into E. coli strain BL21(λDE3) by electroporation (25Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene. 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was grown overnight and subcultured 1:100 (v/v) into 2 liters of lysogenic broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The culture was grown shaking at 37 °C to A600 ∼ 0.7, and MBP-H6-PncA synthesis was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). The culture was grown overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and MBP-H6-PncA purified as described for purification of GST-H6-Pat. PncA eluted at ∼30% buffer B. MBP-H6-PncA-containing fractions were pooled and H6-rTEV protease (26Shih Y.P.

The cleavage reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and dialyzed overnight against two liters of buffer A at 4 °C. Tagless PncA protein (83% pure) was resolved from the reaction mixture using the 5-ml HisTrap HP column, which did not bind tagless PncA. Protein was stored in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) containing KCl (100 mm) and 20% (v/v) glycerol at -80 °C. S. enterica Acs Peptide—Peptide consisting of the C-terminal 52 amino acids of S. enterica Acs was synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. Peptide was purified by preparative scale HPLC using a Dynamax C18 column (22 × 250 mm). Peptide eluted at 36.5% acetonitrile with a final chromatographic purity of 89%.

PrpE (62.5 pmol) was incubated at 37 °C with GST-H6-Pat (62.5 pmol) and [1-14C]Ac-CoA (20 μm, 54 mCi/mmol) or [1-14C]Pr-CoA (20 μm, 53 mCi/mmol) (Moravek) in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 24 °C) containing tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (200 μm); final volume was 100 μl. After 2 h, GST-H6-Pat protein was removed using GST-Mag®-agarose beads (Novagen). CobB sirtuin (15.6 pmol), NAD+ (1 mm), and PncA (50 pmol, when noted) were added and reactions incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Reactions were stopped with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 0.5 m) or gel-loading buffer (Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8, at 24 °C), SDS (2%, w/v), bromphenol blue (0.1%, w/v), glycerol (10%, v/v), dithiothreitol (100 mm)) (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A1.20Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized after staining with Coomassie Blue. Gels were dried and exposed overnight to a MultiPurpose Phosphor Screen (Packard). Radiolabeled proteins were identified by phosphorimaging using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard) and OptiQuant v 04.00 software (Packard). Propionylation Time Courses—Propionylation reactions were performed as described above with either PrpE (62.5 pmol) and GST-H6-Pat (31.3 pmol) or PrpE (37.5 pmol) and AcuA (18.7 pmol) added/25 μl. Samples (25 μl) were removed at designated times and stopped by addition of gel loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 4-15% SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were quantified with respect to a standard curve using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard) and OptiQuant v 04.00 software (Packard). Depropionylation Time Courses—Propionylation reactions were performed as described above with PrpE (62.5 pmol) and GST-H6-Pat (31.3 pmol) added/25 μl. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, GST-H6-Pat was removed using GST-Mag®-agarose beads (Novagen). Sirtuin (31.3 pmol), NAD+ (1 mm), and PncA (50 pmol) were added/25 μl. Samples (25 μl) were removed at designated times and stopped by addition of gel loading buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were quantitated as described above. Propionyl-CoA Synthetase—PrpE (62.5 pmol) was incubated with Pat (62.5 pmol) and 20 μm Pr-CoA, Ac-CoA, or CoA for 6 h at 37 °C. Reaction conditions were as described above. PrpE activity was determined using a coupled assay to link AMP formation to NADH oxidation (11Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C.

Reactions (1 ml) contained HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 25 °C), CoA (1 mm), phosphoenol-pyruvate (3 mm), ATP (1 mm), MgCl2 (200 μm), NADH (260 μm), lactate dehydrogenase (10 units; Sigma), pyruvate kinase (10 units; Sigma), myokinase (10 units; Sigma), and PrpE (62.5 pmol). Reactions were started by addition of sodium propionate (20 μm). Absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 20 min using a PerkinElmer Lambda 40 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Specific activities were calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of NADH (6,220 m-1 cm-1) (34Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 122-123Google Scholar); two moles of NADH were oxidized per mole of AMP produced. Specific activities are reported as μmol of AMP produced/min/mg of protein and are averaged from three independent determinations. The prpE gene was amplified from plasmid pPRP68 (35Horswill A.R.

Strains JE9221 and JE91125 were grown at 37 °C in 250 ml of no-carbon essential medium (36Berkowitz D. Hushon J.M. Whitfield Jr., H.J. Roth J. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with propionate (30 mm), glycerol (0.5 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm), l-methionine (0.5 mm), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml). l(+)-Arabinose (250 μm) was added at A600 ∼ 0.6 to induce expression of T7 polymerase from plasmid pTARA and subsequent PrpE production. PrpE was purified by chitin affinity chromatography and resolved by SDS-PAGE. MALDI-TOF peptide fingerprinting was used to identify the modification. In-gel digest and MALDI-TOF analysis of PrpE proteins were performed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. PrpE proteins were excised, destained, and dehydrated and then reduced with dithiothreitol (25 mm) for 30 min at 56 °C, alkylated with iodoacetamide (55 mm) in darkness at room temperature for 30 min, and digested with 0.4 μg of trypsin (Promega Sequence Grade Modified) overnight at 37 °C. All steps were performed in (NH4)HCO3 (25 mm, pH 8). Resulting peptides were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) followed by acetonitrile/H2O/TFA (70%:25%:5%, v/v). Peptides were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo), resuspended in 20 μl of TFA (0.1%, v/v), and solid phase extracted using ZipTip® μC18 pipette tips (Millipore). Peptides were eluted off the C18 column with acetonitrile/H2O/TFA (70%:25%:0.2%, v/v) onto an AnchorChip™ plate (Bruker Daltonics) and recrystallized with 1 μl of matrix (20 mg/ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/H2O/TFA (70%:25%:0.2%, v/v)). Peptide fingerprint analysis was performed on a Bruker BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Peptide mapping analysis was performed with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science). MS/MS analysis was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in positive ion mode. Fragment ions were assigned using the Protein Prospector MS-Product utility (University of California, San Francisco Mass Spectrometry Facility). In situ O-propionyl-ADP-ribose (OPADPR) generation reactions contained (per 125 μl): Acs peptide (62.5 μm), AcuA (62.5 μm), CobB (6.25 μm), PncA (3.13 μm), Pr-CoA (1 mm), NAD+ (1 mm), HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 25 °C), and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (200 μm). CobB protein was omitted from the control reaction. Reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C, stopped by the addition of TFA to 1% (v/v), and filtered through 0.45-μm Spin-X® Centrifuge Tube Filters (Corning Inc.) prior to HPLC analysis. Reaction components were separated using a Beckman Coulter System Gold HPLC system equipped with an Alltima HP C18 AQ column (4.6 × 150-mm, 5-μm pore size; Alltech). The protocol used was based on those described for the purification of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (37Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The system was run at 25 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored at 260 and 214 nm. Following injection of a 50-μl sample, the column was developed isocratically in solvent A (0.05% TFA/H2O) for 6 min. The gradient was increased linearly to 40% solvent B (0.02% TFA/acetonitrile) over 40 min. Fractions of interest were collected and frozen at -80 °C prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Enhanced mass spectrometry of fractions of interest was performed using an ABI 3200 Q Trap linear ion trap quadrupole liquid chromatography/MS/MS mass spectrometer (AB Sciex Instruments). Sample was directly infused with an infusion syringe containing 50:50 acetonitrile:H2O and was ionized by electrospray ionization with negative polarity. Previously published work (9Starai V.J. Takahashi H. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the Pat acetyltransferase and CobB deacetylase modulated the activity of PrpE in vivo. When tested in vitro, the S. enterica Pat enzyme acetylated or propionylated PrpE, whereas the CobB sirtuin deacetylated PrpEAc or depropionylated PrpEPr (Fig. 1A, lane 2, rows II and IV). Because both PrpE and Acs contain a P-X4-GK motif in which the lysine residue is critical for function (5Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 11Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this lysine could be the modified residue, by analogy with Acs (5Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Failure of Pat to acetylate a PrpEK592E mutant (Fig. 1A, lane 1, rows II and IV) was consistent with the hypothesis that Lys-592 was indeed the modification site of PrpE. This result was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry peptide fingerprinting studies. The mass spectrum of PrpE incubated with Pat and propionyl-CoA, then cut with trypsin, included a signal at m/z = 747.4 atomic mass units, matching the mass of the S590GKPrMLR peptide (supplemental Fig. S7A). Similarly, mass spectrometry of PrpE incubated with Pat and acetyl-CoA gave a signal matching that of the S590GKAcMLR peptide (supplemental Fig. S7B; m/z = 733.5 atomic mass units). Peptides containing Lys-592 were not present in the mass spectrum of tryptic digest of PrpE after incubation with Pat and CoA (supplemental Fig. S7C). Cleavage after Lys-592 should result in the peptides S590GK (m/z = 291.1 atomic mass units) and M593LR (m/z = 419.2 atomic mass units), as long as Lys-592 was not modified. The above-mentioned peptides were not observed. Activity assays showed that propionylation of PrpE resulted in ∼70% loss of specific activity (1.5 + 0.3 μmol AMP min-1 mg-1) relative to that of unmodified PrpE enzyme (5 + 0.9 μmol AMP min-1 mg-1). To determine whether PrpE was posttranslationally modified in vivo, we isolated PrpE protein from strains grown on propionate. The strains used in these experiments were JE9221 (Δacs ΔcobB/pprpE+) and JE9225 (Δacs ΔcobB pat/pprpE+) (supplemental Table S1). Our strategy was to overproduce PrpE in the absence of the CobB sirtuin to allow Pat-dependent acylation and subsequent accumulation of PrpE in its acylated form. Both strains grew on propionate, albeit poorly, because the acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase system was functional (9Starai V.J. Takahashi H. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not expect PrpE to be modified in strain JE9225 (Δacs ΔcobB pat/pprpE+) because the pat gene was inactive in this strain; hence PrpE from strain JE9225 was used as a negative control. In agreement with this prediction, strain JE9225 grew much better on propionate (doubling time = 5.5 h) than did strain JE9221 (doubling time = 15.8 h), suggesting that Pat inactivated PrpE in strain JE9221 (supplemental Fig. S8). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of tryptic peptides of PrpE isolated from strain JE9221 (Δacs ΔcobB/pprpE+) contained a signal at m/z = 747.4 atomic mass units (Fig. 1B). The MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the m/z = 747.4 peptide matched that expected for S590GKPrMLR (supplemental Table S3) as well as that observed for a synthetic SGKPrMLR peptide (supplemental Fig. S9). The peptide fingerprint of PrpE protein isolated from strain JE9225 (Δacs ΔcobB pat/pprpE+) matched that of PrpE treated with CoA and did not contain any signals for modified peptides (Fig. 1C). Although a very small peak was seen at m/z = 747.4, MS/MS fragmentation analysis showed it to be an isotope of the m/z = 745.4 peptide (supplemental Fig. S10). These results demonstrated that Pat was responsible for the propionylation of PrpE in vivo. We investigated whether other acetyltransferase enzymes could propionylate PrpE. The Gcn-5-related N-acetyltransferase enzyme AcuA from B. subtilis (29Gardner J.G. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5460-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) displayed propionylation activity with the specific activity of AcuA (78.4 pmol PrpE propionylated min-1 μmol-1) 5.5 times higher than that of Pat (14.3 pmol PrpE propionylated min-1 μmol-1) (Fig. 2). Because deletion of the cobB gene encoding the S. enterica sirtuin inactivates PrpE in vivo, we asked whether the CobB sirtuin depropionylates substrates in vitro. As predicted, the S. enterica CobB sirtuin was able to remove the propionyl modification from PrpE (specific activity = 3.1 pmol PrpE depropionylated min-1 μmol-1 CobB) (Fig. 1A, lane 1, row IV, and Fig. 3B). We next asked whether other bacterial and eukaryotic sirtuins had depropionylase activity. The human SIRT2 (hSirT2) and SIRT3 (hSirT3) and the bacterial T. maritima Sir2 (Sir2Tm) proteins depropionylated PrpEPr within 1 h (Fig. 3, C-E). Depropionylase activity was not observed with human (hSirT1) or murine SIRT1 (mSirT1) or human SIRT4 (hSirT4) (Fig. 3A, lanes 3, 4, 7). However, mSirT1 displayed robust deacetylase activity (17.6 + 0.4 pmol PrpE deacetylated min-1 μmol-1 mSirT1), suggesting that the lack of depropionylase activity of mSirT1 arises from specific discrimination between acetyl and propionyl lysine rather than being due simply to absence of any enzymatic activity (data not shown). By analogy with the deacetylation reaction, we predicted that sirtuin-mediated depropionylation would produce OPADPR. OPADPR has been shown to be the product of the sirtuin-catalyzed reaction when synthetic propionylated peptides were used as substrates (39Smith B.C. Denu J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5802-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We developed a system for the in situ generation of OPADPR through iterative propionylation and depropionylation of protein substrate. Reaction mixtures contained AcuABs in lieu of Pat because of the former's higher propionylase activity and because its smaller size allowed us to use higher enzyme concentrations. A peptide consisting of the C-terminal 52 amino acids of AcsSe was used as protein substrate because it could be added at higher concentration than PrpE. Results of a control experiment verified that AcuABs propionylated the 52-amino acid peptide (supplemental Fig. S11). To prevent inhibition of the sirtuin activity by nicotinamide, all reaction mixtures contained PncA nicotinamidase (supplemental Fig. S12). Reaction mixtures were resolved by C18 reverse-phase HPLC. The large NAD+ peak (t = 29.5 min) observed in the chromatogram of control mixture lacking CobB sirtuin was absent in the chromatogram of the mixture containing CobB (Fig. 4A, dashed line). The compound eluting 36.5 min post-injection was OPADPR ((M-H)- ion; m/z = 614.1 atomic mass units) as determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4B). Reaction byproducts were identified using authentic standards (nicotinic acid, 5.8 min; ADP-ribose, 3.8 min). To catalyze lysine depropionylation in a manner analogous to the sirtuin deacetylation reaction, the enzyme must be able to accommodate the additional methyl group in the Michaelis complex formed with NAD+ and the propionylated peptide. We therefore modeled the complex based on the structure of NAD+ and an acetylated peptide bound to Sir2Tm (40Hoff K.G. Avalos J.L. Sens K. Wolberger C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), a bacterial sirtuin that exhibits depropionylation activity (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 5, the structure can readily accommodate the additional methyl of propionyl-lysine in a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme active site. A model constructed with no adjustments produced minimal clashes (van der Waals distances of 3.2 Å or greater) that were completely eliminated during energy minimization by minor side-chain rearrangements, with individual atomic shifts of less than 0.2 Å, in the vicinity of the propionyl-lysine.FIGURE 5Model of propionyl-lysine and NAD+ bound in the Sir2Tm active site. A model of propionyl-lysine in the active site of a sirtuin was modeled based on the structure of the ternary complex formed by the bacterial sirtuin Sir2Tm with NAD+ and an acetylated peptide (Protein Data Bank code 2H4F) (40Hoff K.G. Avalos J.L. Sens K. Wolberger C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The acetyl group was replaced with the propionyl group and the structure modeled using the molecular graphics program Quanta (2006 edition). Initial fits were achieved with minimal clashing, but an improved model was obtained from a minimization calculation performed in Quanta using the CHARMM force field. Only minor rearrangements of side chains within the Sir2Tm active site were needed to accommodate the additional methyl in the propionyl group. The propionylated peptide fit into a small hydrophobic pocket comprised of the Leu-100, Leu-159, and Phe-148 side chains and backbone atoms of Val-160 and His-116.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, the data presented here support the conclusion that N-Lys propionylation is a physiologically relevant posttranslational modification for the control of protein function. Because propionylase activity was detectable in two bacterial Gcn-5-related N-acetyltransferase enzymes (S. enterica Pat, B. subtilis AcuA), we suggest that members of this family of enzymes in higher organisms may also have propionylase activity. Similarly, robust depropionylase activity is found among sirtuins from bacteria and higher organisms (Fig. 3), suggesting that other members of this enzyme family may also catalyze this activity. However, because this activity was not detected in human or murine SIRT1 or human SIRT4 enzymes, the ability to accommodate the larger propionyl modification in the enzyme active site appears to be enzyme-specific. Consistent with the current understanding of the CobB sirtuin-catalyzed deacetylase reaction, the product of the depropionylase activity of CobB was OPADPR (Fig. 4). It is unclear whether OPADPR plays any physiological role as has been suggested for the related molecule O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (41Liou G.G. Tanny J.C. Kruger R.G. Walz T. Moazed D.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14057-14065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). From a physiological standpoint, propionylation is a logical means of posttranslational regulation because it allows the cell to rapidly modulate activity of propionyl-CoA synthetase in direct response to potentially deleterious levels of its product, propionyl-CoA. In contrast, control of propionyl-CoA synthetase activity by acetylation would require conversion of propionyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA via rate-limiting steps of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle (supplemental Fig. S6) (16Horswill A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4703-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This strategy would make inactivation of propionyl-CoA synthetase too slow to prevent any imbalance in CoA homeostasis or to prevent other toxic effects caused by high levels of propionyl-CoA (13Horswill A.R. Dudding A.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19094-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cell therefore senses propionyl-CoA imbalance directly using the same enzyme pair used to control acetyl-CoA homeostasis. From a broader physiological perspective, all cells must control their pools of acyl-CoAs to avoid depletion of the pool of free CoA and/or synthesis of toxic metabolites (13Horswill A.R.

Nutr. 1990; 120: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggests, by analogy with the work reported here and with earlier findings regarding acetyl CoA homeostasis (8Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), that there might well be other acyltransferase/deacylase systems that cells from all domains of life use to control the activity of acyl-CoA synthetases. For example, a succinyl-CoA:protein succinyltransferase enzyme might use succinyl-CoA to inactivate the succinate:CoA ligase, while a cognate desuccinylase would reactivate succinyl-CoA ligase. Whether these modifications indeed exist in the cell and, like acetylation, are used to regulate other processes is an intriguing possibility under active investigation. We thank J.

https://openalex.org/W2035965301,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a large, multidomain protein kinase, which plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth and has recently emerged as an essential target of survival signals in many types of human cancer cells. Here, we report the solution structures of complexes formed between the FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of mTOR and phosphatidic acid, an important cellular activator of the kinase, and between the FRB domain and a novel inhibitor (HTS-1). The overall structure of the FRB domain is very similar to that seen in the ternary complex formed with FKBP12 and the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin; however, there are significant changes within the rapamycin-binding site with important consequences for rational drug design. The surface of the FRB domain contains a number of distinctive features that have previously escaped attention, including a potential new regulatory site on the opposite face to that involved in the binding of rapamycin, which displays the features expected for a specific binding site for a small molecule. The interaction sites for phosphatidic acid and HTS-1 were found to closely match the site responsible for rapamycin binding. In addition, the structures determined for the FRB-phosphatidic acid and FRB-HTS-1 complexes revealed a striking similarity between the conformations of buried portions of the ligands and that seen for the rapamycin backbone in contact with the domain. Our findings further highlight the importance of the FRB domain in small molecule-mediated regulation of mTOR, demonstrate the ability to identify novel inhibitors of mTOR that bind tightly to the rapamycin-binding site in the absence of FKBP12, and identify a potential new regulatory site that may be exploited in the design of new anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2093725075,"Homeostatic plasticity is thought to be important in preventing neuronal circuits from becoming hyper- or hypoactive. However, there is little information concerning homeostatic mechanisms following in vivo manipulations of activity levels. We investigated synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cells following 2 days of activity-blockade in vivo in adult (postnatal day 30; P30) and juvenile (P15) rats. Chronic activity-blockade in vivo was achieved using the sustained release of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) from the plastic polymer Elvax 40W implanted directly above the hippocampus, followed by electrophysiological assessment in slices in vitro. Three sets of results were in general agreement with previous studies on homeostatic responses to in vitro manipulations of activity. First, Schaffer collateral stimulation-evoked field responses were enhanced after 2 days of in vivo TTX application. Second, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitudes were potentiated. However, the increase in mEPSC amplitudes occurred only in juveniles, and not in adults, indicating age-dependent effects. Third, intrinsic neuronal excitability increased. In contrast, three sets of results sharply differed from previous reports on homeostatic responses to in vitro manipulations of activity. First, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) amplitudes were invariably enhanced. Second, multiplicative scaling of mEPSC and mIPSC amplitudes was absent. Third, the frequencies of adult and juvenile mEPSCs and adult mIPSCs were increased, indicating presynaptic alterations. These results provide new insights into in vivo homeostatic plasticity mechanisms with relevance to memory storage, activity-dependent development and neurological diseases."

Autoactivation is the consequence of ligand-enforced dimerization of RTKs that results from induced conformational changes in the active site and leads to autophosphorylation, which further enhances catalytic activity and introduces sites for different adapter proteins to engage and activate downstream signaling pathways.

Lett. 2006; 399: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), since the sites that normally are dephosphorylated by RPTPβ/ζ continue to be phosphorylated by constitutive tyrosine kinases when RPTPβ/ζ is inactivated in PTN-stimulated cells. The proposal that ALK is the physiological receptor for PTN also was surprising, since, in Drosophila, Jelly Belly (Jeb) was identified as a ligand of ALK (20Englund C. Loren C.E. Grabbe C. Varshney G.K. Deleuil F. Hallberg B. Palmer R.H. Nature. 2003; 425: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Lee H.H. Norris A. Weiss J.B. Frasch M. Nature. 2003; 425: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Jeb has no apparent sequence or structural relationship with PTN, and the human genome data bases do not contain a human homolog of Jeb. Furthermore, neither Miple1, the Drosophila homolog of Ptn, nor Miple2, the Drosophila homolog of midkine (Mk), which also signals through RPTPβ/ζ (22Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), were found to be spatially localized with DAlk or temporally co-expressed with DAlk during Drosophila development. Furthermore, in yet another study, Moog-Lutz et al. (23Moog-Lutz C. Degoutin J. Gouzi J.Y. Frobert Y. Brunet-de Carvalho N. Bureau J. Creminon C. Vigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26039-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) developed two anti-ALK monoclonal antibodies, each of which effectively activated ALK. However, under the same conditions, PTN failed to activate ALK; thus, in this study also, the data did not support the possibility that ALK is a physiological receptor of PTN. The conflicting views of ALK as the physiological receptor of PTN have now led us to test the possibility that ALK is activated by PTN through an alternative mechanism. In the present studies, the data demonstrate that PTN stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK through the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway. It stimulates phosphorylation of ALK at the same site that is autophosphorylated when ALK is autoactivated in vitro; this site is also recognized by RPTPβ/ζ and dephosphorylated by RPTPβ/ζ. The data suggest that the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway functions to activate ALK through an “alternative mechanism of RTK activation” that is independent of a direct interaction of PTN with RPTPβ/ζ. Cell Lines—HeLa, U87MG, U373, and MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Collection Center (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. HeLa cells express RPTPβ/ζ and low levels of ALK, U87MG cells express RPTPβ/ζ and ALK, U373 cells express RPTPβ/ζ but not ALK, and MCF-7 cells express neither ALK nor RPTPβ/ζ. Reagents—Rabbit anti-ALK antibodies (catalog number 51-3900) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (currently Invitrogen), mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (catalog number 05-321) were obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), mouse anti-RPTPβ/ζ antibodies (catalog number R20720) were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), PTN was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from San Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmids, Transfections—The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RPTPβ/ζ chimeric protein was constructed by fusing the sequences to encode the extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR (amino acids 1-671) with the cytoplasmic domain of RPTPβ/ζ (amino acids 1662-2315), which then were inserted into the vector pcDNA3.1. Human full-length ALK cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_004304), human full-length RPTPβ/ζ cDNA (Gen-Bank™ accession number NM_002851), and a truncated ALK cDNA to encode the eight membrane-proximal extracellular amino acids and the intact transmembrane and intracellular domains of ALK (amino acids 1027-1620) with the IgGκ signal peptide sequences were inserted in the pcDNA3.1 vector. Transfections were performed using the Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The vectors containing shRNA targeting RPTPβ/ζ and a control empty vector were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) (catalog numbers RHS1764-9687266 (shRNA RPTPβ/ζ-1) and RHS1764-9218363 (shRNA RPTPβ/ζ-2)) and delivered into cells using Arrest-In transfection reagent following the manufacturer's recommendations. Ninety-six hours after transfection, the levels of expression of RPTPβ/ζ were analyzed using Western blots and real time reverse transcription-PCR as described before (24Perez-Pinera P. Alcantara S.

The vector pC4-Fv1E to enforce dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ through AP20187 was a kind gift from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The cDNA sequence encoding the intracellular domain of RPTPβ/ζ was inserted in frame with the Fv fragment of FKBP12. RPTPβ/ζ D1, D1 (C1932S), D1 (D1900A) GST “Capture”—Proteins recognized by the active site (D1) domain of RPTPβ/ζ (residues 1663-2034) in lysates of HeLa cells transfected with full-length ALK were captured by GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1, GST-RPTPβ/ζ inactivated D1 (C1932S), and GST-RPTPβ/ζ “substrate trap” D1 (D1900A) as described previously (18Pariser H. Perez-Pinera P. Ezquerra L. Herradon G. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-ALK antibodies and anti-GST antibodies. Dephosphorylation by RPTPβ/ζ of ALK Phosphorylated in Tyrosine—MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells, which express very limited levels of EGFR into which EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ was introduced were stimulated with 150 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems) for 1 min or with sodium pervanadate (20 μg/ml) for 20 min. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ALK antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 or GST-RPTPβ/ζ (C1932S) and analyzed by scanning densitometry of Western blots probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as described before (18Pariser H. Perez-Pinera P. Ezquerra L. Herradon G. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—ALK (catalog number 14-555; Millipore, Billerica, MA) was incubated with 200 μm ATP in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with boiling loading buffer, and the samples were analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As negative control, samples without ATP were analyzed. Pleiotrophin Requires RPTPβ/ζ to Stimulate Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ALK—As cited above, pleiotrophin signals through enforced dimerization and inactivation of the cytoplasmic domain of RPTPβ/ζ (14Meng K. Rodriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 25Fukada M. Fujikawa A. Chow J.P. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4051-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), leading to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of each of its substrates. To first determine if ALK is phosphorylated in PTN-stimulated cells through the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway, MCF-7 cells that do not express ALK or RPTPβ/ζ were transfected with cDNAs to encode full-length ALK and RPTPβ/ζ. The cells were stimulated with PTN for 5, 30, and 60 min. Lysates from stimulated and nonstimulated (control) cells were then prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ALK antibodies. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in the immunoprecipitates were measured by scanning densitometry of Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. It was found that base-line levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in non-stimulated cells were low, as previously shown (26Lamant L. Pulford K. Bischof D. Morris S.W. Mason D.Y. Delsol G. Mariame B. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1711-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Dirks W.G. Fahnrich S. Lis Y. Becker E. MacLeod R.A. Drexler H.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Motegi A. Fujimoto J. Kotani M. Sakuraba H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK was minimally increased at 5 min and increased ∼2.5-fold at 30 min and ∼5.2-fold at 60 min after stimulation with PTN. MCF-7 cells were then transfected with ALK alone but not with RPTPβ/ζ. The cells were then stimulated with PTN and analyzed as above; it was found that PTN failed to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in MCF-7 cells that do not express RPTPβ/ζ (Fig. 1, compare A and B). The data demonstrate that PTN effectively stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in MCF-7 cells but only when MCF-7 cells express RPTPβ/ζ; it is concluded that RPTPβ/ζ is required for PTN to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in PTN-stimulated cells. The data also support the important conclusion that the level of catalytic activity of RPTPβ/ζ regulates the steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK when RPTPβ/ζ is not inactivated in PTN-stimulated cells. MCF-7 cells that express both ALK and RPTPβ/ζ were then stimulated with the general inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases sodium pervanadate for 20 min. Stimulation of the MCF-7 cells expressing both ALK and RPTPβ/ζ with sodium pervanadate increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK by ∼7-fold (Fig. 1A). MCF-7 cells that do not express RPTPβ/ζ were then stimulated with sodium pervanadate; incubation of these cells with sodium pervanadate also sharply increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK (Fig. 1, compare A and B). These data thus support the conclusion that tyrosine phosphatases other than RPTPβ/ζ also regulate the steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK when their catalytic activities are not inhibited by sodium pervanadate, presumably at tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are different from the site(s) regulated through the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway. shRNAs to “Knock Down” RPTPβ/ζ Prevent PTN-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ALK—The requirement of RPTPβ/ζ for PTN to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in PTN-stimulated cells was investigated further. Two shRNAs to knock down RPTPβ/ζ were expressed in U87MG cells. U87MG cells express both endogenous RPTPβ/ζ and endogenous ALK (29Lu K.V. Jong K.A. Kim G.Y. Singh J. Dia E.Q. Yoshimoto K. Wang M.Y. Cloughesy T.F. Nelson S.F. Mischel P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26953-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both the two shRNAs were first shown to effectively knock down expression of RPTPβ/ζ; it was found in these control experiments that the levels of RPTPβ/ζ mRNA were reduced ∼66% in cells expressing shRNA RPTPβ/ζ-1 and ∼73% in cells expressing shRNA RPTPβ/ζ-2, as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Pleiotrophin failed to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in the U87MG cells that expressed either of the two shRNAs to nearly the levels of increase in cells that expressed the control shRNA. However, PTN sharply increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in U87MG cells into which a “scrambled” shRNA (control) was expressed (Fig. 1C). These data thus demonstrate that knockdown of RPTPβ/ζ prevents PTN-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in PTN-stimulated U87MG cells; the data indicate that endogenous RPTPβ/ζ is required for PTN to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in U87MG cells that express both endogenous ALK and RPTPβ/ζ. Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Stimulates Increased Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ALK in MCF-7 Cells through the EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ Chimeric Receptor—To further pursue the requirement of enforced dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain of RPTPβ/ζ for PTN to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK, a chimeric EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ receptor was stably expressed in MCF-7 cells (MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells). ALK was introduced into MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells, and, 48 h later, the cells were stimulated with EGF. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in EGF-stimulated cells were measured as described above. EGF was found to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK ∼2.2-fold after MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells were stimulated with EGF for 1 and 5 min (Fig. 2A). The data thus provide additional support for the possibility that it is enforced dimerization of the intracellular domain of RPTPβ/ζ that has been induced by EGF through the EGFR extracellular domain that stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK. As anticipated, an ∼4-fold increase in levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK was found when MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells were stimulated with sodium pervanadate (Fig. 2A), again supporting the possibility that multiple tyrosine phosphatases regulate levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK, presumably at sites that are different from the site(s) regulated through the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway. To exclude the possibility that EGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK through the endogenous EGFR, MCF-7 cells that do not express EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ were transfected with ALK, stimulated with EGF, and analyzed as above. EGF did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK (Fig. 2A). Chemically Enforced Dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ALK—To directly demonstrate that enforced dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ alone is sufficient to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK, MCF-7 cells were transfected with a vector pC4-Fv1E that contains the cDNA sequence to encode the Fv domain of FKBP12 in frame with the intracellular domain of RPTPβ/ζ (see “Experimental Procedures”). The FV domain of FKBP12 is needed to enforce dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ that is induced chemically by AP20187 (25Fukada M. Fujikawa A. Chow J.P. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4051-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The MCF-7 cells were then transfected with a cDNA to encode full-length ALK, and, 48 h later, the cells were stimulated with AP20187 (2 μm) for 30 and 60 min. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK were then analyzed in Western blots of cell lysates probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Enforced dimerization induced by AP20187 was found to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK ∼12- and ∼25-fold when analyzed 30 and 60 min after the cells were stimulated with AP20187 (Fig. 2B). In the control cells that expressed ALK but contained an “empty” pC4-Fv1E vector, stimulation of the cells with AP20187 failed to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK. These data thus directly demonstrate that enforced dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ alone in MCF-7 cells that express pC4-Fv1E in frame with the intracellular domain of RPTPβ/ζ and ALK is sufficient to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK. The data further support the possibility that the activity levels of RPTPβ/ζ in cells in which RPTPβ/ζ has not been inactivated by PTN regulate the steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK. The very high level of increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in cells stimulated with AP20187 suggests that AP20187 is more effective in inducing dimerization of RPTPβ/ζ expressed with the Fv domain of FKBP12 than is found in PTN-stimulated cells. It was found that the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in nonstimulated cells that express pC4-Fv1E alone were very high. As will be demonstrated subsequently, ALK is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ. Thus, it is predicted that the “empty” vector that lacks RPTPβ/ζ cannot effectively reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK through the activity of RPTPβ/ζ.Itis noticed also that the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in nonstimulated cells that express pC4-Fv1E-RPTPβ/ζ are very low, suggesting the possibility that RPTPβ/ζ with the Fv domain of FKBP12 may function as a more effective tyrosine phosphatase than RPTPβ/ζ “tethered” through its transmembrane and extracellular domains. ALK That Lacks an Extracellular Domain (Truncated ALK) Is Phosphorylated in PTN-stimulated Cells; PTN Requires RPTPβ/ζ but Not the Extracellular Domain of ALK to Stimulate Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ALK—To exclude the possibility that PTN interacts directly with ALK alone or with ALK and RPTPβ/ζ to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids to encode RPTPβ/ζ and “truncated ALK” that lacks the extracellular domain; truncated ALK contains only the first 8 amino acids of the extracellular domain but retains the intact transmembrane and intracellular domains (amino acids 1027-1620). Thus, in cells expressing truncated ALK but not endogenous ALK, PTN cannot directly interact with ALK to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK. MCF-7 cells transfected together with RPTPβ/ζ and truncated ALK were therefore stimulated with PTN, and the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK were measured as above. PTN was shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of truncated ALK ∼5-, ∼13-, and ∼26-fold after stimulation for 5, 30, and 60 min (Fig. 3A). The data thus demonstrate directly that PTN stimulates an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK independently of an interaction of PTN with the extracellular domain of ALK. The data furthermore demonstrate that PTN requires RPTPβ/ζ for PTN to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK without an extracellular domain. As anticipated, PTN failed to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the truncated ALK in MCF-7 cells that expressed truncated ALK but not RPTPβ/ζ. It was found that the base-line levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in nonstimulated cells were low. Again, as shown subsequently, ALK is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ; the low base-line level of ALK phosphorylation suggests the possibility that the extracellular domain of ALK may restrict the availability of ALK as a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ in some manner, which is not the case in truncated ALK that lacks the extracellular domain. The remarkably high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of truncated ALK in PTN-stimulated MCF-7 cells transfected with both RPTPβ/ζ and truncated ALK suggest the possibility that the levels of ALK phosphorylation are negatively regulated by the extracellular domain of ALK; ALK phosphorylation may be facilitated when ALK dimerization is not encumbered by the extracellular domain of ALK. As also anticipated, sodium pervanadate stimulates increased tyrosine phosphorylation of truncated ALK to levels in excess of tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by PTN (Fig. 3B). ALK Co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ—To address the mechanism through which enforced inactivation of RPTPβ/ζ increases tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in PTN-stimulated cells, the possibility suggested above that ALK is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ was pursued. To first determine if RPTPβ/ζ and ALK associate together, lysates of MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells that transiently express ALK were immunoprecipitated with anti-ALK antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-RPTPβ/ζ antibodies as above. It was found that EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ and ALK co-immunoprecipitate together (Fig. 4A). However, an ∼60% loss of the EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ that co-immunoprecipitated with ALK from lysates of unstimulated cells was found in lysates from MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells that were stimulated with EGF for 1 min. An ∼75% loss of association was found at 2 min in lysates of stimulated cells. Thus, inactivation of RPTPβ/ζ by enforced dimerization induced by EGF in MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells sharply reduced the levels of association of ALK and EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ. The data suggest the possibility that ALK associates with RPTPβ/ζ through an interaction of ALK with the active site of RPTPβ/ζ in cells that have not been stimulated with EGF. When the active site of RPTPβ/ζ is no longer accessible to ALK because of enforced dimerization, access of ALK to the active site of RPTPβ/ζ is denied. The data thus are consistent with the possibility that ALK is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ. To further pursue the question of whether ALK associates with RPTPβ/ζ in vivo, U373 cells that express high levels of endogenous RPTPβ/ζ (14Meng K. Rodriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) were then transfected with a cDNA to encode ALK and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged anti-ALK antibodies (green), Texas Red-tagged anti-RPTPβ/ζ antibodies (red), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). Using confocal microscopy, ALK and RPTPβ/ζ were seen to co-localize (Fig. 4B), thus supporting the likelihood that ALK and RPTPβ/ζ associate together in vivo. ALK Is a Substrate of RPTPβ/ζ—To more directly test whether ALK is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ, HeLa cells, which express RPTPβ/ζ, were transfected with a cDNA to encode ALK and stimulated with PTN. Lysates were then prepared from the PTN-stimulated cells and incubated with the GST-D1 domain of RPTPβ/ζ or with the GST-tagged RPTPβ/ζ D1 domain mutants, GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (C1932S), or GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (D1900A). Proteins that associated with GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1, GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (C1932S), and GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (D1900A) were then captured with glutathione-Sepharose, eluted, and analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-ALK antibodies (18Pariser H. Perez-Pinera P. Ezquerra L. Herradon G. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The D1 domain contains the active tyrosine phosphatase site of RPTPβ/ζ and itself is an active tyrosine phosphatase. RPTPβ/ζ D1 (C1932S) is an inactivated active site D1 domain with the catalytic cysteine mutated to serine. RPTPβ/ζ D1 (D1900A) is the “substrate trap” D1 mutant; the substrate trap mutant “captures” substrates of RPTPβ/ζ with very high affinity and specificity (30Dewang P.M. Hsu N.M. Peng S.Z. Li W.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was found that the GST-tagged RPTPβ/ζ D1 and each of the GST-tagged RPTPβ/ζ D1 domain mutants captured ALK (Fig. 5A); the capture of ALK by the D1 (D1900A) substrate trap mutant establishes with near certainty that ALK is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ. To demonstrate directly that ALK is dephosphorylated by RPTPβ/ζ and thus a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ, ALK was then immunoprecipitated from lysates of EGF-stimulated MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended and incubated with the active site D1 domain of RPTPβ/ζ or with the inactive RPTPβ/ζ D1 (C1932S) mutant. After 2 h at 37 °C, the proteins were then analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and scanning densitometry. It was found that levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK were reduced by ∼43% in lysates derived from EGF-stimulated MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells incubated with the active GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 domain (Fig. 5B, second lane) when compared with levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK that had been incubated with the inactive GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (C1932S) mutant (Fig. 5B, first lane). The data thus strongly support the possibility that RPTPβ/ζ dephosphorylates ALK at the site in ALK phosphorylated when RPTPβ/ζ was inactivated in EGF-stimulated MCF-7-EGFR/RPTPβ/ζ cells. Importantly also, and as anticipated, tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK in sodium pervanadate-stimulated cells was reduced by only ∼16% by incubation with GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (Fig. 5B, fourth lane) compared with incubation with the inactive RPTPβ/ζ mutant (Fig. 5B, third lane), consistent with data cited above indicating that multiple tyrosine phosphatases dephosphorylate ALK in sites that are not recognized by RPTPβ/ζ. ALK Is Autoactivated and Autophosphorylated in Tyrosine in Vitro—ALK autophosphorylated and autoactivated is dephosphorylated by RPTPβ/ζ. To pursue the mechanism through which ALK is phosphorylated in PTN-stimulated cells, ALK was incubated in an in vitro kinase assay. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK were measured in Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 6A); tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK was readily apparent 1 min after initiation of the in vitro kinase reaction and increased in levels for up to 20 min. ALK was then immunoprecipitated with anti-ALK antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with either GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 or with GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 (C1932S) and analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as described above (Fig. 6B). It was found that ALK autophosphorylated in tyrosine in vitro was dephosphorylated by GST-RPTPβ/ζ D1 and thus likely to be the same site in ALK phosphorylated in tyrosine in PTN-stimulated cells that also is dephosphorylated by RPTPβ/ζ. The data thus support the important conclusion that ALK is phosphorylated at the same site in PTN-stimulated cells that is phosphorylated when ALK is autoactivated in vitro. In both cases, this site(s) is a substrate of RPTPβ/ζ. RTKs are activated through engagement of ligands (7Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 8Schlessinger J. Harvey Lect. 1993; 89: 105-123PubMed Google Scholar) that enforce dimerization and lead to autoactivation and autophosphorylation of the cognate receptors. In the present study, it is demonstrated that PTN stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ALK through a mechanism that is independent of ligand-enforced dimerization of ALK; it is suggested that ALK is activated through a unique alternative mechanism of RTK activation. The data indicate that a mechanism of activation of ALK is autoactivation and autophosphorylation of ALK that continues to advance when the autophosphorylation sites in ALK no longer are dephosphorylated by RPTPβ/ζ that has been inactivated in PTN-stimulated cells; the steady state activity of ALK is regulated through the levels of activity of RPTPβ/ζ that dephosphorylates the critical tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) phosphorylated during ALK activation. Activation thus is not the result of a direct interaction of PTN with ALK. The model does not preclude the possibility that unidentified tyrosine kinases also may phosphorylate the site in ALK that is autophosphorylated through autoactivation of ALK. The model thus underscores that the steady-state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK are regulated through the activity of the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway. The “alternative mechanism of RTK activation” of ALK raises the important possibility that through the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway, PTN may regulate multiple RTKs and thus effectively regulate different important cellular functions; it potentially also effectively expands the range of different systems regulated through this pathway. In studies of Mourali et al. (6Mourali J. Benard A. Lourenco F.C. Monnet C. Greenland C. Moog-Lutz C. Racaud-Sultan C. Gonzalez-Dunia D. Vigny M. Mehlen P. Delsol G. Allouche M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6209-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), ALK was shown to have proapoptotic activity that is relieved when engaged by agonists that activate its catalytic activity. Our experiments thus implicate PTN as a potential regulator of the low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK that are critical to cell survival. Since many transformed cells are known to constitutively express Ptn, PTN may be antiapoptotic through maintaining levels of activation of ALK sufficient to support survival of malignant cells. This study identifies ALK as a new and important kinase downstream of the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway whose levels of tyrosine phosphorylation are regulated by PTN. Additional targets of the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway thus far identified include β-catenin (14Meng K. Rodriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lett. 2006; 399: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In each case, PTN stimulates a sharp increase in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrates of RPTPβ/ζ in PTN-stimulated cells. Furthermore, in each case studied (Fyn, β-catenin, β-adducin), RPTPβ/ζ dephosphorylates each of the substrates of RPTPβ/ζ whose levels of tyrosine phosphorylation have been increased in PTN-stimulated cells. Through this pathway, PTN thus coordinately regulates steady state levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of critical proteins important in diverse systems, such as cytoskeletal stability and function and intracellular and transmembrane tyrosine kinase activities. It is suggested that this pathway profoundly influences cellular functions at different levels and coordinately influences different cellular systems to alter the cellular phenotype. The view is supported in studies that demonstrate that PTN stimulates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, in which loss of cell-cell adhesion, profound cytoskeleton alternations, and a morphological transition to a more motile and invasive phenotype are induced through the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway (24Perez-Pinera P.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition is a critical event in early development and a critical component of progression of malignant cells to a more aggressive phenotype (31Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar, 32Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Lu et al. (29Lu K.V.

The studies that we report use the 136-amino acid 18-kDa PTN initially reported (12Li Y.S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F.

Pleiotrophin 15 (residues 1-124) lacks the 12 C-terminal amino acids (KKEGKKQEKMLD) of PTN18, and, thus, it lacks the 5 lysine residues that establish the strong net positive charge of the C-terminal domain of PTN. In their studies, immobilized PTN18 was shown to stimulate migration of glioblastoma cells in an RPTPβ/ζ-dependent manner, whereas immobilized PTN15 promoted proliferation of glioblastoma cells in an ALK-dependent fashion. The data of Lu et al. (29Lu K.V. Jong K.A. Kim G.Y. Singh J. Dia E.Q. Yoshimoto K. Wang M.Y. Cloughesy T.F. Nelson S.F. Mischel P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26953-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that PTN18 and PTN15 signal through different receptors. However, the PTN15-stimulated proliferation response that was reported to occur through ALK was determined by demonstrating phosphorylation of Akt; thus, it is possible that ALK is activated either through an interaction directly with PTN15 or, alternatively, through a different signaling pathway; thus, these data do not distinguish the mechanism of activation of ALK and are not inconsistent with our data. However, the studies of Lu et al. (29Lu K.V. Jong K.A. Kim G.Y. Singh J. Dia E.Q. Yoshimoto K. Wang M.Y. Cloughesy T.F. Nelson S.F. Mischel P.S. J. Biol.

These data thus clearly demonstrate that ALK is activated through an alternative mechanism of RTK activation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a cytokine-dependent inactivation of a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase is the mechanism to activate a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase.

Although recent studies have successfully identified CD-associated genetic variants, these susceptibility loci explain only a fraction of the heritability of the disease. Here, we report on a multi-stage genome-wide scan of 393 German CD cases and 399 controls. Among the 116,161 single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested, an association with the known CD susceptibility gene NOD2, the 5q31 haplotype, and the recently reported CD locus at 5p13.1 was confirmed. In addition, SNP rs1793004 in the gene encoding nel-like 1 precursor (NELL1, chromosome 11p15.1) showed a consistent disease-association in independent German population- and family-based samples (942 cases, 1082 controls, 375 trios). Subsequent fine mapping and replication in an independent sample of 454 French/Canadian CD trios supported the authenticity of the NELL1 association. Further confirmation in a large German ulcerative colitis (UC) sample indicated that NELL1 is a ubiquitous IBD susceptibility locus (combined p<10−6; OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.30–2.11). The novel 5p13.1 locus was also replicated in the French/Canadian sample and in an independent UK CD patient panel (453 cases, 521 controls, combined p<10−6 for SNP rs1992660). Several associations were replicated in at least one independent sample, point to an involvement of ITGB6 (upstream), GRM8 (downstream), OR5V1 (downstream), PPP3R2 (downstream), NM_152575 (upstream) and HNF4G (intron)."
https://openalex.org/W2102151538,"We report that EF24, a synthetic compound 3,5-bis(2-flurobenzylidene)piperidin-4-one, greatly inhibits cisplatin-resistant (CR) human ovarian cancer cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of EF24 on cell proliferation is associated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and increased G2/M checkpoint protein (pp53, p53, and p21) levels. Within 24 h following treatment, EF24 induced apoptosis in CR cells. The apoptosis was partially blocked by the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD. Within 12 h, EF24 induced a membranous FasL expression, consistent with a substantial decrease in the Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt, a known negative regulator of FasL transcription. Also, EF24 activated the phosphorylated PTEN and marginally up-regulated total PTEN expression through the inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated PTEN degradation. Suppression of PTEN expression with siRNA significantly reduced the p53 and p21 levels and activated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308, resulting in decreased apoptosis and increased cell survival. On the other hand, overexpression of PTEN markedly induced apoptosis. Our results clearly suggested that EF24 induced significant increase in PTEN expression. The up-regulation of PTEN inhibited Akt and MDM2, which enhanced the level of p53, thereby inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, EF24 appears to have a potential therapeutic role in human ovarian cancer through the activation of PTEN.

Fraser M. Moll U.M. Basak A. Tsang B.K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Patients suffering from advanced ovarian carcinoma are, in most cases, initially responsive to chemotherapy; however, they later experience a relapse of the disease because of the eventual recurrence of the tumor and emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells. Cisplatin is an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent against various human cancers, including ovarian cancer (2Markman M. Howell S.B. Lucas W.E. Pfeifle C.E. Green M.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 1984; 2: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite its great efficacy at treating ovarian cancer, a major limitation of cisplatin treatment is the development of drug resistance. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the cisplatin resistance, including reduced intracellular accumulation of the drug, increased levels of glutathione, up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (3Johnson S.W. Ozols R.F. Hamilton T.C. Cancer. 1993; 71: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Bratasz A. Weir N.M. Parinandi N.L. Zweier J.L. Sridhar R. Ignarro L.J. Kuppusamy P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cisplatin resistance is also associated with the altered activation of signaling pathways which include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 2The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethylketoneMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideCRcisplatin-resistantPARPpolyadenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase. 2The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethylketoneMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideCRcisplatin-resistantPARPpolyadenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase./Akt and MAPK, or the suppression of tumor suppressor genes, p53 and PTEN (1Yang X.

The tumor suppressor gene PTEN encodes a multifunctional phosphatase that is mutated in a variety of human cancers (6Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M.P. Tonks N. Parsons R.

PTEN inhibits the PI3K pathway and downstream functions, including activation of Akt and protein kinase B, cell survival, and cell proliferation in tumor cells carrying mutant or deletion type PTEN (6Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M.P. Tonks N. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5667-5672PubMed Google Scholar, 8Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P.

Inactivation of PTEN because of a genetic mutation resulted in increased Akt activity in many types of tumor (10Kurose K. Zhou X.P. Araki T. Cannistra S.A. Maher E.R. Eng C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 2097-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The overexpression of PTEN in cancer cells carrying mutant or deletion type PTEN can inhibit cell proliferation and tumorigenicity via induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and apoptosis (11Chung J.H. Eng C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8096-8100Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PTEN can bind directly to p53 and prevent its degradation in a manner independent of its effect on Akt activation (12Zhou M. Gu L. Findley H.W. Jiang R. Woods W.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6357-6362PubMed Google Scholar). Recently published evidence indicates the existence of a mechanistic link between PTEN and p53 functions through the control of the phosphorylation state of MDM2, which modulates the nuclear localization of MDM2 and the ubiquitination of p53 by the activation of the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway (13Mayo L.D.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, an important function of p53 is to act as a transcription factor by binding to a p53-specific DNA consensus sequence in responsive genes, which would be expected to increase the synthesis of p21 (waf1) (16Facchinetti M.M. De Siervi A. Toskos D. Senderowicz A.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3629-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The p21 is the most important protein involved in cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2/M checkpoints. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the critical steps in cell survival which occurs through suppression of apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic function of Akt is reported to be mediated by its ability to phosphorylate apoptosis regulatory molecules including BAD, caspase 9, IKK, and the forkhead transcriptional factor FKHRL1 (17Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 18Martelli A.M. Nyakern M. Tabellini G. Bortul R. Tazzari P.L. Evangelisti C. Cocco L. Leukemia. 2006; 20: 911-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recent reports show that Akt inhibition leads to the up-regulation of FasL expression and DNA fragmentation in T-lymphocytes and glioma cells (19Ciechomska I. Pyrzynska B. Kazmierczak P. Kaminska B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7617-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Uriarte S.M. Joshi-Barve S. Song Z. Sahoo R. Gobejishvili L. Jala V.R. Haribabu B. McClain C. Barve S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 680-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) examined the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in the regulation of FasL expression and cellular survival in vascular smooth muscle cells. It is shown that serum deprivation, incubation with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, or transduction of an inactivating Akt mutant will lead to increases in FasL mRNA and cell surface expression of the FasL protein. In our efforts to study the efficacy and mechanisms of novel anticancer agents for ovarian carcinoma, we recently reported that curcumin, a major active component of Curcuma longa, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells by modulating Akt/p38 pathways (22Weir N.M.

Recently, EF24 (Fig. 1A), a new compound having close structural similarity to curcumin, has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells in vitro (23Adams B.K. Ferstl E.M. Davis M.C. Herold M. Kurtkaya S. Camalier R.F. Hollingshead M.G. Kaur G. Sausville E.A. Rickles F.R. Snyder J.P. Liotta D.C. Shoji M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 3871-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The anticancer effect of EF24 in breast cancer cells has been attributed, in part, to redox-mediated induction of apoptosis (24Adams B.K. Cai J. Armstrong J. Herold M. Lu Y.J. Sun A. Snyder J.P. Liotta D.C. Jones D.P. Shoji M. Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This motivated us to investigate the anti-cancer efficacy and molecular mechanism action of EF24 on cisplatin-resistant (CR) ovarian cancer cells. We observed that EF24 greatly inhibited the proliferation of CR cells by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis. We further observed that EF24 significantly increased PTEN expression resulting in the down-regulation of Akt and MDM2 and activation of p53. Materials—EF24 was synthesized as reported by Adams et al. (23Adams B.K. Ferstl E.M. Davis M.C. Herold M. Kurtkaya S. Camalier R.F. Hollingshead M.G. Kaur G. Sausville E.A. Rickles F.R. Snyder J.P.

Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). All other reagents and compounds were analytical grades. Cell Lines and Cultures—Human ovarian carcinoma cell line, A2780, (cisplatin-sensitive, hereafter abbreviated as CS) and a derived cisplatin-resistant subline, A2780 cDDP (cisplatin-resistant, hereafter abbreviated as CR), were used. These cell lines were developed as in vivo s.c. models in athymic mice. The cisplatin-resistant cell line was originally developed from an in vivo tumor model by treating with cisplatin (25Andrews P.A. Jones J.A. Varki N.M. Howell S.B. Cancer Commun. 1990; 2: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used as controls. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were grown in a 100-mm dish to 70% confluence at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were routinely trypsinized (0.05% trypsin/EDTA) and counted using a Nucleo-Counter (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined using the conversion of MTT to formazan via mitochondrial oxidation. Cells were grown in T-75 flasks to >80% confluence. They were then trypsinized, counted, and seeded in 96-well plates with an average of 7,000 cells/well. Cells were incubated overnight and then treated in triplicate with 2 μm EF24 for 24 or 48 h. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Cell Cycle Analysis—CR cells were treated with EF24 (2 μm) for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and then trypsinized, washed in PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 75% ethanol/PBS. The DNA was labeled with propidium iodide. Cells were sorted by flow cytometry analysis, and cell cycle profiles were determined using ModFit LT software (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA). Immunoblot Analysis—CR cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium and treated with Me2SO (control) or EF24 (2 μm) for the desired times. Equal volumes of Me2SO (0.1% v/v) were present in each treatment. Following EF24 treatments, the cell lysates were prepared in nondenaturing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined using a Pierce detergent-compatible protein assay kit. For Western blotting, 25 to 50 μg of protein lysate per sample was denatured in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% or 12% Tris-glycine gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder (w/v) in TBST (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies described above. The bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL Advanced kit). Protein expressions were determined using an Image Gauge version 3.45. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin (2 μg/ml). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated. A 500-μg sample of the total protein was used for immunoprecipitation. Either PTEN, p53, or ubiquitin antibody was incubated with cell lysates for 2 h followed by addition of 20 μl of recombinant agarose G-protein was added in the samples, and then samples were incubated for an additional 1 h. The matrices were washed four times with the same lysis buffer. After being boiled for 8 min in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, samples containing cell lysate protein were separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE gel) and then transferred onto equilibrated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with skimmed milk, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies described above. The bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) using an ECL kit. PTEN siRNAs Study—CR cells were transfected with PTEN siRNA and negative control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, the transfection complexes were removed and replaced with culture medium. After incubating with 2 μm EF24 in culture medium for 6 or 24 h, cell cycle arrest and sub-G1 levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot for PTEN, pAkt (Ser473 and Thr308), Akt, p53, cleaved caspases 3, 7, and PARP. Transfection of Wild-type PTEN cDNA—The PTEN overexpression experiments were performed using a wild-type PTEN cDNA. The FLAG-tagged gene was transfected into CR and CHO cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h after the transfection of the PTEN gene, EF24 (2 μm) was added and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then subjected to viability and immunoblot assays for PTEN, pAkt Ser473, p53, p21, cleaved caspase-3, PARP, and FLAG. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by a Student's t test. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. EF24 Causes Decrease in Cell Viability in Ovarian Cancer Cells—To determine the effect of EF24 on ovarian cancer cell viability, we treated cells with different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm) of EF24 at time points (24 and 48 h). Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The proliferation of CR cells was inhibited by EF24 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). We also observed a similar effect of EF24 on cisplatin-sensitive (CS) human ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, EF24 did not induce any significant cell death in CHO cells (Fig. 1D). The growth inhibition constants (IC50) of the CR, CS, and CHO cells were 0.65 μm, 0.50 μm, and 4.60 μm, respectively. These results indicated that EF24 was more effective in inhibiting the growth of the cancer cells as compared with normal cells. Further, the cell viability in a 48-h incubation period was not significantly different from a 24-h incubation period. EF24 Induces G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest in CR Ovarian Cancer Cells—To determine whether the growth inhibition of CR cancer cells by EF24 was caused by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, the cells were treated with 2 μm EF24 for 3, 6, or 12 h. The cells were then fixed, and cell cycle populations were determined by flow cytometry. The results showed that EF24 induced G2/M arrest in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The increase in G2/M cell population was greatest at 12 h (Fig. 2B). We next examined the effect of EF24 on cell cycle regulatory molecules, including p53, p21, p27, CycB1, CycA, CycD1, Cdc2, and Cdc25C. Exposure of cells to 2-μm EF24 enhanced the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 as well as the levels of p53 and p21 without any change in p27 (Fig. 2C). In addition, the level of MDM2, one of the negative regulators of p53, was decreased in a time-dependent manner. We also observed that the expression of G2/M cell-cycle regulating factors CycB1, CycA, CycD1, Cdc2, and Cdc25C showed a time-dependent decrease. However, no change was observed in the Wee1 levels. Fig. 2D shows the densitometry results of the phosphorylated p53 and p53 bands. EF24 Induces Apoptosis in CR Cells—The arrest of cell cycle progression in tumor cells is usually associated with concomitant activation of cell death pathways. We, therefore, examined the contribution of apoptosis in EF24-treated CR cells. The number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content after 24 h of EF24 treatment was substantially higher as compared with control (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this finding, the increased activation of caspase was examined by Western blot analysis. The analysis demonstrated activation of the caspase cascade, including cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-7, and PARP after treatment with EF24 (Fig. 3B). These results showed that EF24 induced apoptosis via a caspase cascade in CR cancer cells. We next investigated whether inhibition of caspase activation would affect the EF24-induced apoptosis. CR cancer cells were pretreated with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk at 20 or 50 μm for 1 h and then treated with EF24 for another 24 h. The cells were analyzed for cleaved caspase-3, -7, and PARP by immunoblot assay and apoptosis by flow cytometry. Pretreatment with 20 or 50 μm z-VAD-fmk partially blocked the EF24-mediated activation of caspase (Fig. 3C). Consistently, pretreatment of the cells with 50 μm z-VAD-fmk significantly diminished the EF24-mediated apoptotic (sub-G1) cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that the EF24-induced apoptosis in CR cells was related to caspase activation, although z-VAD-fmk did not completely block apoptosis. EF24 Activates FasL—After we observed the caspase-8 activation by EF24, we analyzed the expression level of caspase-8-associated cell death receptors, such as FasL, Fas/CD95, or TNFR1. A clear increase in FasL expression in a time-dependent manner, but not in Fas/CD95 or TNFR1, was observed in the EF24-treated CR ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the quantitative results of the bands by densitometric analyses. The results suggest a significant involvement of FasL in the EF24-induced apoptosis in CR cells. EF24 Causes a Decrease in Phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2—Recently, inhibition of Akt by both a PI3 kinase inhibitor as well as a selective Akt inhibitor was shown to upregulate the FasL mRNA expression and protein levels in vascular smooth muscle cells (21Suhara T. Kim H.S. Kirshenbaum L.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 680-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The up-regulation in FasL mRNA and protein expression could be due to the effect of Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 (26Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar, 27Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in the expression level of FasL by the EF24 treatment in this study prompted us to examine a possible decrease in the expression level of the phosphorylated Akt. Hence, we determined the effect of EF24 on the levels of phospho-Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) and total Akt levels by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, A and B). The expression levels of Ser473- and Thr308-phosphorylated Akt were substantially decreased within 12 h in the EF24-treated cells, without any changes in the total Akt protein level. The Ser-phosphorylated Akt and Thr-phosphorylated Akt levels were also decreased by the PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002. The expression levels of pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were unchanged at 12 h of treatment. However, at 24 and 48 h, the pERK1/2 levels were clearly down-regulated while the total EKR1/2 levels were unchanged (Fig. 5C). EF24 Up-regulates PTEN Activity and Expression—Because the PI3K/Akt pathway is negatively regulated by PTEN (8Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), we presumed that the inhibition of Akt by EF24 might correspond to an activation of PTEN. Hence, we determined the changes in total PTEN expression as well as the activation of PTEN (pPTEN) in the CR cells treated with EF24. We observed an increase in PTEN and pPTEN levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). We next wanted to know whether the increase in the levels of PTEN/pPTEN was caused by EF24-mediated inhibition of proteasomal degradation in CR cells. A previous report by Torres et al. (28Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) indicated that the turnover of PTEN protein was easily degraded in COS-7 cells, and it was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. We treated CR cells with EF24 for 0.5, 1, or 2 h and then measured the inhibition of PTEN proteasomal degradation. As shown in Fig. 6C, incubation CR cells with EF24 caused an accumulation of polyubiquitin-tagged proteins on pPTEN and PTEN, but not on p53. The results revealed that the degradation occurred in both PTEN and pPTEN, and that EF24 inhibited the degradation of both. We, in fact, observed the inhibition of pPTEN degradation as early as 0.5 h after treatment with EF24 compared with PTEN, which took about 2 h. Furthermore, increased levels of polyubiquitinated proteins were observed in pPTEN and PTEN blots, suggesting that the polyubiquitinated proteins might be related to PTEN. Because most of the proteasome-mediated protein degradation pathways require ubiquitination (29Orlowski R.Z. Dees E.C. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the inhibition of proteasome activity by EF24 should increase the level of PTEN protein expression in CR cells. The positive control of specific proteasome inhibitor MG-132 also inhibited the PTEN-degradation in CR cancer cells. These results strongly suggested that PTEN was degraded via a proteasome-mediated mechanism in CR cells, and such a degradation of PTEN was inhibited by EF24. Because casein kinase2 (CK2) is known to regulate PTEN phosphorylation, we next checked the activity of CK2 in EF24-treated CR cells. As shown in Fig. 6D, we did not observe any change in the activity of CK2 suggesting that phosphorylation of PTEN was not affected by the treatment. This further suggested that the increase in the levels of pPTEN in EF24-treated cells was due to the inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of pPTEN. Many reports have shown an interaction of PTEN with p53 (8Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 12Zhou M. Gu L. Findley H.W. Jiang R. Woods W.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6357-6362PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that PTEN stabilizes p53, however, this interaction results in the degradation of PTEN protein levels. We analyzed the PTEN and p53 interaction by IP. As shown in Fig. 6E, the results did not indicate any interaction of PTEN with p53. Taken together, the results suggested that EF24 up-regulated PTEN expression and inhibited pAkt (Ser473 and Thr308) and MDM2, a known negative regulator of p53. PTEN siRNA Blocks Apoptosis Induced by EF24—We next examined the effect of the inhibition of PTEN expression on cell proliferation and apoptosis in EF24-treated CR cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 7A, the level of PTEN, induced by EF24, was repressed in cells transfected with siRNA targeting PTEN, compared with EF24-treated cells without PTEN siRNA, or EF24-treated cells transfected with negative control siRNA. Furthermore, the suppression of PTEN by PTEN siRNA in EF24-treated cells resulted in the increase of Akt phosphorylation (Ser473 and Thr308) and decreased p53 and p21 levels. In addition, the suppression of PTEN decreased the G2/M cell cycle arrest by more than 30% as compared with EF24-treated groups (Fig. 7B) and prevented the activation of cleaved caspase-3, -7, and PARP and reduced apoptosis induced by EF24 (Fig. 7, C-E). These data indicated that up-regulation of PTEN accounted, at least in part, for the G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis caused by EF24. Overexpression of PTEN Selectively Enhances Apoptosis in CR Cell—To check the effect of overexpression of PTEN on inducing apoptosis, we used wild-type PTEN cDNA transfected into cells. Twenty-four hours after the transfection of the PTEN gene, the cells were treated with EF24 (2 μm) for 24 h and then their viability checked. As seen in Fig. 8A, overexpression of PTEN did not induce any significant cell death in CHO cell"

Great care must be exercised in interpretating HSP-driven studies, as by-products linked to the recombinant generation of these proteins have been shown to mediate immunological effects. We generated highly purified human recombinant Hsp70 and demonstrated that it strongly enhances the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens resulting in better antigen-specific T cell stimulation. Augmentation of T cell stimulation was a direct function of the degree of complex formation between Hsp70 and peptides and correlated with improved antigen delivery to endosomal compartments. The Hsp70 activity was independent of TAP proteins and was not inhibited by exotoxin A or endosomal acidification. Consequently, Hsp70 enhanced cross-presentation of various antigenic sequences, even when they required different post-uptake processing and trafficking, as exemplified by the tumor antigens tyrosinase and Melan-A/MART-1. Furthermore, Hsp70 enhanced cross-presentation by different antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells and B cells. Importantly, enhanced cross-presentation and antigen-specific T cell activation were observed in the absence of innate signals transmitted by Hsp70. As Hsp70 supports the cross-presentation of different antigens and APCs and is inert to APC function, it may show efficacy in various settings of immune modulation, including induction of antigen-specific immunity or tolerance.

Conventionally, the antigenic peptides presented by MHC class I are derived from endogenous cytosolic antigens. In specialized situations, MHC class I molecules additionally present peptides derived from exogenous antigens. This noncanonical MHC class I presentation, which is referred to as cross-presentation, requires that the exogenous antigen is internalized by APCs, subsequently enzymatically processed into peptides, and channeled into the MHC class I loading pathway (1Shen L. Kim K.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Guermonprez P. Kim S. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2005; 26: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cross-presentation is crucial for the generation of CD8 T cell responses against antigens that are not endogenously produced by APCs, such as tumor antigens and pathogen-derived proteins. In an applied setting, cross-presentation is the required pathway for the generation of protein-based vaccines that are intended to stimulate antigen-specific CD8 responses. Critical parameters that define the efficacy of a vaccine are the amount of delivered antigen and the context in which the antigen is presented to the T cells. As the physiological capacity of APCs to cross-present antigen is generally low (3Maecker H.T. Kim S.A. Suni M.A. He X.S. Picker L.J. Maino V.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7268-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), there is significant interest to develop reagents that enhance the targeting of exogenous antigens to the cross-presentation pathway.HSPs are a family of intracellular proteins, which act as molecular chaperones with essential functions in folding and intracellular translocation of other proteins (4Mayer M.P.

Recently, however, controversy developed regarding several immunological properties of HSPs, in particular the ability of HSPs to mature DCs, thus questioning their utilization in vaccination settings. Most relevant were the findings that recombinant HSPs (Hsp70 and Hsp60) expressed in Escherichia coli contained LPS and flagellin as by-products, which cause DC maturation and cytokine and chemokine secretion (21Ye Z.

We purified recombinant human (rhu) Hsp70 to homogeneity and carefully monitored for by-products. In addition, we devised a novel experimental protocol that encompasses exposure of APCs to identical concentrations of tumor antigen-derived peptides either alone or complexed to rhuHsp70. This setup allowed us to evaluate whether rhuHsp70-bound antigen is cross-presented, and more importantly, we could quantify the enhancement mediated through the chaperone.Cross-presentation is a complex process that requires enzymatic processing of the exogenous antigen and its trafficking through different intracellular compartments (1Shen L. Kim K.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Rock K.L.

Immunity. 2006; 25: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Dependent on the characteristics of the exogenous antigen and the functional capacity of the involved APC, different steps may be utilized. As these requirements cannot be predicted, the agent best suited as a delivery vehicle for cross-presentation should be independent of these specific processes. To fully assess the capacity of rhuHsp70 in cross-presentation, we therefore used two antigenic sequences with distinct processing requirements and two types of APC, DCs and B cell lines, with different cross-presentation capacity (1Shen L. Kim K.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Heit A. Kim K.M. Schmitz F. Schiemann M. Busch D.H. Wagner H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate that rhuHsp70 significantly enhances cross-presentation of exogenous antigens by means of complex formation and augmenting antigen uptake. rhuHsp70 enhanced cross-presentation of different APCs and different antigenic sequences and thus can be utilized in a variety of settings. Innate immune activation by rhuHsp70 was not observed and more importantly was not required for antigen-specific T cell activation. The possibilities resulting from the absence of innate activation are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—ADP, ATP, γ-ATP, ionomycin, dimethylamiloride (DMA), chloroquine, exotoxin A, E. coli-derived LPS (strain 0111:B4), and reagents for calcium signaling, Indo-I AM, Pluronic F-127, and Me2SO, were purchased from Sigma.

Buffer was exchanged by Sephadex G-25 columns, PD10 (GE Healthcare), and dialysis against HKM buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). Endotoxin was depleted using Detoxi-Gel™ endotoxin removing gel (Pierce). Quantitation of endotoxin was performed using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, MD). The resulting endotoxin content was below 0.5 EU/mg rhuHsp70. The folding status of highly purified rhu-Hsp70 was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy.Protein was quantified by the Bradford assay (protein assay, Bio-Rad), and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (34Bloom H. Kim H. Gross H.S. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3729) Google Scholar) with a detection sensitivity between 2 and 5 ng/protein per band (not shown).The ATPase activity was determined from the amount of [32P]ADP produced from [α-32P]ATP as described (35Gassler C.S.

The reaction mixture, consisting of HKM buffer, 250 μm ATP, 0.1 Ci of [α-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare), and 1 μm rhuHsp70, was incubated at 30 °C. After separation on thin layer chromatography, the amount of radioactive ADP and ATP at 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min was quantified using Packard Instant Imager (Canberra Packard, UK) and used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis (37Mayer M.P. Kim T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase rates of different rhuHsp70 preparations were between 4 and 10 × 10-4 s-1, which is in the published range (35Gassler C.S. Kim T. Brehmer D. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol.

Where indicated, the mixture contained 4.2 μm γ-ATP. To evaluate cross-presentation, DCs and T cells were added to the rhuHsp70·peptide mixture yielding a total volume of 210 μl and resulting in a 1:7 dilution of proteins and peptides. The concentrations stated in this study correspond to the final concentrations present in the cross-presentation assay.The Kd value of b-pep70-MART-1 peptide complexed to rhuHsp70 was determined by fluorescence titration 5M. J. Pandya, manuscript in preparation. and was 0.093 μm ± 0.002. The fraction of peptide in complex with rhuHsp70 was calculated using the quadratic binding Equation, α=P0+L0+Kd−(P0+L0+Kd)2−4P0·L02P0where P0 is the total concentration of pep70-peptide; L0 is the total concentration of rhuHsp70; and Kd is the dissociation constant.Cell Culture—Human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL), L721.45 (positive for transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP)), and L721.174 (negative for TAP) (38Salter R.D. Kim D.N. Cresswell P.

Immunol. 2005; 17: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For cross-presentation assays, both CTL clones were used between day 8 and 14 after the last stimulation.Dendritic Cell Culture—Dendritic cells (DCs) were derived from monocytes. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized venous blood of healthy volunteers by density gradient centrifugation over Pancoll (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany), and monocytes were positively isolated using micromagnetic beads coated with antibody to CD14 (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). CD14+ cells were plated in 6-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 106/4-ml cells per well in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen). rhuGM-CSF (800 units/ml) (Leukine Berlex, Richmond, CA) and rhuIL-4 (500 units/ml) (Cell Genix, Freiburg, Germany) were added to the monocyte cultures at days 0, 3, and 6. Nonmature IL4/GM-CSF differentiated DCs were used between day 6 and day 8. They expressed CD209, CD11c, HLA-DR, CD40, CD32, low levels of CD80 and CD86 and were negative for CD83 and CD38, confirming their nonmature differentiation state. The institutional review board of the Ludwig-Maximilans-University approved these studies. Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki.Cytokine Quantitation—Nonmature DCs were incubated with rhuHsp70, LPS, or without stimuli for 48 h at 37 °C. Cytokines in the supernatants were measured using the Bio-Plex cytokine assay (Bio-Rad), and concentrations were calculated using the Bio-Plex Manager™ software program.Flow Cytometry for Surface Markers and b-pep70-peptide Localization—Surface expression of molecules was determined by flow cytometry. 0.1 × 106 cells (DCs or B-LCL) were stained with specific antibodies (anti-human CD80, CD86, CD83, CD91 (all from BD Biosciences)) and anti-human CD38 (Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany) or IgG control antibodies (BD Biosciences) diluted in PBS containing 2% FCS. For HLA-A2 staining, the antibody HB54 (43McMichael A.J. Kim P. Rust N. Brodsky F. Hum. Immunol. 1980; 1: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and isotype control anti-mouse immunoglobulin were used. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence analyses employed the FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).To determine the distribution of b-pep70-peptides, nonmature DCs or L721.45 were incubated for 60 or 120 min, respectively, with the biotin-peptide or an identical amount of biotin-peptide that was complexed to rhuHsp70 for 12 h at room temperature prior to the addition of cells. Cells were washed, and the amount of biotin-peptide bound to the cell surface or found inside the cells was quantified by staining with streptavidin-FITC. Surface-bound peptide was quantitated by directly staining cells with streptavidin-FITC (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany) in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and 2% FCS. To determine the amount of peptide inside the cells, streptavidin-FITC was given to cells after fixation and permeabilization using the intracellular staining buffer set (eBiosciences, San Diego). The mean fluorescence of FITC was measured with FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).Macropinocytosis Assay—Nonmature DCs (day 6) (2 × 106 cells in 5 ml of AIM-V medium containing 400 units/ml rhuIL-4 and 800 units/ml rhuGM-CSF) were stimulated with 0.3 μm rhuHsp70, 250 μm ADP, or 1 μg/ml LPS. As control, the same volume of medium was added. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed and resuspended in AIM-V medium at a concentration of 0.5 × 106/ml. 1 mg/ml BSA-FITC (Sigma) was added to the cells and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C or on ice. In another setting, unstimulated DCs were incubated with 1 mg/ml BSA-FITC together with the stimulating agent (as above) for 2 h at 37 °C or on ice. Thereafter, cells were washed intensively with PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.01% NaN3, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry, employing FACSCalibur and CellQuest software. Surface binding was determined by subtracting the fluorescence values of cells incubated on ice from those values obtained for cells incubated at 37 °C as described (44Panther E. Kim S. Idzko M. Herouy Y. Napp M. la Sala A. Girolomoni G. Norgauer J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Intracellular Calcium Analysis—For calcium analysis, a modified protocol according to Grundler et al. was used (45Grundler W. Kim P. Beisker W. Marx K. Stampfl A. Maier K. Zimmermann I. Nusse M. Cytometry. 2001; 44: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nonmature DCs, B cells, or CTL clones (1 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Indo-1 AM (5 μg/1 × 106 cells) in AIM-V medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Indo-1 AM stock solution was prepared in Me2SO with 10% pluronic F-127. Loaded cells were washed and resuspended in medium at 0.5 × 106 cells/1.5 ml. Cell aggregates were removed by filtration through a cell strainer (100 μm, Nalgene). Changes in intracellular calcium were measured with MoFlo (DakoCytomation) using Summit software (Dako-Cytomation). The stimulating agents, ionomycin or ADP at different concentrations, were added 1 min after the cells were measured without stimulation for background establishment. Cell populations gated according to FSC/SSC scatter and single cell events, determined by means of pulse width of the FSC signal, were selected. Violet (405 nm) versus green (530 nm) fluorescence was recorded over 7 min. The ratio 405/530 nm is proportional to the intracellular ionized calcium concentration. As control, the buffers without stimulating agents were measured and did not result in a calcium signal. Data analysis was done with Summit and the graphic software Sigma Plot. Results are shown as changes in the ratio of the mean fluorescence over time.Cross-presentation Assay—b-pep70-MART-1- or b-pep70-tyrosinase peptides in HKM buffer at indicated concentrations were added to wells of 96-well cell culture plates. The complex formation reaction was performed by adding rhuHsp70 in HKM buffer or a corresponding volume of HKM buffer without rhuHsp70 as control. After 4 h of incubation at room temperature, nonmature DCs or B-LCL (15,000 in 90 μl AIM-V medium) with or without chloroquine (final concentration of 10 μg/ml) or exotoxin A (final concentration of 10 μg/ml) were added to each well. To allow uptake, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, TyrF8- or A42-CTLs (4,000 cells/90 μl) in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS, 10% human serum, and rIL-2 (50 units/ml, Proleukine, Cetus Corp. Emeryville, CA) were added to each well. After 24 h at 37 °C, supernatants were harvested and the content of IFN-γ was measured by ELISA (OptEIA™, Pharmingen). Control samples, containing all components except the peptide, were used to determine IFN-γ background, which was subtracted from the experimental sample.Fluorescence Labeling of Proteins—Purified rhuHsp70 (own preparation) or BSA (Sigma) were incubated with Cy™5 bis-functional reactive dye (GE Healthcare) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (0.1 m; pH 9.5) for 3 h at room temperature. Free unconjugated Cy5 was removed by passing the mixture over a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25; GE Healthcare). Labeled proteins were centrifuged at 100,000 × g before use to remove any particulate matter.Quantitation of Endocytosis by Flow Cytometry—100,000 DCs were incubated with 100 μl of AIM-V medium containing 50 μg/ml of either Cy5-BSA, A647-transferrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or Cy5-rhuHsp70. Where indicated, DCs were pretreated for 10 min with medium containing the fluid phase macropinocytosis inhibitor DMA (1 mm dissolved in Me2SO) (46Wassenberg J.J. Kim C. Nicchitta C.V. J.

https://openalex.org/W2041896408,"Undesired complement activation is a major cause of tissue injury in various pathological conditions and contributes to several immune complex diseases. Compstatin, a 13-residue peptide, is an effective inhibitor of the activation of complement component C3 and thus blocks a central and crucial step in the complement cascade. The precise binding site on C3, the structure in the bound form, and the exact mode of action of compstatin are unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of compstatin in complex with C3c, a major proteolytic fragment of C3. The structure reveals that the compstatin-binding site is formed by the macroglobulin (MG) domains 4 and 5. This binding site is part of the structurally stable MG-ring formed by domains MG 1–6 and is far away from any other known binding site on C3. Compstatin does not alter the conformation of C3c, whereas compstatin itself undergoes a large conformational change upon binding. We propose a model in which compstatin sterically hinders the access of the substrate C3 to the convertase complexes, thus blocking complement activation and amplification. These insights are instrumental for further development of compstatin as a potential therapeutic.

The complement system is a key part of the innate and adaptive immune system and plays a major role in homeostasis by clearing altered host cells and invading pathogens (1Walport M.J. N. Engl. J.

Inappropriate activation of the complement system leads to tissue injury, causing or aggravating various pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, burn injuries, Alzheimer disease, stroke, and heart attack (reviewed in Ref. 3Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several complement inhibitors are under development, targeting various steps in the complement activation pathways. None of these compounds have been approved for clinical use yet (3Sahu A.

(6Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of C3 by the C3 convertases is a central amplification step in complement activation. All three recognition and initiation pathways, the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways, converge in the activation of C3. Proteolytic activation of C3 yields C3b, which covalently binds to pathogenic or self surfaces, providing a strong signal for clearance of the tagged particles. Because compstatin blocks this critical step of complement activation and because it is a small non-immunogenic peptide, compstatin has the potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent. complement component 3 macroglobulin complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily root mean square. Compstatin (ICVVQDWGHHRCT-NH2, circularized by disulfide bond Cys-2–Cys-12) was discovered by a phage-display, random peptide library search (6Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J.

Compstatin displayed an inhibitory activity of IC50 = 12 μm. In solution, compstatin forms a β-turn at residues Gln-5–Gly-8 with the disulfide bridge Cys-2–Cys-12, residues Ile-1–Val-4, and Thr-13, forming a hydrophobic cluster (10Morikis D. Assa-Munt N.

C3 is a two-chain molecule consisting of a β-(residues 1–645) and an α-chain (residues 650–1641) of 75 and 110 kDa, respectively, that are arranged in 13 domains (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G.

Holland M.C. Sfyroera G. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 2023-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), forms part of MG3 and complete MG4, MG5, MG6β, and the linker domain (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, compstatin likely binds to the structurally stable part of C3. We determined the crystal structure of compstatin in complex with C3c to 2.4-Å resolution. We used C3c instead of C3 in these studies because C3c crystallizes more readily than C3 and crystals of C3c diffract to a higher resolution than those of C3. The resulting structure of the C3c-compstatin complex reveals an unexpected binding site and an unexpected conformation of compstatin. Nonetheless, the structure is in agreement with prior observations on the activity of compstatin and its derivatives and explains the species specificity. Using the available structural data, we propose a model for the inhibitory activity of compstatin in blocking substrate C3 binding to C3 convertases. Protein Purification and Peptide Synthesis—C3c was purified as described previously (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In brief, C3c from outdated human plasma (stored for several weeks at 4 °C) was purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephacel), cation-exchange chromatography (CM-Sephadex C50), and size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl 300). C3c was concentrated to 20 mg ml–1 and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm benzamidine. For crystallization purposes, the glycan moiety on Asn-917 was cleaved off with N-glycosidase F. The improved compstatin analogue (Ac-ICVWQDWGAHRCT-NH2) displaying 45-fold higher activity when compared with the parent peptide was synthesized and purified as described previously (16Mallik B. Katragadda M. Spruce L.A. Carafides C. Tsokos C.G. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and lyophilized for storage. Prior to crystallization, C3c at 20 mg/ml (0.148 mm) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm benzamidine was mixed with lyophilized compstatin to a final concentration of 4.8 mg/ml (3.0 mm). Crystallization and Data Collection—C3c-compstatin was crystallized in hanging drops from mother liquor containing 18% w/v polyethylene glycol-monomethylether 2000, 200 mm potassium bromide and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. Crystals grew up to 250 × 200 × 200 μm within 2 weeks. For cryo-protection crystals were briefly transferred to 8% v/v 2, 3 butanediol, 18% w/v polyethylene glycol-monometylether 2000, 500 mm potassium bromide, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals displayed space group P21 (a = 85.8, b = 124.7, c = 127.4 Å, β = 95.1°), contained two molecules per asymmetric unit and diffracted to 2.4-Å resolution at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID23-1. Diffraction data were processed using MOSFLM/CCP4 (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—C3c-compstatin was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) without the C345c domain was placed. Second the C345c domain of C3c was placed using Coot (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar), and its position was refined by Phaser. Subsequently, all domains were refined by rigid body refinement in Phaser to account for small domain rotations and translations. Compstatin and C3c were finalized by several rounds of model building in Coot and refinement in REFMAC (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) to R and Rfree values of 21.3% and 28.1% (Table 1). The final refined model contained 1107 residues for C3c molecule 1 (chains A, B, and C) and 1113 residues for C3c molecule 2 (chains D, E, and F). Both compstatin molecules were completely built. All molecular graphics figures were generated with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). Structure of the C3c-Compstatin Complex—Here we present the structure of compstatin in complex with C3c. C3c was co-crystallized with the Ac-V4W/H9A-NH2 analogue (Ac-ICVWQDWGAHRCT-NH2) of compstatin (16Mallik B. Katragadda M. Spruce L.A. Carafides C. Tsokos C.G. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), hereafter referred to as compstatin. Crystals diffracted to 2.4-Å resolution and displayed space group P21. Two complexes of C3c-compstatin are present in the asymmetric unit. Complex formation agrees with the 1:1 stoichiometry determined by surface-plasmon resonance (14Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The overall structures of the independent C3c-compstatin complexes are very similar. Differences are observed in the orientation of some domains (see supplemental Table Ia). The differences, which are the largest for C345c, MG8, MG7, and MG3 (in decreasing order), correspond with observed variations for these domains in other structures of C3 and its fragments (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 19Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Nature. 2006; 444: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fair-brother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The structure of the C3c-compstatin complex reveals that compstatin binds between domains MG4 and MG5 (Fig. 1). The MG4 and MG5 domains are part of the 40-kDa C-terminal fragment of the β-chain; thus, the observed binding site is in agreement with prior biochemical data (17Soulika A.M. Holland M.C. Sfyroera G. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 2023-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The β-sheets βA-βB-βE of MG4 and βA-βB-βE of MG5 form a shallow groove. Compstatin binds to the lower end of this groove. Thus, compstatin binds C3c at the bottom end of the MG-ring, far away from the α-chain. Structure of Compstatin—Compstatin bound to C3c differs markedly in conformation from that of free compstatin (10Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Mallik B. Katragadda M. Spruce L.A. Carafides C. Tsokos C.G. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E). In complex with C3c, compstatin is folded in a conformation with a β-turn formed by residues 8–11. The N and C termini point outwards and are outside of the main loop formed by residues 2–10, which is covalently closed by the disulfide bond between Cys-2 and Cys-12. Between the two complexes in the asymmetric unit, compstatin differs only in the orientation of Ile-1 and the acetylated N terminus and Arg-11 (supplemental Fig. 1). This conformation of compstatin differs from those present in the NMR ensemble of free compstatin (10Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Mallik B. Katragadda M. Spruce L.A. Carafides C. Tsokos C.G. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Free compstatin has a β-turn at residues 5–8, whereas in bound compstatin, a β-turn at residues 8–11 is observed. The side-chain interactions between residues 3, 4, and 7 required for conformational stability of free compstatin (10Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Mallik B. Katragadda M. Spruce L.A. Carafides C. Tsokos C.G. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are absent in bound compstatin. In contrast, residues Val-3, Trp-4, and Trp-7 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with C3c in bound compstatin. Furthermore, Trp-4 and Trp-7 in bound compstatin do not show π -π stacking interactions (16Mallik B. Katragadda M. Spruce L.A. Carafides C. Tsokos C.G. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); instead, Trp-4 is involved in CH/π and sulfur-aromatic interactions with Cys-12 when bound to C3c. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation between free and bound compstatin after superpositioning is 3.7 Å for all 13 Cαs and 4.9 Å for all (101, non-hydrogen) atoms (27Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These data show clearly that compstatin undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement upon binding to C3c. Structure of C3c—The structure of C3c in complex with compstatin reveals the same overall domain arrangement of 10 domains as observed for free C3c (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). For most domains, we observe small variations in domain orientation among the two structures of C3c-compstatin and the two structures of free C3c in the asymmetric unit (see supplemental Table Ib). Large differences are observed for C345c (up to 15.4° rotation) and MG8 (up to 8.3° rotation). These differences reflect the flexibility of the C3c molecule. Differences in domain orientation of MG4 and MG5 within C3c range from 2.4 to 3.6° and 1.4 to 1.9°, respectively. The relative orientations between MG4 and MG5 differ by only 4.2° among these structures of C3c. These data indicate that compstatin does not affect the overall domain arrangement of C3c. Compstatin-C3c Interactions—Compstatin interacts extensively with C3c. One side of the compstatin-loop structure faces C3c, and one side faces the solvent with residues 2–9 alternating inside and outside. Residues 11–13 extend outward away from C3c. In total, 40% of the molecular surface of compstatin is buried in the complex, resulting in 1120 Å2 buried surface area of the complex. The interface of compstatin with C3c is characterized by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (see supplemental Table II). Notably, Val-3 and the Trp-7 of compstatin are buried in hydrophobic pockets formed by C3c residues Met-346, Pro-347, Leu-454, Arg-456 and Leu-455, Arg-456, Arg-459, and Glu-462, respectively (Figs. 1C and 2A). A hydrogen-bonding network between both backbone and side-chain atoms of C3c and compstatin further stabilize the interaction (supplemental Table IIa and Fig. 2B). A small difference in bound waters is observed in the interface of compstatin with C3c between the two complexes in the asymmetric unit. In one complex (chains A, B, and C for C3c and chain G for compstatin in the deposited Protein Data Bank file), we observe no bound water molecule, whereas in the other complex (chains D, E, and F and chain H, respectively), we observe two water molecules mediating hydrogen bonding between compstatin and C3c. The water molecules mediate interactions between compstatin Gln-5 and C3c Asp-491 and the backbone carbonyl oxygens of compstatin Cys-2 and C3c Thr-391. This small difference in bound waters possibly reflects flexibility and small differences in crystal packing in the vicinity of the compstatin-binding site. Alternatively, we possibly have not observed all bound water molecules due to the limited resolution of 2.4 Å. For both complexes, we observe a bromide ion bound in the interface. This ion forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogen of compstatin Asp-6 and backbone nitrogen of C3c Arg-459. The crystallization solution contained 200 mm KBr, whereas the cryo-protectant contained 500 mm KBr. Possibly, the stabilizing role of bromide is replaced by a water molecule in conditions without bromide present. Comparison of C3c-Compstatin with C3—Several structures of C3 and its fragments C3b and C3c are now available (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 19Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Nature. 2006; 444: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fair-brother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Comparison of the medium with high resolution structures of C3, C3c, C3c-CRIg, and C3c-compstatin shows that the MG4-MG5 domain orientation is conserved (Fig. 3). Difference in orientations of other domains, notably C345c, MG8, MG7, and MG3, can be attributed to inherent flexibility of the molecule. However, we observe significant differences in the compstatin-binding site. The loop βE-βF of MG4 and positions of amino acid side chains differ up to 4.6 Å between C3c-compstatin and free C3c (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the positions of the side chains in the C3c-compstatin complex resemble more free C3 than free C3c; see, for example, the positions of Asn-390, His-392, and Pro-393 of loop βE-βF and Pro-347 and Arg-456 in Fig. 3A (see r.m.s. deviation values in supplemental Table Ic). These differences between C3, C3c-compstatin, and C3c may explain the higher affinity of compstatin for C3 (Kd of 0.14 μm) than for C3c (Kd of 0.39 μm) 4M. Katragadda and J. D. Lambris, unpublished results. (14Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Katragadda M. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54987-54995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Overall, we may conclude that compstatin binding does not induce large rearrangements in C3c, but minor, local induced effects are present in the vicinity of the compstatin-binding site. Compstatin Binding to C3—The crystal structure of the C3c-compstatin complex reveals that compstatin binds C3c between domains MG4 and MG5 of the β-chain. Compstatin undergoes a large conformational change upon binding to C3c. In contrast, C3c does not undergo large changes upon complex formation. The conformation of the compstatin-binding site in C3c is structurally very similar to that observed in the structure of uncomplexed C3. The observed compstatin-binding site is supported by biochemical data. Recently, the compstatin-binding site was found to reside on the 40-kDa C-terminal region of the β-chain of C3 (17Soulika A.M. Holland M.C. Sfyroera G. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 2023-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both domains MG4 and MG5 are part of this region. Compstatin displays species specificity; it binds only to primate C3 and not to C3 from lower mammalian species (28Sahu A. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Residues Gly-345, His-392, Pro-393, Leu-454, and Arg-459 are all extensively involved in interactions with compstatin, as determined by the crystal structure. These residues are conserved in primate C3, whereas they all differ in other mammals (see supplemental Fig. 2). These different amino acid residues would yield steric hindrance or lead to loss of specific interactions, and, thus explain the species specificity observed for compstatin. The structure of compstatin in the C3c-compstatin complex differs markedly from the structure of compstatin in solution. Previous activity data from mutational studies, however, are in agreement with the observed C3c-compstatin complex. These studies indicated that the disulfide bridge, residues in the β-turn (residues 5–8), and some residues in the hydrophobic cluster at the linked termini (residues 1–4 and 12–13) were essential for binding to C3 (10Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Sarrias M.R. Roy M. Spruce L.A. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. J.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both main-chain and side-chain atoms were proposed to be directly involved in binding to C3 (11Morikis D. Roy M. Sahu A. Troganis A. Jennings P.A. Tsokos G.C. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14942-14953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L.

Immunol. 2003; 39: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More specifically, hydrophobic residues Val-3 and Trp-7 were shown to be essential for activity. The indole amide of Trp-7 was proposed to be involved in hydrogen bonding with C3 (10Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Morikis D. Roy M. Sahu A. Troganis A. Jennings P.A. Tsokos G.C. Lambris J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 49: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); in contrast, the indole amide of Trp-4 was not (29Katragadda M. Magotti P. Sfyroera G. Lambris J.D. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In our crystal structure, both main-chain and side-chain atoms contribute to the compstatin-C3c interactions, residues 2 and 3 of the hydrophobic cluster are involved in hydrophobic interaction with C3c, Val-3 and Trp-7 have extensive hydrophobic interactions with C3c, and the amide indole of Trp-7 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain oxygen of Met-457 (see also supplemental Table II), whereas the amide indole of Trp-4 does not form a hydrogen bond with C3c. Thus, many of the previously proposed interactions are in agreement with the structure of the C3c-compstatin complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that the C3-compstatin binding is an enthalpy-driven process (15Katragadda M. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54987-54995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the unfavorable entropy could arise from binding water molecules at the interface or could be due to conformational changes in C3 and/or compstatin (15Katragadda M. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54987-54995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We observe large structural differences between free and bound compstatin. In contrast, only small structural differences are observed in the compstatin-binding site region between structures of C3, C3c (18Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and C3c-compstatin (Fig. 3). We observe very few water molecules mediating the interactions between compstatin and C3c; this fits with the tight packing and the amount of hydrophobic interactions observed in the complex. Therefore, we conclude that the observed unfavorable entropy of complex formation arises mostly from the conformational change that compstatin undergoes upon binding to C3. Compstatin's Mode of Action—Two possible mechanisms for complement inhibition by compstatin have been proposed; compstatin either (i) sterically hinders binding of C3 to the convertase or (ii) induces conformational changes in C3, preventing binding of C3 to the convertase. Our data clearly show that the binding site of compstatin lies far away from any other known binding site on C3 or its proteolytic fragments (30Janssen B.J. Gros P. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that compstatin binds C3 without effecting large structural changes. These data are consistent with the observation that compstatin does not interfere with the formation of the C3 convertase or with the function of any of the complement regulatory proteins (6Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, binding of compstatin to C3 does not increase protease sensitivity (6Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to bacterial protein extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb-C), which affects protease sensitivity by changing the conformation of C3 (31Hammel M. Sfyroera G. Ricklin D. Magotti P. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The effect observed by surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that conformational changes play an important role in compstatin-C3 binding (14Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Katragadda M. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54987-54995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We argue that the marked conformational change of compstatin suffices to explain the surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry results. We therefore conclude that compstatin does not act by changing the conformation of C3 but likely acts through sterically hindering the binding of C3 to the convertase. How does compstatin sterically hinder C3 binding to the convertases? Most binding sites for interacting proteins have been mapped to the α-chain of C3 (30Janssen B.J. Gros P. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The exception is the recently identified complement receptor CRIg, which also inhibits convertase activity (21Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fair-brother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M. Nature. 2006; 444: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Crystal structures revealed that CRIg binds C3b and C3c predominantly at domains MG3 and MG6 of the β-chain (21Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fair-brother W.J. McCallum S.A. Embuscado L. DeForge L. Hass P.E. van Lookeren Campagne M.

These two binding sites of CRIg and compstatin are >20 Å apart but lie on the same face of the MG-ring of the β-chain. Interestingly, in the crystal of C3b, we observe a C3b-C3b crystallographic symmetry-related contact site formed by the same face of the MG-ring (Fig. 4A) (19Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Nature. 2006; 444: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that this MG-ring interaction face may indicate a major exosite in substrate binding forming the C3-C3bBb substrate-enzyme complex. Both CRIg and compstatin would sterically hinder the formation of this interface of the substrate-enzyme complex, and thus, explain the inhibitory activity of both molecules (Fig. 4B). Compstatin may also bind the enzyme complex, C3bBb (6Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). In our back-to-back model of the MG-ring interaction in C3-C3bBb substrate-enzyme complex, compstatin might inhibit the interaction both ways, either through binding the substrate or through binding the enzyme complex. This additional mechanism may explain the higher inhibitory activity of compstatin in the alternative pathway when compared with the classical pathway (6Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar, 12Furlong S.T. Dutta A.S. Coath M.M. Gormley J.J. Hubbs S.J. Lloyd D. Mauger R.C. Strimpler A.M. Sylvester M.A. Scott C.W. Edwards P.D. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 48: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the classical pathway, compstatin can only bind to C3 and not to the convertase C4bC2a (28Sahu A. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas in the alternative pathway, compstatin can bind both the substrate C3 and the convertase C3bBb, thus possibly acting in a dual way. Thus, based on an interaction surface observed in C3b crystals and the interaction sites of compstatin and CRIg, we propose a model for C3 binding to the convertase. This model explains how a small peptide inhibitor, compstatin, has the same inhibitory effect as the large protein receptor CRIg. We have identified that the potential therapeutic compstatin binds C3 on a shallow groove between two domains of the β-chain. Most drug design projects target well defined pockets in proteins for binding low molecular weight inhibitors to achieve high binding affinity and specificity. Remarkably, compstatin binds on a rather flat surface of the C3c molecule. Nevertheless, it has been possible to improve the specific activity by structure-activity studies and experimental and theoretical combinatorial approaches (reviewed in Ref. 32Morikis D. Soulika A.M. Mallik B. Klepeis J.L. Floudas C.A. Lambris J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex between C3c and compstatin provides crucial information on the bound conformation of compstatin and the binding site on C3. These data provide new impetus to develop improved and less costly non-peptide inhibitors, for example, by developing molecules that structurally mimic the bound form of compstatin. The detailed knowledge of the binding site provides the possibility to develop a mouse model by conservatively “humanizing” mouse C3 to enable in vivo testing of complement inhibition of compstatin and derivatives in various complement disease models. Finally, the current data indicate a potential role for the large MG-ring of the β-chain in substrate binding to the convertase.

Here we have developed a cleavage assay using tagged annexin 1 and observed marked activity in the membrane fraction of activated neutrophils. A combination of inhibitors, transfected cells, and proteomic analyses allowed us to identify proteinase 3 as the main enzyme responsible for this cleavage in the N terminus region of the protein, at least in the context of neutrophil activation. Because annexin 1 is an important endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator, blocking its cleavage by proteinase 3 would augment its homeostatic pro-resolving actions and could represent an opportunity for innovative anti-inflammatory drug discovery.

Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Studies over the past 20 years have shown that AnxA1 acts as an endogenous down-regulator of blood neutrophils (PMN). AnxA1 released by these cells inhibits in a time-dependent fashion their interaction with activated endothelial cells (2Perretti M. Croxtall J.D. Wheller S.K. Goulding N.J. Hannon R. Flower R.J. Nat.

Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of animals with exogenous AnxA1 reduces PMN adhesion and emigration to inflamed vessels, thereby affecting leukocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation (4Lim L.H. Solito E.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The possibility that the actions of AnxA1 could be modulated in the microenvironment of an activated PMN has been scantly investigated. Association studies detected intact (37 kDa) and cleaved (33 kDa) AnxA1 proteins concomitant to elastase presence (6Smith S.F. Tetley T.D. Guz A. Flower R.J. Environ.

Biol. 1998; 18: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). AnxA1 cleavage also occurs following human PMN adhesion (2Perretti M. Croxtall J.D. Wheller S.K. Goulding N.J. Hannon R. Flower R.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), a process that activates protein externalization (8Perretti M. Christian H. Wheller S.K. Aiello I. Mugridge K.G. Morris J.F. Flower R.J. Goulding N.J. Cell Biol. Int. 2000; 24: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, the proteolytic action of human recombinant neutrophil elastase (HNE) on AnxA1 catabolism has been described (9Rescher U. Goebeler V. Wilbers A. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Proteinase 3 (PR3) is another serine protease expressed in neutrophil organelles, including secretory vesicles (10Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct regulatory roles have been ascribed to PR3, given its ability to modulate neutrophil cell differentiation (11Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E.

Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the wider distribution of PR3 in PMN membranes and organelles relative to HNE, mainly localized in azurophilic granules (14Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Witko-Sarsat V. Rieu P. Descamps-Latscha B. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Lab. Investig. 2000; 80: 617-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that PR3 could cleave AnxA1 in the PMN microenvironment. Here, we have devised a novel AnxA1 cleavage assay to compare (i) the effects of HNE and PR3 and (ii) the actions of enzyme inhibitors. The ultimate aim was to assess their contribution to AnxA1 cleavage in the context of cell activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture Conditions—The epithelial cell line HEK-293T (Amersham Biosciences) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 1 μg/ml Geneticin, and 50 μg/ml G418. The human mastocytic cell line (HMC1 or human mast cell clone 1) and clones overexpressing human PR3, inactive mutant PR3 (S203A), or HNE were cultured as previously described (16Witko-Sarsat V. Canteloup S. Durant S. Desdouets C. Chabernaud R. Lemarchand P. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47338-47347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).PMN Activation and Fractionation—PMN of healthy individuals were isolated by Hystopaque sedimentation as reported (2Perretti M. Croxtall J.D. Wheller S.K. Goulding N.J. Hannon R. Flower R.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In activation assays PMN (107 cells/ml) were incubated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. For preparation of whole cell lysates (WL), PMN were pelleted and resuspended (3 × 107/ml) in lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min. To obtain cytosolic (CYT) and membrane (MEM) fractions, cells (3 × 107/ml) were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, centrifuged briefly for 2 min at 300 × g, transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged again for 45 min at 800 × g. The resultant supernatant (cytosolic fraction, CYT) was collected and the remaining pellet resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, at 30 × 106 cells/ml for 15 min (membrane fraction, MEM). Membrane-bound AnxA1 was recovered by washing 3 × 106 pelleted cells twice with 50 μl of 1 mm ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). When purified PMN (107 cells/ml) were prepared for Western blot analysis only, a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors was added to the lysis buffers. Extracts for use in the cleavage assay (see below) were prepared in the absence of inhibitors.Construction of MF-AnxA1 Expression Vector and Cell Transfection—Total RNA from 10–15 × 106 HL-60 cells was extracted using the RNeasy® extraction kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturers' instructions. AnxA1 with c-Myc tagged on the N terminus and FLAG tagged on the C terminus (MF-AnxA1) was generated using the primers reported in the supplemental information. PCR products were cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). MF-AnxA1 (2 μg) was transfected into HEK-293T cells using 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 92 μl of OptiMEM™ (Invitrogen) culture medium for each well of a 6-well culture plate (containing 5 × 105 cells). After 24 h, cells from each well were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer and stored at -20 °C until further use. HMC1 cell lines were transfected with MF-AnxA1 by nucleofection (Amaxa GmbH). Briefly, 106 cells were nucleofected using 2 μg of plasmid DNA in supplemented Nucleofector Solution V. T-030 program was selected, and cells were incubated in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h prior to collection.AnxA1 Cleavage Assay—MF-AnxA1-transfected HEK-293T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-c-Myc-(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) -conjugated agarose beads overnight at 4 °C (20 μl of beads/reaction). The beads were washed three times with 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored on ice until further use. For the analysis of cleavage activity of cell lysates, extracts from PMN (104–106) or HMC1 cells (3 × 106) were diluted into a reaction volume 100 μl of Hanks' buffered salt solution with Ca2+/Mg2+ and added to the c-Myc IP containing intact MF-AnxA1. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and thereafter a mixture of protease inhibitors (see supplemental information) was added to prevent further proteolysis. The reaction mixture was then IP with anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads overnight at 4 °C, while the remaining pellet was boiled in 20 μl of 6× Laemmli buffer for 5 min. The anti-FLAG beads were subsequently washed and boiled (95 °C, 5 min) and samples subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Where purified PR3 (Elastin Products, Owensville, MO) or HNE (Elastin Products) were added to MF-AnxA1, this was done in 100 μl of Hanks' buffered salt solution with Ca2+/Mg2+. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (1 mm) or eglin C (0.1, 1 mm) was added to MEM fractions for 15 min at 37 °C prior to addition to the cleavage assay.Western Blot Analysis—Samples boiled in 6× Laemmli buffer were subjected to standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and electrophoretically blotted onto polyvinylidene diflouride membranes (Millipore, Watford, UK). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline solution containing Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed for 20 min with the solution changed at 5-min intervals and secondary antibodies and proteins detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit and visualized on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-AnxA1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Cambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz), and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used (polyclonal goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse) were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Cambridge, UK).MALDI-TOF Analysis of MF-AnxA1 N Terminus Fragments—MF-AnxA1 was incubated with PMN membrane fractions according to the cleavage assay. The c-Myc IP was washed with 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then eluted by competition with 50 μl (1 mg/ml) of c-Myc peptide (Sigma). The sample was subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis (Mass Spectrometry Facility School of Pharmacy, University of London, UK), run in positive mode (Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF).Confocal Microscopy—Resting or stimulated PMN (10 ng/ml TNF-α, 30 min at 37 °C) were adhered onto poly-l-lysine precoated coverslips and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde prior to permeabilization with either ice-cold methanol or streptolysin-O, as described (17Pederzoli M. Kantari C. Gausson V. Moriceau S. Witko-Sarsat V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6381-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primary and secondary antibodies were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-human PR3 (2 μg/ml; Sanquin) followed by ALEXA-488 anti-mouse IgG (6.7 μg/ml; Molecular Probes); mouse monoclonal anti-HNE (25 μg/ml; Biogenesis) followed by ALEXA-488 anti-mouse IgG; mouse rabbit polyclonal anti-human AnxA1 (1:50 dilution; Zymed Laboratories) followed by ALEXA-555 anti-rabbit IgG (13.3 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted using Permafluor mounting medium (Dako) and analyzed by confocal microscopy with a Zeiss LSM-5 confocal scanning laser microscope as previously described (17Pederzoli M. Kantari C. Gausson V. Moriceau S. Witko-Sarsat V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6381-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).RESULTSLocalization and Cleavage of Endogenous AnxA1 in Human PMN—PMN activation or adhesion induces AnxA1 externalization onto the membrane and simultaneous release in the extracellular milieu (2Perretti M. Croxtall J.D. Wheller S.K. Goulding N.J. Hannon R. Flower R.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, in resting PMN AnxA1 was localized predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 1A, CYT). Upon PMN activation with TNF-α, the protein was markedly mobilized onto the membrane fraction (Fig. 1B, MEM) and secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the 37-kDa intact AnxA1 form was detected in the whole lysate of resting cells while it was clipped into the 33-kDa form upon treatment with TNF-α (Fig. 1, A and B, WL).To determine the cellular compartment where the protein is clipped, we isolated the CYT and MEM fractions; stimulation with TNF-α mobilized the protein onto the membrane, where it was present as a clipped form (Fig. 1B, 33 kDa). Importantly, elution of membrane-bound AnxA1 with two consecutive washes of EDTA (E1 and E2) resulted in both intact and clipped AnxA1 being recovered from stimulated PMN, compared with control unstimulated cells where only modest levels of the intact form were detected (Fig. 1D). Together, these results indicate AnxA1 to be present in the cytosol predominantly as an N-terminal-intact 37-kDa species. In response to cell stimulation, the protein translocates to the membrane compartment, where it is cleaved and released as an N-terminal-clipped 33-kDa species.AnxA1 Cleavage Assay—A number of studies over the past ten years have suggested that AnxA1 is cleaved at the N terminus during inflammatory conditions (6Smith S.F. Tetley T.D. Guz A. Flower R.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 85: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Tsao F.H. Meyer K.C. Chen X. Rosenthal N.S. Hu J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To isolate and identify the enzyme(s) responsible for this cleavage we developed an “AnxA1 cleavage assay.” To discern endogenous from exogenous AnxA1, a double-tagged protein derivative with a c-Myc tag on the N terminus and a FLAG tag on the C terminus was cloned (MF-AnxA1; see schematic in Fig. 2A). This construct was transfected into HEK-293T cells and further purified from the cell lysates by IP. MF-AnxA1 was then used as an in vitro substrate to identify PMN cellular fractions containing “cleavage activity” (Fig. 2B). At the end of the reaction, the “clipped forms” were isolated by IP for the relative tags (c-Myc for the N terminus and FLAG for the C terminus). As shown in Fig. 2C, transfection of MF-AnxA1 into HEK-293T cells and analysis of the whole cell lysate (pre-IP) for the c-Myc or FLAG tags yielded a single band of ∼45 kDa (37 kDa of the full-length protein plus the c-Myc and FLAG tags) in the c-Myc blot and a double band of 45 and 41 kDa in the FLAG blot, corresponding to the intact (37-kDa) and clipped (33-kDa) forms of AnxA1, respectively. IP of cell lysates with c-Myc-conjugated agarose beads and immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc or anti-FLAG detected a single N terminus-intact form (Fig. 2C). Conversely, IP with FLAG-conjugated agarose beads and immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc or anti-FLAG showed a single and a double band, respectively (Fig. 2C). This demonstrates that IP of the FLAG tag recovers both intact and clipped MF-AnxA1, whereas IP of the c-Myc tag enables isolation of the intact form only. We next incubated MF-AnxA1 (purified from HEK-293 cell lysates) with distinct PMN extracts. As shown in Fig. 2D, addition of non-stimulated PMN WL resulted in loss of c-Myc immunoreactivity. Collection and IP of the reaction buffer with anti-FLAG beads, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Myc (Fig. 2D, middle panel) or anti-FLAG (Fig. 2D, right panel) detected a single 41-kDa FLAG-positive but c-Myc-negative band. This corresponds to the clipped 33-kDa AnxA1 fragment, suggesting that cleavage occurs at the N terminus. Addition of the PMN CYT fraction had minimal cleavage activity, as the intact MF-AnxA1 was still detected. Importantly, and in line with the profile of endogenous AnxA1, the majority of PMN cleavage activity measured in the WL appears to be derived from the MEM fraction. Here, c-Myc immunoreactivity was absent (Fig. 2D, IP with c-Myc), while the N terminus-cleaved 41-kDa portion was present in the wash (Fig. 2D, IP with FLAG). The validation of the cleavage assay was achieved by testing commercial preparations of purified HNE and PR3. Supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, shows that either enzyme was able to produce a concentration-dependent disappearance of c-Myc immunoreactivity within the 30-min reaction time, but PR3 appeared to be more efficient when concentrations were compared.FIGURE 2AnxA1-specific proteolytic activity resides in the membrane fraction of human PMN. A, schematic representation of MF-AnxA1 and fragments resulting from proteolysis. B, depiction of the AnxA1 cleavage assay. PMN fractions (WL, CYT, MEM) were incubated with MF-AnxA1 for 30 min at 37 °C (left). Intact MF-AnxA1 could be recovered from the reaction mixture by analysis of the c-Myc IP (right), while N terminus-cleaved MF-AnxA1 could be recovered by IP for FLAG (far right). C, HEK-293T cells were transfected with MF-AnxA1. Cell lysates were IP for c-Myc or FLAG epitopes and immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc (left panel) or anti-FLAG (right panel). D, resting PMN-derived cell fractions were incubated with MF-AnxA1 (input) and assessed for AnxA1-specific proteolytic activity using the cleavage assay described above. Intact MF-AnxA1 was obtained by recovering the c-Myc IP and immunoblotting for c-Myc (left panel). N-terminal-cleaved MF-AnxA1 fragments were obtained by IP for FLAG and immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc (middle panel) or anti-FLAG (right panel) antibodies.

Here, MALDI-TOF analysis revealed three major peptides of masses 2436, 3900, and 5186 Da (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2). Comparison of the mass of these peptides with the known AnxA1 N terminus sequence suggested the presence of major cleavage sites occurring at Ala11, Val22, and Val36.TABLE 1N terminus-located MF-AnxA1 fragments cleaved by the PMN membrane fraction MF-AnxA1 was eluted from c-Myc-conjugated agarose beads and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis.

The ability of the PMN MEM fraction to cleave MF-AnxA1 was specific because addition of the denatured fraction (boiled at 95 °C for 5 min) did not produce any effect (Fig. 3A). Moreover, MEM fraction activity was blocked by preincubation with PMSF, a pan-inhibitor of serine proteases, but not by other protease inhibitors, including aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Thus, PMSF, at a concentration active in blocking the cleavage effect of purified HNE and PR3 (Fig. 3B), reverted the cleavage of the N-terminal tag by MEM fraction, also apparent by the recovery of the intact 45-kDa species (Fig. 3, A and C).FIGURE 3Abrogation of AnxA1 proteolysis by a serine-type protease inhibitor. A, MF-AnxA1 (input) was incubated with resting PMN-derived membrane (MEM) fractions in the absence or presence of phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF, 1 mm) or heat-inactivated samples (boil). B, MF-AnxA1 (input) was incubated with 50 milliunits of HNE (left panel) or 10 milliunits of PR3 (right panel), treated with/without 1 mm PMSF or 0.1–1 mm eglin C. C, as in panel A, PMN-derived membrane (MEM) fractions were incubated with 1 mm PMSF or 0.1–1 mm eglin C. In all cases, intact MF-AnxA1 was recovered and immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc antibody (upper panels) and resultant N-terminal-cleaved proteolytic fragments obtained by IP and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (lower panels). Blots are representative from at least three distinct experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A hint toward the identification of the catabolic enzyme present in MEM fractions was obtained by the ineffectiveness of eglin C; this inhibitor, active in blocking HNE, but not PR3 actions (Fig. 3B), did not significantly affect the endogenous MEM activity (Fig. 3C). To further demonstrate the specificity of PR3 cleavage, we used HMC1 cells stably transfected with active PR3, the inactive mutant S203A, or HNE (16Witko-Sarsat V. Canteloup S. Durant S. Desdouets C. Chabernaud R. Lemarchand P. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47338-47347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transfection with the MF-AnxA1 construct led to equivalent expression of the protein, which was, however, markedly degraded on its N terminus only in PR3/HMC1 cells, as detected following IP with c-Myc (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of MF-AnxA1 in cells transfected with PR3 resulted in the loss of both the c-Myc (Fig. 4A, top panel) and FLAG tags (bottom panel). Absence of the 41-kDa fragment likely results from the dynamic effect of constitutively active PR3 with excess substrate degradation and possibly release of small fragments into the cell supernatant. Finally, these data were validated in the in vitro assay whereby addition of cell lysates from untransfected HMC1 cells (control) or S203A mutant did not reduce immunoreactivity for intact 45-kDa MF-AnxA1, whereas PR3/HMC1 and HNE/HMC1 cell extracts clipped, although to a different extent, the c-Myc N terminus portion of the substrate (Fig. 4B, top panel). Analysis of FLAG immunoreactivity showed recovery of the 41-kDa clipped fragment (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). These results highlight the difference between the in vivo and in vitro settings, where only PR3 cleaves AnxA1 in intact cells. Therefore, colocalization, rather than substrate specificity, dictates the bone fide AnxA1 catabolic enzyme. To verify this point in the context of PMN biology, we next conducted confocal microscopy analyses chasing AnxA1, PR3, and HNE.FIGURE 4N-terminal proteolysis of MF-AnxA1 by PR3 in HMC1 cells. A, HMC1 cells (control, PR3, PR3 mutant S203A, and HNE) were transfected with MF-AnxA1. After 24 h cell lysates were immunoblotted for c-Myc (upper panel) and FLAG (lower panel) with anti-c-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. B, extracts prepared from control, PR3, PR3 mutant S203A, and HNE cells were processed and incubated with MF-AnxA1 (input). Intact MF-AnxA1 (upper panel) and N-terminal-cleaved fragments (lower panel) were obtained as described above. Blots are representative from at least three distinct experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Endogenous AnxA1 and PR3 Localization in Resting and Stimulated PMN—The localization of endogenous AnxA1 and PR3 (and HNE, for comparative purposes) was monitored in resting and stimulated PMN. Cell treatment with streptolysin-O, which leads to controlled plasma membrane permeabilization allowing access only to extra-granular proteins in the PMN, revealed a high degree of overlay between the staining obtained for AnxA1 and PR3 in resting PMN (Fig. 5A). This is likely to reflect membrane co-localization and, of importance, it was augmented after cell incubation with TNF-α (Fig. 5B). Subjecting the cells to total permeabilization procedure (methanol treatment) confirmed a high degree of co-localization between the two stainings. In contrast, when cells were prepared either with streptolysin-O or methanol treatment, minimal or no co-localization between AnxA1 and HNE staining was detected ( supplemental Fig. S3).FIGURE 5Localization of endogenous AnxA1 and PR3 in resting and activated PMN. PMN were incubated in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min at 37 °C before being subjected to treatment with streptolysin-O (SLO) or methanol (metOH) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Staining with anti-AnxA1 or anti-PR3 antibodies is shown, including the overlay panels on the right-hand side, showing a high degree of co-localization between the two proteins in either PMN state.

Analyses of AnxA1 localization in both resting and activated PMN, in relation to the different protein species (intact and cleaved), identified a link between AnxA1 N terminus cleavage and the simultaneous process of cell activation. This link was centered on PR3.At least three pools of AnxA1 are known to exist in leukocytes: a cytosolic pool, a membrane-bound pool sensitive to elution by di-cation chelators such as EDTA, and a membrane pool resistant to EDTA washes (18Flower R.J. Rothwell N.J. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1994; 15: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Peers S.H. Smillie F. Elderfield A.J. Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In resting PMN, the majority of AnxA1 is localized to the gelatinase granules (8Perretti M. Christian H. Wheller S.K.

Wheller S.K. Goulding N.J. Hannon R. Flower R.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we found that while resting PMN contained only intact AnxA1 mainly localized within the cell cytosol, as a result of PMN activation the 37-kDa species was both externalized and processed into a 33-kDa fragment. The latter event is likely explained by mobilization of subcellular organelles that act as a store for proteases that only become membrane-expressed upon translocation during cell activation. Interestingly, analysis of the conditioned medium revealed both intact and clipped forms of the protein to be present irrespective of the treatment group, indicating the inherent ability for AnxA1 to be cleaved at the level of the cell membrane once mobilized in this microenvironment. Together these results indicate that a protease, localized to the membrane fraction of the PMN, may be responsible for the cleavage of the intact AnxA1 to form the characteristic 37/33-kDa doublet.To track down the protease(s), we developed a cleavage assay where a double-tagged recombinant"

In this study, a tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry strategy was developed for the isolation of complexes formed by Ikaros and by Helios, a T-cell-restricted member of the Ikaros family that remains largely uncharacterized.

In extracts from a murine thymocyte line, Ikaros and Helios associated under moderate stringency conditions only with other members of the Ikaros family. However, under low stringency conditions, both tagged proteins assembled into higher molecular weight complexes. Mass spectrometry revealed that both proteins associated predominantly with subunits of NuRD, an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex implicated in transcriptional repression and activation and previously reported to associate with Ikaros. Further analysis of the affinity-purified Ikaros revealed that several serines and threonines are phosphorylated in the thymocyte line, with apparent changes upon thymocyte maturation. These results support the hypothesis that the NuRD complex makes major contributions to the functions of both Ikaros and Helios and that the activities of these proteins may be regulated in part by changes in phosphorylation.

Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to most blood-cell lineages through a developmental program regulated by numerous extracellular signals and transcriptional regulators whose precise functions are rapidly being elucidated. The sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Ikaros is one of the critical regulators of many different stages of hematopoiesis (1Smale S.T. Dorshkind K. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the gene encoding Ikaros can contribute to leukemogenesis and lymphomagenesis, usually in combination with activating mutations of Notch1 (2Dumortier A. Jeannet R. Kirstetter P. Kleinmann E. Sellars M. Dos Santos N.R. Thibault C. Barths J. Ghysdael J. Punt J.A. Kastner P. Chan S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ikaros is the founding member of a family of five proteins that exhibit homology within two distinct zinc finger domains. Near its N terminus, full-length Ikaros contains four C2H2 zinc fingers that are responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding. At the C terminus, two additional C2H2 fingers support homodimerization, heterodimerization with other family members, and multimerization (3Molnar A. Wu P. Largespada D.A. Vortkamp A. Scherer S.

Cell. 2003; 11: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing leads to the production of smaller isoforms of Ikaros, most of which lack portions of the DNA-binding zinc-finger domain (5Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Three of the Ikaros family members, Ikaros, Aiolos, and Helios, are expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, whereas the other two members, Eos and Pegasus, are expressed more broadly (7Kelley C.M. Ikeda T. Koipally J. Avitahl N. Wu L. Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 508-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Georgopoulos K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Ikaros and Aiolos are expressed in most hematopoietic cells, whereas Helios is expressed primarily in T-lineage cells and early multipotential precursors (7Kelley C.M. Ikeda T. Koipally J. Avitahl N. Wu L. Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 508-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although Ikaros proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and mice lacking Ikaros and Aiolos have been extensively studied (8Georgopoulos K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the intracellular functions of proteins within this family have not been clearly established. Mechanistic insights have emerged from four different directions. First, studies of the subnuclear localization of Ikaros revealed that, in interphase cells, Ikaros proteins localize primarily to foci of pericentromeric heterochromatin (10Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Because silent genes co-localize with Ikaros at these foci, it has been hypothesized that Ikaros proteins may regulate gene silencing and perhaps contribute to the recruitment of silent genes to the pericentromeric foci (10Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Second, studies of potential Ikaros target genes have suggested roles in both repression and activation. Mutations in Ikaros binding sites in the Dntt and Igll1 (λ5) promoters in stable transfection and transgenic mouse experiments have suggested important roles in transcriptional repression during lymphocyte development (11Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahm K. Ernst P. Garraway I.P. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1817-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Sabbattini P. Lundgren M. Georgiou A. Chow C. Warnes G. Dillon N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, an analysis of Cd8a expression in Ikaros-null mice suggested a role in gene activation, with additional support for this hypothesis provided by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (13Harker N. Naito T. Cortes M. Hostert A. Hirschberg S. Tolaini M. Roderick K. Georgopoulos K. Kioussis D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1403-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additional mechanistic insights have emerged from the identification of proteins that associate with Ikaros. In yeast two-hybrid screens, Ikaros associated with Mi-2α, a catalytic subunit of the NuRD ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex (14Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller E. Winandy S. Viel A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The Ikaros-NuRD interaction was validated by co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal binding protein, CtBP (16Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), have been observed. However, unlike the Ikaros-NuRD and Ikaros-BRG1 interactions, the Ikaros-Sin3 and Ikaros-CtBP interactions were confirmed primarily by overexpression of Ikaros or the co-repressor. The fourth approach used to obtain mechanistic insight has been to study post-translational modifications of Ikaros. Because Ikaros is abundantly expressed throughout hematopoiesis, it has been hypothesized that post-translational modifications may regulate its functions. Indeed, specific phosphorylation events have been found to inactivate Ikaros during the G2-M transition (17Dovat S. Ronni T. Russell D. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and regulate its functions during the G1-S transition (18Gomez-del Arco P. Maki K. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sumoylation has also been reported to regulate the functions of Ikaros (19Gomez-del Arco P. Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2688-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite the progress described above, the mechanisms by which Ikaros contributes to development and oncogenesis remain poorly understood. At the biochemical level, one major deficiency is that multiprotein complexes formed by Ikaros have not been purified and characterized. Purification of Ikaros complexes is necessary to gain insight into the relative importance of the interacting proteins that have been described, and to determine whether additional interacting proteins were missed in previous studies. To this end, we developed a novel tandem affinity purification (TAP) strategy for the purification of both Ikaros and Helios complexes. This strategy was necessary because Ikaros and Helios do not form complexes with other proteins of sufficient stability to survive high stringency washes, necessitating the development of a low stringency purification strategy. The TAP strategy that was developed may be broadly useful for tandem affinity purification in mammalian cells, especially when low stringency conditions are required. The results obtained provide strong support for the hypothesis that the NuRD complex is the predominant interaction partner of both Ikaros and Helios. With the availability of highly purified Ikaros, we were also in a position to use mass spectrometry to identify sites of phosphorylation, revealing a number of Ikaros phosphoacceptors that may help regulate its functions during hematopoiesis and oncogenesis. Cells, Plasmids, and Retroviruses—The double positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocyte line, VL3-3M2 (20Groves T. Katis P. Madden Z. Manickam K. Ramsden D. Wu G. Guidos C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5011-5022PubMed Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Stimulation was carried out with PMA and ionomycin as described previously (21Su R.C. Brown K.E. Saaber S. Fisher A.G. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Oligonucleotides encoding the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site and calmodulin binding peptide were annealed and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing sequences encoding two adjacent FLAG epitope tags. Helios, Ikaros, HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ cDNAs were cloned in-frame and downstream of the tag. Hence, the tag is at the N terminus of the expressed protein. The entire FLAG-TEV-CBP-cDNA (FTC-cDNA) construct was inserted into the pMSCV-IRES-pac retroviral vector. Retrovirus was prepared by transient transfection of HEK 293T cells as described (22Cobb B.S.

Helper viruses used for infecting VL3-3M2 cells and 3T3 cells were pCL10A1 and pCLEco, respectively (11Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahm K. Ernst P. Garraway I.P. Merkenschlager M.

Stable lines were generated in VL3-3M2 cells by spin infection. 2 × 105 cells in log phase were infected with 1 ml of retroviral supernatant by centrifugation for 1 h at 2500 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge at 30 °C. After the viral supernatant was removed, the cells were resuspended in RPMI with supplements and aliquoted into a 96-well plate. After 1 day, cells were selected in 1 μg/ml puromycin until single colonies were observed. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Gel Filtration Chromatography—Nuclear extracts were prepared by osmotic swelling and Dounce homogenization as described (23Lo K. Landau N.R. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nuclear extraction in the presence of DNase I was carried out as described (24Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J.

Dialysis was carried out in dialysis cassettes (Pierce) with a 3500 molecular weight cutoff for a total of 12 h with two buffer exchanges, into Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2) at 0.15 m KCl supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Complete EDTA free), in a volume 100 times that of the sample at 4 °C. Gel filtration was carried out in a prepacked Superose 6 column as described (9Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) with the following changes: The input volume was 200 μl (protein concentration, ∼4 μg/μl), and the column was equilibrated with Buffer D at the indicated concentration of KCl or with TEV digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). In some experiments, fractions were concentrated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (Fisher). TAP and Mass Spectrometry—40 mg of nuclear extract supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and, where required, phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), in a 10-ml volume, were incubated with 200 μl of FLAG-M2-agarose beads (Sigma, 50% slurry) that had been equilibrated in nuclear extract buffer. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted at 700 rpm in a table top centrifuge for 5 min. Beads were washed two times for 5 min each at 4 °C with 10 ml of nuclear extract buffer. Beads were then washed twice (1 ml each) with TEV digestion buffer, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and resuspended in 1 ml of TEV digestion buffer supplemented with 100 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen). Digestion was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were pelleted and the supernatant was transferred to a micro-centrifuge tube containing pre-equilibrated calmodulin beads and supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm imidazole, and 1 mm MgOAc. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, beads were pelleted and washed four times in calmodulin binding buffer (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat.

Beads were then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and elutes were resolved by SDS-PAGE (9%) followed by silver staining. SYPRO-Ruby (Molecular Probes) or Colloidal Blue (Bio-Rad) staining were carried out according to manufacturer's instructions. Mass spectrometry was carried out at the HHMI mass spectrometry facility at UC Berkeley, Midwest Bioservices, and the Taplin mass spectrometry facility at Harvard Medical School.

CtBP (07-306) and p66 (07-365) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology; MTA1 (sc10813) and TIF1β (sc 19168) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the RbAp48 (ab 3536) antibody was from Abcam, and the Reptin (612482) antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. To confirm protein-protein interactions by immunoblot, the inputs and flow-through fractions from each column were incubated in primary antibody at 1:500 dilution overnight in 5% milk. The lanes containing the eluates were excised after transfer and incubated in primary antibody at 1:50 dilution. Confocal Microscopy—Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (22Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), except that 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline was used for fixation and 0.1% Triton X-100 was used for permeabilization. Ikaros and Helios Form a Stable Core Complex That Contains Only Ikaros Family Members—We previously used Ikaros antibodies to purify Ikaros complexes by immunoaffinity chromatography from the RLm11 thymocyte line, which expresses abnormally high concentrations of small Ikaros isoforms (9Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After washing the immunoaffinity columns at high stringency (1 m KCl) and eluting the complexes with high pH, analysis by SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining revealed the presence of Ikaros isoforms and Helios. However, no other proteins co-purified with Ikaros. We reasoned that the absence of co-purifying proteins may be due to 1) the abnormally high abundance of Ikaros in the RLm11 line, 2) the aberrant expression of small Ikaros isoforms, or 3) the use of high stringency wash conditions for purification. The first two possibilities were eliminated when we repeated the procedure using extracts from cell lines that express the largest Ikaros isoforms (i.e. the isoforms that are normally expressed in primary thymocytes) at concentrations comparable to those found in primary thymocytes. 3R. Sridharan and S. T. Smale, unpublished results. Importantly, co-purifying proteins were absent when Ikaros was immunoaffinity purified using antibodies directed against its N terminus, C terminus, or DNA-binding domain, 3R. Sridharan and S. T. Smale, unpublished results. ruling out the possibility that the antibodies disrupted important interactions. Unfortunately, efforts to purify complexes under low stringency conditions when using anti-Ikaros immunoaffinity columns failed because of the high abundance of proteins that associated nonspecifically with Ikaros or with the column resin under low stringency conditions. To purify Ikaros complexes under reduced stringency conditions, we developed a two-step TAP procedure. The classic TAP tag procedure developed for the purification of multiprotein complexes in yeast makes use of a tag containing protein A followed by a TEV protease cleavage site followed by calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). In the classic procedure, a DNA sequence encoding the two tags and the intervening protease cleavage site is fused to the 5′-end of the cDNA of interest. The tagged protein and associated proteins are then purified by binding to an immunoglobulin column followed by efficient elution from the column by TEV protease cleavage. Further purification is then achieved by binding to a calmodulin column. Although the above procedure has been highly successful in yeast, it appears to be less desirable for use in mammalian cells, in part because of the large size of the tag (137, 7, and 26 amino acids for the protein A, TEV protease cleavage site, and CBP site, respectively). For Ikaros in particular, we have found that large tags on either the N terminus or C terminus destabilize the protein (data not shown). For this reason, we developed a modified TAP procedure that makes use of a smaller double FLAG tag in place of protein A. For this strategy, we prepared a pcDNA3-based expression vector in which a translation initiation codon preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence was used to direct synthesis of a tag containing two FLAG epitopes (double FLAG tag), followed by the TEV protease cleavage site and the 26-residue CBP (Fig. 1A). Restriction enzyme recognition sequences that can be used for the in-frame insertion of the cDNA of interest follow the CBP-coding sequence. After insertion of the cDNA, the entire coding sequence can be transferred to a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector, which includes a puromycin-resistance gene separated from the cDNA of interest by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Fig. 1A). Purification of proteins tagged with the double FLAG-TEV-CBP (FTC) peptide relies on serial chromatography of nuclear extracts using first a FLAG immunoaffinity column and then a second calmodulin affinity column. Elution from the anti-FLAG column is performed by cleavage with the TEV protease. As with the conventional TAP tag procedure, elution by TEV protease cleavage offers the advantages of extremely high efficiency elution and mild (low stringency) elution conditions. The resulting eluate is further purified using the calmodulin column, which binds CBP with high affinity in the presence of divalent calcium (Ca2+) ions. After binding to the calmodulin column and washing, the final elute is obtained by chelation of the calcium ions with EGTA. Alternatively, prior to SDS-PAGE, the calmodulin beads can be boiled in SDS sample buffer. A cDNA for mouse Ikaros isoform VI was inserted into the pcDNA3 FTC vector and the FTC-Ikaros cassette was transferred to the retroviral vector. A cDNA for mouse Helios was also inserted because Helios-interacting proteins have not previously been pursued. Clonal lines expressing FTC-Ikaros and FTC-Helios were generated in the mouse VL3-3M2 thymocyte line (20Groves T. Katis P. Madden Z. Manickam K. Ramsden D. Wu G. Guidos C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5011-5022PubMed Google Scholar). This line was chosen because it is representative of CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes, in terms of general gene expression profile and expression of Ikaros isoforms. Furthermore, it has been carefully characterized by Guidos and colleagues (20Groves T. Katis P. Madden Z. Manickam K. Ramsden D. Wu G. Guidos C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5011-5022PubMed Google Scholar) and is capable of undergoing early stages of thymocyte-positive selection following T-cell receptor engagement or treatment with PMA and ionomycin. Immunoblot analysis of several clonal lines revealed that FTC-Ikaros was generally expressed at concentrations comparable to that of endogenous Ikaros (Fig. 1D and data not shown). FTC-Helios was usually overexpressed relative to endogenous Helios (Fig. 1C), which we previously had found to be less abundant than endogenous Ikaros (9Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similar to endogenous Ikaros and Helios, both FTC-Ikaros and FTC-Helios were observed at distinct foci in VL3-3M2 nuclei by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B). On the basis of previous studies (10Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), these foci correspond to pericentromeric heterochromatin. Localization to the pericentromeric foci was observed using antibodies against Ikaros, Helios, or the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1B). Gel-filtration chromatography of nuclear extracts from the clonal lines revealed that FTC-Ikaros and FTC-Helios co-migrate with their endogenous counterparts, suggesting that they assemble into comparable complexes. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), gel filtration was performed in a buffer containing 0.42 m KCl, which was the same buffer used to elute the proteins from the cell nuclei. Under these conditions, the tagged and endogenous proteins eluted in broad peaks in close proximity to the 669 kDa molecular mass marker, although some variability was observed from experiment to experiment. These results suggest that the tagged proteins and endogenous proteins are incorporated into similar complexes. To determine the composition of proteins in these complexes, FTC-Ikaros and FTC-Helios within the 0.42 m KCl extracts were purified by the TAP procedure. In these experiments, the FLAG antibody column was washed with a 0.42 m KCl buffer and the calmodulin column was washed with a 0.15 m NaCl buffer. The immunoblots in Fig. 2A reveal that the tagged proteins bound with high efficiency to the FLAG antibody and calmodulin columns. The reduced size of the proteins (CBP-Ikaros and CBP-Helios) following elution from the FLAG column using TEV protease is also readily apparent. As a control, extracts from VL3-3M2 cells lacking FTC-tagged proteins were subjected in parallel to the same purification procedure (not shown). Associated proteins were eluted from the calmodulin resin by boiling in SDS sample buffer, which was found to be more efficient than elution in EGTA. Eluates from the anti-FLAG column and calmodulin column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 2, B and C). Mass spectrometry was then used to identify protein bands that were consistently observed in the FTC-Ikaros or FTC-Helios final eluates but not in the control VL3-3M2 eluates. The results revealed that the FTC-Ikaros and FTC-Helios complexes purified in the presence of 0.42 m KCl contained primarily Ikaros family members (Fig. 2, B and C). Proteins detected included the CBP-Ikaros and CBP-Helios proteins in their respective samples, endogenous Ikaros isoforms VI and V (the two predominant isoforms expressed in VL3-3M2 cells), Aiolos, and Helios. All other detectable bands (dots in Fig. 2C) were usually observed in the control VL3-3M2 eluates or were not obtained consistently and therefore were considered to be contaminants. Gel filtration was used to determine whether the purified complexes that contain only Ikaros family members continue to co-migrate with high molecular weight markers. Eluates of the calmodulin column unfortunately could not be analyzed by gel filtration because the use of sample buffer for elution disrupted the complexes. However, an analysis of CBP-Ikaros from the anti-FLAG eluate revealed that the tagged protein and associated endogenous Ikaros migrated between the 442- and 669-kDa markers, suggesting that the complex is only slightly smaller than that observed in the nuclear extracts. Because dimers of Ikaros family members would have molecular masses of on"

Intriguingly, specific functions have not been ascribed for GFAP, despite, for instance, evidence for increased GFAP mRNA in Alzheimer disease and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and decreased GFAP levels in Down syndrome (2Eng L.F.

Mutations in the GFAP gene are believed to cause a fatal condition, Alexander disease. However, it is not known how expression of the mutant GFAP protein leads to brain damage (3Messing A. Brenner M. Glia. 2003; 43: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analyses of brains from GFAP knock-out mice suggest that glutamate transport activity is reduced (4Hughes E.G. Maguire J.L.

The plasmalemmal glutamate transporters, including GLAST and GLT-1, which are expressed by astrocytes in the brain, normally act to maintain low extracellular levels of glutamate (5Danbolt N.C.

Glutamate has the potential to act as a potent excitotoxin when present at high concentrations or for long periods in the extracellular space, causing excessive activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors; thus it is a major contributing factor in hypoxia-related brain injury (8Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Choi D.W. Rothman S.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar, 10Jensen F.E.

Because GFAP is expressed by astrocytes and because it appears to influence glutamate transport capacity, we hypothesized that glutamate transporters might be linked to the astrocyte cytoskeleton. Hypoxia is a major cause of brain damage, especially in neonates, much of which is mediated by glutamate excitotoxicity (13Johnston M.V. Trescher W.H. Ishida A. Nakajima W. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 14Johnston M.V. Nakajima W. Hagberg H. Neuroscientist. 2002; 8: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that hypoxic insults cause region-specific damage to the neonatal pig brain and that the patterns of cellular damage are in precise topographical register with the patterns of loss of GLAST (15Pow D.V. Naidoo T. Lingwood B.E. Healy G.N. Williams S.M. Sullivan R.K.P. O'Driscoll S. Colditz P.B. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 153: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There is currently no known reason why astrocytes in some brain regions would lose their glutamate transporters whereas others do not. In this study, we examined the potential relationship between GFAP and GLAST using multiple methods. We have used co-immunoprecipitation to identify potential binding partners of GFAP in the brain and transfection studies to characterize the functional consequences of interactions on transport activity. Finally, we have examined the topographic co-expression of these proteins in the hypoxically insulted brain. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) guidelines and the Queensland Protection of Animals Act. This legislation accords with and exceeds the ethical requirements of National Institutes of Health guidelines. All studies were approved by the University of Queensland or University of Newcastle Animal Ethics Committees. Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from the University of Newcastle or University of Queensland animal breeding facilities. Male and female piglets (Landrace X Large White) were obtained from The University of Queensland piggeries on the day of birth. For ethical reasons, all hypoxia experiments were performed on anesthetized animals; thereafter, the animals were allowed to recover consciousness. Antibodies—The GLAST, GLT-1α, and GLT-1b antibodies used in this study have been extensively characterized in previous studies, including pig (15Pow D.V. Naidoo T. Lingwood B.E. Healy G.N.

Mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody was purchased from Sigma or Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-ezrin was purchased from Invitrogen. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of NHERF1 (a gift from Dr. C. Yun) was used as previously described (17Lee A. Rayfield A. Hryciw D. Ma T.A. Pow D.V. Broer S. Yun C. Poronnik P. Glia. 2007; 55: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Lysate Preparation—Brain tissues were isolated from rats or pigs that had been euthanized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Rat brain tissues were homogenized in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 7.7 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Pig brain tissues were homogenized in immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). After gentle rotation for 3 h at 4 °C, homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the supernatant collected. GFAP Immunoprecipitation in Rat Brain—Brain lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics) for 3 h at 4 °C and incubated with anti-GFAP or IgG overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads were added and the samples incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The protein G-agarose was then gently washed five times in IP lysis buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the pellet and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie blue to visualize all potential binding partners of GFAP. Rat Brain Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting— Rat brain co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the Profound Mammalian Co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies (against GLAST, GLT-1α, GLT-1b, NHERF1, ezrin, or GFAP) were covalently immobilized to an AminoLink® coupling gel that was subsequently packed onto a spin column. Rabbit/mouse IgG was used as a control. Rat brain total lysate was subjected to the column and incubated with gentle mixing overnight at 4 °C to allow binding of the antigen to the immobilized antibody. After several wash steps with IP lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated complex was eluted from the column by addition of ImmunoPure IgG elution buffer and directly resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) by electroblotting and incubated with appropriate antibodies (against GLAST, GLT-1α, GLT-1b, NHERF1, ezrin, or GFAP) overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat milk, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 306 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. The membrane was washed four times with Tris-NaCl-Tween buffer, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (Pierce), and washed again. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce). Pig Brain Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting— Pig brain lysates were precleared with Protein G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics) for 3 h at 4 °C and incubated with anti-GFAP or a non-relevant antibody control (anti-green fluorescent protein) overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads were added and the samples incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The protein G-agarose was then gently washed five times in IP lysis buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the pellet and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoblotting for pig brain samples was performed as for the rat brain samples described above. Cell Culture and Transfection—293FT packaging cells (Invitrogen) were grown and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 6 mm l-glutamine, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin in a 5% CO2 environment. COS7 cells were grown and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 environment. For d-aspartate uptake studies, COS7 cells were plated in 12-well dishes. At 70–80% confluency, the cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 (control) or pcDNA3.1:GFAP (a kind gift from Dr. Michael Brenner, University of Alabama) plus either pGLAST or pGLASTΔpdz by using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). The transfected COS7 cells were cultured for 3–4 days before performing d-aspartate uptake assays (described below). pGLASTΔpdz was a GLAST C-terminal deletion mutant without the PDZ binding motif (ETKM) and was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) from the wild-type pGLAST construct. The effective transfection and high level of expression were verified by Western blot analysis. Lentivirus Production and Infection of COS7 Cells—The shRNA Constructs (TRCN0000068583, TRCN0000068584, TRCN0000068585, TRCN0000068586, and TRCN-0000068587) for NHERF1 knock down were obtained from The RNAi Consortium via Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Five pre-made constructs were obtained and tested to identify those able to achieve efficient knock down at the protein level. The negative control construct in the same vector system (vector alone) was also obtained from The RNAi Consortium via Open Biosystems. The lentiviral packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2G were obtained from Dr. Didier Trono (School of Life Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland). To prepare virus stocks, 293FT cells were co-transfected with shRNA constructs, together with psPAX2 and pMD2G constructs (4:3:1 ratio, respectively), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The medium was changed after 24 h, and virus-containing medium was collected after 36–48 h. The viral stocks were centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to remove any nonadherent 293FT cells. Cultures of COS7 cells or transfected COS7 cells were infected with a mixture of 0.5 ml of shRNA lentivirus-containing medium and 0.5 ml of regular medium. The medium was changed 24 h post-infection and replaced with regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. d-Aspartate Uptake Assays—COS7 cells were washed twice with transport buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 4.5 g/liter of glucose. COS7 cells were then incubated in transport buffer containing [3H]d-aspartate (Amersham Biosciences) and 5 μm unlabeled d-aspartate for 10 min at 25 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold transport buffer in which NaCl was replaced by choline chloride and solubilized with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA. Aliquots were taken for scintillation counting, protein assays, and Western blot analysis. The radioactivity counts were adjusted according to the protein content of the sample and expressed as nmol d-aspartate/mg of protein/min. COS7 Cell Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins from transfected COS7 cells was carried out using the ProFound Mammalian Co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Anti-GLAST antibody was covalently immobilized to an AminoLink® antibody-coupling gel. COS7 cells in T25-cm2 flasks (at 70–80% confluency) were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 (control) or pcDNA3.1:GFAP plus either pGLAST or pGLASTΔpdz by using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Three to four days after transfection, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer containing PBS and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). After lysis for 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. For NHERF1 knockdown experiments, transfected cells were infected with a mixture of 2 ml of shRNA lentivirus-containing medium and 2 ml of regular medium. The medium was changed 24 h post-infection and replaced with regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and further incubated for 4–5 days before lysis as described above. Precleared lysate was applied to the antibody-coupled gel and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle end-to-end rotation. The protein-antibody-coupled gel was washed with lysis buffer, and protein complexes were eluted in ImmunoPure elution buffer, boiled in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with anti-GFAP as described above. Quantification of Results and Statistical Analysis—Data from three independent uptake experiments (performed in triplicate) were analyzed and presented as mean value ± S.D. Statistical significances were estimated using one-way analysis of variance with Dunnet's test (Graph Pad Prism v4.0). Western blot data from NHERF1 knockdown experiments (performed in triplicate) were analyzed using Scion Image (Scion Corp.). A significance level threshold of p = 0.05 was used in this study. Immunocytochemical Experiments—Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6) were euthanized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (120 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Animals were fixed initially by perfusion via the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.2). Anesthetized neonatal piglets (n = 6) were rendered hypoxic by exposure to 4% oxygen for 30 min and monitored as previously described in detail (18Bjorkman S.T. Foster K.A. O'Driscoll S.M. Healy G.N. Lingwood B.E. Burke C. Colditz P.B. Brain Res. 2006; 1100: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Littermate controls (n = 6) underwent anesthesia only and were then allowed to recover for 72 h. At the completion of each experiment, pigs were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (120 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Tissue Preparation for Immunocytochemistry—Rat brains were removed after perfusion-fixation and fixed by immersion for an additional 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 10% picric acid in PBS. Pig brain tissues were removed and 3-mm-thick slices prepared using a brain slice matrix. Slices were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 10% picric acid for 12 h. All brains were then processed for paraffin wax embedding according to standard protocols (15Pow D.V. Naidoo T. Lingwood B.E. Healy G.N. Williams S.M. Sullivan R.K.P. O'Driscoll S. Colditz P.B. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 153: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Microscopy—Serial coronal sections of paraffin wax-embedded brains (8 μm in thickness) were cut on a rotary microtome and mounted onto silanated microscope slides. Sections were dewaxed with xylene and then rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol/water mixtures. Antigen recovery was performed using Revealit-Ag antigen recovery solution (ImmunoSolution, NSW, Australia). Immunocytochemical labeling was performed for GFAP (1:3,000) or GLAST (1:5,000) using standard immunoperoxidase methods with species-specific secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Biosciences); labeling was revealed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Sections were viewed with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP70 digital camera. Low magnification images of entire brain hemisections were scanned using a Nikon Coolscan IV slide scanner. Dual immunolabeling for GLAST (1:1,000) and GFAP (1:500) was performed using species-specific secondary antibodies labeled with Texas Red (for GLAST) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (for GFAP). Confocal imaging was performed using a Nikon C1 confocal microscope equipped with solid state lasers emitting at 488 and 594 nm to excite fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red, respectively. Digital images were imported into Adobe Photoshop 7. Only minor contrast and brightness adjustments were made. Composite plate images of the digital files were generated using Macromedia Freehand X. GFAP Binding Partners—Total rat brain lysate was immunoprecipitated with the GFAP antibody; the products were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue to initially evaluate whether a significant number of proteins were associated with GFAP in vivo. Multiple potential binding partners for GFAP were detected (represented by bands of differing intensities), including at least ten proteins with molecular masses between 50 and 300 kDa (Fig. 1). We noted in particular two bands at ∼65 kDa and one at ∼80 kDa. These were selected for further investigation because they corresponded to predicted molecular masses of the known glial markers GLAST, GLT-1, and ezrin. The band at ∼50 kDa includes GFAP. However, the broad nature of this band indicated the probable presence of other proteins of a similar molecular mass, such as NHERF1 (∼52 kDa). In Vivo Interaction between GFAP and GLAST in Rat Brain— We next asked whether the glutamate transporters GLAST, GLT-1α, or GLT-1b co-associate with GFAP in rat brain. We used polyclonal antibodies to immunoprecipitate GLAST, GLT-1α, and GLT-1b from brain lysate, and the recovered immunocomplexes were subjected to immunoblot analysis. As GLAST was recently shown to associate with the PDZ scaffold protein NHERF1 and the microfilament membrane linker ezrin (17Lee A. Rayfield A. Hryciw D. Ma T.A. Pow D.V. Broer S. Yun C. Poronnik P. Glia. 2007; 55: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we also included NHERF1- and ezrin-immunoprecipitated products in our analysis. Immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-GLAST, anti-NHERF1, and anti-ezrin antibodies (but not anti-GLT-1α and anti-GLT-1b) contained GFAP, represented by the band detected at ∼50 kDa (Fig. 2A). To further confirm the interactions, we immunoprecipitated total rat brain lysate with monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody and detected GLAST (Fig. 2A); the bands detected at ∼130 and ∼195 kDa represented the dimeric and trimeric forms of GLAST, respectively (19Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M. Chaudhry F.A. Honore T. Nielsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 44: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated complex obtained using anti-GFAP also contained NHERF1 and ezrin, represented by the bands detected at ∼52 and ∼80 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A), but not GLT-1α or GLT-1b (data not shown). Western blots showing that the target proteins were immunoprecipitated are shown in Fig. 2B. Taken together, these results would indicate that in brain, GLAST, NHERF1, and ezrin associate with GFAP. In Vivo Interaction between GFAP and GLAST in Pig Brain— To determine whether the GLAST-GFAP interaction described above in rat was relevant and replicable in other mammalian species, the immunoprecipitation experiments were also performed using pig brain lysate. We immunoprecipitated total pig brain lysate with monoclonal anti-GFAP antibodies, and the recovered immunocomplexes were subjected to immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the immunocomplexes obtained using anti-GFAP antibodies contained GLAST, with the band detected at ∼130 kDa representing the dimeric form of GLAST. Immunoprecipitation with a non-relevant antibody control (monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein) did not immunoprecipitate GLAST (Fig. 3). GFAP immunoprecipitation complexes were also blotted with anti-GLT-1α and anti-GLT-1b antibodies; however, no association was detected between GFAP and GLT-1 (data not shown). We further confirmed the GLAST-GFAP interaction by immunoprecipitating total brain lysate with an anti-GLAST antibody and detected GFAP (data not shown). Modulation of GLAST Transport by GFAP Involves PDZ-mediated Interactions—To assess whether GFAP could modulate GLAST-mediated transport, we performed [3H]d-aspartate uptake assays in COS7 cells co-expressing GFAP and wild-type GLAST or a GLAST C-terminal PDZ motif deletion mutant (GLASTΔpdz). Expression of wild-type GLAST alone in COS7 cells resulted in a ∼12-fold increase in d-aspartate uptake over mock-transfected cells. Co-expression of wild-type GLAST and GFAP resulted in a significant increase (∼17%) in d-aspartate uptake compared with wild-type GLAST alone (Fig. 4A). COS7 cells expressing GLASTΔpdz alone had a significant reduction (∼27%) in d-aspartate uptake compared with wild-type GLAST (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, co-expression of GLASTΔpdz and GFAP in COS7 cells did not increase d-aspartate uptake above that of GLASTΔpdz alone (Fig. 4A). To assess the role of NHERF1 in the GFAP-GLAST interaction, we used lenti-shRNA to knock down endogenous NHERF1 in COS7 cells. Initially, several lenti-shRNAs were generated against the mouse NHERF1 sequence and tested on COS7 cells. Lenti-A9 specifically reduced endogenous NHERF1 protein expression by >90% (Fig. 4B) but did not affect NHERF2 expression (data not shown). COS7 cells expressing wild-type GLAST alone or in combination with GFAP were then infected with lenti-A9 to assess the role of NHERF1 in GLAST/GLAST-GFAP-mediated d-aspartate uptake. d-Aspartate uptake was significantly reduced (∼26%) in lenti-A9-treated COS7 cells expressing wild-type GLAST compared with cells infected with control lentivirus (Fig. 4C). Treatment with lenti-A9 also abolished the GFAP-stimulated component of d-aspartate transport in COS7 cells co-expressing GLAST and GFAP (Fig. 4C). We further tested the interaction between GLAST/GLASTΔpdz and GFAP in transfected COS7 cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Constructs encoding GLAST, GLASTΔpdz, and GFAP were transfected in COS7 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GLAST antibodies followed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, GFAP was found to co-precipitate with wild-type GLAST but not with the PDZ deletion mutant, GLASTΔpdz. As negative controls, GFAP was not detected in anti-GLAST immunoprecipitations from cells transfected with only GLAST, GLASTΔpdz, or GFAP. We also showed that the GFAP-GLAST interaction was greatly impaired when endogenous NHERF1 was knocked down (Fig. 5B). Taken together, the results suggested that the GFAP-GLAST interaction was dependent on the GLAST C-terminal PDZ binding motif (ETKM) and association with NHERF1. Immunofluorescence Labeling for GFAP and GLAST in the Rat Brain—Because the co-immunoprecipitation data suggested GFAP can form a complex in vivo that included GLAST, immunolabeling was used to further examine the relationship between the two proteins in the rat brain. GFAP expression was modest and widespread in gray matter astrocytes and highly expressed in white matter astrocytes. The glutamate transporter GLAST was abundantly expressed in gray matter astrocytes throughout the rat brain, including hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 6, A and B). High magnification confocal images revealed a co-association of GFAP and GLAST in gray matter astrocytes. GFAP was expressed in the core of the astrocyte process, whereas GLAST was expressed in the plasma membranes of the astrocytes (Fig. 6, C–F). GFAP and GLAST Expression in Normal Pig Brain—Analysis of normal pig brain tissues revealed that GFAP was also expressed by astrocytes in gray and white matter of pig brain (Fig. 7A). Similarly, analysis of serial sections immunolabeled for GLAST revealed high expression in the gray matter of the cortex, in hippocampus, and in other forebrain regions such as thalamus and hypothalamus (Fig. 7B). GFAP and GLAST Expression in Hypoxic Pig Brain—Comparison of the patterns of labeling for GFAP (Fig. 7, C and E) and GLAST (Fig. 7, D and F) in hypoxic brains, obtained on serial sections, revealed a remarkable level of coincidence at the macroscopic level. GFAP expression was up-regulated in the gray matter in those areas such as the dentate gyrus where the GLAST expression was retained, whereas in areas where GLAST expression was lost (such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus) GFAP expression was minimal. Significant loss of GLAST was evident in areas such as the cortex, particularly layers 2–5, and subregions of the hippocampus such as the CA1 region. Conversely, some areas such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus usually exhibited little, if any, evidence for damage (Fig. 7, D and F, arrows). Damage in other brain regions was also heterogeneous; thus only subregions of the thalami appeared to have lost expression of GLAST. To determine whether GFAP co-localized with GLAST in normal or hypoxic pig tissues, dual immunofluorescence labeling was performed. Expression patterns of both proteins were compared with results obtained for single-labeled sections (Fig. 8, A–C). After hypoxic insults, little expression of either GFAP or GLAST was observed in the CA1 hippocampal region. Conversely, GFAP and GLAST were highly expressed and co-localized in the adjacent dentate gyrus. High magnification confocal images revealed that GFAP and GLAST were co-associated in a subset of gray matter astrocytes in the control pig brain as they were in the rat brain, with GFAP expressed in the core or cytoskeleton of the astrocyte and GLAST expressed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 8, D–F). The association of these two proteins was most striking in hypoxic tissues. In some areas of cortex from hypoxic brains, GLAST expression was retained in the outer layers of cortex, where GFAP was also up-regulated (Fig. 8G). In these cortical areas and other areas such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, astrocytes appeared to have normal morphology and showed co-association of GFAP and GLAST in their distal processes (Fig. 8H). In areas where severe cellular damage was evident, astrocytes exhibited an abnormal morphology, with expression of GFAP (and concomitant expression of GLAST) restricted to the proximal processes and soma of the astrocyte (Fig. 8, I–L). Some astrocyte processes appeared completely retracted, with GFAP only expressed in the soma and GLAST expression restricted to around the cell body (Fig. 8L). In this study we have identified a novel association between GFAP and GLAST that appears to result in the anchoring of GLAST in the plasma membranes of astrocytes and enhancement of GLAST-mediated transport. This is significant because a well defined functional role for GFAP has not previously been identified. Previous studies have noted that glutamate transporters are targeted or anchored in specific cellular compartments of astrocytes (20Sullivan R.K.P. Rauen T. Fischer F. Wiessner M. Grewer C. Bicho A. Pow D.V. Glia. 1994; 45: 155-169Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This targeting or anchoring process is significant because the localization of GLAST will influence its capacity to regulate extracellular glutamate; however, to date, there has been limited evidence as to how this anchoring or targeting might be achieved. A clue as to the possible mechanism by which GFAP might serve to anchor GLAST is provided by earlier studies. An in vivo association was previously shown between GLAST, NHERF1, and ezrin (17Lee A. Rayfield A. Hryciw D. Ma T.A. Pow D.V. Broer S. Yun C. Poronnik P. Glia. 2007; 55: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 40: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study we have extended these findings; our d-aspartate uptake and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cultured cells have highlighted the importance of the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (ETKM) of GLAST in both functional transport and in mediating the interaction with GFAP. Our results also suggest that the interaction between GFAP and GLAST is indirect but dependent upon the presence of NHERF1. We further demonstrate a molecular association between GFAP and GLAST in rat and pig brain. We propose that GFAP stabilizes the process of the astrocyte and allows the retention of GLAST in the plasma membrane via a series of intermediate, linking proteins, including NHERF1 and ezrin (Fig. 9). In support of this model, it has been shown that each of these proteins is expressed in astrocytes. Moreover, Derouiche and Frotscher (22Derouiche A. Frotscher M. Glia. 2001; 36: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that the GFAP cytoskeleton is intimately associated with actin-associated ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins and that immunoreactivity for ERM proteins extends from the GFAP cytoskeleton out to the plasma membranes of the astrocytes. Whether the linkage between GFAP and ezrin is direct or via one or more additional linking proteins remains to be determined. We note in our Coomassie blue-stained gels that there are at least ten proteins that might provide additional linkages in our model. Our model would suggest that any change in GFAP expression or localization would influence glutamate homeostasis. This hypothesis is supported by our d-aspartate transport results and the recent observation that GFAP knock-out mice exhibit reduced glutamate clearance and may be more sensitive to hypoxia than normal mice (4Hughes E.G. Maguire J.L. McMinn M.T. Scholz R.E. Sutherland M.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 124: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Given the preceding evidence, the model we propose indicates that the association between GFAP and GLAST will be important under normal physiological conditions because any modulation of the localization of GLAST will influence its capacity to regulate extracellular glutamate. The loss of GLAST from some brain regions in response to an episode of hypoxia (and retention in other brain regions) accords with other studies (15Pow D.V. Naidoo T. Lingwood B.E. Healy G.N.

The novel facet of this study is the observation that the redistribution of GLAST is associated with redistribution of GFAP in the same cells, an observation that is compatible with our proposed model. We have observed that in response to hypoxia, astrocytes in damaged brain regions exhibit an abnormal morphology, characterized by the presence of very short processes and a redistribution of immunoreactivity for both GFAP and GLAST from the processes into the somata. Conversely, in undamaged brain regions we observe an increase in the expression of GFAP that coincides with the retention of GLAST protein in these astrocyte processes. These observations accord with the proposed model. Because GFAP is thought to stabilize astrocyte processes, loss of GFAP has consequences not only for glutamate homeostasis but also for astrocyte morphology. Our view, that homeostasis of glutamate and astrocyte morphology are intimately linked with GFAP expression, is of potential relevance to many disease states besides hypoxia. GFAP is up-regulated in diseases such as epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis where abnormal excitation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease (31Chengyun D. Guoming L. Elia M.

However, at the individual cell level, there are no current data as to whether there are correlated changes in the expression of GLAST. Collectively, our data and data from the literature support the view that the GFAP cytoskeleton of the astrocyte may be a key component in normal astrocyte function and that anchoring proteins such as GLAST to the cytoskeleton may be an important element in glutamate homeostasis. Accordingly, developing therapies that protect or promote the interaction between these proteins may be useful neuro-protective strategies.

Okun J.G. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, mitochondrial membranes were homogenized, shock-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of preparations were used for activity measurements and gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined colorimetrically using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).Measurement of Catalytic Activity—NADH:HAR 2The abbreviations used are:HARhexaammineruthenium(III)-chlorideDBQn-decylubiquinonedNADHdeamino-NADH (reduced form)DQA2-decyl-4-quinazolinylamineMops3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. oxidoreductase activity was measured as NADH oxidation (ϵ340–400 nm = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) in the presence of the artificial electron acceptor HAR using a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax PLUS384 plate reader spectrometer. The activity was measured at 30 °C in 20 mm Na+/Hepes, pH 8.0, with 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, and 2 mm HAR. The reaction was initiated by the addition of mitochondrial membranes (final concentration 25 μg of protein per ml). Specific NADH:HAR oxidoreductase activity was used to estimate complex I content because it is not affected by changes in the ubiquinone binding pocket.dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity of mitochondrial membranes was determined as the fraction of dNADH oxidation activity (ϵ340–400 nm = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) sensitive to the complex I inhibitor DQA in the presence of DBQ as electron acceptor. Measurements were carried out on a SPECTRAmax PLUS384 plate reader spectrometer (Molecular Devices) at 30 °C in 20 mm Na+/Mops, pH 7.4, with 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCN, 0.1 mm dNADH, and 0.07 mm DBQ. The final concentration of mitochondrial membranes was 50 μg/ml. The reaction was started by adding DBQ. The inhibitor-sensitive fraction of the ubiquinone reductase activity was calculated by subtracting the residual rate in the presence of 27 μm DQA that was usually 5–10% of the dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity of the parental strain. To allow comparison between different membrane preparations, all activities were normalized for complex I content. The results are given as mean ± S.E. (n = 5–15).I50 values and apparent Km values were determined under essentially the same conditions as dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity by varying the inhibitor and DBQ concentrations, respectively. The I50 value is defined as the concentration of inhibitor that decreased the inhibitor-sensitive complex I activity by 50%. For determination of the apparent Km, data were fitted using the program “Enzfitter” (version 2.0.17.0, Biosoft 1999, Cambridge, UK) and a modified Michaelis-Menten equation (25Eschemann A. Galkin A.

Spectra were recorded using the following parameters: microwave frequency 9.47 GHz, microwave power 5 milliwatts, modulation amplitude 0.64 millitesla, and modulation frequency 100 kHz.Mitochondrial membranes (10–25 mg/ml, depending on the specific mutant) were reduced with 2 mm NADH or 2 mm NADH, 5 mm sodium dithionite. Samples were frozen in cold isopentane/methylcyclohexane (5:1, ∼120 K) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Usually, spectra were recorded at temperatures of 40 K to analyze binuclear clusters only or at 12 K to analyze binuclear and tetranuclear clusters.Structure Images—Images of the structural model and interpretation of the results from mutagenesis were based on the x-ray structure of the peripheral arm of complex I from T. thermophilus at 3.3 Å resolution (18Sazanov L.A.

The software package PyMol (version 0.99) was used for visualizing the coordinates (Protein Data Bank 2FUG) and preparing the figures in which the amino acids were labeled using Y. lipolytica numbering that was deduced from aligning the sequences from the two organisms (supplemental Fig. S1). In cases where a residue was not conserved between T. thermophilus and Y. lipolytica, the side chain was exchanged to match the Y. lipolytica sequence using the mutagenesis wizard of the PyMol package.RESULTSMutations in the Ubiquinone Binding Cavity Did Not Interfere with Complex I Assembly—To gain more insight into the function of amino acid residues that line the putative ubiquinone binding pocket (18Sazanov L.A.

In cases where we had made several exchanges in the same position, we analyzed those mutants that exhibited the most drastic effect on activity (supplemental Fig. S2). From previous studies it is known that the shape of the EPR signature of iron-sulfur cluster N2 is highly sensitive to structural changes in its environment (14Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S.

Remarkably, in none of the mutations made for this study could we detect significant changes in the EPR spectra of iron-sulfur cluster N2 or any of the other EPR detectable iron-sulfur clusters, irrespective of the reductant used (NADH or NADH/dithionite). This suggested that the structural changes introduced by the mutations were largely local.Effects of Point Mutations on Complex I Ubiquinone Reductase Activity—In a number of mutants we observed significant reductions of the specific inhibitor-sensitive ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I (Tables 1 and 2). By introducing multiple exchanges in a given position, we probed how critically catalytic activity depended on the size and properties of a particular side chain. Although in some regions of the 49-kDa subunit different exchanges had comparatively severe effects on activity, in other parts of the protein only some of the mutations markedly reduced activity. Compared with mitochondrial membranes from the parental strain, mutagenesis of residues Ala-94, Val-97, Leu-98, Arg-99, and Tyr-144 reduced specific ubiquinone reductase activity dramatically to values that were below 25% in all cases. In contrast, exchanging the hydrophobic residue with a much smaller hydrophilic residue in mutant V145T had virtually no effects, whereas mutation V145F markedly reduced complex I activity. Also for Arg-141 the changes in activity depended on the amino acid that was introduced (14Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24082-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Grgic L. Zwicker K. Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21193-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and in position 407 only the drastic exchange K407W strongly impaired activity, whereas the more conservative exchanges K407H or K407R had only moderate or no effect. Marked reductions of catalytic activity were also observed with mutations M188Y and S192Y and for several mutations near the C terminus of the 49-kDa subunit between residues 455 and 461.Of the mutations within the PSST subunit, only V88F strongly reduced the specific ubiquinone reductase activity. Mutation E185Q that we had analyzed in earlier studies (22Garofano A. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Okun P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and mutation V88M had only moderate effects on activity.To see how the severity of effect of the different mutations correlated with their location in the cavity, we grouped and color-coded them into four categories (Fig. 2); in some positions mutagenesis resulted in activities that were comparable with the parental strain (>75%, blue), and in others, the mutant activities were markedly reduced (25–75%, green). Yellow was used if at least one mutant with an activity below 25% was found. If several exchanges all resulted in complex I activities below <25% of the parental strain, this was indicated by red color. A color-coded representation of our results in the structure around cluster N2 (Fig. 2) illustrates that the effects of the mutations nicely correlated with their positions within the ubiquinone binding cavity. The most severe reductions of activity were observed along a path leading from the first strand of the N-terminal β-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit toward a region adjacent to iron-sulfur cluster N2.FIGURE 2Effects of point mutations on complex I activity. The putative ubiquinone binding cavity of complex I is shown as a schematic with exchanged amino acids highlighted in stick representation. Amino acids mutated within the putative quinone binding cavity are color-coded to illustrate the effect on dNADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity observed for an amino acid exchange in a given position in complex I from Y. lipolytica. Red, several exchanges all resulted in very low activity (<25% of parental); yellow, at least one exchange resulted in very low activity (<25% of parental); green, reduced activity (between 25 and 75% of parental); blue, essentially normal activity (>75% of parental) for all exchanges.

However, this was only possible for those mutants that had a residual activity of well above 20% of the parental strain. Many mutants exhibited a slightly lower apparent Km value than the parental strain, but in most cases this seemed to go parallel with reduced ubiquinone reductase activity, a trend that we had observed previously with complex I mutations. Overall none of the mutants analyzed here that had retained appreciable ubiquinone reductase activities exhibited marked changes in the apparent Km value for DBQ.Effects of Point Mutations on I50 of Specific Complex I Inhibitors—Many different complex I inhibitors are known that act on the quinone-binding site. Because of their kinetic properties these inhibitors are divided into three classes, A–C (19Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), with different but partially overlapping binding sites (29Okun J.G. Lümmen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Because DQA and rotenone are very potent representatives of class A and B, respectively, we measured the I50 values for these inhibitors in our complex I mutants. Again, reliable determination of this parameter was only possible if the residual activity of a given mutant was well above 20%. Mutation K407R in the 49-kDa subunit caused a 4.7-fold increase of the I50 value for DQA, but no change in the I50 value for rotenone. In contrast, for mutant F207W we observed a significant increase in the I50 value only for rotenone. Mutation V88M in the PSST subunit exhibited a slight hypersensitivity for rotenone and some resistance to DQA. The latter was also observed to a somewhat lesser extent in PSST mutant V88L. All other mutants studied here exhibited I50 values for both inhibitors that were not significantly different from the parental strain (Table 1 and 2). Table 1 also contains several previously generated and published mutations, which change I50 for DQA and rotenone. All resistance data are illustrated in Fig. 3. Amino acid positions where mutants exhibited resistance or hypersensitivity to DQA or rotenone are shown in orange in Fig. 3. For orientation, the residues that were most critical for catalytic activity are shown again in red in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Effects of point mutations on I50 value of complex I inhibitors. The same view into the ubiquinone binding cavity of complex I as in Fig. 2 is shown. However, amino acids that, when exchanged, had an effect on I50 of DQA or rotenone are now shown in orange. For better orientation, other residues that were most critical for catalytic activity are shown again in red. The other mutated residues highlighted in Fig. 2 are now shown in the same color as the secondary structure schematic of the subunit. (A and B as in Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have probed the proposed ubiquinone binding cavity within the peripheral arm of complex I by site-directed mutagenesis. Of the 39 mutations that were analyzed here, a significant number resulted in a marked reduction of inhibitor-sensitive ubiquinone reductase activity. Several mutations changed inhibitor sensitivity. By localizing the corresponding residues in the partial structure of complex I from T. thermophilus (18Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and by combining these results with information from earlier studies (14Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J.

The region identified as being most critical for activity included a group of residues that (except for Tyr-144, Ser-192, and Val-460) were not located immediately in the spacious cavity around cluster N2 but rather seemed to form a path of entry for ubiquinone (Fig. 2A). This path starts with Ala-94 at a distance of about 24 Å from the ubiquinone-reducing iron-sulfur cluster N2 within the first strand of the N-terminal three-stranded β-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit. The amphipathic loop connecting the first and second strand of this β-sheet reaches into the pr"

We isolated thrombin inhibitors present in the salivary gland extract from partially fed female Amblyomma variegatum, the tropical bont tick, and characterized the most potent, variegin, one of the smallest (32 residues) thrombin inhibitors found in nature. Full-length variegin and two truncated variants were chemically synthesized. Despite its small size and flexible structure, variegin binds thrombin with strong affinity (Ki ∼10.4 pm) and high specificity. Results using the truncated variants indicated that the seven residues at the N terminus affected the binding kinetics; when removed, the binding characteristics changed from fast to slow. Further, the thrombin active site binding moiety of variegin is in the region of residues 8–14, and the exosite-I binding moiety is within residues 15–32. Our results show that variegin is structurally and functionally similar to the rationally designed thrombin inhibitor, hirulog. However, compared with hirulog, variegin is a more potent inhibitor, and its inhibitory activity is largely retained after cleavage by thrombin.

Blood coagulation is part of the physiological response to vascular injury, in which circulating zymogens of serine proteases are sequentially activated by limited proteolysis leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. Within this network of reactions, thrombin plays a central role in maintaining the integrity of hemostasis. Thrombin interacts with most of the zymogens and their cofactors, playing multiple procoagulant and anticoagulant roles in blood coagulation (1Huntington J.A. J. Thromb.

As a procoagulant protease, the first traces of thrombin generated in the initiation phase activate factor V (FV) 2The abbreviations used are:FVfactor VFfactorSGEsalivary gland extractAPCactivated protein CTPAtissue plasminogen activatorHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyTTthrombin timePTprothrombin timeAPTTactivated partial thromboplastin timeMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. and factor VIII (FVIII) to provide positive feedback leading to the thrombin burst. Thrombin can also activate factor XI, triggering the intrinsic pathway. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin, forming insoluble clots. Fibrin polymers are further strengthened and stabilized through covalent cross-linking driven by thrombin-activated factor XIII. Thrombin also contributes to the generation of a platelet plug, possibly through two mechanisms: (a) it activates platelets by interacting with protease-activated receptors and glycoprotein V, and (b) it prevents destabilization of the platelet plug, by inactivating ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, that cleaves von Willebrand factor. As an anticoagulant protease, thrombin activates protein C in the presence of the cofactor thrombomodulin. Activated protein C (APC) inactivates factor Va and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa), down-regulating the generation of thrombin (1Huntington J.A. J. Thromb.

Thromboembolic disorders are major causes of mortality and morbidity (6Schwienhorst A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2773-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Anticoagulants are pivotal in the prophylaxis and treatment of these disorders. Although heparin and coumarin derivatives (vitamin K antagonists) are the cornerstones of anticoagulation therapy, both classes of drug have well documented limitations, such as a narrow therapeutic window and highly variable dose response. These limitations drive the continual and intense effort to develop new anticoagulants, mainly targeting specific coagulation factors (7Hirsh J. O'Donnell M. Weitz J.I. Blood. 2005; 105: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thrombin represents an ideal target owing to its central role in the coagulation cascade (6Schwienhorst A. Cell Mol.

It has a globular N-terminal domain and an acidic C-terminal tail. This C-terminal tail interacts with thrombin exosite-I through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The N-terminal domain binds to an apolar site near the active site of thrombin, obstructing its accessibility (11Grutter M.G. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R.

All other chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade. Salivary Gland Extracts and Estimation of Protein Concentrations—The extraction procedure of A. variegatum SGE and estimation of protein concentrations during fractionation were described previously (23Kazimirova M. Jancinova V. Petrikova M. Takac P. Labuda M. Nosal' R. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 2002; 28: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult female ticks that had been feeding on laboratory rabbits for 9 days (partially fed) were removed and mounted in Petri dishes dorsal side down, and their salivary glands were dissected out into 150 mm NaCl and stored at–70 °C. Prior to use, the frozen salivary glands were incubated at ∼90 °C for 5 min, homogenized, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant fluids were collected, and the pellets were resuspended in 150 mm NaCl and recentrifuged. Pooled supernatant fluids represented crude SGE. Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Purification of Variegin Isoforms—Variegin was purified by a three-step reversed-phase HPLC procedure with a Beckman Instruments 126/168 DAD HPLC system (Fullerton, CA). In the first step (Fig. 1A) SGE was loaded onto a Vydac C-4 (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) column (Grace Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Pooled fractions that contained the strongest anticoagulant activity (Fig. 1A, fraction AV-III) were subjected to a second step (Fig. 1B) using a Beckman Ultrasphere C-18 (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) column. Lastly, individual fractions were further purified using a Vydac C-18 (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) column to obtain three fractions of potent antithrombin activity: AV 3/5, AV 5/5, and AV 6/5 (Fig. 1, C and D). The major component in the AV 6/5 fraction was named n-variegin (“n” denotes the native peptide). Coagulation Assays—Thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assays were used for the initial screens of anticoagulant activities in SGE and fractions. Citrated human plasma (50 μl) was preincubated with a maximum of 5 μl of the SGE or the same volume of 150 mm NaCl (control) at 37 °C for 1 min. After adding the corresponding reagents (TT: 50 μl of Thromboclotin reagent; PT: 100 μl of Thromboplastin IS reagent; APTT: 50 μl of Actin FS Activated PTT added for 3 min and reaction started with 50 μl of 20mm CaCl2), times required for the formation of fibrin clots were determined visually using a stopwatch. The activities of crude SGE and the three fractions (AV 3/5, AV 5/5, and AV 6/5) were verified at the Oxford Hemophilia Centre of Churchill Hospital (Oxford, UK). TT, PT, and APTT were performed using an MDA-180 analyzer (Organon Teknika Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Ten microliters of SGE (1 μg/μl) or diluted fractions containing AV 3/5, AV 5/5, and AV 6/5 (concentrations of undiluted fractions were: 0.07 μg/μl, 0.05 μg/μl, and 0.02 μg/μl, respectively) were added to 290 μl of platelet poor plasma, mixed, and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The activities were also verified using a Thromboelastograph (TEG) Analyzer (Hemoscope Inc., Skokie, IL). 5 μl of samples was added to 335 μl of citrated whole blood, incubated for 5 min, and the sample was run on the TEG following recalcification. Protein Sequence Analysis—The molecular weights of proteins present in AV 3/5, AV 5/5, and AV 6/5 were determined by Eurosequence (Groningen, the Netherlands) using a BIFLEX (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and gridless delayed extraction ion source. Partial amino acid sequences were determined by N-terminal Edman degradation using an automated sequencer (Model 494, Applied Biosystems). The complete sequence for AV 6/5 was determined by MALDI-MS analysis. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Three peptides (s-variegin, EP25, and AP18) were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis methods on an Applied Biosystems Pioneer Model 433A Peptide Synthesizer. Fmoc groups of amino acids were removed by 20% v/v piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide and coupled using HATU/DIPEA in situ neutralization chemistry. All peptides were synthesized on preloaded polyethylene glycol polystyrene (PEG-PS) resins. Cleavage by a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/1,2-ethanedithiol/thioanisole/water released peptide acids (-COOH). Synthetic peptides were purified by reversed phase-HPLC on anÁKTA™ purifier (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) with a SunFire™ C18 (5 μm, 250 mm × 10 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) column. The purity and mass of all peptides were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using an API 300 liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex, Selton, CT). CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra (260–190 nm) of n-variegin, s-variegin, EP25, and AP18 dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD). All measurements were carried out at room temperature using 0.1-cm path length cuvettes with a scan speed of 50 nm/min, a resolution of 0.2 nm, and a bandwidth of 2 nm. Inhibition of Thrombin Amidolytic Activity—All assays for thrombin amidolytic activity on S2238 were performed in 96-wells microtiter plates in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Typically, 100 μl of peptide and 100 μlof thrombin were preincubated for different durations before the addition of 100 μl of S2238. The rates of formation of colored product p-nitroaniline were followed at 405 nm for 10 min with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Percentage inhibition was calculated by taking the rate of increase in absorbance in the absence of inhibitor as 0%. Dose-response curves were fitted using Origin software (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) to calculate IC50 values and Hill coefficients. Determination of the Inhibitory Constant Ki—The inhibitory constant, Ki, was determined using S2238 as substrate. When an enzyme is inhibited by an equimolar concentration of inhibitor, the binding of inhibitor to enzyme causes a significant depletion in the concentration of free inhibitors. This tight-binding inhibition is described by the following equation (25Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar),Vs=(Vo/2Et){[(Ki′+It−Et)2+4Ki′Et]1/2−(Ki′+It−Et)}(Eq. 1) where Vs is steady-state velocity in the presence of inhibitor, Vo is velocity observed in the absence of inhibitor, Et is total enzyme concentration, It is total inhibitor concentration, and Ki′ is apparent inhibitory constant. For competitive inhibition, Ki is related to Ki′ by Equation 2,Ki′=Ki(1+S/Km)(Eq. 2) where Ki′ increases linearly with S, Ki is the inhibitory constant, S is the concentration of substrate, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant for S2238 (determined to be 3.25 ± 0.56 μm, supplemental Fig. S1, similar to reported values (25Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 26Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F. Betz A. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4972-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Both n-variegin and s-variegin were found to be tight binding inhibitors. The data were fitted to these equations using Origin software. If the rate of interaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme is slow so that the inhibited steady-state velocity is slowly achieved, the progress curve of product formation of this slow binding inhibition is described by Equation 3 (27Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar),P=Vft+(Vi−Vf)(1−e−kt)/k+P0(Eq. 3) where P is the amount of product formed, Po is the initial amount of product, Vf is final steady-state velocity, Vi is initial velocity, t is time, and k is the apparent first-order rate constant. There are two possible minimum kinetic mechanisms to describe such slow binding reactions (27Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Schemes 1 and 2). The first is shown in Scheme 1,E+I⇄K2K1EI∗SCHEME 1 where E is enzyme, I is inhibitor, EI* is the stable enzyme-inhibitor complex, K1 is the association rate constant, and K2 is the dissociation rate constant. In this scheme, slow binding is mainly due to the slow K1. The apparent first-order rate constant k will increase linearly with inhibitor concentration. Alternatively, the second mechanism is shown in Scheme 2,E+I⇄K2K1EI⇄K4K3EI∗SCHEME 2 where EI is the initial collision complex, K3 is the forward isomerization rate, and K4 is the reverse isomerization rate. In this scheme, binding involves rapid formation of an initial collision complex (EI) that subsequently undergoes slow isomerization to the final enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*). k increases hyperbolically with inhibitor concentrations. Dissociation constant of EI (denoted Ki′) can be calculated from Equation 4,k=K4+K3It/[It+Kt(‵1+S/Km)](Eq. 4) The overall inhibitory constant Ki can be calculated from Equation 5.Ki=Ki[‵K4/(K3+K4)](Eq. 5) EP25 was found to be a slow binding inhibitor following the Scheme 2 mechanism. The data were fitted to these equations using Origin software. Serine Protease Specificity—The selectivity profile of variegin was examined against 13 serine proteases: fibrinolytic serine proteases (plasmin, TPA, and urokinase), anticoagulant serine protease APC, procoagulant serine proteases (FXIIa, FXIa, FXa, FIXa, FVIIa, kallikrein, and thrombin), and classic serine proteases (chymotrypsin and trypsin). Effects of s-variegin on these serine proteases were determined by inhibition of their amidolytic activities assayed using specific chromogenic substrates. Fibrinogen Clotting Time—The abilities of s-variegin, EP25, and AP18 to prolong fibrinogen clotting time were tested using a BBL fibrometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). 200 μl of fibrinogen (final concentration, 3 mg/ml) were incubated with 100 μlof peptides (various concentrations) at 37 °C. Clotting of fibrinogen was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of thrombin (final concentration, 20 nm). All reagents and samples were dissolved in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. Cleavage of S-variegin by Thrombin—S-variegin and EP25 (final concentrations: 150 μm) were incubated with thrombin (final concentration: 5 μm) at both room temperature and 37 °C. After various incubation times, the reactions were quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid buffer (pH 1.8) and loaded onto a SunFire™ C18 column attached to anÁKTA™ purifier. New peaks other than those present in the chromatogram of 0-min incubation were identified as cleavage products and subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to verify their masses. The peaks were integrated to calculate the area under the peaks and relative percentage of each peak. Purification of Variegin Isoforms—Crude SGE of A. variegatum exhibited potent anticoagulant activity in all three coagulation assays (PT, APTT, and TT) (Table 1). Potency was in the order TT >> APTT > PT, indicating that SGE is a promising source of potent thrombin inhibitor(s). To purify the one or more inhibitors, SGE was fractionated by reversed phase-HPLC (Fig. 1A). After the first step of purification, the most potent anticoagulant fraction (AV-III) was subjected to a second purification step (Fig. 1B). The resulting fractions were screened for antithrombin activity in coagulation and chromogenic substrate assays. Two fractions with the strongest activity (retention times, 23.083 and 28.933 min) were further purified in separate runs. The fraction with retention time 23.083 min was separated into two main peaks denoted AV 3/5 and AV 5/5 (Fig. 1C). The fraction with retention time 28.933 had one main peak and with a small “shoulder peak” and was denoted AV 6/5 (Fig. 1D). The anticoagulant activities of these three fractions (AV 3/5, AV 5/5, and AV 6/5) along with crude SGE were verified by PT, APTT, TT, and TEG assays. All four assays revealed that AV 6/5 contained the most potent anticoagulant activity, followed by AV 3/5 and AV 5/5 (Table 2).TABLE 1Anticoagulation activities of A. variegatum SGE (females fed for 9 days)PTAPTTTTsControl152817SGE protein (μg) 0.02550 0.050105 0.100>180 0.2501528 0.5001938 1.0002245 2.50040>180 5.000>180 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Anticoagulation activities of A. variegatum SGE and reversed-phase-HPLC fractionsSample (initial concentration)TEGPTAPTTTTsCrude SGE (1 μg/μl)Complete inhibitionNo clotNo clotNo clotPNPNormal13.625.612.2AV 6/5 (0.02 μg/μl)Inhibited 1:200 dilution15.359.278.9 1:500 dilution14.448.339.2AV 3/5 (0.07 μg/μl)Prolonged r/k 1:200 dilution14.146.730.8 1:500 dilution14.138.820.6AV 5/5 (0.05 μg/μl)Prolonged r/k 1:200 dilution13.838.521.4 1:500 dilution13.833.715.6 Open table in a new tab Protein Sequence Analysis—Partial sequences of all three fractions were determined by Edman degradation. For AV 6/5 the sequence and molecular weight were completed by MALDI-TOF. MALDI spectrum of AV 6/5 revealed a major m/z signal of 3769.96 Da (monoisotopic mass = 3768.96 Da) and a minor m/z signal of 3777.79 Da (monoisotopic mass = 3776.79 Da). The main component has the sequence SDQGDVAEPKMHKT(hex) APPFDFEAIPEEYLDDES, where the Thr-14 is modified by a hexose moiety. This was named “variegin” and was further characterized. The minor component (3776.79 Da) is almost identical to variegin, with Glu-31 replaced by His. Partial sequences determined by Edman degradation revealed two components in the AV 3/5 fraction (m/z 3953.54 and 3409.57 Da) and three components in AV 5/5 (m/z 3680.23, 3368.94, and 3173.62 Da). All the sequences determined are highly similar to variegin (Fig. 2A). The CD spectrum of variegin is typical of a random-coil protein (supplemental Fig. S2). BLAST results indicate that variegin does not show similarity to any known proteins in the data base. Interestingly, its C terminus (DFEAIPEEYL) is almost identical to the C terminus of hirudin (residues 55–64: DFEEIPEEYL). Thus, we hypothesized that variegin C terminus plays a similar role to hirudin C terminus in binding to thrombin. However, Tyr-63 of hirudin is sulfated (29Naski M.C. Fenton J.W. Maraganore J.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8692-8698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the corresponding Tyr in variegin is not. Inhibition of Thrombin Amidolytic Activity by N-variegin and Its Ki—The ability of n-variegin to inhibit thrombin amidolytic activity was assayed with S2238, a small peptidyl substrate that binds only to the active site. N-variegin inhibited the amidolytic activity, and progress curves of inhibition showed that steady-state equilibrium was achieved upon mixing (Fig. 2B). Significant inhibition (∼80%) was observed for equimolar concentrations of thrombin and n-variegin (3.33 nm). IC50 and Hill coefficient (mean ± S.D.) of the inhibition were 0.99 ± 0.02 nm and 1.4 ± 0.2, respectively (Fig. 2C). N-variegin is a fast and tight binding competitive inhibitor of thrombin with a Ki (mean ± S.D.) of 10.4 ± 1.4 pm (Fig. 2D). Synthesis of S-variegin and Variants—For further characterization, three peptides were synthesized, purified, and characterized. Synthetic variegin (SDQGDVAEPKMHKTAPPFDFEAIPEEYLDDES, s-variegin) has the complete sequence of variegin, whereas EP25 (EPKMHKTAPPFDFEAIPEEYLDDES) and AP18 (APPFDFEAIPEEYLDDES) have 7 and 14 residues truncated from the N terminus. Unlike native variegin (n-variegin), Thr is not glycosylated in s-variegin and EP25. CD spectra of s-variegin, EP25, and AP18 are all similar to that of n-variegin, typical of random-coil proteins (supplemental Fig. S2). Selectivity Profile of Variegin—To determine the specificity, s-variegin was screened against 13 serine proteases, including thrombin. Apart from thrombin, no other serine proteases showed significant inhibition (≤5%) even at 1 μm s-variegin. Inhibition of >10% was observed at much higher concentrations of s-variegin. The most susceptible proteases are plasmin, trypsin, and FXIa, which were inhibited ∼20 to 30% by 100 μm of s-variegin. In contrast, against thrombin, similar ∼30% inhibition was observed at a concentration at least four orders of magnitude lower (∼3.3 nm) (Fig. 3). Therefore, s-variegin is a specific and potent thrombin inhibitor. On the other hand, negative values were observed for the inhibition of urokinase and FVIIa, suggesting some degree of activation for these enzymes. Although there seems to be a dose-dependent activation for urokinase, similar activation is less evident and inconclusive in the case of FVIIa. Accurate interpretation of the FVIIa data is difficult due to the lack of a dose-dependent relation as well as the overlapping standard deviations. Inhibition of Thrombin Amidolytic Activity by S-variegin, EP25, and AP18—S-variegin is similar to n-variegin in that steady-state equilibrium of inhibition was achieved upon mixing. It was 5-fold less active than n-variegin, and ∼30% inhibition was observed at equimolar concentrations of thrombin and s-variegin (3.33 nm). Dose-response curves showed IC50 values of around 5.4 nm and Hill coefficient of around 0.9, independent of preincubation time (0 and 10 min) (Fig. 4A). Hence, s-variegin is also a fast and tight binding inhibitor of thrombin. The absence of Thr glycosylation in s-variegin might account for its weaker activity. EP25 also inhibited amidolytic activity of thrombin. However, unlike n-variegin and s-variegin, progress"
https://openalex.org/W2159108889,"Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) regulates reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. During adipogenesis, the structure of filamentous actin is converted from long stress fibers to cortical actin, suggesting that the ROCK is involved in adipogenesis. Two ROCK isoforms have been identified: ROCK-I and ROCK-II. However, pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK cannot distinguish two ROCK isoforms. In the present study, we examined the role of ROCK in adipogenesis and actin cytoskeleton using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Y-27632, which inhibits the activity of both ROCK isoforms, enhanced adipogenesis through the up-regulation of adipogenic transcription factors in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, Y-27632 restored inhibition of adipogenesis by lysophosphatidic acid, which activates Rho. Regarding actin cytoskeleton, Y-27632 disrupted stress fibers in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Next, we analyzed adipogenesis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from ROCK-I and ROCK-II knock-out mice, respectively. Adipogenesis of ROCK-II (-/-) MEFs was markedly enhanced compared with wild-type MEFs while that of ROCK-I (-/-) MEFs was not. In contrast to pharmacological approaches, no obvious alteration was found in actin cytoskeleton of ROCK-II (-/-) MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs. In 3T3-L1 cells, knockdown of ROCK-II by RNA interference enhanced the expression of adipogenic transcription factors while that of ROCK-I did not. Moreover, Y-27632 inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and enhanced Akt phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Similarly, Akt phosphorylation in ROCK-II (-/-) MEFs was augmented compared with wild-type MEFs. In conclusion, inhibition of ROCK-II, not ROCK-I, enhances adipogenesis accompanied by the up-regulation of adipogenic transcription factors. Augmentation of insulin signaling may contribute to the enhancement of adipogenesis."

The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is essential for Wnt5a activation of NF-AT(nuclear factor of activated T cells)-sensitive gene transcription (17Ma L. Wang H.Y. J. Biol.

We scanned signaling pathways that might intersect with the Wnt/cyclic GMP, Ca2+ pathway that ultimately regulates NF-AT-sensitive gene transcription. Of central interest in the analysis was the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and the possible role of p38 in the Wnt-sensitive non-canonical signaling pathway. Our results indicate a central role of p38 MAPK in the Wnt5a/Frizzled-2/Gαt2/PDE6/cyclic GMP and Ca2+ mobilization pathway that regulates NF-AT. Notably, the Wnt5a-stimulated activation of MAPK signaling cascade to the level of p38 is the first Wnt pathway demonstrated to operate independent of Dishevelleds. Cell Culture—Mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells were obtained from the ATCC collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Clones stably co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 harboring rat Frizzled2 (Fz2) and pNFAT-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were selected in medium containing 0.4 mg/ml neomycin analogue, G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). At least three independent clones were selected for each transfection. Clones were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mg/ml G418. Immunoblotting—F9 clones stably expressing either rat Frizzled1 (Fz1) or rat Frizzled2 (Fz2) were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and the mixture was subjected to centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant, designated as whole cell lysates, was collected and protein concentration was determined by Lowry's method (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough H.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein aliquots (40 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with antibodies specifically against p38 MAPK, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, MKK3, phosphorylated MKK3/6, phosphorylated ATF2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or against the indicated G protein subunits (anti-Gαt1, and anti-Gαt2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; anti-Gαo from Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and followed by incubation with a corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-rabbit from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Immune complexes were determined by enhanced chemiluminescence method. p38 MAP Kinase Assay—Confluent F9 clones stably expressing Fz2 were cultured in 6-well plates in media without serum for 16 h, and thereafter cells were pretreated without or with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), 8-Br-PET-cyclic GMP (10 μm), or Zaprinast (1 μm) for 30 min to 1 h prior to Wnt5a (50 ng/ml, cat. 645-WN, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) stimulation for the indicated periods. The activity of p38 MAP kinase was measured by using p38 MAP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and the lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (500 μg of protein) of the supernatant were incubated with 20 μl of immobilized phospho-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm CaCl2). The immobilized phospho-p38 was incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of p38 substrate peptide GST-ATF2-(19-96) and 20 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were subjected to the 10% SDS-PAGE and separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membrane. The activity of p38 kinase was assessed by detection of GST-ATF2 phosphorylation via an anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody. NF-AT-sensitive Luciferase Gene Reporter Assay—Mouse F9 clones stably co-transfected with NF-AT reporter gene (pNFAT-Luc) and an expression vector harboring Fz2 were cultured on 12-well plates. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 12 h. Thereafter cells were pretreated for 30 min with vehicle (as control), or PD98059 (20 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or SB203580 (2 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), followed by incubation without or with Wnt5a (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cells were lysed with 1× luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and supernatants from cell lysates were subjected to luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, 20 μl of supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer (40 mm Tricine, pH 7.8; 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm luciferin), and the intensity of luminescence was measured 10 s after by using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). Samples were assayed in triplicate, and the luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentrations. Results are presented as ratios of relative light units of treatment groups to those of control groups. Cytoplasmic Calcium Measurements—Cells were plated on collagen-coated, glass-bottomed 35-mm dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) and cultured overnight. The intracellular Ca2+ was measured as described previously (17Ma L. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30990-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in Krebs-Ringer buffer composed of 128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 77.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 1.3 mm CaCl2 for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with Krebs-Ringer buffer and treated with Wnt5a (50 ng/ml). In the experiment that p38 inhibitor SB203580 was used, it was incubated together with Fura-2 for the last 30 min of the total 45 min loading time. Cells were immediately monitored via a Hamamatsu OREA ER-AG digital CCD camera coupled to a Nikon inverted microscope. Measurement of fluorescence intensity was performed and the ratio of absorbance at 340/380 nm (A340/A380) was computed using Dynamic Intensity Analysis (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Assay of PKG Activity—PKG activity was determined as described previously (21Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, supernatants (20 μl) from the whole cell lysates were employed with 200 μg/ml PKG-specific heptapeptide substrate (RKRSRAE; Bachem, San Diego, CA), 50 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a buffer (TMG) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 100 nm okadaic acid, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 4 μl of 2 n HCl. Preboiled or HCl-treated supernatants were used as blank samples. Twenty microliters of the resultant mixture were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose filters. Air-dried P-81 filters were washed with H3PO4 (75 mm) three times. Incorporated 32P in substrates on filters were measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The samples were assayed in triplicate. Kinase activity is normalized with protein concentration and presented in percentage of PKG activity of treatment group to that of the control group. Measurement of Intracellular Cyclic GMP in Live Cells—The change of intracellular cyclic GMP in response to Wnt5a in the absence or presence of SB203580 was measured by using a cyclic GMP indicator Cygnet-2.1 (a kind gift from Dr. Wolfgang Dostmann, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT). Cygnet-2.1 was designed utilizing catalytically inactive mutant Δ1-77/T516A bovine cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (PKG Iα) as the central cGMP sensor flanked by enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (eCFP) and citrine, a pH-insensitive version of yellow fluorescence protein (YFP). This biosensor binds cyclic GMP with a high affinity and undergoes a conformational change, interrupting the native FRET observed in the absence of cyclic GMP (22Honda A. Sawyer C.L. Cawley S.M. Dostmann W.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 27-43PubMed Google Scholar, 23Honda A. Adams S.R. Sawyer C.L. Lev-Ram V. Tsien R.Y. Dostmann W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). F9 Fz2 expressing clones were transfected with pcDNA3 harboring Cygnet-2.1 on a 35-mm glass-bottomed dish by using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Twenty-four hours later, cells were bathed in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of SB203580 (2 μm) and imaged at 37 °C with a thermostatted chamber supplied with 5% CO2 on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope with a 100/1.45 Alpha Plan-Fluor objective and an Argon 458 nm laser line. Dual-emission ratio (525/475 nm) imaging of the indicator was controlled by Zeiss LSM Image software. Emission intensities were monitored from 460 to 560 nm at an interval of 10 nm. Intracellular Cyclic GMP Accumulation—The second method for determining intracellular cyclic GMP concentrations was using a commercial cyclic GMP ELISA kit (Cayman, Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as previously described (13Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Salafranca M.N. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1854-H1859PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse F9 cells stably expressing Fz2 were seeded onto 12-well plates. Control siRNA or siRNA specifically against p38 MAP kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were introduced into cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction. After siRNA treatment for 48 h and serum starvation for 12 h, cells were stimulated with Wnt5a (50 ng/ml) for 45 min and lysed in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m HCl. Supernatants from lysates were collected by centrifugation and cyclic GMP concentrations were determined. The coefficients of variation within and among assays were 7.5 and 9.8%, respectively. The results were expressed as percentage of cyclic GMP measured in the “control” cells. Treatment of Cells with Antisense Morpholinos—Morpholino phosphorodiamidate antisense oligonucleotides (morpholinos) targeting the translational initiation sites of Gαt2, Gαt1, and Gαo were purchased from Gene Tools (Corvallis, OR). The sequences of morpholinos for Gαt2, Gαt1, and Gαo are as follows: CACTCCCCATTTCTGCTGTCTCCTC is for Gαt2, CTCCCCGGCCTCCTCAGACGACCTT is for Gαt1, and CCTCTGCGCTCAGCGTACATCCCAT is for Gαo. Mouse F9 clones expressing Fz2 were treated with morpholino antisense oligo according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (17Ma L. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30990-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after morpholino antisense treatment, cells were stimulated without or with Wnt5a (50 ng/ml) for 15 min and p38 kinase activity was assessed. The expression levels of target proteins were evaluated by immunoblotting. Treatment of Cells with siRNA—F9 cells expressing Fz2 were grown to ∼60% confluence. siRNA (final concentration = 100 nm) was introduced into cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in the presence of siRNA for additional 48 h according to the manufacturer's recommendation. siRNAs targeting either mouse p38α (cat. SC-44217) or human p38α (cat. SC-29433) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PDE Activity Assay—F9 cells stably expressing Fz2 were seeded onto 12-well plates. siRNA treatment was performed 48 h prior to the Wnt5a (50 ng/ml) stimulation, as described previously. After incubation with Wnt5a for 15 min, cells were collected and homogenized in the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 2 mm MgCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Twelve milligrams of cytosol fraction of cell lysates (∼1 ml) were applied to a Resource Q chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The starting buffer was 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with 50 mm NaCl; the washing buffer was 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with 300 mm NaCl. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (50-300 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. PDE6 in the eluted fractions was identified by immunoblotting. PDE6 activity was measured from the three fractions containing immunostained PDE6. Briefly, 50 μl of samples were employed in a total volume of a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgSO4, 100 μm cGMP, and 0.02 μCi of purified [3H]cGMP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by heat denaturation, 2 min at 100 °C. To convert GMP to guanosine, 0.1 unit/reaction of alkaline phosphatase (P-5931, Sigma) were added to each sample, and the reaction was conducted for 20 min at 25 °C. The labeled guanosine was separated by AG 1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) and quantified by scintillation counting. PDE6 activity is expressed as the mean value (cpm) of three separate samplings. Expression of Constitutively Active G Protein α-Subunits—Gln to Leu substitution mutants of G protein α-subunits: Gαt2 (Q204L), GαoA (G205L), and Gαq (Q209L) were purchased from UMR cDNA Resource Center (University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO). F9 cells stably expressing Fz2 were plated onto 12-well plates and transiently transfected with an expression vector harboring either Gαt2 (Q204L), GαoA (G205L), or Gαq (Q209L) by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with Wnt5a for 15 min, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—The experiments were conducted at least in triplicate. All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. Comparisons of data among groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance (p value of less than 0.05) is denoted with asterisks or pound symbols. Wnt5a Activates p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase—Mouse F9 clones expressing rat Frizzled-2 (Fz2) were treated with purified Wnt5a for up to 2 h and the activity of p38 MAPK assayed. In response to stimulation with Wnt5a, p38 activity increases, as measured by the phosphorylation of the substrate ATF2 (Fig. 1A). ATF2 is a transcription factor that is a member of the leucine zipper family of DNA-binding proteins. Phosphorylated ATF2 (p-ATF2) was detected within 5 min of stimulation of the cells with Wnt5a. The amount of p-ATF2 increases progressively to 30 min, declining to basal levels from 60-120-min post-stimulation with Wnt5a. The amount of p38, established by immunoblotting, was unchanged by the treatment with Wnt5a. Clones expressing Fz1, rather than Fz2, display no significant accumulation of p-ATF2. To further test the hypothesis that Wnt5a treatment activates p38, we assayed the phosphorylation state of p38 MAPK itself, by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Wnt5a stimulates accumulation of the phosphorylated/activated form of p38 (p-p38), first detected at 5 min and peaking at 15 min following stimulation by Wnt5a (Fig. 1B). Analysis of known upstream regulators of p38 MAPK reveals that the phosphorylated/activated form of MAPK kinases (MKK) MKK3/6 (p-MKK3/6) is detected within 5 min of treatment with Wnt5a (Fig. 1C). The accumulation of p-MKK3/6 in response to stimulation with Wnt5a peaks at 30 min (Fig. 1C). These data clearly demonstrate that Wnt5a stimulates the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, culminating in the activation/phosphorylation of ATF2. Activation of p38 MAPK by Wnt5a Is G Protein (Gαt2)-mediated—Because Gαo and Gαt2 mediate Wnt5a signaling to PDE6 and Ca2+ mobilization in F9 cells (13Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Ma L. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30990-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we examined their possible involvement in the Wnt5a activation of p38 MAPK. Treating these cells with pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml, for 2 h), which inactivates both Gαo and Gαt2, abolishes the ability of Wnt5a to activate p38, as measured by accumulation of p-ATF2 (Fig. 2A). We made use of antisense morpholinos to suppress Gαt2, Gαo, or Gαt1 (as a control, Fig. 2B). The morpholinos effectively target their cognate G protein α-subunits (13Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and effectively suppressed the expression of their targets by >75% (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Fz2 expressing F9 clones treated with antisense morpholinos targeting G protein subunits were assayed for the ability of Wnt5a to stimulate p38 MAPK phosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation of ATF2 (Fig. 2C). Suppression of Gαt2 effectively abolishes the ability of Wnt5a to stimulate p38 phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 2C). Suppression of either Gαo or Gαt1, in contrast, has no effect on the Wnt5a-stimulated signaling to p38 MAPK.TABLE 1Efficiency of knockdown of G protein subunits targeted by antisense morpholinosProtein antisenseControlGαt2GαoGαt1Gαt21.00 ± 0.040.23 ± 0.04ap<0.001 for the difference from the value observed for cells that were not treated with antisense morpholinos.1.06 ± 0.040.99 ± 0.03Gαo1.00 ± 0.040.95 ± 0.080.19 ± 0.04ap<0.001 for the difference from the value observed for cells that were not treated with antisense morpholinos.0.96 ± 0.08Gαt11.00 ± 0.090.99 ± 0.111.01 ± 0.040.23 ± 0.02ap<0.001 for the difference from the value observed for cells that were not treated with antisense morpholinos.a p<0.001 for the difference from the value observed for cells that were not treated with antisense morpholinos. Open table in a new tab If Gαt2 mediates Wnt5a-stimulated activation of p38 MAPK, one would predict that expression of a constitutively activated (CA-) mutant form of this G protein α-subunit might mimic the effects of Wnt5a, in the absence of the ligand. F9 clones were transiently transfected with an empty expression vector (EV) or an expression vector harboring a CA mutant form of various G protein α-subunits. Expression of Q204LGαt2 mimics the ability of Wnt5a to stimulate activation of p38 MAPK, as measured by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies for active p38 (Fig. 2D). Treating the clones expressing Q204LGαt2 with Wnt5a does not further increase the activation of p38 MAPK observed by expression of the Q204LGαt2 alone. Expression of either Q205LGαo or Q209LGαq, in contrast, does not activate p38 MAPK signaling (Fig. 2D). Thus, on the basis of knock-down studies (Fig. 2C) and expression of CA mutant forms of Gα-subunits, Gαt2 appears to be obligate for Wnt5a to stimulate p38 MAPK. The best-known effector of Gαt2 is the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase PDE6, which has been shown to be the effector for the Gαt2-mediated, Wnt5a-stimulated decline in intracellular cyclic GMP (13Ahumada A.

Biol. 2005; 6: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based upon this knowledge, we explored if a cyclic GMP analogue (i.e. β-phenyl-1,N2-etheno-8-bromo-cGMP or 8-Br-PET-cGMP), a PDE6-selective inhibitor (zaprinast), or a protein kinase G inhibitor (i.e. 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate Rp-isomer or Rp-8-pCPT-cyclic GMP) would impact the ability of Wnt5a to stimulate the activity of p38"
https://openalex.org/W2048618922,"Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are among the most common endosymbionts in the world. In many insect species these bacteria induce a sperm-egg incompatibility between the gametes of infected males and uninfected females, commonly called unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). It is generally believed that unidirectional CI cannot promote speciation in hosts because infection differences between populations will be unstable and subsequent gene flow will eliminate genetic differences between diverging populations. In the present study we investigate this question theoretically in a mainland-island model with migration from mainland to island. Our analysis shows that (a) the infection polymorphism is stable below a critical migration rate, (b) an (initially) uninfected ""island"" can better maintain divergence at a selected locus (e.g. can adapt locally) in the presence of CI, and (c) unidirectional CI selects for premating isolation in (initially) uninfected island populations if they receive migration from a Wolbachia-infected mainland. Interestingly, premating isolation is most likely to evolve if levels of incompatibility are intermediate and if either the infection causes fecundity reductions or Wolbachia transmission is incomplete. This is because under these circumstances an infection pattern with an infected mainland and a mostly uninfected island can persist in the face of comparably high migration. We present analytical results for all three findings: (a) a lower estimation of the critical migration rate in the presence of local adaptation, (b) an analytical approximation for the gene flow reduction caused by unidirectional CI, and (c) a heuristic formula describing the invasion success of mutants at a mate preference locus. These findings generally suggest that Wolbachia-induced unidirectional CI can be a factor in divergence and speciation of hosts."

We recently identified a novel member of the Ant family in mouse, Ant4, of which gene configuration as well as amino acid homology is well conserved among mammals. The conservation of Ant4 in mammals, along with the absence of Ant4 in nonmammalian species, suggests a unique and indispensable role for this ADP/ATP carrier in mammalian development. Of interest, in contrast to its paralog Ant2, which is encoded by the X chromosome and ubiquitously expressed in somatic cells, Ant4 is encoded by an autosome and selectively expressed in testicular germ cells. Immunohistochemical examination as well as RNA expression analysis using separated spermatogenic cell types revealed that Ant4 expression was particularly high in spermatocytes. When we generated Ant4-deficient mice by targeted disruption, a significant reduction in testicular size was observed without any other distinguishable abnormalities in the mice. Histological examination as well as stage-specific gene expression analysis in adult and neonatal testes revealed a severe reduction of spermatocytes accompanied by increased apoptosis. Subsequently, the Ant4-deficient male mice were infertile. Taken together, these data elucidated the indispensable role of Ant4 in murine spermatogenesis. Considering the unique conservation and chromosomal location of the Ant family genes in mammals, the Ant4 gene may have arisen in mammalian ancestors and been conserved in mammals to serve as the sole and essential mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier during spermatogenesis where the sex chromosome-linked Ant2 gene is inactivated.

The Ant proteins are the most abundant proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane and are comprised of ∼300-320 amino acid residues that form six transmembrane helices. The functional unit is likely a homodimer acting as a gated pore that channels single molecules of ADP and ATP (13Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Until recently, it has been believed that humans posses three members of the ANT family of genes: ANT1 (SLC25A4), which is expressed primarily in the heart and skeletal muscle; ANT2 (SLC25A5), which is expressed in rapidly growing cells and is inducible; and ANT3 (SLC25A6), which appears to be constitutively expressed in all tissues (14Stepien G. Torroni A. Chung A.B. Hodge J.A. Wallace D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14592-14597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lunardi J. Hurko O. Engel W.K. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15267-15270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, rodents were believed to posses only two members of the Ant family: Ant1, which is expressed at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain; and Ant2, which is expressed in all tissues but skeletal muscle (2Levy, S. E., Chen, Y., Graham, B. H., and Wallace D. C. (200) Gene (Amst.) 254, 57-66Google Scholar). Mouse Ant2 is the ortholog of human ANT2 and seems to combine the functions of human ANT2 and ANT3 (16Ellison J.W. Salido E.C. Shapiro L.J.

Genetic inactivation of Ant1 resulted in viable mice (3Graham B.H. Waymire K.G. Cottrell B. Trounce I.A. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, these animals developed mitochondrial myopathy and severe exercise intolerance along with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3Graham B.H. Waymire K.G. Cottrell B. Trounce I.A. MacGregor G.R.

Lamantea E. Forrero I. Zebiani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3079-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In humans, there is a clinical manifestation known as autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia that is associated with ANT1 as well as TWINKLE and POLγ mutation (18Hirano M. DiMauro S. Nephrology. 2001; 57: 2163-2165Google Scholar). This disorder is characterized molecularly by the accumulation of numerous mitochondrial DNA mutations and clinically by the appearance of external opthalmoplegia, ptosis, and progressive skeletal muscle weakness (19Van Goethem G. Dermaut B. Lofgren A. Martin J.J. Van Broeckhoven C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In the cases of ANT1 mutation, A114P, L98P, A90D, D104G, and V289M substitutions have been reported to be associated with autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia (20Lodi T. Bove C. Fontanesi F. Viola A.M. Ferrero I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gene disruption of Ant2 in mice appears to result in embryonic to perinatal lethality, although a detailed phenotype has not yet been published (www.patentdebate.com/PATAPP/20050091704). There have been no reports regarding ANT2 or ANT3 mutations in human. Utilizing various approaches, we and others recently identified a novel member of the Ant family, Ant4, both in mouse and human (4Dolce V. Scarcia P. Lacopetta D. Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N.

The mouse Ant4 gene was predicted to encode a 320-amino acid protein and shared amino acid sequence homology with the other mouse Ant proteins previously identified (70.1 and 69.1% overall amino acid identity to Ant1 and Ant2, respectively). The Ant4 gene also contained three tandem repeats of a domain of ∼100 residues, each domain containing two transmembrane regions, a characteristic shared by all members of the Ant family (22Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L. Kroemer G. Brenner C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Dolce et al. (4Dolce V. Scarcia P. Lacopetta D. Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human ANT4 indeed localizes to mitochondria in cells and can actively exchange ADP for ATP by an electrogenic antiport mechanism in vitro. Of interest, the Ant4 gene is expressed selectively in the testis, both in mouse and human (5Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Kim Y.H. Haidl G. Schaefer M. Egner U. Herr J.C. Dev. Biol. 2007; 302: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, neither the exact expression pattern in testis nor the specific function of Ant4 has been determined. The present study demonstrates an indispensable role for Ant4 in male germ cell development in mice and discusses the molecular evolution of Ants in mammals. Immunostaining—Testes were harvested from 6-week-old wild type or mutant male mice. All of the mice have been maintained under standard specific pathogen-free conditions, and the procedures performed on the mice were reviewed and approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The tissues were then fixed in a mild fixative (10% formalin) overnight with rocking. Following fixation the tissues were dehydrated using an organic solvent (PBS-Citrasol). The tissues were then imbedded in paraffin and sectioned. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human testis tissue was obtained through the University of Florida Department of Pathology tissue bank. Use of human tissue was performed in accordance with IRB-approved protocols at the University of Florida. The tissues were rehydrated with organic solvent (PBS-Citrasol) of decreasing concentrations. Deparaffinized and rehydrated 5-μm tissue sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against mouse Ant4 (5Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or a cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). The slides were blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity and then unmasked in target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Antibody was applied at 1:600 (Ant4) or 1:200 (Caspase-3) for 1 h at room temperature prior to identification using the diaminobenzidine (DAB) Envision kit (Dako). An isotype and concentration matched negative control section was included for each tissue. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunostaining of human ANT4, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the N-terminal human ANT4 peptide (REPAKKKAEKRLFDC) and purified through an affinity column using the same peptide (Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). Preparation of Stage-specific Spermatogenic Cells—Stage-specific spermatogenic cells were prepared from neonatal, prepubertal, and adult CD-1 mice by sedimentation through a 2-4% bovine serum albumin “Sta Put” gradient at unit gravity as described previously (24McCarrey J.R. Thomas K. Nature. 1987; 326: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 44Khalil A.M. Boyar F.Z. Driscoll D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16583-16587Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Specifically, primitive type A spermatogonia were recovered from testis of male mice at 6 days postpartum. Similarly, type A and type B spermatogonia were recovered from males at 8 days postpartum; preleptotene, leptotene + zygotene, and juvenile pachytene spermatocytes were recovered from males at 18 days postpartum; and adult pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and residual cytoplasmic bodies were recovered from males at 60+ days postpartum. The purities of recovered cell types were assessed on the basis of morphological characteristics when viewed under phase optics and were ≥85% for prospermatogonia, spermatogonia, and juvenile spermatocytes (preleptotene, leptotene plus zygotene, and juvenile pachytene) and ≥95% for adult pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (44Khalil A.M. Boyar F.Z. Driscoll D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16583-16587Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNA aqueous kit (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized using the HiCapacity cDNA archive kit using random primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real time PCR was performed using the TaqMan gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each 20-μl reaction consisted of 10 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, No AmpErase-UNG, 1 μl of TaqMan gene expression assay mix, for β-actin (VIC-labeled), Ant4 (FAM-labeled), or Ant2 (FAM-labeled), and 9 μl of cDNA (50 ng) (primer sequences available upon request). The reactions were performed using Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR instrument. Gene expression analysis was performed using the comparative CT method using β-actin for normalization. Targeting Vector Construction—The targeting vector was designed to replace exons 2-4 of the mouse Ant4 gene with an SV40 splicing donor/acceptor signal-IRES (internal ribosomal entry site)-βgal-and PGKneor (neomycin-resistant gene cassette driven by the PGK promoter) cassette of the pNF-SIBN targeting vector. The targeting construct was generated by sequential subcloning of the 5′ homology arm, 3′ homology arm, and diphtheria toxin gene into the pNF-SIBN vector. A 2.0-kb fragment containing exon 1 and a 5.3-kb fragment containing exons 5-6 was amplified from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell (R1, 129/SvJ strain) genomic DNA and used as the source of 5′ and 3′ homologous arms for the targeting constructs, respectively. Targeting arms were amplified by LA Taq PCR system (Takara, Madison, WI) with the following primers Ant4-5.f (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTCTCATTGTTTTAACTGGATACGTG), Ant4-5.r (5′-GCGTGTCGACTGGCCCTGCCATTCTCCAAAACACC), Ant4-3.f (5′-CCCGCTCGAGGTAATTGGTGACTTTAAGTGG), and Ant4-3.r (5′-GCGTGTCGACTGCTCATAAATGGACTCTGGG). The homologous arms were cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Following excision from pCR2.1-TOPO vectors, the 5′ homologous arm was ligated into the XhoI site, and the 3′ homologous arm was ligated into the SalI site in the pNF-SIBN targeting vector. To increase selection efficiency of positive clones, we inserted the negative selection gene (diphtheria toxin) into the XhoI site. Generation of Ant4-/- Mice—The targeting vector was linearized with SalI digestion and transfected into J1 ES cells by electroporation as we previously described (23Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from ∼450 G418-resistant colonies was screened, and homologous recombination in ES cells was confirmed by genomic Southern blotting as previously described (23Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Upon initial Southern blot screening with a 5′ external probe followed by confirmation with a 3′ internal probe, three successfully targeted ES clones were identified. ES cells from one positive clone were injected into blastocysts of the C57BL/6 (B6) strain. Chimeric male mice were mated with females on a B6 background. Immunoblotting—We used testis and heart samples from 6-week-old mice for Western blotting. For testis and heart, the tissues were frozen using liquid nitrogen and mechanically minced with a razor blade. We then lysed the cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 35 μg of total protein was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following were used as primary antibodies: the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ant4 as we previously described (5Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), anti-Ant1 and Ant2 antibodies provided by Douglas C. Wallace (UC Irvine); actin (sc-1615 Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (RDI-TRK5G4 - 6C5 Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ). Peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz) was used as the secondary antibody, followed by enhanced ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR Analysis—We isolated total RNA from testes of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant 6-week-old mice using the RNA aqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript II first strand synthesis system with oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). For each gene, the DNA primers were designed on different exons to ensure that the PCR product represented the mRNA and not genomic DNA (primer sequences available upon request). TUNEL Assay—Paraformaldehyde fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and water. The slides were then placed in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and permeabilized by exposure to 6 min of microwave irradiation (350 W). Staining was performed using and in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL reaction mixture containing TdT and fluorescein-dUTP was incubated on the slides for 1 h at 37 °C, with negative control slides receiving labeling mixture devoid of TdT enzyme. After three washes in 1× PBS, slides were coverslipped using Vector-shield with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vectorlabs, Burlingame, CA). In some experiments, fluorescein-dUTP was visualized using anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. X-Gal Staining—Testes were harvested from 6-week-old wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), and homozygous (-/-) mutant male mice and dissected into two equal halves. The tissues were then fixed in a mild fixative for ∼10-15 min. Following brief fixation, X-gal staining was carried out overnight with rocking, to prevent misshaping of the organ. The samples then underwent post fixation to further ensure the integrity of the tissue. Following post fixation the tissues were dehydrated using an organic solvent (PBS-Citrasol). The tissues were then imbedded in paraffin and sectioned. Following paraffin imbedding, the tissues were rehydrated with organic solvent (PBS-Citrasol) of decreasing concentrations. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The Autosomal Ant4 Gene Is Conserved in Mammals—The deduced amino acid sequence of Ant4 is well conserved among mammals (around or over 90%) (Table 1); however, a phylogram indicates that Ant4 is relatively distant from the other mammalian Ant family peptides, Ant1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1). Indeed, the amino acid identity between Ant4 and other Ants is ∼70%. Of interest, the gene configuration of Ant4 is also well conserved among mammals but different from that of other Ant members. The Ant4 gene always consists of six exons, whereas the other Ants have four exons in all mammalian species investigated. Another distinguishing characteristic of mammalian Ants is in their chromosomal location. The Ant1 gene, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, is on an autosome. The Ant2 gene, which is ubiquitously expressed in somatic organs, is encoded by the X chromosome and the Ant3 gene, which has been identified in only a portion of mammalian species so far, including human, cow, and dog, is also located on the X chromosome. Rodents apparently do not have the Ant3 ortholog, based on a search of the published genome data bases. Ant3 has the highest homology with Ant2 and is ubiquitously expressed in somatic organs like Ant2. It should be noted that the human ANT3 gene is localized to the tip of the short arm (Xp22) of the X chromosome, which is known as pseudoautosomal region 1. In contrast to Ant2 and Ant3, the Ant4 gene is always encoded by an autosome. Moreover, in contrast to Ant1 and Ant2, of which orthologs are found in other species including amphibians and fish, the Ant4 gene apparently exists only in mammals including the marsupials (Table 1). Ant4 is found in both eutherian and metatherian species, suggesting the presence of Ant4 in their common therian ancestor. The eutherian radiation event representing the divergence of eutherian and metatherian lineages occurred ∼150 million years ago, suggesting that the emergence of Ant4 occurred at least 150 million years ago (24McCarrey J.R. Thomas K. Nature. 1987; 326: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Wang P.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), relatively close to the origin of mammals (∼200 million years ago).TABLE 1Chromosomal location, number of exons, and deduced amino acid identities of the Ant1, 2, 3, and 4 genesSpeciesChromosome locationExon numberAmino acid identitiesEnsembl gene ID%Ant1 (slc25a4), skeletal muscle and heart Homo sapiens44100cAmino acid identities are compared with the human ortholog.ENSG00000151729 Macaca mulatta54100ENSMMUG00000015472 Mus musculus8495ENSMUSG00000031633 Rattus norvegicus16495ENSRNOG00000010830 Bos taurus27495ENSBTAG00000013208 Monodelphis domestica5494ENSMODG00000004639 Canis familiaris16492ENSCAFG00000007596 Danio rerio1488ENSDARG00000027355 Xenopus tropicalisNA489ENSXETP00000009435Ant2 (slc25a5), somatic cells H. sapiensX4100ENSG00000005022 M. musculusX498ENSMUSG00000016319 R. norvegicusX498ENSRNOG00000039980 B. taurusX497ENSBTAG00000020245 C. familiarisX497ENSCAFG00000018384 D. rerio14492ENSDARG00000053529 X. tropicalisNAaNA, not available.491ENSXETG00000025466Ant3 (slc25a6), somatic cells H. sapiensX, YbAnt3 is on a pseudoautosomal region of X and Y chromosomes.4100 (92)dAnt3 sequence was also compared with human Ant2 paralog.ENSG00000169100 B. taurusX, Y497 (92)ENSBTAG00000013487Ant4 (slc25a31), male germ cells H. sapiens46100ENSG00000151475 Pan troglodytes4699ENSPTRG00000016432 M. mulatta5699ENSMMUG00000015243 M. musculus3688ENSMUSG00000069041 B. taurus17691ENSBTAG00000012826 C. familiaris19690ENSCAFG00000003924 M. domestica5688ENSMODG00000012128a NA, not available.b Ant3 is on a pseudoautosomal region of X and Y chromosomes.c Amino acid identities are compared with the human ortholog.d Ant3 sequence was also compared with human Ant2 paralog.

Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, because of the limited resolution we obtained during immunostaining of cryopreserved tissues, we were unable to further define the exact expression profile of the protein within the testis. Here, paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues were utilized to obtain a more precise expression pattern of Ant4 in mouse testis. Of interest, it appears that the Ant4 protein expression is highest in spermatocytes among testicular germ cells, based upon nuclear morphology and position within the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2A). We also examined the expression pattern of ANT4 in human testis samples using polyclonal antibodies raised against human ANT4 and were able to more clearly distinguish the cell types within which ANT4 was expressed (Fig. 2B). The human immunohistochemistry data provided us with evidence that primary spermatocytes express the highest levels of the ANT4 protein, whereas spermatogonial cells express a lower level. Importantly, Sertoli cells or other somatic interstitial cells did not express ANT4. To further define stage-specific expression of Ant4 in male germ cells, we analyzed Ant4 mRNA expression in separated spermatogenic cell types of mouse using real time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). Ant4 transcript levels began to increase upon transition of premeiotic type B spermatogonia into the early stages of meiosis as represented by preleptotene spermatocytes. The transcript level of Ant4 continued to increase through the leptotene and zygotene spermatocyte stages, peaking in early pachytene spermatocytes. Ant4 transcript levels then began to decrease in late pachytene spermatocytes and in later round spermatids. Thus, high levels of Ant4 expression are likely associated with entry of the male germ cells into meiosis. In contrast, the fraction enriching Sertoli cells expressed a very low level of Ant4. We also confirmed here, by real time RT-PCR, that the Ant4 transcript is very low or undetectable in somatic organs and ovary. It should be noted here that, in contrast to a previous observation using a cryopreserved specimen (5Rodic N. Oka M. Hamazaki T. Murawski M.R. Jorgensen M. Maatouk D.M. Resnick J.L. Li E. Terada N. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), developing oocytes did not show any detectable Ant4 expression in paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues (supplemental Fig. S1). Using the same RNA samples prepared for the study above, we also investigated the expression pattern of the Ant2 gene in various organs and spermatogenic cell types (Fig. 2C). Of interest, the expression profile of Ant2 in mice was reciprocal to that of Ant4. The Ant2 transcript was high in somatic organs, but relatively low in whol"

Its potential as a model in which to study tumour suppressor and oncogene function is now being realized. Whilst in situ hybridization of mRNA has been well developed in this species to study gene expression, antibody probes are in short supply. We have, therefore, generated a panel of anti-zebrafish p53 monoclonal antibodies and used these to study the p53 response in zebrafish embryos. By immunohistochemistry, we show that the exposure of zebrafish embryos to p53-activating agents such as R-roscovitine and gamma-irradiation results in the accumulation of p53 protein in the gut epithelium, liver and pancreas. A combination of R-roscovitine and gamma-irradiation results in massive p53 induction, not only in the pharyngeal arches, gut region and liver but also in brain tissues. Induction of apoptosis and expression of p53 response genes are seen in regions that correspond to sites of p53 protein accumulation. In contrast, although zebrafish tp53(M214K) mutant embryos showed a similar accumulation of p53 protein, a complete lack of a downstream p53-dependent response was observed. In this system the p53 gene is identified as a p53-responsive gene itself. Our results demonstrate that zebrafish p53 protein can readily be induced in embryos and detected using these new antibody tools, which will increase the usefulness of zebrafish as a model in compound-based screening for novel drugs in cancer research."

SNX9 is widely expressed and plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but it is not known if it is present in neuronal cells. We report that SNX9 is expressed in the presynaptic compartment of cultured hippocampal neurons, where it binds to dynamin-1 and N-WASP. Overexpression of full-length SNX9 or a C-terminal truncated version caused severe defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis during, as well as after, stimulation. Knockdown of SNX9 with short interfering RNA also reduced synaptic vesicle endocytosis, and the W39A mutation of SNX9 abolished the inhibitory effect of SNX9 on endocytosis. Rescue experiments showed that most of the effect of SNX9 on endocytosis results from its interaction with dynamin 1, although its interaction with N-WASP contributes in some degree. We further showed that SNX9 dimerizes through its C-terminal domain, suggesting that it may interact simultaneously with dynamin 1 and N-WASP. We propose that SNX9 interacts with dynamin-1 and N-WASP in presynaptic terminals, where it links actin dynamics and synaptic vesicle endocytosis.

Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It also enhances the assembly of dynamin and increases its GTPase activity (6Soulet F. Yarar D. Leonard M. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Other endocytic molecules, namely AP-2 (adaptor protein complex 2) and clathrin, also bind to the low complexity region of SNX9 in a cooperative manner (2Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol.

Dynamin is centrally involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 8Sever S. Curr. Opin.

It self-assembles around the necks of invaginated clathrin-coated pits and releases vesicles from the membrane via GTP hydrolysis (9Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). It is composed of several domains. The N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain is responsible for GTP hydrolysis, and the C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) links it to several SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2, amphiphysin, and endophilin (10Gout I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and a coiled-coil domain (also called the GTPase effector domain) is involved in its self-assembly and in regulating its GTPase activity. The affinity between the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin and lipids is not high enough to translocate dynamin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Rather, truncation of the PRD of dynamin blocks endocytosis because of mislocation of the protein (13Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) suggesting that it is the interaction of the PRD with SH3-containing domains of other endocytic molecules that is the key to the correct localization and functioning of dynamin. Because of the mechanistic similarity between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in non-neuronal cells and synaptic vesicle endocytosis, SNX9 is suspected of having a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. However, the presence of SNX9 in neuronal cells and the functional interplay between it and its presynaptic binding partners in synaptic vesicle endocytosis have never been studied. Here we report that SNX9 is expressed in the presynaptic compartment of cultured hippocampal neurons where it associates with dynamin-1 as well as N-WASP, and that it plays a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Because SNX9 can be dimerized, and binds dynamin at one end and N-WASP at the other, our data raise the possibility that it links actin dynamics and synaptic vesicle endocytosis. GST Pulldown Assays—The GST-SNX9, GST-SNX9-SH3, GST-SNX9ΔSH3, and GST-virgin vector plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21, and the transformants were cultured in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin. After overnight induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C, the cultures were sonicated in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-agarose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a brain lysate in lysis buffer. The beads were then washed extensively with lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation—To detect SNX9 binding to dynamin-1 in vivo, COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-SNX9 and FLAG-SNX9-ΔSH3 together with GFP-dynamin-1 using Liopofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and extracted for 1 h at 4 °C in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm aprotinin). They were then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Samples containing 1 mg of total protein were immunoprecipitated for 4 h with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by an additional 3 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies. In-gel Digestion and Peptide Sample Preparation—The SDS-polyacrylamide gels were silver-stained, and protein bands were excised. The resulting samples were washed three times with a 1:1 (v/v) solution of acetonitrile/deionized water for 10 min, dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, washed with a 1:1 (v/v) solution of 100% acetonitrile, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and dried using a SpeedVac. Then they were reduced with 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 45 min and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 30 min. The above washing step was repeated on the alkylated samples, which were dried, soaked in sequencing-grade trypsin solution (500 ng) on ice for 45 min, and immersed in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 14-18 h. The resulting peptides were extracted sequentially by agitation for 20 min with 45% acetonitrile in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 45% acetonitrile in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 75% acetonitrile in 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts containing tryptic peptides were pooled and evaporated under vacuum. Micro-LC-MS/MS Analysis and Protein Data Base Search—In gel digested proteins were loaded onto fused silica capillary columns (100-μm inner diameter, 360-μm outer diameter) containing 8 cm of 5-μm particle size Aqua C18 reverse-phase column material. The columns were placed in line with an Agilent HP 1100 quaternary LC pump, and a splitter system was used to achieve a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Buffer A (5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) were used to make a 90-min gradient. The gradient profile started with 5 min of 100% buffer A, followed by a 60-min gradient from 0 to 55% buffer B, a 25-min gradient from 55 to 100% buffer B, and a 5-min gradient of 100% buffer B. Eluted peptides were directly electrosprayed into an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Palo Alto, CA) by applying 2.3 kV of DC voltage. Data-dependent scans consisting of one full MS scan (400-1400 m/z) and five data-dependent MS/MS scans were used to generate MS/MS spectra of the eluted peptides. A normalized collision energy of 35% was used throughout data acquisition. MS/MS spectra were searched against an NCBI rat protein sequence data base using Bioworks version 3.1 and Sequest Cluster System (14 nodes). DTASelect was used to filter the search results, and the following Xcorr values were applied to the different charge states of peptides: 1.8 for singly charged peptides, 2.2 for doubly charged peptides, and 3.2 for triply charged peptides. Fragment ions in each MS/MS spectrum were manually assigned to confirm the data base search results. Cell Culture—E-18 primary rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as described (15Chang S. De Camilli P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley fetal rats, dissociated with papain, and triturated with a polished half-bore Pasteur pipette. Cells (250,000) in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.6% glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in a 60-mm Petri dish. Four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with basal media Eagle's (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm pyruvate or Neurobasal (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27, 0.5 mm l-glutamine. 4 μm of 1-β-d-cytosine-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C, Sigma) was added as needed. Transfection—Neurons were transfected using calcium-phosphate (15Chang S. De Camilli P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptopHluorin (spH) alone or with either FLAG-tagged full-length SNX9 or its truncated variants were transfected at 10 DIV for the endocytosis assays. The spH and SNX9 constructs were cotransfected in a ratio of 1:2-1:5. After the endocytosis assays, the cells were fixed and doubly stained with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies to confirm cotransfection, and only immunopositive neurons were included in the analysis. The amount of spH construct transfected was fixed for constant fluorescent signals. Immunoblot Analysis—Hippocampal neurons (∼3,000,000) were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes coated with poly-d-lysine and grown for 3, 7, 14, or 21 days. They were lysed in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm aprotinin) and scratched out, boiled for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Constant amounts of proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to poly-vinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS/T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), after which they were incubated with the respective primary antibodies, anti-SNX9, or anti-dynamin-1 (ABR, Golden, CO), and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped by heating to 60 °C for 30 min in a stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and re-probed with anti-tubulin (Sigma) as a control. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (16Kim Y. Kim S. Lee S. Kim S.H. Kim Y. Park Z.Y. Song W.K. Chang S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9515-9523Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 4% sucrose, PBS for 15 min, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.25% Triton X-100, PBS and blocked for 30 min in 10% BSA, PBS at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies, 3% BSA, PBS for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies, 3% BSA, PBS for 45 min at 37 °C. Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-SNX9 (provided by Dr. Sven R. Carlsson, Umeå University, Sweden, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-synaptophysin, anti-synaptobrevin2, anti-synaptotagmin, anti-synaptojanin (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), anti-GFP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-dynamin-1 (ABR), anti-Hudy2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-GFAP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and anti-type β-III tubulin (Chemicon). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. SynaptopHluorin Endo-exocytosis Assay—Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion/stimulation chamber equipped with platinum-iridium field stimulus electrodes (EC-S-10, LCI, Seoul, Korea) on the stage of an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with 40 × 1.0 or 60 × 1.4 NA oil lenses. Cells were continuously perfused at room temperature with Tyrode solution (119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 30 mm glucose, pH 7.4). 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and 50 μm of dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid were added to the Tyrode solution to reduce spontaneous activity and prevent recurrent excitation during stimulation. Time-lapse images were acquired every 10 s for 4 min using a CoolSNAP-ES CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) driven by MetaMorph Imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) with a GFP optimized filter set (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). From the 4th frame, cells were stimulated (1 ms, 20-50 V, bipolar) for 30 s at 20 Hz or 30 s at 10 Hz using a Grass SD9 stimulator (Grass-Telefactor, West Warwick, RI). Quantitative measurements of the fluorescence intensity at individual boutons were obtained by averaging a selected area of pixel intensities using MetaMorph software. Individual regions were selected by hand, and rectangular regions of interest were drawn around the synaptic boutons, and average intensities were calculated. Large puncta, typically representative of clusters of smaller synapses, were rejected during the selection procedure. The center of intensity of each synapse was calculated to correct for any image shift over the course of the experiment. Fluorescence was expressed in intensity units that correspond to fluorescence values averaged over all pixels within the region of interest. Light from a mercury lamp was shuttered using a VMM1 Unibilitz shutter (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Net fluorescence changes were obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames (F0) from the intensity of each frame (Ft) for individual boutons. They were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax - F0) and averaged. The decay of fluorescence was fitted with a single exponential. All fitting was done using individual error bars to weight the fit, using SigmaPlot 6.0. In some experiments where fluorescence decay deviated from single exponential behavior, we obtained the best fitting single exponential function from the early portion of the decay. Data are presented as means ± S.E. For the rescue experiments, FLAG-SNX9 was coexpressed with HA-dynamin-1 or Myc-N-WASP; FLAG-SNX9-ΔBAR was coexpressed with HA-dynamin-1 or Myc-N-WASP, and FLAG-SNX9-SH3 was coexpressed with HA-dynamin-1-PRD. For the exocytosis assays, control neurons expressing spH, or neurons expressing FLAG-SNX9, FLAG-SNX9-ΔBAR, or FLAG-SNX9-SH3 with spH, were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 for 60 s and stimulated for 30 s at 10 Hz. Net fluorescence changes were obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames (F0) from the intensity of each frame (Ft) for individual boutons, then normalizing to the maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax - F0), and averaging. bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO to 0.2 mm and diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 μm prior to the experiments. Bafilomycin was applied throughout the fluorescence measurements. Expression of each construct was confirmed by retrospective immunostaining with specific antibodies (rabbit anti-Myc, mouse anti-FLAG, and rat-anti-HA antibodies), and only immunopositive neurons were included in the analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out with SigmaStat (Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA). For multiple conditions, we compared means by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's HSD post hoc test or Fisher's LSD test (depending on the number of groups). FM 4-64 Endocytosis Assay—FM 4-64 was used at a concentration of 15 μm in the above Tyrode solution. Pools of synaptic vesicles were labeled during electrical stimulation for 30 s at 10 Hz in the presence of FM 4-64. After 10 min of washing in dye-free Tyrode, images were taken, and neurons were stimulated for 2 min at 10 Hz to unload the FM 4-64. A fully unloaded image was then taken. Net fluorescence changes were obtained by subtracting the intensity of the unloaded image from the intensity of the loaded image. A 15-min rest period was inserted between the end of the first unloading stimulus train and the start of the second loading stimulus. Images were acquired using a CoolSNAP-ES CCD camera driven by MetaMorph Imaging software with a FM 4-64 optimized filter set (Omega Optical). Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat (Systat Software). Data are presented as means ± S.E. RNA Interference—SNX9-specific siRNAs were designed from the rat SNX9 cDNA sequence acquired by Blast search, targeting to the region of nucleotides 1183-1203 (siRNA 1, gi|2985617) and 1365-1385 (siRNA 2, gi|2942879). A pair of complementary oligonucleotides was synthesized separately with the addition of an ApaI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. The forward primer sequences were 5′-ATAGAACAGAAGTGTGACGTTCAAGAGACGTCACACTTCTGTTCTATTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGACGGACCTTAACATTCAAGAGATGTTAAGGTCCGTCTCTCCTTTTTT-3′) (the underlined letters are the SNX9-siRNA sequences). The annealed cDNA fragment was cloned into the ApaI-EcoRI sites of pSilencer 1.0-U6 vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) modified by inserting an mRFP tag at the C terminus. The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA was tested in Rat-1 cells of fibroblast origin. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with SNX9-specific siRNAs using calcium phosphate. SNX9 Is Expressed in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons and Its Expression Increases with Developmental Stage—A previous Northern blot analysis showed that SNX9 was expressed in many tissues (1Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To see whether it is expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, we performed a Western blot analysis using an SNX9 antibody. We used three different culture conditions to test the expression of SNX9 as follows: a pure glial cell culture obtained by2hof treatment with 200 μm of glutamate to remove neurons; a serum-free Neurobasal culture completely depleted of glial cells with Ara-C, and a Neurobasal culture without Ara-C treatment, containing mostly neurons and only a few glial cells. The glial cells expressed SNX9 as expected. The hippocampal neurons also expressed considerable amounts of SNX9, and expression increased as the neurons matured (Fig. 1, B-D). SNX9 Is Present at the Presynaptic Terminals of Hippocampal Neurons Where It Binds to Dynamin-1—To study the distribution and subcellular localization of SNX9 in the neurons, we performed immunocytochemistry. SNX9 was found to be present diffusely all along the neurites, and formed many clusters in the axons, and the majority of it colocalized with the presynaptic vesicle markers synaptobrevin2, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin (Fig. 2, A-I). Because SNX9 contains an SH3 domain and is present at presynaptic nerve terminals, it could bind PRD-containing proteins. Dynamin-1 is the major SH3-containing protein in the presynaptic compartment. To test whether SNX9 and dynamin-1 bind to each other via an SH3-PRD interaction, we performed a micro-LC-MS/MS analysis to identify SNX9-interacting proteins (Fig. 3A). Brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with an SNX9 antibody, and SDS-polyacrylamide gels were silver-stained. After in-gel digestion, micro-LC-MS/MS, and a protein data base search, dynamin-1 was identified as one of the endogenous binding partners (Fig. 3A). Binding of SNX9SH3 to dynamin-1 was as strong as that of endophilin-SH3 (Fig. 3B). We carried out a series of GST pulldown assays. Dynamin-1 was found to interact with full-length SNX9 and with its SH3 domain, but not with SNX9 lacking the SH3 domain (SNX9-ΔSH3) (Fig. 3, B and E). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of lysates of cells overexpressing FLAG-SNX9 and GFP-dynamin-1 confirmed that SNX9 associated with dynamin-1 in vivo in an SH3 domain-dependent interaction (Fig. 3F). We did not observe any significant change in this interaction in response to high KCl (Fig. 3G). Interaction of SNX9 with dynamin-1 was further confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Neurons were doubly stained with SNX9 and dynamin-1 antibodies. Although SNX9 exhibited rather diffuse cytosolic staining, it colocalized with dynamin-1 throughout the neurites (Fig. 3I). SNX9 Interacts with N-WASP and Synaptojanin—N-WASP is the most potent and best characterized activator of actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex (17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), and it is also enriched at nerve terminals, where it links the dynamin-mediated processes of endocytosis to rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton within nerve terminals. Drosophila SNX9 (dSH3PX1) is known to interact with the Drosophila orthologue of WASP (18Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J.C. Kruger R.P. Muda M. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We also showed that SNX9 interacts with N-WASP using micro-LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 3A). Although we could not detect N-WASP in GST pulldown followed by Coomassie staining, immunoblotting with anti-N-WASP antibody revealed that N-WASP interacted with full-length SNX9 and with its SH3 domain, but not with SNX9 lacking the SH3 domain (SNX9-ΔSH3) (Fig. 3E). Co-immunoprecipitation of lysates of cells overexpressing FLAG-SNX9 and GFP-N-WASP cells confirmed that SNX9 indeed interacts with N-WASP in vivo in an SH3 domain-dependent interaction (Fig. 3F). Previous study showed that SNX9 interacts with synaptojanin (4Yeow-Fong L. Lim L. Manser E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5040-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Synaptojanin is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling and vesicle trafficking (19Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Synaptojanin, however, was not detected in Coomassie staining (Fig. 3B) and only faintly visible in silver staining (Fig. 3C, arrow), suggesting very weak binding. The interaction of synaptojanin with SH3 domain of SNX9 further confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-synaptojanin antibody (Fig. 3C). SNX9 contains a single SH3 domain at its N terminus, by which it interacts with dynamin-1 and N-WASP. This raised the possibility that it dimerizes. Fig. 3H shows that SNX9 indeed dimerizes and that it does so via its BAR domain. Thus, our results suggest that SNX9 can dimerize, thus binding dynamin-1 and N-WASP simultaneously and coordinating clathrin-mediated endocytosis with the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of SNX9 Impairs Clathrin-mediated Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis—We investigated whether the interaction between SNX9 and dynamin-1 could be involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. To measure synaptic vesicle endocytosis in the cultured hippocampal neurons we used synaptopHluorin (spH) (Fig. 4A). spH is a VAMP-2/synaptobrevin-2 fused with a pH-sensitive variant of GFP. The fluorescence of spH is quenched once synaptic vesicles are endocytosed and re-acidified (from external pH ∼7.4 to an internal pH of a synaptic vesicle ∼5.5). It has been proved that re-acidification is not a rate-limiting step; thus the fluorescence change to synapto-pHluorin reliably reflects the kinetics of endocytosis (20Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of SNX9 on endocytosis, FLAG-tagged SNX9 or truncated SNX9 variants were cotransfected with spH into hippocampal neurons. We confirmed by retrospective immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody at the end of each experiment that the neurons expressing spH also expressed FLAG-tagged SNX9 or the truncated variants of SNX9. When neurons were stimulated electrically (600 action potentials/20 Hz), the fluorescence intensity of individual spH boutons increased rapidly, reached a peak, and then decayed with an exponential time course (Fig. 4A). In boutons expressing SNX9, synaptic vesicle endocytosis occurred much more slowly than in nonexpressing boutons (τ = 182.4 ± 28.9 for SNX9 expression; τ = 39.2 ± 3.4 for control; Fig. 4, A, C and D). In previous studies, inhibition of endocytosis was observed with the SH3-containing truncated variant (SNX9-ΔBAR) (2Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract"

The absolute risk reduction of reporting persistent back pain in the intervention group was 3.6% lower than in the control group (10.5% vs. 14.1%; 95% confidence interval [-6.3% ; -1.0%]; p value adjusted for cluster effect = 0.01). Patients in the intervention group were more satisfied than those in the control group with the information they received about physical activities, when to consult their physician, and how to prevent a new episode of LBP. However, the number of patients who had taken sick leave was similar, as was the mean sick-leave duration, in both arms, and, among patients with persistent pain at follow-up, the intervention and control groups did not differ in disability or fear-avoidance beliefs.The level of improvement of an information booklet is modest, but the cost and complexity of the intervention is minimal. Therefore, the implications and generalizability of this intervention are substantial.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00343057."
https://openalex.org/W2115786687,"Alzheimer disease-associated β-amyloid peptide is generated from its precursor protein APP. By using the yeast two-hybrid assay, here we identified HtrA2/Omi, a stress-responsive chaperone-protease as a protein binding to the N-terminal cysteinerich region of APP. HtrA2 coimmunoprecipitates exclusively with immature APP from cell lysates as well as mouse brain extracts and degrades APP in vitro. A subpopulation of HtrA2 localizes to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane where it contributes to ER-associated degradation of APP together with the proteasome. Inhibition of the proteasome results in accumulation of retrotranslocated forms of APP and increased association of APP with HtrA2 and Derlin-1 in microsomal membranes. In cells lacking HtrA2, APP holoprotein is stabilized and accumulates in the early secretory pathway correlating with elevated levels of APP C-terminal fragments and increased Aβ secretion. Inhibition of ER-associated degradation (either HtrA2 or proteasome) promotes binding of APP to the COPII protein Sec23 suggesting enhanced trafficking of APP out of the ER. Based on these results we suggest a novel function for HtrA2 as a regulator of APP metabolism through ER-associated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2167841323,"We constructed a simple and compact imaging system designed specifically for the recording of fast neuronal activity in a 3D volume. The system uses an Yb:KYW femtosecond laser we designed for use with acousto-optic deflection. An integrated two-axis acousto-optic deflector, driven by digitally synthesized signals, can target locations in three dimensions. Data acquisition and the control of scanning are performed by a LeCroy digital oscilloscope. The total cost of construction was one order of magnitude lower than that of a typical Ti:sapphire system. The entire imaging apparatus, including the laser, fits comfortably onto a small rig for electrophysiology. Despite the low cost and simplicity, the convergence of several new technologies allowed us to achieve the following capabilities: i) full-frame acquisition at video rates suitable for patch clamping; ii) random access in under ten microseconds with dwelling ability in the nominal focal plane; iii) three-dimensional random access with the ability to perform fast volume sweeps at kilohertz rates; and iv) fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the ability to record action potentials with high temporal resolution using intracellularly loaded potentiometric dye di-2-ANEPEQ. Our design proffers easy integration with electrophysiology and promises a more widespread adoption of functional two-photon imaging as a tool for the study of neuronal activity.

The dimeric transcription factors of the AP-1 family control virtually all cell fates. They play essential roles in most major physiological processes and are involved in various pathological situations, including tumorigenesis (for reviews see Refs. 1Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev.

Consistently, AP-1 is controlled by a plethora of physiological stimuli and environmental insults operating at multiple transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels to prevent deleterious expression and/or activity. The best-studied AP-1 components are the Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra2) and Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) proteins that dimerize via a leucine zipper (LZ) 4The abbreviations used are: LZ, leucine zipper; DBD, DNA-binding domain; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; TRN1, transportin 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; NES, nuclear export signal; HA, hemagglutinin; CHX, cycloheximide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; LMB, leptomycin B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; Impβ1, importin β1; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; FLIP, fluorescence loss induced after photobleaching; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation. domain and recognize their target DNA sequences owing to an adjacent, upstream basic DNA-binding domain (DBD) (6Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Jun family members, Fos proteins cannot homodimerize. They must heterodimerize with different partners, including the Jun proteins, to form active AP-1 dimers. c-Fos (for a review, see Ref. 7Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Targeted Protein Data Base. Current Biodata Ltd., London, in press2007Google Scholar) is expressed constitutively in diverse primary tumors and cancer cell lines (3Milde-Langosch K. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2449-2461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and in certain tissues in vivo. In most other cells, it can be rapidly and transiently induced by many stimuli, including mitogens, cytokines, hormones, and stresses (4Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar), to convert them into long-term responses the nature of which depends on the cell context and the stimulus. Not only the multiplicity of its dimerization partners is important for c-Fos specificity and activity, but also the many post-translational modifications it is subjected to. Thus, c-Fos is an unstable protein undergoing proteasome-dependent degradation (8Salvat C. Jariel-Encontre I. Acquaviva C. Omura S. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Acquaviva C. Brockly F. Ferrara P. Bossis G. Salvat C. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M.

(2007) Biochimie (Paris), in pressGoogle Scholar). Proteolysis of the bulk of c-Fos is essentially ubiquitylation-independent (12Bossis G. Ferrara P. Acquaviva C. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7425-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is also the case for its Fra-1 relative (13Basbous J. Chalbos D. Hipskind R. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3936-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but can under certain conditions involve ubiquitylation (14Sasaki T. Kojima H. Kishimoto R. Ikeda A. Kunimoto H. Nakajima K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Fos transcriptional activity, which depends on multiple transactivation domains, is stimulated upon phosphorylation of various threonines in response to either oncogenic Ras GTPases or kinases of the Erk1/2 MAPK kinase pathway (for a review, see Ref. 15Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). By contrast, it is reduced upon sumoylation at a unique lysine (16Bossis G. Malnou C.E. Farras R. Andermarcher E. Hipskind R. Rodriguez M. Schmidt D. Muller S. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6964-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). One aspect of c-Fos biology that has been poorly studied is the control of intracellular localization. Usually, the protein predominantly accumulates within the nucleus (17Roux P. Blanchard J.M. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. Cell. 1990; 63: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Tratner I. Verma I.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2049-2053PubMed Google Scholar). Entry into the nucleus does not require prior LZ-dependent heterodimerization but likely depends on at least two nuclear localization signals (NLS) (18Tratner I. Verma I.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2049-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 19Campos M.A. Kroon E.G. Gentz R. Ferreira P.C. Cell Biol. Int. 1999; 23: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus far, only one NLS has been characterized in details. It consists of an arginine-rich basic motif residing within the DBD (amino acids 139-160) (18Tratner I. Verma I.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2049-2053PubMed Google Scholar). c-Fos displays high in vitro affinity for importin β1 (Impβ1) (20Forwood J.K. Lam M.H. Jans D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5208-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a member of the importin β superfamily of nuclear transport receptors that recruit protein cargoes within the cytoplasm, address them to the nucleopore complex, and mediate their translocation through the nucleopore complex (21Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 22Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). More recently, a digitonin-permeabilized cell-based in vitro assay suggested that c-Fos nuclear transport may rather involve two importins, one being Impβ1, through interaction with the basic NLS, the other being transportin 1 (TRN1), interacting with an unidentified upstream NLS (23Arnold M. Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this biochemical assay, the TNR1- and Impβ1-dependent pathways showed mutual exclusion with TNR1 appearing more efficient for c-Fos nuclear import. c-Fos is also found cytoplasmic in various situations. Its transport into the nucleus depends on extra- and intracellular signals that may be absent depending on the conditions. Thus, in cells constitutively expressing it, c-Fos progressively becomes exclusively cytoplasmic within a few hours upon removal of serum from the culture medium (17Roux P. Blanchard J.M. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. Cell. 1990; 63: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Vriz S. Lemaitre J.M. Leibovici M. Thierry N. Mechali M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3548-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Preferential cytoplasmic localization associated with faster turnover is also observed when endogenous c-Fos is induced by STAT3 signaling under conditions where the Erk5 kinase pathway is inactivated (14Sasaki T. Kojima H. Kishimoto R. Ikeda A. Kunimoto H. Nakajima K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This intracellular redistribution seems to depend, at least in part, on c-Fos nuclear export by the Crm-1 exportin (14Sasaki T. Kojima H. Kishimoto R. Ikeda A. Kunimoto H. Nakajima K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a fraction of c-Fos associates with the endoplasmic reticulum to activate phospholipid metabolism in a transcription activity-independent manner (25Bussolino D.F. Guido M.E. Gil G.A. Borioli G.A. Renner M.L. Grabois V.R. Conde C.B. Caputto B.L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This appears to be required for neurite elongation (26Gil G.A. Bussolino D.F. Portal M.M. Pecchio A.A. Renner M.L. Borioli G.A. Guido M.E. Caputto B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1881-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting a physiological cytoplasmic role for c-Fos in addition to its long known nuclear one in transcription. Finally, cytoplasmic retention of c-Fos is reversed upon activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (17Roux P. Blanchard J.M. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. Cell. 1990; 63: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and upon that of p38 MAPKs by UV irradiation (27Tanos T. Marinissen M.J. Leskow F.C. Hochbaum D. Martinetto H. Gutkind J.S. Coso O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18842-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The afore-mentioned observations suggest that actively regulated nucleocytoplasmic traffic may contribute to c-Fos activity regulation. We have therefore combined genetic, cell biology, and microscopic studies to investigate c-Fos nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, including when the protein is essentially nuclear, to characterize more precisely c-Fos second NLS and to assess the actual roles of Impβ1 and TRN1 in its nuclear import in vivo.

Paraformaldehyde was from Electron Microscopy Sciences, Permafluor from Shandon Immunon, and complete mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets from Roche Applied Science. CHX and LMB were used at final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 20 to 100 nm, respectively.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar) is a kind gift from E. Wagner. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (35Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.

Transfections were routinely carried out using 3 μg of plasmid per 106 cells. When necessary, 3 μg of pDsRed2 or pDsRed-m-C1 were also co-transfected. Transfection time was limited to 16 h to avoid overexpression, except for BiFC experiments where cells were incubated for another 8 h at 30 °C before PEG-mediated fusion to allow for optimal renaturation of YFP. Heterokaryon Experiments—Heterokaryon assays were essentially performed as described by Roth et al. (36Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J.

To investigate endogenous c-Fos protein nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, BALB/c 3T3 cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and, then, stimulated by addition of fresh medium containing 20% serum. 1 h later, freshly trypsinized HeLa cells, previously transfected with the pDsRed2-C1 plasmid for 16 h, were added in the presence of CHX. After another 2 h, i.e. time sufficient for cell spreading, coverslips were quickly rinsed in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7), covered with a 50% w/v solution of PEG for 2 min, again carefully washed with PBS, and, finally, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in fresh medium containing 10% serum and CHX. Cells were then fixed and treated for microscopic examination. To study shuttling efficiency at low temperature, HeLa cells transfected with appropriate expression plamids were PEG-fused with BALB/c 3T3 cells, let at 37 °C for 15 min to allow completion of heterokaryon formation, and, then, placed on ice for 45 min before cell fixation and microscope analysis. To study EGFP-c-Fos and EGFP-c-FosΔLZ shuttling during the G0/G1 transition, f10 c-fos-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts were stably transfected with expression plasmids for each one of the two proteins under the transcriptional control of a minimal c-fos promoter containing the serum-responsive element and recapitulating the transient induction of normal c-fos gene (9Acquaviva C.

Transfectants were starved for 36 h, trypsinized, stimulated by resuspension in fresh culture medium containing 20% serum, and placed over a monolayer culture of asynchronous HeLa cells grown on coverslips. One hour later, i.e. a time sufficient for transfectant attachment, cells were PEG-fused and let for another1hat 37 °C in presence of CHX before fixing and direct fluorescence microscopy analysis. For analysis of ectopic wild-type and mutant c-Fos and c-Jun proteins as well as that of EGFP chimeras, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pDsRed2-C1 and the relevant expression vector(s). 16 h later, freshly trypsinized BALB/c 3T3 cells were added in the presence of CHX, with or without LMB, for 2 h. Fusion was performed as above, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for another1hinthe presence of LMB, when needed, before treatment for microscopic examination. Localization of c-Fos at Low Temperature—For the analysis of c-Fos redistribution at low temperature, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for either EGFP/NLS/NLS or c-Fos and, 16 h later, placed on ice for 1 h before fixation and microscopic analysis. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, washed twice in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min, and, then, washed twice in PBS before incubation in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. Protein immunodetections were carried out with optimized dilutions of primary- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Alexa488-, and Alexa647-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained using Hoescht 33342 at a 0.2 μg/ml concentration for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted in Permafluor. Observations were performed using either a Leica DMRA microscope equipped with a 63× oil lense and a coolsnap FX camera or a confocal Leica DMR microscope equipped with a 63× oil lense, a confocal spinning disc (Yokogawa), and a coolsnap FX camera. Fluorescence signal quantifications were performed using the Metamorph software and 12-bit images. FRAP and FLIP Experiments—FRAP and FLIP analysis were performed at 37 °C with a Zeiss LSM510 Meta microscope equipped with a heating chamber and a plan Apochromat 63× water immersion lense. For EGFP fluorescence monitoring, cells were excited with an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was collected using the 505-550 nm wavelength bandpass filter. For DsRed2-monomer fluorescence monitoring, cells were excited with the 543 nm wavelength laser, and emission was collected using the 560 nm wavelength long path filter. Before photobleaching, five fluorescence intensity measurements were made over a period of 5 min. For FRAP experiments, HeLa cells were washed once with PBS, incubated with PEG for 1 min, washed again 10 times with PBS to remove any trace of PEG and incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium containing 10% serum. One hour later, cells were co-transfected with pDsRed-m-C1 and the plasmid of interest. 19 h after fusion, FRAP experiments were carried out on cells previously cultured in the presence of CHX for 1 h. Photobleaching was carried out on the whole surface of one targeted nucleus of the homopolykaryon using the 488 nm wavelength laser at maximal power. The bleach was of 256 μs/pixel. The recovery of fluorescence in the bleached area was monitored every minute. For FLIP experiments, HeLa cells were co-transfected with the pDsRed-m-C1 for visualization of the cytoplasm and the plasmid of interest. 16 h later, approximately half of the cytoplasm of the transfected cells was irradiated every minute for 10-15 s with the 488 nm wavelength laser at maximal power with a bleach of 25.6 μs/pixel. Nuclear fluorescence was monitored after each bleach. siRNA Experiments—siRN As against Impβ1 (sc35736) and TRN1 (sc35737) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-TRN2 siRNA, which was a mix of two sequences (5′-GUGGCCUCAUCCUCAAGAATT-3′ and 5′-GCAGUUCUCUGAGCAAUUCTT-3′) and the anti-Imp7 (5′-GAUGGAGCCCUGCAUAUGA-3′) siRNA were purchased from Eurogentec. They (200 pmol/well) were transfected in HeLa cells (3 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates) using Oligofectamine (3 μl/well) according to the supplier (Invitrogen) specifications. Thirty-six hours later, cells were transfected with the plasmids of interest using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (3 μg of plasmid per 35-mm culture dish). 16 h later, they were fixed for microscopic observation or lysed in the RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 1 Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 10-ml buffer) for immunoblotting analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Assays—Immunoprecipitations were performed as in a previous study (16Bossis G. Malnou C.E. Farras R. Andermarcher E. Hipskind R. Rodriguez M. Schmidt D. Muller S. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6964-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 107 cells were lysed in 600 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. To immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged proteins, 200 μl of lysates was incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 3 h. Lysates were then centrifuged, supernatants were collected, and pellets were resuspended in Laemmli electrophoresis loading buffer after five washes. Total extracts, supernatants, and immunoprecipitated fractions were then submitted to immunoblotting analysis. For this, proteins were electrotransfered on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after fractionation through 12% PAGE-SDS gels. Immunoblots were probed with the appropriate antibodies. Quantification of luminescence signals was performed using the GeneGnome system from Syngene. Cell Fractionation Experiments—Cell fractionation experiments were performed as previously described in (37Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were scrapped in PBS on ice, harvested by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in 200 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 10 ml of buffer). Cells were then lysed on ice for 15 min by addition of 0.15% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 3500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatants (S) contained both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear soluble fractions. Nuclei were then washed once in 200 μl of cold buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged. The centrifugation supernatants corresponded to the wash fraction (W). The pellets (P) corresponding to the nonsoluble fraction were directly resuspended in denaturing Laemmli electrophoresis loading buffer. Equivalent amounts of the three fractions were then submitted to immunoblotting analysis. An anti-Phax monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody 8G5, gift of Dr. E. Bertrand) was used to characterize the soluble nuclear fraction, and an anti-topoisomerase I one (gift of Dr. J. Tazi) was used to characterize the insoluble one (see Ref. 16Bossis G. Malnou C.E. Farras R. Andermarcher E. Hipskind R. Rodriguez M. Schmidt D. Muller S. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6964-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). c-Fos Shuttles between the Nucleus and the Cytoplasm—We first tested the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of c-Fos under conditions of prominently nuclear steady-state localization. This was achieved in classic heterokaryon assays in which a donor cell expressing the protein of interest is fused to an acceptor cell not expressing it in the presence of PEG. The experiment was performed in the presence of CHX to prevent bias possibly generated by newly synthetized proteins. In case of shuttling, the studied protein is reimported indifferently in both donor and acceptor cell nuclei, after exit from the donor nucleus. Transient induction by growth factors in cells re-entering the cell cycle is one of the best-characterized physiological situations to study c-Fos. Therefore, quiescent BALB/c 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts were stimulated by serum to induce endogenous c-Fos whose transient expression peaks by 1-2 h post-stimulation and returns to basal level 4-6 h later when cells traverse the G0/G1 transition (38Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). They were then fused to asynchronous human HeLa cells expressing an ectopic red fluorescent protein (Ds-Red) for visualization of heterokaryons. c-Fos distribution was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence 1 h post fusion, DNA staining with Hoescht 33342 permitting easy discrimination of human and mouse nuclei. Fig. 1A (panel a) shows a clear accumulation of c-Fos in human acceptor nuclei. Similar results were obtained in the reverse experiment when serum-stimulated HeLa cells were used as donors and BALB/c fibroblasts as acceptors (not shown). Thus, endogenous c-Fos can shuttle under physiological conditions of expression. We then expressed an exogenous c-Fos in asynchronous HeLa cells, which is a situation mimicking constitutive nuclear expression found in certain tissues and tumors, and investigated c-Fos shuttling activity. To avoid biases linked to overexpression, transfection was optimized to ensure a c-Fos accumulation level comparable to that of the endogenous protein induced by serum stimulation (not shown). One hour post fusion with asynchronous BALB/c fibroblasts, c-Fos was found in both human and mouse nuclei of heterokaryons (Fig. 1A, panel b), indicating ability to shuttle in this setting. Heterocaryon formation is not synchronous but spread over time following PEG treatment, which makes impossible to precisely measure the half-time for c-Fos return to the cytoplasm. However, quantification of c-Fos transfer from HeLa to BALB/c cell nuclei allowed to estimate c-Fos half-return time to the cytoplasm to be <30 min. This value is much less than the"

RGS2 can be phosphorylated by type Iα cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKIα), increasing its GAP activity. To understand how RGS2 and cGKIα regulate vascular smooth muscle signaling and function, we identified signaling pathways that are controlled by cGMP in an RGS2-dependent manner and discovered new mechanisms whereby cGK activity regulates RGS2. We show that RGS2 regulates vasoconstrictor-stimulated Ca2+ store release, capacitative Ca2+ entry, and noncapacitative Ca2+ entry and that RGS2 is required for cGMP-mediated inhibition of vasoconstrictor-elicited phospholipase Cβ activation, Ca2+ store release, and capacitative Ca2+ entry. RGS2 is degraded in vascular smooth muscle cells via the proteasome. Inhibition of cGK activity blunts RGS2 degradation. However, inactivation of the cGKIα phosphorylation sites in RGS2 does not stabilize the protein, suggesting that cGK activity regulates RGS2 degradation by other mechanisms. cGK activation promotes association of RGS2 with the plasma membrane by a mechanism requiring its cGKIα phosphorylation sites. By regulating GAP activity, plasma membrane association, and degradation, cGKIα therefore may control a cycle of RGS2 activation and inactivation. By diminishing cGK activity, endothelial dysfunction may impair RGS2 activation, thereby blunting vascular relaxation and contributing to hypertension.

Kaltenbronn K.M. Rhee M.H. Peng N. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Penninger J.M. Muslin A.J. Steinberg T.H. Wyss J.M. Mecham R.P. Blumer K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hypertension in RGS2-/- mice is due in part to impaired vascular relaxation in response to NO donors or cGMP analogs (34Tang K.M. Kim G.R. Lu P. Karas R.H. Aronovitz M. Heximer S.P. Kaltenbronn K.M. Blumer K.J. Siderovski D.P. Zhu Y. Mendelsohn M.E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 51Sun X. Kim K.M. Steinberg T.H. Blumer K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) in vascular smooth muscle to attenuate vasoconstrictor signaling and thereby promote relaxation. In the absence of RGS2, these vascular relaxation defects are thought to result from the inability of cGMP to inhibit the Ca2+ transients elicited by vasoconstrictors (50Heximer S.P. Kim R.H. Sun X. Kaltenbronn K.M. Rhee M.H. Peng N. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Penninger J.M. Muslin A.J. Steinberg T.H. Wyss J.M. Mecham R.P. Blumer K.J. J. Clin.

Although specific Ca2+ flux pathways regulated by cGMP in an RGS2-dependent manner have yet to be identified, these findings suggest that cGMP activates RGS2 function. How RGS2 is activated by cGMP stimulation is not clear. RGS2 binds to and is phosphorylated by cGKIα, modestly increasing its GAP activity in vitro toward Gqα (∼2-fold) (34Tang K.M. Kim G.R. Lu P. Karas R.H. Aronovitz M. Heximer S.P. Kaltenbronn K.M. Blumer K.J. Siderovski D.P. Zhu Y. Mendelsohn M.E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether this mechanism accounts for cGMP-dependent augmentation of RGS2 function indicated by studies of vasoconstrictor signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (51Sun X. Kim K.M. Steinberg T.H. Blumer K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). cGMP-stimulated phosphorylation therefore may augment RGS2 activity or function by additional mechanisms. To elucidate the mechanisms whereby cGMP-triggered phosphorylation regulates vascular smooth muscle function, we have determined the specific vasoconstrictor-triggered Ca2+ flux and second messenger pathways that are regulated by cGMP in an RGS2-dependent manner and investigated how cGK-mediated phosphorylation regulates RGS2 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our findings indicate that cGKIα-mediated phosphorylation regulates the degradation and plasma membrane association of RGS2, which would control RGS2 function as an inhibitor of vasoconstrictor- and Gq-triggered PLCβ activation, Ca2+ release, and capacitative Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle, thereby promoting vascular relaxation. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell (VSMC) Isolation and Culture—All procedures involving animals were performed in strict accordance with protocols approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were isolated from thoracic aortas of age-matched (4 months) wild type and RGS2-/- mice, as described previously (50Heximer S.P. Kim R.H. Sun X. Kaltenbronn K.M. Rhee M.H. Peng N. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Penninger J.M. Muslin A.J. Steinberg T.H. Wyss J.M. Mecham R.P. Blumer K.J. J. Clin.

In brief, freshly isolated aortas were excised and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen). After fatty tissue and blood clots were removed, aortas were diced and enzymatically digested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing elastase (0.03%, w/v) and collagenase (0.07%, w/v), sieved through 50-mm nylon mesh, washed twice in culture medium, and seeded in a 12-well plate containing poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were cultured for 3-5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin. For membrane translocation studies of RGS2, cultured aortic VSMCs from wild type mice were infected with a lentivirus expressing wild type RGS2-myc or mutant RGS2-myc bearing serine to alanine substitutions at the two known cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα phosphorylation sites (S46A and S64A) and then allowed to grow 48 h before analysis. Staining with anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibody indicated that aortic cell cultures contained ∼90% smooth muscle cells (data not shown). Lentivirus-mediated Expression of RGS2-myc in Primary Aortic VSMCs and Smooth Muscle Cell Lines—We used a lentivirus system to express wild type RGS2-myc and RGS2(S46A,S64A)-myc in primary mouse aortic and cultured A7r5 VSMCs. The viral envelope plasmid VSVG, packaging vector Δ8.9, and transfer vector FCIV were a kind gift from Dr. J. Milbrandt (Washington University School of Medicine). The FCIV vector uses the ubiquitin promoter to drive expression of the gene of interest, followed by an IRES to express enhanced GFP (VENUS) (52Araki T. Kim Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Wild type RGS2-myc and RGS2(S46A,S64A)-myc were cloned into FCIV using the PCR In-fusion™ cloning kit (Clontech) according the manufacturer's protocol. The lentiviral expression system was prepared as previously described (52Araki T. Kim Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Cultured primary aortic and A7r5 VSMCs growing on poly-l-lysine-coated cover glass were infected with lentivirus in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced, and cells were allowed to grow for 48 h. More than 90% of cells were infected (GFP-positive) as indicated by fluorescence microscopy. Lentivirus-mediated expression of RGS2-myc and RGS2(S46A,S64A)-myc was confirmed by Western blotting using mouse anti-Myc (Covance, Berkeley) and rabbit anti-GFP (AbCam) antibodies. Ca2+ Imaging—Ca2+ signaling experiments using primary aortic VSMCs were performed as described previously (50Heximer S.P. Kim R.H. Sun X. Kaltenbronn K.M. Rhee M.H. Peng N. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Penninger J.M. Muslin A.J. Steinberg T.H. Wyss J.M. Mecham R.P. Blumer K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 51Sun X. Kim K.M. Steinberg T.H. Blumer K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were washed and incubated in 4 μm FURA-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in Ca1 solution (11 mm glucose, 130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 17 mm HEPES, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once and incubated in Ca1 without FURA-2 for 10 min at 37 °C to allow hydrolysis of the acetoxymethyl ester. Cells on coverslips were placed in an open bath recording chamber (Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E600 FN microscope equipped with a Nikon Fluor ×40/0.80 water immersion lens (Nikon, Melville, NY). Excitation light (340/380 nm) was provided by a TILL Polychrome IV monochrometer (TILL Photonics GmbH, Martinsried, Germany), a 495-nm dichroic mirror, and a 525 ± 20-nm emission filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). For experiments involving cGK activation, VSMCs were mounted in the recording chamber as described above and treated for 10 min with 8-pCPT-cGMP (100 μm), which activates cGKs but does not inhibit phosphodiesterases (53Butt E. Kim C. Schulz S. Beltman J. Beavo J.A. Jastorff B. Walter U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). During subsequent stimulation with vasopressin, 8-pCPT-cGMP (100 μm) was also present. To determine which vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ entry pathways are regulated by RGS2, we incubated cells in Ca1 solution containing GdCl3 (1 μm), which specifically blocks capacitative (store-operated) Ca2+ entry (CCE), or SKF 96365 (100 nm), which specifically inhibits noncapacitative Ca2+ entry (NCCE) (54Moneer Z.

Ther. 2006; 317: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and then treated cells with [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP). To monitor only Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, we incubated cells in Ca0 solution (Ca1 lacking Ca2+) and then stimulated cells with AVP. Fluorescence ratio imaging was performed with TILL-visION 4.0 imaging software (TILL Photonics GmbH), and images were acquired with a SensiCam cooled charge-coupled device camera (PCO Computer Optics GmbH, Kelheim, Germany). Regions of interest contained 10-20 VSMCs. Image pairs of the regions of interest were taken every 2 s, and background-corrected ratio images (340 nm/380 nm) were obtained. Data for each region of interest were collected as relative ratio values over time. Ratio data were converted into [Ca2+]i by using a standard look-up table created with a Ca2+ calibration kit (Molecular Probes). Monitoring DAG Production by Video Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—An adenovirus expressing a DAG biosensor consisting of EGFP linked to the DAG-binding C1 domain of PKCγ was constructed and used as follows according to published procedures (61He T.C. Kim S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar, 62Luker G.D. Kim V. Pica C.M. Prior J.L. Li W. Piwnica-Worms D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1780-1788PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pEGFP-N1-PKCγC1A was a gift of T. Meyer (Sanford University School of Medicine). pShuttle-CMV and pAdEasy-1 vectors in BJ5183 cells were gifts of Dr. H. Piwnica-Worms (Washington University School of Medicine). EGFP-N1-PKCγC1A was subcloned into pShuttle-CMV cleaved with BgIII and NotI. The resultant plasmid was linearized by digestion with PmeI and transformed to BJ5183 cells containing pAdEasy-1. The resultant plasmid was cut with PacI and transfected to HEK293 cells, and recombinant adenoviruses expressing EGFP-PKCγC1A were isolated from the culture supernatant. Primary wild type and RGS2-/- vascular smooth muscle cells growing on glass bottom dishes (Bioscience Tools, San Diego, CA) precoated with 0.5 μg/ml vitronectin were infected by adenovirus expressing EGFP-N1-PKCγC1A. After 3 days, the culture medium was replaced with Ca1 solution, and cells were imaged as follows with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Enhanced green fluorescent protein was excited using the 488-nm laser line, and the emitted fluorescence was captured at wavelengths of >505 nm with images collected at 5-s intervals. Wild type and RGS2-/- cells were treated or not with 8-pCPT-cGMP (100 μm for 10 min) and then stimulated with AVP (100 nm). Movies were acquired at 12 frames/min. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Primary mouse aortic or A7r5 VSMCs cultured on coverslips were infected with lentiviruses expressing wild type RGS2-myc or RGS2(S46A,S64A)-myc. 48-72 h later, cells were treated with vehicle or 8-pCPT-cGMP (100 μm) or the selective cGKI inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (20 μm) for 30 min. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, washed, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1:100 mouse anti-Myc, 9E10; Covance, Berkeley, CA) in buffer A with 1% goat serum for 20 min and washed 10 times. Secondary antibodies (1:1000 Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-mouse IgG; Molecular Probes) in solution A with 1% goat serum were incubated with cells for 20 min, followed by 10 washes in buffer A, and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence images were quantified using NIH Image J 1.37v. The proportion of wild type or mutant RGS2-myc associated with the plasma membrane was quantified on a cell by cell basis by subtracting the fluorescence signal in the cytoplasm/intracellular organelles/nucleus from the total fluorescence of the cell and dividing this value by total fluorescence. RGS2-myc Degradation—A7r5 smooth muscle cells grown to ∼70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine were transfected using FUGENE 6 reagent and FCIV transfer plasmid expressing RGS2-myc or RGS2(S46A,S64A)-myc. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle, 8-pCPT-cGMP (100 μm), or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (20 μm) in the presence of cycloheximide (30 μg/ml). The proteasome dependence of RGS2-myc degradation was investigated by treating cells with MG132 (10 μm). Cells were harvested by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in MLCB (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm microcystin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant fractions were used for Western blotting (30 μg of total protein/lane separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore)). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% fat-free milk/TBST followed by co-incubation with primary antibodies (1:1000 mouse anti-Myc, 9E10 (Covance); 1:2000 rabbit anti-GFP (AbCam)) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and co-incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with infrared fluorescent dyes (1:10,000 goat anti-mouse IRDye680® and 1:10,000 goat anti-rabbit IRDye® 800CW; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h. Myc and GFP bands were detected and quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). RGS2-myc protein expression was normalized to that of co-expressed GFP. Statistics—Student's t test (two-tailed, two-sample, equal variance) with Bonferroni correction was used to analyze Ca2+ signaling data, the effect of proteasome inhibitor on RGS2-myc degradation, and membrane translocation data. A two-way analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of 8-pCPT-cGMP and Rp-pCPT-cGMPS on the degradation rate of RGS2-myc and RGS2(S46A,S64A)-myc proteins at various time points. A Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used to determine between-group differences at the various time points. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RGS2 Regulates Vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ Store Release and Entry in Primary Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—To determine whether RGS2 regulates specific Ca2+ release and/or Ca2+ entry mechanisms in VSMCs stimulated by AVP, we used specific pharmacologic tools established by previous investigations (54Moneer Z.

https://openalex.org/W2011925959,"Many significant bacterial pathogens use a type III secretion system to inject effector proteins into host cells to disrupt specific cellular functions, enabling disease progression. The injection of these effectors into host cells is often dependent on dedicated chaperones within the bacterial cell. In this report, we demonstrate that the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) chaperone CesT interacts with a variety of known and putative type III effector proteins. Using pull-down and secretion assays, a degenerate CesT binding domain was identified within multiple type III effectors. Domain exchange experiments between selected type III effector proteins revealed a modular nature for the CesT binding domain, as demonstrated by secretion, chaperone binding, and infection assays. The CesT-interacting type III effector Tir, which is crucial for in vivo intestinal colonization, had to be expressed and secreted for efficient secretion of other type III effectors. In contrast, the absence of other CesT-interacting type III effectors did not abrogate effector secretion, indicating an unexpected hierarchy with respect to Tir for type III effector delivery. Coordinating the expression of other type III effectors with cesT in the absence of tir partially restored total type III effector secretion, thereby implicating CesT in secretion events. Collectively, the results suggest a coordinated mechanism involving both Tir and CesT for type III effector injection into host cells.

Bacterial pathogens often have multiple systems to disrupt and subvert host cellular processes that are involved in disease production. One such system is the type III secretion system (T3SS) 4The abbreviations used are:T3SStype III secretion systemEPECenteropathogenic E. coliA/Eattaching and effacingLEElocus of enterocyte effacementCBDCesT binding domainaaamino acidsGSTglutathione S-transferase. that is widespread among Gram-negative pathogens of animals and plants.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a human diarrheal attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen that attaches to intestinal microvilli and then injects type III effector proteins directly into host cells (2Kaper J.B.

The A/E phenotype has been linked to the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (5Jerse A.E. Yu J. Tall B.D. Kaper J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lai L.C. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The LEE encodes components of the T3SS, transcriptional regulators, chaperones and type III effector proteins, the latter of which are translocated directly into host cells (7Deng W. Puente J.L.

EPEC and other related strains have multiple type III effectors that are encoded within the LEE, in addition to non-LEE-encoded effectors that are located in distinct pathogenicity islands throughout the chromosome (3Dean P.

One of the best studied EPEC type III effectors is Tir (translocated intimin receptor), a protein that is injected into host cells, modified by host kinases, and localized to the host membrane (10Kenny B.

Furthermore, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Tir interact with a number of host proteins, causing dramatic host cytoskeletal rearrangements, which result in actin-rich lesions termed pedestals (12Gruenheid S.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3570-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which have been shown to have multifunctional disruptive properties within host cells. The translocation of type III effectors into host cells is often dependent on a dedicated family of proteins termed type III chaperones (NCBI conserved domain data base, pFam05932). These proteins are cytosolic or membrane-associated, generally small (∼20 kDa), soluble, and negatively charged (pI 4-5) (23Parsot C. Hamiaux C. Page A.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Type III secretion chaperones typically form homodimers that bind to the amino-terminal region of effectors and remain in the bacterial cell following translocation of effectors into the host cell. The crystal structures of many type III secretion chaperones have been solved, some in a complex with an effector (24van Eerde A. Hamiaux C. Perez J. Parsot C. Dijkstra B.W.

Collectively, these studies have revealed remarkable chaperone structural similarity, even in the absence of primary sequence similarity. Certain type III secretion chaperones are thought to bind a single effector, whereas others have been demonstrated to have multivalent properties and bind more than one effector. In the case of EPEC, the LEE encoded type III secretion chaperone CesT was initially shown to bind and stabilize Tir within the bacterial cell (30Abe A. de Grado M. Pfuetzner R.A.

Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CesT is also required for the efficient in vitro type III secretion of other LEE and non-LEE type III effectors (33Thomas N. Deng W. Puente J. Frey E. Yip C. Strynadka N. Finlay B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1762-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that other chaperone-effector interactions may occur within the bacterium. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that CesT interacts with the membrane-associated ATPase EscN of the T3SS, in a role probably serving to recruit and target type III effectors for translocation into host cells (33Thomas N. Deng W. Puente J. Frey E. Yip C. Strynadka N. Finlay B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1762-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Gauthier A. Finlay B.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6747-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cesT mutants do not cause overt disease in a mouse model of attaching and effacing pathogenesis (7Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vazquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), indicating that this type III secretion chaperone has a central role in disease. In this study, we demonstrate that CesT interacts with at least eight EPEC type III effectors. A degenerate CesT binding domain within multiple type III effectors was identified and experimentally confirmed by pull-down and protein domain-exchanging experiments. A variety of complementary genetic and biochemical assays were used to demonstrate a modular nature for the CesT binding domain. Last, using multiple EPEC strains in secretion and infection assays, it is demonstrated that a coordinated Tir-CesT interaction is required for the efficient injection of other type III effectors into host cells. The results highlight events leading to the hierarchical injection of the critical host colonization factor Tir, which probably precedes the delivery of subsequent effectors.

The PCR fragment was restriction-digested with NdeI and KpnI and cloned into the respective restriction sites of pFLAG-CTC (Sigma) to create an in frame fusion with a sequence encoding the FLAG peptide. The resulting construct (pNT243) encodes NleH-FLAG from the recombinant tac promoter of pFLAG-CTC. To create a plasmid for nleH expression from its native promoter, primers 163 (TCGAATTACCCTGATTTTGCTGG) and 169 were used in a PCR with genomic DNA. The resulting PCR fragment encompassed 419 bp upstream of the nleH start codon and the complete nleH open reading frame. The fragment was restriction-digested with KpnI followed by directional cloning into NruI/KpnI-treated pNT242 to create pNT244, which expresses NleH-FLAG from the nleH promoter. Truncated forms of NleH-FLAG were created by using pNT244 as template in a PCR with primer 163 individually paired with primers 164 (CGGGTACCTGTTCTGTTGCCAACCGTTAC) (NleH aa 1-50), 165 (CGGGTACCCGTGCTCACTGGCGATGTATTC) (NleH aa 1-100), 166 (CGGGTACCACCAATAACATTACCTGGCACG) (NleH aa 1-150), 167 (CGGGTACCATATATTTTCTCTGCACTCCCGG) (NleH aa 1-200), and 168 (CGGGTACCTGTATCAACAAAAAGAATTCC) (NleH aa 1-250). The resulting fragments were restriction-digested with KpnI and cloned into NruI/KpnI-digested pNT242. A deletion construct of nleH, lacking the first 150 bp encoding the CesT binding domain (CBD) of NleH was created using a ligation-PCR strategy. Briefly, an nleH promoter region was amplified from pNT244 with primers 163 and 170 (GGAATTCCATATGTTTCAACCTTCAAAATAAACCTATC). An nleH gene fragment was then amplified with primer 173 (GGAATTCCATATGTATCGTGTTGTGGTCACTGATAATAAG) and primer 169. The two DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio, followed by the addition of T4 ligase. An aliquot of the ligation was added to a PCR with primers 163 and 169 to amplify a 1.2-kb fragment that was then treated with KpnI, followed by cloning into NruI/KpnI-digested pNT242 to generate pNT250. The generation of plasmids expressing CBD exchange derivatives of Tir and NleH used a multiple step blunt ligation-PCR strategy. For the Tir-NleH[CBD]-Tir fusion, three fragments were ligated as follows. The NleH CBD (aa 1-40) was PCR-amplified with primers 172 (ATGTTATCGCCCTCTTCTATAAATTTGG) and 176 (GCTATCAGAGTGAACAGCAGC) using pNT244 as template, generating fragment A (120 bp). A DNA fragment containing nucleotides 250-1653 of tir was amplified by PCR from EPEC genomic DNA with primers 177 (TGCTTGCTTGGAGGATTTG) and 151 (CCGGATATCTTAAACGAAACGTACTGGTCC), generating fragment B (1.4 kb). Fragments A and B were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, gel-purified, and then blunt end-ligated to each other in a ligation reaction. The ligation reaction then served as template in a PCR with primers 172 and 151, generating fragment C. The promoter and first 114 nucleotides of tir were then amplified from EPEC genomic DNA with primers 145 (GTAAGGAGACTAAATGTCGC) and 174 (AATTAGATGACCAGTTCCTC), generating fragment D. Fragments C and D were kinase-treated and blunt end-ligated as before. The ligation reaction then served as a template in a PCR with primers 145 and 151, generating a 2.2-kb DNA fragment that was digested with BamHI and subsequently cloned into BamHI/EcoRV-treated pACYC184 to create pNT251. For the Tir[CBD]-NleH fusion, the Tir CBD was PCR-amplified with primers 178 (GGAATTCCATATGAGCTCTACAGGAGCATTAGGA) and 179 (TGTCTCAGATGTAGCTGCAGC), generating fragment E. A DNA fragment containing nucleotides 121-909 of nleH was PCR-amplified with primers 180 (GGGACGCAAGTAACGGTTGGC) and 169 using pNT244 as template, generating fragment F. The fragments were kinase-treated and then ligated. The ligation reaction served as template in a PCR with primers 178 and 169, which generated a 1-kb fragment that was directionally cloned into NdeI/KpnI-digested pNT250, creating pNT252. A plasmid construct expressing NleH-FLAG from the tir promoter was created by amplifying a DNA fragment with primers 175 (CCGCTCGAGGTCTGTTAGGAATAATTAGATAGG) and 169 in a PCR with pNT244 serving as template, followed by cloning of the product into XhoI/KpnI-digested pNT242, to create pNT253. The same primers were used in a PCR with pNT250 as template to create pNT254 expressing NleH[ΔCBD]-FLAG from the tir promoter. A plasmid construct expressing NleA-FLAG from a tac promoter was generated by amplifying a DNA fragment from EPEC genomic DNA with primers 157 (GGAATTCCCATATGAACATTCAACCGATCGTAAC) and 158 (CGGGTACCGACTCTTGTTTCTTGGATTATATC) followed by cloning into NdeI/KpnI-digested pFLAG-CTC to create pNT255. To create a plasmid expressing Tir (Δ2-38), an inverse PCR strategy was used. Briefly, primer 186 (CATACATATATCCTTTTATTTAGAAATTTGACACG) and primer 191 (AGCTGTGCACCGTATCGCGG) were used in a PCR with pTir as template DNA. The resulting product was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by ligation and transformation into DH5α, creating pTir(Δ2-38). The plasmid was then transformed into Δtir for phenotypic analyses. A nonpolar in frame nleA deletion mutant was generated by allelic exchange with a nleA gene fragment with an internal in-frame deletion. Briefly, primers 159 (CGGAGCTCGACGCACTCGACATCTCACTGG) and 160 (CCGCTCGAGGATTCCGGATGTTACGATCGG) were used to PCR-amplify a 1013-bp fragment from EPEC genomic DNA. Similarly, primers 161 and 162 generated a 799-bp fragment. The two DNA fragments were digested with XhoI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation served as template in a PCR with primers 159 and 162 with the resulting 1.8-kb product being cloned into SacI/KpnI-digested pRE112, generating pNT256. pNT256 was conjugated into EPEC ΔsepD, followed by the isolation and genotypic verification of ΔsepDΔnleA strains, as previously described (37Gruenheid S. Sekirov I. Thomas N.A. Deng W. O'Donnell P. Goode D. Li Y. Frey E.A. Brown N.F. Metalnikov P. Pawson T. Ashman K. Finlay B.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1233-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Similarly, a pRE112-based espZ deletion construct was created using primer pairs EPespZ(1) (GCGGTACCTGCTTGTCGAGCAACGAGGCG) and ΔEPespZ(R) (CCGCTAGCGGATTAGCGATGAAATATGCC) and ΔEPespZ(F) (GCGCTAGCTGGTAATACTGCACCAGAAGG) and EPespZ(2) (CCGAGCTCGAGTATCTTTGTATATTGACTC), followed by the isolation of ΔespZ mutants. An EPEC ΔsepDΔescN mutant was created in the ΔescN genetic background by allelic exchange using a sepD deletion construct (38Deng W. Li Y. Hardwidge P.R. Frey E.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Lee S. Gruenheid S. Strynakda N.C. Puente J.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) harboring a gene fragment of sepD with an internal in-frame deletion. ΔsepDΔescN mutants were verified by PCR genotyping and evaluating protein secretion profiles. Transcriptional Analyses—The nleA gene promoter was cloned upstream of the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-tranferase gene within pKK232-8 (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting construct was transformed into various EPEC strains and tested in transcriptional reporter assays as previously described (41Sanchez-SanMartin C. Bustamante V.H. Calva E. Puente J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2823-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Evaluation of Total EPEC Secreted Proteins—Total EPEC secreted proteins were collected as previously described (33Thomas N. Deng W. Puente J. Frey E. Yip C. Strynadka N. Finlay B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1762-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-cultured EPEC cells were pelleted, and the culture supernatant was then filtered (0.22 μm). The filtrate was precipitated by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10% (v/v)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and then washed with ice-cold acetone. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 2× ESB (0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses. CesT Affinity Column Binding and FLAG Immunoprecipitation Pull-down Assays—A CesT affinity column was generated by purifying overexpressed His-CesT from an E. coli BL21(λDE3) lysate using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (33Thomas N. Deng W. Puente J. Frey E. Yip C. Strynadka N. Finlay B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1762-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified CesT (200 μg) was equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl), followed by the addition of various filtered EPEC culture supernatants. The column was extensively washed with binding buffer, followed by a higher stringency wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole). Retained proteins were co-eluted with His-CesT using elution buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 m imidazole). For mass spectrometry identification of CesT-interacting proteins, the procedure was modified to specifically exclude CesT from the elution fraction. Briefly, after CesT-interacting EPEC proteins were column-bound, the column was treated with denaturing binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 6 m urea). This served to denature and elute proteins from the column. The eluate was then passed over a separate Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, pre-equilibrated with denaturing binding buffer, to specifically retain denatured His-CesT. The eluate from this column was then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, followed by mass spectrometry analyses (see below). To evaluate a direct interaction between NleH and CesT, FLAG-tagged NleH expressed in DH5α was immunoprecipitated from a cell lysate (5-ml culture, A600 = 0.8) onto FLAG beads as previously described (33Thomas N. Deng W. Puente J. Frey E. Yip C. Strynadka N. Finlay B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1762-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified GST-CesT or GST only was added to the NleH-containing beads, followed by incubation at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science complete mini-EDTA, one tablet per 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline). NleH-FLAG was competitively eluted from the beads using FLAG peptide (final concentration of 90 ng/μl). The eluted protein fraction was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses. An additional control for GST-CesT demonstrated that it did not bind to FLAG-beads exposed to a DH5α lysate, ruling out CesT interacting with the beads or any nonspecific bead-i"
https://openalex.org/W2018175152,"This study presents a molecular inhibitory mechanism by Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) on IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation, where divergent NF-kappaB-activating stimuli converge. FAF1 interacts with IKKbeta in response to proinflammatory stimuli (such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and lipopolysaccharide) and suppresses IKK activation. Interaction of the leucine-zipper domain of IKKbeta with FAF1 affected the IKK heterocomplex (IKKalpha/beta) and homocomplex (IKKalpha/alpha, IKKbeta/beta) formations and attenuated IKKgamma recruitment to IKKbeta. Overexpression of FAF1 reduced the level of IKKbeta activity, whereas FAF1 depletion increased the activity. These results indicate that FAF1 inhibits IKK activation and its downstream signaling by interrupting the IKK complex assembly through physical interaction with IKKbeta. Taken together, FAF1 robustly suppresses NF-kappaB activation through the inhibition of IKK activation in combination with previously reported cytoplasmic retention of NF-kappaB p65 (Park, M. Y., Jang, H. D., Lee, S. Y., Lee, K. J., and Kim, E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 2544-2549). Such redundant suppression would prevent inadvertent activation of the NF-kappaB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2044220221,"Cytidine triphosphate synthetase (CTPS) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of CTP, and both the yeast and human enzymes have been reported to be regulated by protein kinase A or protein kinase C phosphorylation. Here, we provide evidence that stimulation or inhibition of protein kinase A and protein kinase C does not alter the phosphorylation of endogenous human CTPS1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells under the conditions tested. Unexpectedly, we found that low serum conditions increased phosphorylation of endogenous CTPS1 and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor indirubin-3′-monoxime and GSK3β short interfering RNAs, demonstrating the involvement of GSK3 in phosphorylation of endogenous human CTPS1. Separating tryptic peptides from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells and analyzing the phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry identified Ser-574 and Ser-575 as phosphorylated residues. Mutation of Ser-571 demonstrated that Ser-571 was the major site phosphorylated by GSK3 in intact human embryonic kidney 293 cells by GSK3 in vitro. Furthermore, mutation of Ser-575 prevented the phosphorylation of Ser-571, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-575 was necessary for priming the GSK3 phosphorylation of Ser-571. Low serum was found to decrease CTPS1 activity, and incubation with the GSK3 inhibitor indirubin-3′-monoxime protected against this decrease in activity. Incubation with an alkaline phosphatase increased CTPS1 activity in a time-dependent manner, demonstrating that phosphorylation inhibits CTPS1 activity. This is the first study to investigate the phosphorylation and regulation of human CTPS1 in human cells and suggests that GSK3 is a novel regulator of CTPS activity.

Low serum was found to decrease CTPS1 activity, and incubation with the GSK3 inhibitor indirubin-3′-monoxime protected against this decrease in activity. Incubation with an alkaline phosphatase increased CTPS1 activity in a time-dependent manner, demonstrating that phosphorylation inhibits CTPS1 activity. This is the first study to investigate the phosphorylation and regulation of human CTPS1 in human cells and suggests that GSK3 is a novel regulator of CTPS activity. Pyrimidine nucleotides have been known for decades to be essential components of cells. Most recently the effects of nucleotides have been revisited and were shown to regulate apoptosome formation by binding to cytochrome c, and constitutively high levels of nucleotides were shown to inhibit the cell cycle and the response to DNA damage (1Chabes A. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Chandra D. Bratton S.B. Person M.D. Tian Y. Martin A.G. Ayres M. Fearnhead H.O. Gandhi V.

Of all the nucleotides, the cellular concentration of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is the lowest, suggesting that control of CTP synthesis is tightly regulated (3Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). CTP is important in DNA/RNA synthesis, phospholipid synthesis, and protein sialylation, which are needed for cell proliferation and cell size expansion. CTP levels are elevated during S phase of the cell cycle, and rapidly proliferating cells maintain a higher basal concentration of CTP and dCTP (4Sidi Y. Edwards N.L. Winkler C. Bunn P. Mitchell B.S.

Cytidine nucleotide levels were also found to be elevated in a variety of tumors and elevated, albeit to a lesser degree, in normal proliferating cells (11van den Berg A.A. van Lenthe H.

Primary human lymphocytes demonstrate a dramatic increase in CTP levels following mitogenic stimulation, demonstrating the importance of CTP synthesis in response to mitogens (12van den Berg A.A. van Lenthe H.

CTPS activity is feedback-inhibited by CTP, and with glutamine as a substrate CTPS activity is markedly enhanced by GTP. In mammals there are two CTPS isozymes that share 74% amino acid identity (13van Kuilenburg A.B. Meinsma R. Vreken P. Waterham H.R. van Gennip A.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 486: 257-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are also two isoforms of CTPS, URA7 and URA8, corresponding to the mammalian enzymes CTPS1 and CTPS2, respectively. Investigation into how CTPS is regulated, primarily in bacteria and yeast, has uncovered two major forms of regulation, regulation by metabolites and phosphorylation. The unique ability of CTPS to bind four nucleotides (UTP, ATP, GTP, and CTP) and the amino acid glutamine makes CTPS sensitive to the metabolite levels of four nucleotides and glutamine in cells, providing exquisite metabolic control of CTPS.

Regulation of yeast CTPS by phosphorylation was discovered by Carman and co-workers (14Park T.S. O'Brien D.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20785-20794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), who showed that yeast CTPS1 (URA7) was phosphorylated in vitro on multiple sites by protein kinase C (Ser-36, Ser-330, Ser-354, and Ser-454). Mutation of potential phosphorylation sites demonstrated that Ser-330 was a major site of protein kinase C phosphorylation (14Park T.S. O'Brien D.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20785-20794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, this same group identified Ser-424 as an in vitro protein kinase A phosphorylation site (15Park T.S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The S424A mutant showed decreased CTPS activity and greater sensitivity to CTP feedback inhibition (15Park T.S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently this same group also showed that human CTPS1 expressed in yeast was phosphorylated by protein kinase A (16Han G.S. Sreenivas A. Choi M.G. Chang Y.F. Martin S.S. Baldwin E.P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38328-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, sequence alignments of the yeast CTPS1 phosphorylation sites with mouse and human CTPS1 indicate that only two of the phosphorylation sites identified in yeast CTPS1 (URA7) are conserved in humans (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that human CTPS1 in human cells may be phosphorylated on different sites than URA7. Despite the importance of CTP in processes such as phospholipid synthesis and protein sialylation, little is known about the regulation of human CTPS1. The objective of this study was to investigate the phosphorylation and regulation of mammalian CTPS1 expressed in mammalian cells. Endogenous human CTPS1 was found to be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in response to low serum, and several phosphorylation sites in human CTPS1 were mapped to the carboxyl terminus, including the site for GSK3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of endogenous human CTPS1 was found to inhibit CTPS1 activity, and inhibition of GSK3 restored the low serum decrease in CTPS1 activity. Thus, these studies suggest that human CTPS1 expressed in human cells is regulated by GSK3 phosphorylation of CTPS1, a carboxyl terminal residue not found in the yeast enzyme. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells purchased from the University of North Carolina Tissue Culture facility were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Full-length cDNA containing human CTPS1 was purchased from Invitrogen (IMAGE clone ID 3355881). A carboxyl-terminal FLAG sequence was introduced after insertion of human CTPS1 into pCDNA 4 myc/his using the compatible cohesive ends EagI&NotI and XhoI. Briefly, the CTPS1 IMAGE clone was digested with EagI and XhoI and ligated into pCDNA4 digested with NotI and XhoI. Introduction of the carboxyl-terminal FLAG sequence was done by first amplifying a carboxyl-terminal section of CTPS1 with the sense primer 5′-CACGAAGCTTGGCAGAAGC-3′ (HindIII site is underlined) and antisense primer 5′-GACTCGAGCGCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAATCCGCGTCATGATTTATTGATGG-3′ (XhoI site is underlined, FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) is boldface, and mutation of stop codon to alanine is italicized and underlined) and finally ligating the carboxyl-terminal-amplified section back into the pCDNA4 CTPS1 using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites. A Kozak sequence (GCCACC) was added upstream of the start codon (ATG) by amplifying an amino-terminal fragment of CTPS1 with the sense primer 5′-CGCGGCCGCGCCACCATGAAGTACATTCTG-3′ (NotI site is underlined and start codon is boldface) and antisense primer 5′-CGGATCCGCGTCATGATTTATTGATGG-3′, digesting the amplified amino-terminal fragment with NotI and Eco N1, and ligating the digested amino-terminal fragment into pCDNA4 myc/his CTPS1-FLAG digested with NotI and Eco N1. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using QuikChange™ (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Of note, Ser-571 was found to be an isoleucine in the IMAGE clone and was mutated back to the wild type serine. Transfection and Immunoprecipitation of Endogenous and Recombinant CTPS1—HEK 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. Anti-FLAG (Sigma) resin was prepared as recommended by the manufacturer to remove non-covalently linked antibodies. Approximately 8 × 106 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer without SDS (150 mm NaCl, 9.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 nm microcystin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following clarification of lysate by centrifugation, 1 mg of lysate was rotated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG resin overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CTPS1 was done by rotating 1 mg of lysate clarified by centrifugation with 10 μl of anti-CTPS1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to lysate containing anti-CTPS1 antibody and rotated an additional hour at 4 °C. CTPS Activity Assay—CTPS1 was immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer without SDS containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin and a final wash was done with 1 ml of 1× CTPS reaction buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 8.1, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KCl). The volume was adjusted to 40 μl with 10 μl of 5× reaction buffer and 30 μl of double distilled H2O (ddH2O). CTPS1 and 5× substrate mix (5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm UTP, 5 mm GTP, 100 mm l-glutamine, and 0.625 μCi/ml [14C]UTP or 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]UTP) were equilibrated to 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 5× substrate mix to 40 μl of CTPS1 in reaction buffer and stopped after 45 min by adding 10 μl of 200 mm EDTA and removing the tube to ice. CTPS1 reactions were reduced to dryness using a SpeedVac. Dried supernatant pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of ddH2O. 3–4 μl of resuspended pellets and 1 μl of 100 mm UTP/CTP/UDP/CDP standards were spotted onto polyethylimine cellulose plastic-backed plates (Fisher Scientific) that were prewashed for 10 min with ddH20, 5 min with 0.65 N HCl, and 1 min with methanol. Nucleotides were resolved using 0.65 N HCl as the ascending chromatography buffer. Areas corresponding to UTP, CTP, UDP, and CDP were visualized with a short wavelength UV light, and nucleotide areas containing radioactivity were visualized by exposing TLC plate to a phosphorimaging screen overnight. Areas corresponding to UTP, CTP, UDP, and CDP were excised and counted using Ecoscint™ (Fisher Scientific) scintillation fluid. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Anti-CTPS1 (human) antibody was generated by Rockland Immunochemicals using a carboxyl-terminal peptide (amino acids 578–591, H2N-CSEITELKFPSINHD-COOH) containing an amino-terminal cysteine for coupling to peptide affinity column and keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-CTPS1 antibody was purified from rabbit serum in a three-step process. First, serum proteins including immunoglobulins were precipitated at 4 °C by adding ice-cold saturated (NH4)2SO4 to a final percentage of 50%. (NH4)2SO4-precipitated proteins were resuspended in a volume of PBS equal to the initial volume of serum and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS. Second, 2.5 ml of (NH4)2SO4 purified serum protein solution was rotated with 0.5 ml (bead volume) of protein A that had been equilibrated with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0. After washing the protein A column with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, bound antibodies were eluted with 5 ml of 50 mm glycine, pH 3.0. 1-ml fractions were collected in Eppendorf tubes containing 100 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, to immediately neutralize pH. All fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS. Lastly, antibodies specific for CTPS1 were separated from nonspecific antibodies using a peptide affinity column created with the antigenic peptide (H2N-CSEITELKFPSINHD-COOH) and a Sulfolink column (Pierce Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted anti-CTPS1 antibodies were concentrated to ∼350 μl and buffer exchanged to PBS with 0.05% NaN3 using 4 ml of 10-kDa MWCO spin concentrators. 20-μl aliquots were stored at -20 °C for future use. Immunoblotting for GSK3 and phospho-GSK3 (α/β, Ser-21/Ser-9) was done by lysing HEK 293 cells with RIPA without SDS and determining the protein concentration in lysate using the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002 g/ml bromphenol blue). 10–40 μg of protein was separated on an 8 or 10% discontinuous buffer gel, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilin-P; Millipore). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature or overnight in a cold room with 3% w/v cold fish gelatin (Sigma) diluted with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Primary antibodies (1:1000 α-phospho-(Ser-9) GSK3β (Cell Signaling) and 1:1000 α-GSK3β (Cell Signaling)) were diluted in 1% w/v gelatin in TBST and incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature (α-GSK3β) or overnight at 4 °C (α-phospho-(Ser-9) GSK3β; Cell Signaling). Membranes were then washed with TBST three times for 5 min each wash and incubated for 1 h with 1:2000 goat anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (for α-GSK3β) or alkaline phosphatase (for α-phospho-(Ser-9) GSK3β). Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each wash with TBST and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposing membrane to x-ray film or using a BCIP/NBT kit (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium) (Promega) to visualize alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody as suggested by the manufacturer. GSK3β RNA Interference—3.5 × 105 HEK 293 cells were plated onto 60-mm poly-d-lysine-coated plates and incubated overnight. DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (DMEM + 10% FBS + pen./strep.) was removed from cells, and medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and no antibiotics (DMEM + 10% FBS). RNA duplexes (Dharmacon) were suspended as suggested by the manufacturer, and 15 μl of 20 μm RNA duplex was added to one tube containing 285 μl of DMEM + 10% FBS and mixed thoroughly. 12 μl of Dharmafect 1 was added to a second tube containing 288 μl of DMEM + 10% FBS and mixed thoroughly. Tubes containing RNA duplexes and Dharmafect 1 were combined, mixed thoroughly, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min. 2400 μl of DMEM + 10% FBS was added to the duplex/Dharmafect 1 mixture to give a total volume of 3000 μl, and the entire mixture (3000 μl) was added to plates that had their medium removed. Medium was switched the following day to DMEM + 10% FBS + pen./strep. Cellular manipulations were done the following day after incubating cells overnight. In Vitro GSK3β Kinase Reaction—Endogenous CTPS1 or FLAG-CTPS1 was immunoprecipitated as described before. Immunoprecipitates were washed one time with 1 ml of 1× GSK3 reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 25 °C and 10 mm MgCl2) without dithiothreitol and 25 μl of complete GSK3 reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 25 °C, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 nm microcystin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) was added to each immunoprecipitate. To each reaction 0.01 units of GSK3β-purified enzyme (New England Biolabs) were added and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, flicking tubes occasionally to resuspend immunoprecipitates. Reactions were stopped by removing the supernatant, placing tubes on ice, and adding 30 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer (see “Antibodies and Immunoblotting” for composition of SDS sample buffer) to immunoprecipitates. Calf Intestinal Phosphatase Treatment of CTPS1—Immunoprecipitated CTPS1 (prepared as described earlier) was washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer without SDS and one time with 1 ml of 1× CTPS reaction buffer. 10 μl of 5× CTPS reaction buffer and 25 μl of ddH2O were added to immunoprecipitates, and tubes were placed at 30 °C for phosphatase reaction. Dephosphorylation was initiated by adding 15 μl (1 unit/μl) of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP; Roch Biochemicals) or 15 μl of 50% glycerol (control reaction) to tubes containing immunoprecipitated CTPS1 (50-μl total volume). Reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 1× CTPS reaction buffer to dilute reaction components and placing tubes on ice. Immunoprecipitates were washed again with ice-cold 1× CTPS reaction buffer. In Vivo Labeling with [32P]Orthophosphate—100-mm tissue culture plates (Sarstedt Inc.) were coated with 0.02 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) and washed with ddH2O. 7.5 × 106 HEK 293 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates. Cells were washed one time with 5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM (phosphate/pyruvate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), giving a final concentration of 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate and the same concentration of penicillin/streptomycin as described earlier). 3 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) was added to plates 30 min prior to adding 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/plate (0.33 mCi/ml; MP Biomedical). In a typical experiment, cells were labeled for 4 h prior to manipulation. Labeling was stopped by washing plates twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed by scraping plates in the presence of 0.5 ml of no-SDS RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitations were done as described above. Immunecomplex proteins were eluted from beads by boiling for 3 min with Laemmli buffer. SDS-PAGE/autoradiography was done on eluted proteins. Phosphorylation Site Identification by Mass Spectrometry— HEK 293 cells were labeled and immunecomplexes were separated as described above. After separation of eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Osmonics; GE Healthcare). Proteins were visualized using MemCode (Pierce Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bands corresponding to CTPS1 were excised and cut into ∼1-mm pieces. Membrane pieces were placed in a siliconized microfuge tube, and MemCode destaining was done as recommended by the manufacturer. After membrane pieces were washed three times with ddH2O, they were incubated with 1% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone suspended in 100 mm acetic acid for at least 1 h at 37 °C. Membrane pieces were washed four times with ddH2O to ensure residual polyvinylpyrrolidone was removed. Membrane pieces were incubated with 0.5 μg of TPCK-modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were collected by removing the trypsin solution to a clean tube, washing the membrane pieces three times with ddH2O, and removing each ddH2O wash to the same clean tube containing the trypsin solution. The volume of collected peptides was reduced to a final volume of ∼10 μl using a speed vac. Recovery of radioactivity from membrane pieces was at least 85% as determined by Cerenkov counting. For separation of peptides on cellulose TLC plate, peptides were washed at least three times with ddH2O to remove ammonium bicarbonate. After the final ddH2O wash, peptides were resuspended in the first dimension buffer (pH 1.9 buffer, 15% v/v acetic acid, and 5% v/v of 88% formic acid) to give a final volume of ∼8 μl. The peptides were spotted in a corner of a 10 × 10-cm cellulose TLC plate, 1.5 cm from the sides of the plate. Peptides were electrophoresed in a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis box at 1000 V for 32 min. After thoroughly drying the TLC plate, peptides were separated in the second dimension using Scheidtmann buffer (isobutyric acid-pyridine-acetic acid-butanol-water, 65:5:3:2:29) (18Scheidtmann K.H. Echle B. Walter G. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 116-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After exposure of TLC plates to x-ray film or phosphorimaging plate, radioactive spots indicative of phosphopeptides were eluted as described previously (19Raska C.S. Parker C.E. Huang C. Han J. Glish G.L. Pope M. Borchers C.H. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Volume of peptides was decreased to ∼10 μl using a speed vac. Peptides were subjected to nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR® pulsar mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. Peptides were sequenced by nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using BioAnalyst software. Data Analysis—Statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post-hoc test and a 95% confidence interval. CTPS1 Is Phosphorylated in Response to Serum Starvation— Inhibition or activation of protein kinase A or protein kinase C did not alter the phosphorylation of endogenous human CTPS1 from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled HEK 293 cells (supplemental data). Instead, we observed that CTPS1 phosphorylation increased after incubation overnight in low serum (0.1% FBS). The average increase in radioactivity associated with endogenous CTPS1 isolated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled HEK 293 cells in 0.1% FBS was approximately twice that from cells maintained in 10% FBS. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatography separation of tryptic peptides from endogenous CTPS1 revealed five major phosphopeptide spots; consistent with the effects of low serum on CTPS phosphorylation, all five of these spots increased after serum starvation (Fig. 1A). Involvement of GSK3 in Phosphorylation of Endogenous CTPS1—Because we observed that phosphorylation of CTPS1 increased in low serum (0.1% FBS) conditions, kinases known to be activated under these conditions were investigated. Two kinases shown to be activated under low serum/nutrient starvation conditions are AMP-activated protein kinase and GSK3 (20Munday M.R. Milic M.R. Takhar S. Holness M.J. Sugden M.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Incubation of HEK 293 cells with the AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor compound C failed to inhibit the increase in CTPS1 phosphorylation induced by low serum (data not shown). Analysis of GSK3 demonstrated that the inhibitory phosphorylation site on GSK3 α/β (Ser-21, Ser-9 respectively) was decreased in 0.1% FBS, indicating that GSK3 was more active when HEK 293 cells were maintained overnight in low serum (Fig. 1B). To test whether GSK3 was involved in CTPS1 phosphorylation, HEK 293 cells were incubated with the GSK3 inhibitor indirubin-3′-monoxime (indirubin) or the vehicle (Me2SO) overnight in the presence of 10 or 0.1% FBS. The increase in low serum-induced CTPS1 phosphorylation was inhibited by indirubin, suggesting GSK3 was a candidate kinase necessary for the phosphorylation of CTPS1 (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of GSK3 prevented the low serum-induced phosphorylation of CTPS1 in four separate experiments. Shown is a representative experiment. Furthermore, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping showed that indirubin decreased the radioactivity of the five phosphopeptide spots equally (Fig. 1C). To further establish that GSK3 was specifically involved in low serum-induced CTPS1 phosphorylation, GSK3β protein expression was specifically reduced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. 1D). GSK3β siRNA almost completely eliminated GSK3β expression but did not affect GSK3α expression (Fig. 1D). Analysis of CTPS1 phosphorylation in these cells in two separate experiments demonstrated that low serum-induced CTPS1 phosphorylation was inhibited in cells transfected with GSK3β siRNA compared with cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 1D). Although much of the low serum-induced CTPS1 phosphorylation was inhibited by GSK3β siRNA, the reduction was not as significant as that observed after indirubin treatment (Fig. 1C), suggesting that GSK3α may also contribute to the phosphorylation of CTPS1. Identification of Ser-574 and Ser-575 as Phosphorylation Sites in Human CTPS1—To identify the amino acids phosphorylated in endogenous CTPS1, HEK 293 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and CTPS1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation. Tryptic peptides from endogenous CTPS1 were separated by two-dimensional TLC; the five phosphopeptide spots routinely observed were scraped and the peptides eluted and analyzed by nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Spot 3 was identified as a carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide (SGSSS*PDSEITELK; the asterisk denotes phosphorylation) containing a phosphorylation on serine 575 (Fig. 2A). Spots 1 and 5 were identified as the same peptide isolated but the tandem mass spectrometry da"
https://openalex.org/W2010495206,"Herpesviruses maintain long-term infectivity without marked antigenic variation. They must therefore evade neutralization by other means. Immune sera block murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) infection of fibroblasts, but fail to block and even enhance its infection of IgG Fc receptor-bearing cells, suggesting that the antibody response to infection is actually poor at ablating virion infectivity completely. Here we analyzed this effect further by quantitating the glycoprotein-specific antibody response of MHV-68 carrier mice. Gp150 was much the commonest glycoprotein target and played a predominant role in driving Fc receptor-dependent infection: when gp150-specific antibodies were boosted, Fc receptor-dependent infection increased; and when gp150-specific antibodies were removed, Fc receptor-dependent infection was largely lost. Neither gp150-specific monoclonal antibodies nor gp150-specific polyclonal sera gave significant virion neutralization. Gp150 therefore acts as an immunogenic decoy, distorting the MHV-68-specific antibody response to promote Fc receptor-dependent infection and so compromise virion neutralization. This immune evasion mechanism may be common to many non-essential herpesvirus glycoproteins."

Here we describe a second proteolytic event that generates an isoform lacking two active repression domains in the COOH terminus. This processing event was inhibited by treatment of cells with synthetic and natural caspase inhibitors. In vitro, several caspases generated a processed isoform that co-migrated with the in vivo generated product. In cells, recombinant CUX1 proteins in which the region of cleavage was deleted or in which Asp residues were mutated to Ala, were not proteolytically processed. Importantly, this processing event was not associated with apoptosis, as assessed by terminal dUTP nick end labeling assay, cytochrome c localization, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Moreover, processing was observed in S phase but not in early G1, suggesting that it is regulated through the cell cycle. The functional importance of this processing event was revealed in reporter and cell cycle assays. A recombinant, processed, CUX1 protein was a more potent transcriptional activator of several cell cycle-related genes and was able to accelerate entry into S phase, whereas mutants that could not be processed were inactive in either assay. Conversely, cells treated with the quinoline-Val Asp-2,6-difluorophenoxymethylketone caspase inhibitor proliferated more slowly and exhibited delayed S phase entry following exit from quiescence. Together, our results identify a substrate of caspases in proliferating cells and suggest a mechanism by which caspases can accelerate cell cycle progression.

Together, our results identify a substrate of caspases in proliferating cells and suggest a mechanism by which caspases can accelerate cell cycle progression. The roles of caspases in cytokine maturation and apoptosis have been thoroughly documented (for a detailed review, see Refs. 1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar and 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Caspases are expressed as inactive zymogens, and their activation proceeds by one of two mechanisms. Caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10, the initiator caspases, are activated by dimerization. They contain CARD (caspase recruitment domain) or DED (death effector domain) domains and are brought together via homotypic interactions with upstream molecules. Caspase-3, -6, and -7, the effector caspases, are present as inactive dimers that are activated by proteolysis (3Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Caspase substrates have aspartate in the P1 position, and the specificity of recognition by individual caspases is determined by the amino acids in the P2, P3, and P4 positions. In addition to their functions in cell death, caspases participate in nonapoptotic processes, such as differentiation and proliferation. Caspase activity has been documented during the differentiation of diverse cell types, including erythrocytes, keratinocytes, lens fiber, and sperm cells, and was often accompanied by some of the morphological changes associated with apoptosis (e.g. chromatin condensation, enucleation, and remodeling of the cytoplasm) (4Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 5Morioka K. Tone S. Mukaida M. Takano-Ohmuro H. Exp.

Med. 2001; 193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, differentiation of monocyte into macrophages did not involve morphological signs of apoptosis (7Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of caspases in proliferation comes mostly from the study of the immune system. A number of studies revealed that caspases were activated following T cell stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, IL-2, or other mitogens (8Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sekaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 9Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, no evidence of cell death was detected. Moreover, a number of caspase inhibitors were able to block T cell proliferation (8Alam A. Cohen L.Y. Aouad S. Sekaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 9Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, an inherited mutation in humans, causing defects in the activation of T, B, and NK (natural killer) cells, was mapped to the caspase-8 gene (12Chun H.J. Zheng L. Ahmad M. Wang J. Speirs C.K. Siegel R.M. Dale J.K. Puck J. Davis J. Hall C.G. Skoda-Smith S. Atkinson T.P. Straus S.E. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 2002; 419: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In mice, T cell-restricted ablation of the caspase-8 gene resulted in a decrease in the number of peripheral T cells and impaired activation-induced T cell proliferation (13Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for the involvement of caspases in T cell proliferation was also suggested from studies on Fas-associated via death domain, FADD. In mice that lack FADD function, either due to gene ablation or expression of a dominant negative, T cells were defective in activation-induced proliferation (14Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 15Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, T cells expressing dominant negative FADD mutant arrested in G0/G1 (15Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Mice expressing a FADD mutant in which serine 191 was mutated to aspartate were smaller and anemic and presented splenomegaly. No defect in apoptosis was noticed, but an impairment in the cell cycle progression of T cell was evident (16Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the equivalent serine in human FADD is differentially phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle, further suggesting that post-translational modifications could modulate FADD function (16Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the mechanism(s) by which caspases participate in cell proliferation. One study reported a correlation between cell proliferation in the BJAB B-lymphoid cell line and a caspase-like activity that caused the truncation of the p27Kip1 Cdk inhibitor (17Frost V. Al-Mehairi S. Sinclair A.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2737-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following T cell receptor activation, caspase-8 was shown to induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity (18Dohrman A. Kataoka T. Cuenin S. Russell J.Q. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5270-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Su H. Bidere N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K. Dale J. Salmena L. Hakem R. Straus S. Lenardo M. Science. 2005; 307: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the long isoform of FLICE-like inhibitory protein, cFLIPL, was found to function both as an activator and substrate of caspase-8 (18Dohrman A. Kataoka T. Cuenin S. Russell J.Q. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5270-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). cFLIPL was shown to activate caspase-8 by forming a heterodimer with it. In turn, the cleavage of cFLIPL into p43FLIP enhanced its ability to recruit adaptor proteins that promote activation of NF-κB. Apart from cFLIPL, no other caspase substrate has been conclusively identified in this system. Thus, although a number of substrates have been described in apoptotic conditions, substrates that are associated with proliferation still remain to be identified. Limited proteolysis regulates the activities of many transcription factors. Cleavage of Notch, SREBP, and others results in their translocation to the nucleus (21Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar, 22Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Alternatively, limited proteolysis of IRF2, Stat3, -5, and -6, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein removes their activation domains (23Hendry L. John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4613-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CUX1 is a transcription factor that has variously been named CDP, CUTL1, CUX, or CDP/Cux. CUX1 has recently been identified as a substrate for the cathepsin L cysteine protease in the S phase of the cell cycle (24Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The product of this proteolysis, p110, lacks the amino-terminal inhibitory domain and the cut repeat 1 (CR1) and binds more stably to DNA (25Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Truscott M. Raynal L. Wang Y. Berube G. Leduy L. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49787-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the full-length CUX1 protein was characterized as a transcriptional repressor, the processed p110 isoform was found to function both as a repressor and as an activator (reviewed in Ref. 27Nepveu A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; see Refs. 25Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Truscott M. Raynal L. Premdas P. Goulet B. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32712-32721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the regulatory effect of p110 CUX1 remains to be defined. In the present study, we show that another proteolytic processing event results in the removal of the COOH-terminal region of CUX1, which contains two active repression domains. Treatment of cells with a panel of protease inhibitors suggested that a caspase was responsible. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mapped the region of cleavage to one or more aspartate residues downstream of the Cut homeodomain. This cleavage was observed in proliferating cells and was confirmed to occur in the absence of apoptosis. In vitro processing assays suggested that CUX1 can be a substrate for multiple caspases. Interestingly, a truncated recombinant protein was a more potent activator in reporter assays and was also able to accelerate entry into S phase. These results identify a novel caspase substrate that plays a role in cell proliferation. Sequences and/or maps will be provided upon request for CUX1-(831-1505) Δ1320-1351, Myc-CUX1-(878-1505)-HA D1320,36,39A, Myc-CUX1-(878-1336), and pTriEx/his/Myc1062-1505/CBP/protA constructs. All other CUX1 constructs have been described in our previous studies, although they were called CDP/Cux (25Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Santaguida M. Ding Q. Berube G. Truscott M. Whyte P. Nepveu A. J. Biol.

The pTriEx/his/Myc1062-1505/CBP/protA expression plasmid was introduced into the BL21 (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1.5 h. Cleared lysates were resuspended in IPP-100 buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 4.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercatoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene). EGTA was used to elute the purified CUX1-containing complexes from the calmodulin column. Recombinant caspases were expressed in E. coli as COOH-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins using the pET expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI). Proteins were expressed in the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain (Novagen) and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography as previously described (31Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hs578T cells were grown in DMEM 3The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IL, interleukin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; Q-VD-OPh, quinoline-Val Asp-2,6-difluorophenoxymethylketone; DEVD-CHO, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde. supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NIH3T3 and MCF-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Kit225 T cells stably expressing CUX1 proteins were generated as in Ref. 32Sansregret L. Goulet B. Harada R. Wilson B. Leduy L. Bertoglio J. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2441-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 75 ng/ml human IL-2. Transient transfections were performed with GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synchronization of NIH3T3 cells was performed by two methods. Serum Starvation/Stimulation—Post-transfection, cells were maintained in DMEM for 72 h and then in DMEM plus 10% FBS for the indicated times. Thymidine Block—Post-transfection, cells were cultured overnight in DMEM plus 10% FBS supplemented with 2 mm thymidine and harvested. Stably infected Kit225 cells were deprived of IL-2 for 48 h, followed by IL-2 addition for the indicated times. Cell cycle distribution was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting following ethanol fixation and propidium iodide staining (32Sansregret L. Goulet B. Harada R. Wilson B. Leduy L. Bertoglio J. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2441-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were stained using the CellTrace™ carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining cell proliferation kit and were analyzed by flow cytometry with 488-nm excitation and emission filters appropriate for fluorescein, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). CSFE profiles were analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star Software). Luciferase assays were performed as previously described (25Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the internal control plasmid is itself often repressed by CUX1, as a control for transfection efficiency the purified β-galactosidase protein (Sigma) was included in the transfection mix, as previously described (33Howcroft T.K. Kirshner S.L. Singer D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was then normalized based on β-galactosidase activity. Antibodies 510, 861, 1061, and 1300 have been described previously (25Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody c-20 is a goat polyclonal antibody raised against the last 20 amino acids of CUX1 (sc-6327; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Lee et al. (35Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), except that nuclei were obtained by submitting cells to one freeze/thaw cycle in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Nuclei were then resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After 15 min of centrifugation, the supernatant was collected. Buffers A and C were supplemented with protease inhibitor mix tablet purchased from Roche Applied Science and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Total extracts were prepared by applying modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors as above) to a monolayer plate. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the resulting slurry was centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with the antibodies indicated. An actin antibody was used to monitor equal loading (sc-1615). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-rabbit (1:4000) (sc-2313), α-mouse (1:10,000) (Jackson Immunoresearch), or anti-goat (1:4000) (sc-2020) secondary antibodies were used. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence with an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown for 16 h in medium containing [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. Total extracts were prepared as above (modified radioimmune precipitation buffer), and precleared with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with antibody, beads were added for 1 h. Complexes were washed two times with wash buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS), two washes with wash buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and one wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were boiled in sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem and used at the following working concentrations: 20 μm E-64d, 40 μm MG132, 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk, 100 μm DEVD-CHO, 100 μm pepstatin A. Q-VD-OPh was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products; a 100 μm working concentration was used. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with the indicated quantity of purified protein. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a final volume of 30 μl of 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin with 0.2 pmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1), 0.5× TBE gel and separated by electrophoresis at 8 V/cm in 0.5× TBE. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. In vitro cleavage reactions were performed using 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.015% CHAPS, 1 m sodium citrate, 10 mm dithiothreitol (for caspase-2, -3, -8, -9, and -10) or 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose (for caspase-6 and -7). Caspases were activated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of 65 nm purified CUX1 protein. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20 min, after which loading buffer was added and samples were boiled. The second order rate constant was calculated as described in Ref. 31Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, kcat/Km = k = ln 2/t × E, where E is the active caspase concentration that cleaved 50% of the CUX1 substrate in the incubation period t. A terminal dUTP nick end labeling assay for free DNA 3′-OH ends was performed as per the manufacturer's directions with the ApopTag kit S7110 (Serologicals). NIH3T3 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected or not (see figure legends). Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then solubilized (5% FBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated with primary antibodies α-Myc9e10, falloidin, α-cytochrome c, or α-Tom-20. Secondary antibody (anti-mouse Alexa-488 (1:1000) or anti-rabbit Alexa-594) was added for 30 min. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss AxioVert 135 microscope with a ×63 objective or using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. CUX1 Is Proteolytically Processed Downstream of the Homeodomain in Proliferating Cells—Previous studies, in which immunoblotting was performed with an NH2-terminal antibody, have revealed a species that was shorter than the full-length CUX1 protein (27Nepveu A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28Truscott M. Raynal L. Premdas P. Goulet B. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3013-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that CUX1 was proteolytically processed at its COOH terminus. To verify this hypothesis, a panel of CUX1 proteins starting at amino acid 1, 659, or 878 were expressed in Hs578T cells and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the NH2-terminal Myc epitope tag. In addition to the full-length protein, in each case we could detect a species that was shorter than the parental molecule by 20-30 kDa (Fig. 1A). We next asked whether this proteolytic event was cell cycle-regulated. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a vector expressing Myc-CUX1-(878-1505)-HA and were then synchronized in early G1, mid-G1, and S phases by serum deprivation and restimulation or thymidine block (see “Experimental Procedures”). The COOH-terminally cleaved protein was barely visible in early G1 and mid-G1 but was strongly expressed in unsynchronized cells and in S phase using either method of synchronization (Fig. 1B). Importantly, there was no sub-2N peak, which indicates the presence of apoptotic cells, at the time points where processing was observed (Fig. 1B; also see Fig. 3B). These results suggested that CUX1 is COOH-terminally truncated in proliferating cells.FIGURE 2COOH-terminal proteolytic processing can be inhibited by caspase inhibitors.A, NIH3T3 and MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with a vector expressing Myc-CUX1-(878-1505) or Kit225 cells stably expressing Myc-CUX1-(747-1505) were treated with protease inhibitors as indicated. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blot with a Myc antibody. B, Hs578T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing a Myc-tagged CUX1 protein and a plasmid expressing either nothing or the indicated CrmA mutant. Western blot analysis was performed on nuclear extracts 48 h post-transfection. C and D, Hs578T cells were transfected with vectors expressing the 878-1336 or 878-1505 CUX1 proteins, either wild type or with the indicated mutations: deletion of residues 1320-1351 or replacement of Asp1320, Asp1336, and/or Asp1339 with alanine.

Hs578T cells were labeled overnight with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with 861 and 1300 antibodies or, as a control, an HA antibody (Fig. 1C). Following autoradiography, the p200 and p110 CUX1 isoforms were detected, as well as an 80-kDa isoform that could be the product of processing events at the NH2 and COOH termini. In order to address this possibility and to attempt to map the epitopes present in the 80-kDa isoform, nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with a series of CUX1 antibodies, followed by Western blotting with the 1300 antibody (Fig. 1D; see Fig. 1E for a diagram of the protein and antibodies). As expected, p200 was immunoprecipitated by all of the antibodies (Fig. 1D, lanes 1-5). In contrast, p110 was detected following immunoprecipitation with antibodies 861, 1061, and 1300 but not with 510 and only weakly with C-20 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1-5). The 80-kDa species was immunoprecipitated with antibodies 861, 1061, and 1300 but not with 510 or C-20 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1-5). These results are consistent with the notion that an endogenous 80-kDa CUX1 species is truncated at both its COOH and NH2 termini. Here-after, this species will be called p80. A Caspase Cleaves CUX1 in the COOH-terminal Region—To determine which protease(s) cleaves the CUX1 COOH terminus, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a vector expressing Myc-CUX1-(878-1505)-HA, and, following treatment with a series of protease inhibitors, nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blot with the Myc antibody (Figs. 2A and 7A). Proteolytic processing was partially inhibited by treatment with Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A) and Q-VD-OPh (Fig. 7A), both broad spectrum caspase inhibitors, but not by any of the other inhibitors tested (Fig. 2A, compare lane 5 with the other lanes). Inhibition by Z-VAD-fmk was also observed in transfected MCF-7 and Kit225 T cells stably expressing Myc-CUX1 747-1505-HA (Fi"

https://openalex.org/W1973742026,"In many tumor cell types, ionizing radiation (IR) or DNA-damaging anticancer drugs enhance sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis, which is of great clinical interest. We have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the response to combined modality treatment in p53-mutant Jurkat T leukemic cells overexpressing Bcl-2. These cells are largely resistant to individual treatment with TRAIL or IR, but sensitive to combined treatment, in vitro as well as in vivo. We demonstrate that IR and DNA-damaging anticancer drugs enable TRAIL receptor-2 and CD95/Fas to bypass the mitochondrial pathway for effector caspase activation. This was validated by RNA interference for Bax and Bak and by overexpression of dominant-negative Caspase-9. Improved effector caspase activation was neither caused by altered expression of proapoptotic components nor by impaired activity of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins or nuclear factor-κB signaling. Rather, we found that pretreatment of cells with IR caused quantitative and qualitative changes in death receptor signaling. It strongly improved the capacity of ligand-bound receptors to recruit FADD and activate Caspase-8 and -10 in the death-inducing signaling complex, while c-FLIPL levels were unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W2108021524,"Angiogenesis and hematopoiesis are closely linked and interactive with each other, but few studies were given to identify possible links between angiogenesis-promoting proteins and hematopoiesis-related transcription factors. Here we investigated the potential relationship of oxygen-sensitive α-subunit of angiogenesis-related hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) with Runt-related protein 1 (Runx1, also known as acute myeloid leukemia-1, AML-1), an important hematopoietic transcription factor. The results demonstrated that Runx1 and HIF-1α proteins directly interacted with each other to a degree, in which Runt homology domain of Runx1 was mainly involved. Leukemia-related abnormal Runx1 fusion protein AML1-ETO, which fuses the N-terminal 177 amino acid residues of the Runx1 protein in frame to ETO (eight-twenty-one) protein, also interacted with HIF-1α protein with greater ability than Runx1 itself. More intriguingly, Runx1 overexpression inhibited DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of HIF-1 protein with reduced expression of HIF-1-targeted genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor, while silence of Runx1 expression by specific small interfering RNA significantly increased transcriptional activity of HIF-1 protein, suggesting that Runx1 inhibited transcription-dependent function of HIF-1. Vice versa, HIF-1α increased DNA-binding ability and transcriptional activity of Runx1 protein. All these data would shed new insight to understanding Runx1 and HIF-1α-related hematopoietic cell differentiation and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986547465,"To ensure precise neurotransmission and prevent neurotoxic accumulation, l-glutamate (Glu), the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, is cleared from the synapse by glutamate transporters (GluTs). The molecular components of Glu synapses are highly conserved between <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and mammals, yet the absence of synaptic insulation in <i>C. elegans</i> raises fundamental questions about Glu clearance strategies in the nematode nervous system. To gain insight into how Glu clearance is accomplished and how GluTs impact neurotransmission, we probed expression and function of all 6 GluTs found in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome. Disruption of each GluT impacts multiple Glu-dependent behaviors, with GluT combinations commonly increasing the severity of behavioral deficits. Interestingly, the sole GluT that we find expressed in neurons is localized predominantly in presynaptic neurons, in contrast to the postsynaptic concentration of neuronal GluTs typical in mammals. Moreover, 3 of the 6 GluT genes appear strongly expressed on the capillary excretory canal cell, where they affect Glu-dependent behaviors from positions distal to glutamatergic circuits. Indeed, our focused study of GLT-3, one of the distally expressed GluTs, shows that despite this distance, GLT-3 function can balance the activity mediated by synaptic release and synaptic receptors. The effects of distal GluTs on glutamatergic circuits support that Glu diffusion outside the vicinity of the synapse is a critical factor in <i>C. elegans</i> neurotransmission. Together with the presynaptic localization of neuronal GluTs, these observations suggest an unusual strategy for Glu clearance in <i>C. elegans</i>."

They suppressed regression by activating the ERK pathway that antagonized the Rho/ROCK pathway, which was essential for regression. These studies reveal that SFKs contribute to several phases of the angiogenic program and identify the downstream effectors by which SFKs stabilize tubes. The angiogenic program consists of a deliberately orchestrated series of cellular events by which new vessels arise from pre-existing ones. Misregulated angiogenesis underlies major human diseases such as cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (1Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar, 2Gariano R.F. Gardner T.W. Nature. 2005; 438: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Hence there is an acute need to identify angiomodulators and the relationships between them. The greatest advances in this regard have been the discovery of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 2The abbreviations used are:VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorSFKSrc family kinaseBRECbovine retinal endothelial cellPI3Kphosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinasePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPDGFRPDGF receptorPLCphospholipase CPtdIns-4,5-P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphateERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase.

Pathol. 2007; 171: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) has catalyzed research to identify signaling enzymes that govern the various phases of the angiogenic program. For instance, the Rho/ROCK pathway is essential for the remodeling/regression phase of the angiogenic program (7Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11686-11695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway antagonizes the Rho/ROCK pathway and thereby stabilizes vessels (8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibiting the ERK pathway within tumor vessels results in reduced angiogenesis and tumor growth (8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus elucidating the signaling enzymes that regulate individual phases of the angiogenesis program is a proven approach to guide development of new anti-angiogenic therapies. Although regression of vessels is in certain cases the inevitable consequence of growth factor withdrawal (9Benjamin L.E. Golijanin D. Itin A. Pode D. Keshet E. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), this is not always the case (10Im E. Kazlauskas A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2057-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the post-natal developing mouse eye, hyaloid vessels regress within the first 2 postnatal weeks, and this regression is correlated with macrophage-induced apoptosis of the endothelial cells (11Lang R. Lustig M. Francois F. Sellinger M. Plesken H. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, extracellular factors can induce regression. For instance, angiopoietin 2 induces vessel regression, provided that the action of VEGF is blocked (12Oshima Y. Oshima S. Nambu H. Kachi S. Takahashi K. Umeda N. Shen J. Dong A. Apte R.S. Duh E. Hackett S.F. Okoye G. Ishibashi K. Handa J. Melia M. Wiegand S. Yancopoulos G. Zack D.J. Campochiaro P.A. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 963-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several laboratories discovered that signaling enzymes such as PLCγ, Rho/ROCK, and the ERK pathway govern vessel regression (7Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11686-11695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J.

Together these studies indicate that vessels regress for multiple reasons. In some cases regression results from the withdrawal of the pro-angiogenic growth factors, whereas in other situations regression is the deliberate response directed by specific signaling enzymes (10Im E. Kazlauskas A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2057-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SFKs have been found previously to contribute to angiogenesis (14Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 15Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L. Hood J.D. Leng J. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 915-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We extended these findings by identifying the phases of the angiogenic program to which SFKs contribute. We report that SFKs promote tube formation and antagonize regression. The underlying mechanism appears to involve SFK-dependent activation of ERK, which antagonizes Rho and thereby suppresses regression. These findings suggest that SFKs participate in controlling vessel stability. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt antibody, anti-Akt antibody, anti-phospho-ERK antibody, and anti-ERK antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-myosin light chain (MLC) 2 antibody and anti-MLC 2 antibody were the gifts from Dr. Alexey M. Belkin (University of Maryland, Baltimore). The anti-SFK antibody, which recognizes multiple SFKs, was a mouse monoclonal antibody that was described previously (16Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-SFK (Y418) antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE and recognizes the appropriately phosphorylated forms of Src, Fyn, and Yes. The RasGAP and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) antibodies were crude polyclonal rabbit antisera that were described previously (16Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-permeable C3 enzyme was purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). PD98059 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. SU6656 and Y27632 were purchased from Calbiochem. The BB isoform of PDGF (PDGF-B; referred to as “PDGF” throughout) was purchased fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs) were obtained as described previously (18Gitlin J.D. D'Amore P.A. Microvasc. Res. 1983; 26: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Im E. Venkatakrishnan A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3488-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and were maintained in EBM (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Clonetics), 80 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin C (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), and 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract (Clonetics). The cells were maintained in tissue culture dishes that had been coated with 50 μg/ml bovine fibronectin. For all experiments, cells were used between passages 7 and 10. Tube Formation Assay—The tube formation assay was performed as described previously (19Im E. Venkatakrishnan A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3488-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The average tube length was routinely 15–30 mm. Each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated on at least three independent occasions. Construction of α/β Chimeric PDGFR Mutants—The tyrosine phosphorylation sites that permit association of SFKs with the PDGFβ receptor (PDGFRβ) (Tyr-579 and -581 in the juxtamembrane domain) are also required for maximal PDGF-stimulated kinase activity (20Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In contrast, the corresponding Tyr residues in the PDGFα receptor (PDGFRα) could be mutated to phenylalanine without compromising the kinase activity of the PDGFRα (22Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like PDGFRα, the kinase activity of a chimeric PDGFR(α/β) was unaffected by phenylalanine substitution of these two Tyr residues (23DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chimera consisted of the extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane domains from the PDGFRα, and the remainder of the intracellular portion was PDGFRβ (24DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The α/β F7 chimera receptor has tyrosines 572, 574, 740, 751, 771, 1009, and 1021 mutated to phenylalanine. Consequently, it is unable to recruit or activate SFKs, PI3K, RasGAP, SHP2, and PLCγ. The α/β SFK+ receptor is the same as α/β F7, except that the Tyr residues necessary for engaging SFKs (572 and 574) have been repaired. Similarly, the Tyr residues necessary for recruitment of PI3K (740 and 751) were restored in the α/β PI3K+ chimera. The α/β SFK/PI3K+ chimera contained the Tyr residues necessary for recruiting both SFKs and PI3K. The chimeric α/β PDGFR cDNAs were subcloned into the retroviral vector pLXSN2 and transfected into 293GPG cells. The virus-containing medium was collected for 5 days, concentrated (25,000 × g, 90 min, 4 °C), and used as described previously (25Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Cells were infected and selected on the basis of proliferation in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml). The expression level of the chimeric receptors was comparable, except for α/β F7, which was severalfold below the others (supplemental Fig. S1A). Association of SFKs with the chimeric receptors was dependent on tyrosines 572 and 574 (supplemental Fig. S1B). R388A and D386N Src Mutants—The murine Src R388A and Src D386N cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Philip A. Cole (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore) (26Qiao Y. Molina H. Pandey A. Zhang J. Cole P.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). They were subcloned into the pLXSN vector and stably expressed in BRECs as described above. The expression level of the mutants is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—For Western blot analysis, 2 × 106 BRECs were plated into a 10-cm tissue culture plate, incubated for at least 18 h in culture medium, and serum-starved for at least 18 h in medium containing 0.2% horse serum. Total cell lysates were prepared by adding lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm sodium fluoride) and incubating for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was determined. 10–30 μg of proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Im E. Venkatakrishnan A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3488-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To re-probe a blot, the blot was first stripped by incubating for 30 min at 60 °C in a buffer containing 6.25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then reprobed with the desired primary antibody. To analyze cells that had been plated in a collagen gel, the gel was dissolved by a collagenase treatment (collagenase type I-S, 281 units/well for 20–30 min at 37 °C), and the liberated cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described previously (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Preparation of Retinal Explants— The vessel outgrowth procedure was a modification of a previously published protocol (19Im E. Venkatakrishnan A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3488-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Knott R.M. Robertson M. Muckersie E. Folefac V.A. Fairhurst F.E. Wileman S.M. Forrester J.V. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, a collagen gel mixture was prepared as described for the tube formation assay, and 400 μl was placed into each well of 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow the gel to solidify. Whole retinas were dissected from enucleated eyes and spread out in a Petri dish containing phosphate-buffered saline. The retinas were cut into pieces of ∼1 mm diameter. Individual explants were added to 200 μlof a freshly prepared collagen gel mixture and placed on top of the solidified collagen gel. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to permit solidification of the newly added collagen. At the end of this incubation, 500 μl of medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, and 25 ng/ml mouse VEGF (R & D Systems) was added. The explants were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated duration, during which time they were periodically photographed through an Eclipse TE300 inverted phase microscope (Nikon). Images were captured using Adobe Photoshop, and the data were imported as a TIFF file into NIH Image. The total vessel length in each explant was measured, and the data were imported into Microsoft Excel. Statistics—The Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance. We previously reported that PI3K was required for tube formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These studies relied in part on the Tyr-740/Tyr-751 PDGFRβ that recruits and activates two signaling enzymes known to be involved with angiogenesis, PI3K and SFKs. In this study we used molecular and pharmacological approaches to assess the role of SFKs in tube formation and regression. SFKs Promoted Tube Formation—We first examined tube formation. As shown in Fig. 1A, the chimera that was unable to recruit either SFK or PI3K (α/β F7) failed to form tubes in response to endogenously produced PDGF (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although boosting the level of PDGF to 10 ng/ml improved the response, it was never very strong for these cells. The low, endogenous level of PDGF was also insufficient to induce tube formation in cells expressing the α/β SFK+ chimera (which activates SFKs (23DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1B)). However, tubes formed readily when the concentration of PDGF was increased (Fig. 1A). Cells expressing the chimera that activated PI3K (α/β PI3K+) formed tubes in both experimental settings, and the response was greater in the presence of the higher concentration of PDGF (Fig. 1A). These studies indicate that both SFKs and PI3K were capable of promoting tube formation and that in the context of the PDGFR, PI3K was more effective than SFKs. Although α/β SFK+ recruits and activates SFK, it is possible that other proteins engaged by this receptor were responsible for inducing tube formation. To address this possibility, we tested the effect of inhibiting the activity of SFKs on tube formation. Tube formation was suppressed by an SFK inhibitor (SU6656) in cells expressing α/β SFK+ chimera but not in cells expressing the α/β PI3K+ chimera (Fig. 1B). We conclude that SFK activity was required downstream of the α/β SFK+ chimera for tube formation. Endothelial cells typically express Src, Fyn, and Yes (28Werdich X.Q. Penn J.S. Angiogenesis. 2005; 8: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and both Fyn and Yes were readily detectable in BRECs, whereas Lyn was not (supplemental Fig. S1C). Because we did not have an Src-specific antibody, we were unable to determine whether Src was expressed in these cells. PDGF activated SFKs in the α/β SFK+ chimera-expressing BRECs within the expected time frame (supplemental Fig. S1D). Thus it appears that Fyn and/or Yes were among the SFK family members that were promoting tube formation. Finally, we investigated the mechanism by which SFKs induced tube formation. Because several reports indicate that SFKs can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway (29Arcaro A. Aubert M. Espinosa del Hierro M.E. Khanzada U. Angelidou S. Tetley T.D. Bittermann A.G. Frame M.C. Seckl M.J.

Basson M.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1730-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we tested if SFKs activated Akt. Indeed, SFKs increased phospho-Akt without recruiting PI3K to chimeric PDGFR (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Furthermore, SFK-dependent tube formation was attenuated by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) (supplemental Fig. S2C). These results suggest that SFKs promoted tube formation by activating PI3K/Akt. SFKs Attenuated Tube Regression—After tubes form, they regress despite daily media changes and the continual presence of serum and pro-angiogenic factors (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We used four complementary approaches to test whether SFKs influenced regression. First, we compared regression of tubes organized from cells expressing chimeras that activated SFKs (α/β SFK+) or PI3K (α/β PI3K+) or both PI3K and SFKs (α/β SFK/PI3K+) in the presence of high PDGF (which was needed to observe tube formation by the α/β SFK+-expressing cells). Fig. 2A shows that the α/β PI3K+ tubes regressed, whereas tubes formed with cells expressing chimeras that activated SFKs (α/β SFKPI3K+ or α/β SFK+) did not. Second, we observed that pharmacologically inhibiting SFKs promoted regression of the α/β SFK/PI3K+ tubes (Fig. 2B). Third, we considered whether SFKs also prevented regression when driven by VEGF acting through endogenous VEGF receptors. Indeed, pharmacologically inhibiting SFKs enhanced regression (Fig. 2C). Fourth, we tested if activating Src would prevent regression of VEGF-driven tubes. For these experiments, we stably expressed a point mutant of Src that can be activated by imidazole (R388A) (26Qiao Y. Molina H. Pandey A. Zhang J. Cole P.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Characterization of these cells indicated that imidazole activated Src in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the R388A-expressing cells, but not in cells expressing D386N that is not responsive to imidazole (Fig. 2, D and E). Importantly, activation of Src prevented regression of VEGF-induced tubes (Fig. 2F). Taken together these data indicate that SFKs antagonized regression of tubes.FIGURE 2SFKs inhibited tube regression. A, α/β SFK+ or α/β PI3K+ or α/β SFK/PI3K+ cells were subjected to a tube assay in the presence of high PDGF (10 ng/ml) as described in the legend of Fig. 1. The medium was changed every day. At the indicated times, photographs were taken, and tube lengths were measured. The difference between day 1 and 2 for the α/β PI3K+ tubes was statistically significant (*, p < 0.001). The diagram at the bottom of this panel indicates the proteins that are recruited to each of the mutants in an activation-dependent manner. B, α/β SFK/PI3K+ cells were subjected to a tube assay in the presence or absence of SU6656 (10 μm; added to the medium) as indicated. The difference between day 1 and 2 in the presence of SU6656 was statistically significant (*, p < 0.01), whereas it was not in the absence of SU6656. C, same as in B, except that the cells were parental BRECs, and tube formation was driven by exogenously added VEGF-A (2.5 ng/ml). The difference between 0 and 10 μm was statistically significant (*, p < 0.0001 at day 2). D, cells expressing R388A or D386N mutants were starved in EBM with 0.2% horse serum for 16–18 h. Freshly prepared imidazole (15 mm) was added for the indicated times. The cells were harvested, and total cell lysates were subjected to a Western blot using an anti-phospho-SFK (Y418) antibody. The blot was then stripped and re-probed with an anti-SFKs antibody. E, same as D, except all cells received the designated amount of imidazole for 15 min. F, cells expressing the indicated Src mutant were subjected to a tube assay. Imidazole (15 mm) or buffer was added at day 2. The difference between R388A and D386N mutants was statistically significant (*, p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Src Blocked Tube Regression by Antagonizing RhoA/ROCK Pathway —We next investigated the mechanism by which SFKs suppressed regression. A recent study indicates that Src can antagonize RhoA (32Janiak A. Zemskov E.A. Belkin A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1606-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A second publication reported that Rho is required for tube destabilization/regression (8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SFKs attenuated tube regression by blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing serine/threonine protein kinase (ROCK) pathway (Fig. 5). The first step in testing our hypothesis was to determine whether the RhoA/ROCK pathway was required for regression in our system. Indeed, we found that blocking RhoA or ROCK prevented regression of tubes in the VEGF- and PDGF-driven models (Fig. 3, A–C). Thus, the Rho/ROCK pathway was required for regression in our systems as in those used by other groups (7Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11686-11695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J.

A, α/β PI3K+ cells were subjected to a tube assay in which a Rho (C3; 10 μg/ml) or a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632; 1 μm) was added after tubes had formed. B, same as A, except that the cells were parental BRECs and tube formation was driven by exogenously added VEGF-A (2.5 ng/ml). C, representative photos of the tubes that formed in the experiment described in B; bar, 100 μm. D, cells expressing the indicated chimeras were stimulated with PDGF (1 ng/ml) for 5 min. Total cell lysates were subjected to a Western blot using an anti-phospho-MLC2 (Ser-19) antibody. The blot was then stripped and re-probed with an anti-MLC2 antibody. The ratio of the phospho-MLC2/MLC2 signal was quantified and presented as the mean± S.D. from all three experiments. The difference between p-MLC2 inα/β SFK/PI3K+ and α/β PI3K+ cells was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The fold stimulation (+/–PDGF) is shown below the MLC2 blot. E, α/β SFK/PI3K+ cells were subjected to a tube assay in the presence of a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632; 1μm) and/or Src inhibitor (SU6656; 10μm). The day 2 data are presented. The difference between SU6656 and SU6656 + Y27632 was statistically significant (*, p < 0.0001). F, same as E, except that the cells were parental BRECs, and tube formation was driven by exogenously added VEGF-A (2.5 ng/ml). The difference between SU6656 and SU6656 + Y27632 at day 2 was statistically significant (*, p < 0.0001). G, retinal explants were isolated from wild-type mice (C57BL/6;129 mixed background, n = 4 per group) and plated in a collagen sandwich gel in the presence of 25 ng/ml mouse VEGF. On day 14 (once the vessels had growth to ∼50% of the length attained at day 25), SU6656 (10 μm) and/or Y27632 (1 μm) was added. On day 25, the total length of the vessels was quantified, and the percentage of disorganized vessels was determined. Disorganized vessels are ones that formed normally but then underwent dissolution when the cells migrated out of the vessel. The percentage of disorganized vessels is presented in the table. The difference between SU6656 and Y27632 + SU6656 was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The panels show representative data from explants derived from four mice; bar, 100 μm. The right-hand panel in the top row is a close up showing the morphology of a disorganized vessel; bar, 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we tested if SFKs antagonize the Rho/ROCK pathway by measuring phosphorylation of MLC 2 at Ser-19, which depends at least in part on ROCK activity (33Ren X.D. Wang R. Li Q. Kahek L.A. Kaibuchi K. Clark R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3511-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, PDGF stimulation (1 ng/ml, 5 min) of phospho-MLC2 was reduced in the α/β SFK+ cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, although PDGF stimulated phosphorylation of MLC2 in the α/β PI3K+ cells, enabling the chimera to also activate SFKs (α/β SFK/PI3K+) reduced MLC2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that SFKs inhibited ROCK activity and support our hypothesis that SFKs attenuate regression by antagonizing the RhoA/ROCK pathway (Fig. 5). If SFKs suppressed regression by inhibiting the Rho/ROCK pathway, then the SFK inhibitor should be unable to promote regression of tubes when the Rho/ROCK pathway is blocked. We found that the ability of SU6656 to promote regression was substantially diminished in ROCK inhibitor Y27632-treated tubes (Fig. 3, E and F). These findings suggest SFKs attenuate regression by antagonizing the RhoA/ROCK pathway. We also tested whether the relationship between the SFK-Rho/ROCK pathways was relevant beyond the in vitro tube assay. To this end we used a retinal organ culture (19Im E. Venkatakrishnan A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3488-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in which vessels grew out of retinal explants in response to VEGF. Outgrowth was first detected on day 10 and continued for at least 1 month. The SFK inhibitor (added at day 14) promoted the disorganization of vessels, which was characterized by the migration of cells out of the vessels and vessel dissolution (Fig. 3G). The SU6656-induced disorganization of vessels was diminished in cultures that were also treated with Y27632 (Fig. 3G). These findings indicate that the SFK-Rho/ROCK relationship appears to regulate the stability of vessels in the retinal explant setting as it does in the in vitro tube assay. ERK Was the Liaison between SFKs and the Rho/ROCK Pathway—To identify the intermediary between SFKs and the Rho/ROCK pathway, we considered ERK because of previously published reports. Marshall and co-workers (8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ERK regulates Rho in the context of vessel stability/regression. Furthermore, SFKs can activate ERK and thereby promote endothelial cell proliferation and motility (34Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Because of these publications we hypothesized that SFKs act through ERK to block Rho/ROCK and thereby prevent tube regression (Fig. 5). A prerequisite for our hypothesis is that SFKs activate ERK in our model. Chimeras capable of recruiting SFKs (α/β SFK+ and α/β SFK/PI3K+) activated ERK better than the corresponding chimeras that did not recruit SFKs (α/β F7 and α/β PI3K+) (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, pharmacologically inhibiting SFKs reduced ERK activation in both the basal and PDGF-stimulated settings (Fig. 4C). These results reveal that active SFKs were required for ERK activity. If SFKs prevented regression through an ERK-dependent pathway, then blocking the ERK pathway should destabilize tubes. Indeed, although vehicle-treated α/β SFK+ tubes were stable, those that received PD98059 regressed (Fig. 4D). The experiment in Fig. 4D also shows that formation of tubes was much less dependent on the ERK pathway because tube formation was only modestly affected by inhibition of the ERK pathway, and only at the highest dose (50 μm) of PD98059 (Fig. 4D). Finally, if the Rho/ROCK pathway were downstream of ERK, then blocking the Rho/ROCK pathway would protect tubes from PD98059-induced regression. Indeed, we found that the ability of PD98059 to promote regression was substantially diminished in ROCK inhibitor Y27632-treated tubes (Fig. 4E). Taken together our findings support the following model regarding how SFKs prevent tube regression (Fig. 5). Activation of SFKs augments the ERK pathway, which antagonizes the Rho/ROCK pathway that is essential for tube regression. Recent studies demonstrating that ROCK phosphorylates and activates PTEN in leukocytes (35Li Z. Dong X. Wang Z. Liu W. Deng N. Ding Y. Tang L. Hla T. Zeng R. Li L. Wu D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) suggest that the RhoROCK pathway may prevent regression by boosting the output of PI3K, which is a known mechanism for suppressing regression (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, in our experimental setting, the phospho-Akt level was not changed by Rho/ROCK inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S4). These findings indicate that tube regression by Rho/ROCK pathway was independent of the PI3K pathway. A recent paper from Marshall and co-workers (8Mavria G. Vercoulen Y. Yeo M. Paterson H. Karasarides M. Marais R. Bird D. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) provides evidence for the relationship between ERK and Rho/ROCK pathways in tumor vessels. They found that inhibiting the ERK pathway (by expressing dominant negative MEK1) reduced angiogenesis in tumors, and this phenomenon was reversed by treatment with Y27632. The concordance between these in vivo studies and our in vitro findings indicates that the in vitro model can be used to learn how the angiogenesis is regulated in vivo. As compared with PI3K, SFKs were less capable of driving tube formation in both the PDGF- and VEGF-driven models. Thus although SFKs are capable of promoting the formation of tubes, it appears that PI3Ks drive the bulk of this portion of the angiogenic program. Curiously, SFKs-driven tube formation involves activation of Akt, and thereby implicates Akt as the downstream effector for both the SFK- and PI3K-driven pathways. However, because PI3K drives tube formation more potently than SFKs, signaling enzymes other than Akt maybe contributing to the tube response. In contrast to their feeble ability to promote the formation of tubes, SFKs fully prevented regression. Our working hypothesis is that SFKs activate the ERK pathway and thereby antagonize the Rho/ROCK pathway that promotes regression (Fig. 5). Curiously, we found that PLCγ, which promoted regression, had little effect on ERK activation (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Instead, PLCγ induced regression by reducing the level of PtdIns-4,5-P2. Thus it appears that enzymes that promote and suppress regression interface with distinct components of the putative intrinsic regression pathway. In addition to the ERK/Rho mechanism to stabilize tubes, SFKs may also protect from regression by increasing PtdIns-4,5-P2. There are reports that SFKs modulate the amount of PtdIns-4,5-P2 (36Tolloczko B. Turkewitsch P. Choudry S. Bisotto S. Fixman E.D. Martin J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1305-L1313Google Scholar, 37Halstead J.R. van Rheenen J. Snel M.H. Meeuws S. Mohammed S. D'Santos C.S. Heck A.J. Jalink K. Divecha N. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1850-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and elevating the level of PtdIns-4,5-P2 in cells prevents regression (13Im E. Kazlauskas A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2075-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If SFKs protect from regression by elevating the level of PtdIns-4,5-P2, then the chain of events that mediate this SFK-dependent phenomenon may include activation of enzymes that produce PtdIns-4,5-P2 (PtdIns 4-phosphate 5-kinase and PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase) or antagonize those that reduce the level of PtdIns-4,5-P2 (PLC, PI3K, and PtdIns-4,5-P2 5-phosphatases) (38Halstead J.R. Jalink K. Divecha N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 654-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observation that SFKs act through the ERK pathway to prevent regression suggests that activating the ERK pathway would be sufficient to stabilize tubes. However, this does not appear to be the case. The α/β PI3K+ receptor activated ERK at least as well as the α/β SFK+ receptor (Fig. 4B), yet α/β PI3K+ tubes regressed (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, although α/β SFK+ chimera suppressed ROCK activity, α/β PI3K+ promoted it (Fig. 3D). Thus it appears that although ERK activity was required for inhibiting ROCK and regression, it was not sufficient. Alternatively, SFKs and PI3K may activate ERK in different ways, and these differences may constitute the basis for subsequent ROCK inhibition and protection from regression.

Receptor activation results in the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which in turn via the IP3 receptor releases Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores (1Ambudkar I.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 25-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ is followed by the sustained entry of extracellular Ca2+ that results in a prolonged elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (2Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Hewavitharana T. Xu W. Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The sustained entry of Ca2+ is now considered to be mediated through Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane ion channels, which are activated either by the IP3-induced depletion of the internal Ca2+ store or by other receptor-operated processes that are as yet not well understood. The sustained entry of Ca2+ is thought to be caused by two different cation channels that have been designated as store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) and receptor-operated Ca2+ (ROC) channels, respectively (3Dietrich A. Kalwa H. Rost B.R. Gudermann T. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Groschner K. Rosker C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

Recent studies suggest that some, if not all, of these Ca2+ channels involved in the sustained entry of Ca2+ are members of the family of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels.

Some ROC channels are now known to interact with phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) and to be regulated by PLC-γ, forming a ROC signal complex (10Patterson R.L. Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S.

However, there may be additional proteins involved in the ROC complex linking GqPCRs to TRPCs.Using the α1A-AR as a prototype of GqPCRs because of its greater effect on Ca2+ signaling compared with the other α1-AR subtypes (12Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Theroux T.L. Esbenshade T.A. Peavy R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that in addition to the previously known mechanisms, other receptor-accessory proteins might be involved in coupling the α1A-AR to enhanced cellular Ca2+ entry via the ROC channels. To test this hypothesis, we first sought to identify α1A-AR-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid approach, with the receptor as bait in the setting of a brain-derived cDNA library. This screen identified Snapin as a protein that interacts with the α1A-AR; Snapin is better known as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein (15Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine the following: (i) if in a cell or tissue context, Snapin could indeed interact directly with the α1A-AR; (ii) if Snapin-α1A-AR interactions might account for the ability of the receptor to regulate the sustained phase of Ca2+ entry via ROC channels; (iii) if TRPCs might be involved in such an augmented Ca2+ influx; (iv) if in a cell or tissue context, TRPCs could indeed interact directly with Snapin; and (v) if the activation of the α1A-AR could influence the interaction of Snapin with TRPCs. Our results suggest a new ROC signaling mechanism wherein Snapin acts as an accessory GqPCR protein that plays a key role in α1A-AR-regulated Ca2+ influx via TRPC6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening and Colony-lift Filter Assay—Human αlA-AR (17Taniguchi T. Inagaki R. Murata S. Akiba I. Muramatsu I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pGBKT7 and used as bait. A human brain cDNA library (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was screened by a yeast two-hybrid method using the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). Full-length of Snapin, cloned by a yeast two-hybrid screening, was subcloned into pGADT7 (Clontech) for colony-lift assay and in vitro translation.Colony-lift filter assays were also performed using MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3, based on the β-galactosidase activities. More information is described in the supplemental Methods.Antibodies—Custom-ordered affinity-purified rabbit anti-Snapin antibody was prepared by MBL, Nagoya, Japan, raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 117-136 of mouse Snapin. Rabbit anti-αlA-AR antibody (raised against the epitope corresponding to residues 331-466 of the human receptor) and anti-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-TRPC3, -TRPC5, and -TRPC6 antibodies were from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel); and anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma. For immunocytochemistry, mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was from Sigma.Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—In vitro synthesized proteins obtained from a reticulocyte lysate synthesis protocol and solubilized homogenates of rat brain cortex and PC12 cells were used for co-immunoprecipitation studies. HA-tagged Snapin and c-Myc-tagged αlA-AR were translated in vitro with [35S]methionine using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Synthesized proteins were mixed and co-immunoprecipitated either by anti-c-Myc or anti-HA antibody using a MATCHMAKER co-immunoprecipitation kit (Clontech). For co-immunoprecipitation analyses of cell- or tissue-derived proteins, a solubilized membrane pellet fraction was obtained from homogenates of rat cortex or PC12 cells by ultracentrifugation. To examine the interaction of TRPC6 and Snapin promoted by αlA-AR activation, the total cell homogenate was used directly. The membrane fraction or the homogenate was solubilized in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and was incubated with AminoLink Plus gel with immobilized anti-Snapin or anti-α1A-AR antibody (Seize primary immunoprecipitation kit, Pierce). Equal amounts (10 μg) of immunoprecipitated protein from the untreated and agonist/antagonist-treated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the blot densities for TRPC6 and receptor were normalized to the densities observed for these components in the immunoprecipitates from agonist/antagonist-untreated cells. Biotinylation and separation of the cell surface protein were done using a cell surface protein biotinylation and purification kit (Pierce).PC12 Cells and Transfection—Rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells were transfected with αlA-AR tagged with FLAG at its N terminus and/or Snapin subcloned into each multiple cloning site of pIRES vector (Clontech), by electroporation using Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany). The αlA-AR density of stably transfected PC12 cell lines was determined by a saturation binding assay (18Suzuki F. Taniguchi T. Nakamura S. Akagi Y. Kubota C. Satoh M. Muramatsu I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cell lines of αlA-AR-, Snapin-αlA-AR-, Snapin-, and mock-PC12 were selected by G-418 (0.5 mg/ml).Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—PC12 cells stably transfected with FLAG-αlA-AR and Snapin were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, and labeled with mouse anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-Snapin antibodies as primary antibodies. Cells were then incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. They were visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems).To estimate the abundance of Snapin distributed at the plasma membrane or in the intracellular region, we developed a morphometric analysis approach employing confocal images of 8 bit depth in resolution that were taken under the identical conditions (including the laser power, gain and offset of the photomultiplier detector, and the duration and amount of antibodies applied). These images were analyzed by our custommade software, as reported previously (19Kida H. Miyoshi T. Manabe K. Takahashi N. Konno T. Ueda S. Chiba T. Shimizu T. Okada Y. Morishima S. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). More than 20 lines across a cell trajectory in a confocal image were randomly drawn, and pixel intensity units (range in our system, 0-255 arbitrary pixel units) versus the distance from the origin of the line was plotted (see Fig. 3C). The plasma membrane location was identified as the region where the intensity of two consecutive pixels was higher by two standard deviations from the average intensity measured in the same direction just prior to the cell margin. The density of Snapin at the plasma membrane was then estimated as the average pixel intensity measured over a 1-μm distance at each edge of each cell. Then the density of Snapin distributed in the intracellular area was calculated by measuring the average pixel intensity over the mid-point range in between the two 1-μm cell edge regions, as depicted in Fig. 3, C and D.Measurement of [Ca2+]i and Inositol Phosphate Accumulation Assay—PC12 cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) for 45 min to 1 h, washed, and then resuspended in Ca2+(+) assay buffer, containing (in mm) NaCl 136.9, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1.0, CaCl2 1.5, glucose 10, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.4 by NaOH) with 3% fetal bovine serum. [Ca2+]i was measured by fura-2 ratiofluorometry using a CAF-110 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (14Suzuki F. Taniguchi T. Takauji R. Murata S. Muramatsu I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During the measurements, cells were continuously stirred and kept suspended at 37 °C. To assess the intracellular Ca2+ response of the cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, buffers were prepared without the addition of Ca2+ either in the absence (nominally, Ca2+-free buffer) or presence of 2 mm EGTA [Ca2+(-) buffer]. Accumulation of inositol phosphates was assayed as reported previously (20Israilova M. Tanaka T. Suzuki F. Morishima S. Muramatsu I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).RNAi of Snapin—To knock down Snapin, three hairpin siRNAs for Snapin were designed and subcloned into pSilencer 4.1-CMV siRNA expression vector (Ambion, Austin, TX). Each αlA-PC12 cell clone and Snapin-αlA-PC12 cell clone was transfected with either of the three Snapin siRNA vectors or a vector containing missense siRNA and selected using 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin. One of the knocked down cell lines was used for further study. The sequence of the siRNA for Snapin, scrambled siRNA, and missense siRNA was 5′-TGCTGGATTCGGGAATTTA-3′, 5′-AATGGCTTGGATTGGATTC-3′, and 5′-GACGAGTTGACTGCGATTG-3′, respectively.Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical differences of data were evaluated by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc multiple comparison tests, and considered to be significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSIdentification of Snapin as an αlA-AR-interacting Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library with human αlA-AR (GenBank™ accession number U03866) as a bait yielded a number of positive clones that encoded full-length human Snapin (GenBank™ accession number NM012437). Snapin was first identified on synaptic vesicle membranes and has been considered to be involved in the exocytotic process (15Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat.

The prepared anti-Snapin antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”) detected a band of ∼15 kDa in every lane loaded with membrane preparations obtained from Snapin- or mock-transfected PC12 cells and rat cortex (Fig. 1B), and the intensity of the band was higher in the lane loaded with membrane of Snapin-transfected cells than that of mock-transfected cells, showing the reliable specificity of the antibody. The interaction between Snapin and the αlA-AR was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the following: (i) in vitro synthesized Snapin and αlA-AR (Fig. 1A); (ii) a stably transfected PC12 cell line expressing both Snapin and the αlA-AR (designated as Snapin-αlA-PC12) (Fig. 7E); or (iii) solubilized membrane extracts from rat brain cortex where both Snapin and αlA-AR are known to be expressed abundantly (Fig. 1C) (15Ilardi J.M.

A, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled c-Myc-αlA-AR (lanes 2 and 5) and HA-Snapin (lanes 1 and 6) and the mixture of both proteins (lanes 3 and 4) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-c-Myc antibody (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or anti-HA antibody (lanes 2, 4, and 6), respectively. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to PAGE. HA-Snapin (15 kDa) was detected in lanes 3, 4, and 6, and c-Myc-αlA-AR (50 kDa) in lanes 3-5. B, to confirm the specificity of anti-Snapin antibody, an equal amount (10 μg) of solubilized membrane preparations obtained from Snapin- (left lane) or mock-transfected PC12 cells (middle lane) and rat cortex (right lane) was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot (WB) analysis. A band of ∼15 kDa was detected in every lane, and the intensity of the band was higher in the lane loaded with membrane of Snapin-transfected cells than that of mock-transfected cells. C, a solubilized membrane preparation from rat cortex was used directly for Western blot analysis (lane 4) or immunoprecipitated with anti-Snapin antibody (lane 1), anti-αlA-AR antibody (lane 2), or rabbit pan-IgG (lane 3) as a negative control. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using the same anti-receptor and anti-Snapin antisera. Snapin (15 kDa) and αlA-AR (50 kDa) were co-immunoprecipitated with the counterpart, respectively. The positions of the molecular size markers (kDa) are shown on the left in B and C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Involvement of TRPC6 in cellular signaling evoked byαlA-AR activation. A, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled c-Myc-TRPC6 (lanes 2 and 5) and HA-Snapin (lanes 1 and 6), and the mixture of both proteins (lanes 3 and 4) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-c-Myc antibody (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or anti-HA antibody (lanes 2, 4, and 6), respectively. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to PAGE. HA-Snapin (15 kDa) was detected in lanes 3, 4, and 6 and c-Myc-TRPC6 (120 kDa) in lanes 3-5. The molecular masses estimated for Snapin (15 kDa) and TRPC6 (120 kDa) are also shown. B, anti-TRPC6 antibody detected a band of ∼120 kDa in both lanes loaded with equal amounts (20 μg) of solubilized membrane obtained from PC12 cells and rat cortex. The positions of the molecular size markers (kDa) are shown. C, anti-TRPC6 channel antibody was pre-absorbed with an antigen peptide provided with the antibody (Alomone Labs). Membrane protein (10 μg) of PC12 cells was subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis using either pre-absorbed or untreated antibody. The pre-absorbed antibody could not detect a band of TRPC6 (120 kDa) (left lane), whereas the normal untreated antibody could (right lane), and in either lane β-actin could be similarly detected on the same membrane by anti-β-actin antibody. D, solubilized rat brain cortex membrane fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-Snapin antibody. TRPC6 (120 kDa) was strongly enriched in the Snapin co-immunoprecipitate (right), as compared with the crude membrane preparation (left). Positions of the molecular weight markers (kDa) are also shown. E, interaction between Snapin and TRPC6 or αlA-AR was promoted by receptor activation. The Snapin-αlA-PC12 cells were stimulated by methoxamine (100 μm) for 10 min with or without 100 nm prazosin, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Snapin antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The amounts of TRPC6 and αlA-AR co-immunoprecipitating with Snapin were significantly increased by αlA-AR activation and that association was reversed by the receptor antagonist prazosin. F, experiments in E were repeated (n = 3) and analyzed by an image densitometer. The bars show the relative amounts of TRPC6 (left graph) and αlA-AR (right graph) immunoprecipitated with anti-Snapin-antibody, normalized for the abundance of TRPC6 and αlA-AR harvested from agonist/antagonist untreated cells. Both co-immunoprecipitated TRPC6 and αlA-AR were significantly increased upon activation of the receptor by methoxamine (*, at p < 0.05 versus nonactivated cells). Treatment with prazosin significantly reduced the amount of co-immunoprecipitated TRPC6 with or even without methoxamine-induced receptor activation (#, at p < 0.05). G, increase in cell surface TRPC6 in the Snapin-αlA-PC12 cells upon αlA-AR activation. Cells were stimulated or not with methoxamine (100 μm) for 10 min. Cell surface proteins on plasma membrane were then biotinylated for 30 min; cells were lysed, and surface proteins were harvested using an avidin-conjugated affinity column. Total and surface TRPC6 with or without treatment by methoxamine were compared by Western blot analyses. As a control, HSP90, a cytoplasmic protein, was also examined by Western blot analyses, to establish by its absence of biotinylation (not shown) that only surface proteins were successfully biotinylated. H, three experiments as shown in G were repeated, and the bands were analyzed by an image densitometer. The bars in the graph show the ratio of surface TRPC6 to total TRPC6 in untreated and methoxamine-treated Snapin-αlA-PC12 cells (*, significant at p < 0.05 versus untreated cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)α1A-AR via Its C-terminal Sequence Interacts with Snapin—We searched for the domain of αlA-AR responsible for the interaction with Snapin by a colony-lift filter assay. Four C terminus deletion mutants (αlA-AR-(1-335), αlA-AR-(1-347), αlA-AR-(1-375), and αlA-AR-(1-399)) and a full-length wild type (WT) of αlA-AR (in the pGBKT7 vector, as shown in Fig. 2) were co-transformed into a yeast strain with Snapin in the pGADT7 vector, and the β-galactosidase activity in each clone was examined. Although the mutant αlA-AR-(1-399) as well as the WT αlA-AR demonstrated an interaction with Snapin, the other three mutants did not (Fig. 2). These results indicated that the C-terminal 24 amino acids (376-399) were essential for the direct Snapin-receptor interaction.FIGURE 2Colony-lift filter assay of WT and four C-terminal truncated mutants of αlA-AR. Either the WT receptor or each of the αlA-AR mutants shown in the left panel subcloned into pGBKT7 containing GAL4 DNA binding domain was transformed in yeast together with Snapin subcloned in pGADT7 containing GAL4 activation domain. β-Galactosidase (β-GAL) activity in each clone was examined as shown in the right panel. Yeast colonies transformed with WT and -399 constructs showed positive β-galactosidase activity, while others were negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dynamic Interaction of Snapin and αlA-AR upon Activation of the Receptor—To study the dynamic or functional interaction of Snapin and the αlA-AR further, we used a PC12 cell line, in which we had confirmed the expression of endogenous Snapin by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A and Fig. 1B) but not the αlA-AR (absence of radioligand binding and ligand-mediated Ca2+ signaling as shown Fig. 4A). We examined the intracellular localization of these proteins by immunocytochemistry using PC12 cells with or without the transfection of αlA-AR. In mock-transfected PC12 cells, the anti-Snapin antibody that recognized Snapin reliably on Western blots (Fig. 6A) visualized endogenous Snapin both in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, left upper panel). To estimate quantitatively the amount of Snapin distributed at plasma membrane and in the intracellular area, confocal images were subjected to morphometric analysis as outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” and the abundance of Snapin was calculated from the average pixel intensity in regions corresponding either to the 1-μm plasma membrane region or over the mid-range of the intracellular domain between the two cell membrane margins (Fig. 3C). As shown by the morphometric analysis data summarized in Fig. 3D, transfection of the αlA-AR into the PC12 cells resulted in a slight increase in the abundance of Snapin at the plasma membrane as shown qualitatively in Fig. 3A (see arrowheads, lower left panel) and by the quantitative morphometric analysis in Fig. 3D (an increase to 46 ± 5.1 pixels in αlA-AR transfected cells compared with 31 ± 4.7 in untransfected cells, respectively; compare Mock versus receptor-transfected cells Before agonist treatment in Fig. 3D). Upon activating the αlA-AR with 100 μm methoxamine (Fig. 3B), the abundance of Snapin in the 1-μm plasma membrane region significantly increased from 46 ± 5.1 to 59 ± 5.4 and 79 ± 6.3 pixel intensity units at 3 and 5 min after agonist activation, respectively (Fig. 3D, black bars on right). As reported previously, the expressed receptor was also mainly localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, right lower panel) (23Chalothorn D. McCune D.F. Edelmann S.E. Garcia-Cazarin M.L. Tsujimoto G. Piascik M.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the αlA-AR-transfected cells, the recruitment of Snapin to the plasma membrane did not appreciably deplete the intracellular abundance of Snapin (Fig. 3D, compare white versus black bars). The activation-induced recruitment of Snapin to co-localize with the receptor suggested not only that αlA-AR and Snapin are functionally coupled but that they might be able to interact directly at the molecular level.FIGURE 6RNAi for Snapin. A, expression level of Snapin was analyzed by Western blotting (WB) in the αlA-PC12 cell clone (lanes 1 and 2) and in the Snapin-αlA-PC12 clone (lanes 3 and 4) transfected with the missense siRNA or pSilencer siRNA expression vector for Snapin and in the Snapin-PC12 cells (lane 5). Expression of β-actin was shown together to confirm the equal protein loading. B, four experiments as shown in A were repeated, and the bands were analyzed by an image densitometer. The bars in the graph show relative expression level of Snapin in each cell clone (n = 4; #, statistically significant at p < 0.05). C-F, tracings show the [Ca2+]i increase induced by methoxamine (100μm, C-E) or UTP (10μm, F) in the αlA-AR (C and E) and in the Snapin-αlA-AR PC12 cells (D and F) that were transfected with the siRNA for Snapin (gray) or the missense siRNA (black). G, bars show the net increase of [Ca2+]i in each cell clone 3 min after αlA-AR stimulation (n = 4-12; #, statistically significant at p < 0.05). E, Ca2+ influx caused by αlA-AR activation in the αlA-PC12 cells (black) was suppressed in the cells transfected with siRNA for Snapin (gray). Each cell clone was first stimulated by methoxamine in Ca2+-free buffer, and at about 3 min the buffer was supplemented with added Ca2+ to a final concentration of 1.5 mm. C, D, and F, the augmented [Ca2+]i response induced by αlA-AR activation was abolished in Snapin knocked down cells (C and D), while that caused by P2Y-R activation remained unchanged (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGUR"
https://openalex.org/W2084673007,"The NRG4 gene is a member of a family of four genes that encode a class of epidermal growth factors. This gene has been reported to express a protein designated here as NRG4A1. We describe here a novel splice variant of the NRG4 gene, NRG4A2, which encodes a C-terminal region containing a predicted type I PDZ-binding peptide. Both NRG4A1 and NRG4A2 were shown to be expressed on the cell surface, as expected by the presence of a predicted transmembrane sequence, and were modified at a single N-linked glycosylation site in the extracellular domain. Significant stabilization of expression of both proteins was seen in the presence of the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 suggesting that they are normally degraded by this system. N-terminal cleavage was inhibited in both isotypes by the broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, galardin (GM 6001). A glycosylated, secreted form of NRG4A1 was detected in the cell medium which showed biological activity in two assays, phosphorylation of the HER4 receptor and stimulation of neurite formation in PC-12 cells stably expressing HER4. Transfection and expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins and immunofluorescent staining with specific anti-peptide antibodies showed that NRG4A1 is localized to membrane ruffles, while NRG4A2 has a more punctate membrane distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2026383028,"A number of cancers are characterized by elevated expression of CK2 (formerly casein kinase II), which has been implicated as a key component in cell proliferation and transformation. Two lines of evidence, (a) deregulated expression of CK2 and (b) CK2β ubiquitination and degradation of these in a proteasome-dependent manner prompted further investigation of the regulation of CK2β protein stability. We demonstrate that mutating six surface-exposed lysine residues to arginine (6KR) to interfere with ubiquitin attachment can stabilize CK2β. Examination of 6KR expression in cells revealed increased stability over time and increased its steady-state expression level compared with CK2β. In cells, 6KR was no longer sensitive to proteasome inhibition but maintained an elevated expression level. In our studies, 6KR functioned as a normal CK2 regulatory subunit, because it participated in CK2β dimerization, associated with catalytic subunits, was autophosphorylated, and formed active, stable CK2 tetramers. The physiological role of CK2β stabilization was investigated in cell proliferation assays, which showed a significant decrease in proliferation in cells expressing 6KR compared with CK2β.

Given the diverse, yet essential, roles of CK2 within the cell, it is important to understand the mechanisms regulating CK2, which are equally as diverse and critical. Furthermore, perturbations in expression or activity of CK2 are associated with human disease. Abnormally high levels of CK2 have been observed in cancers of the breast, prostate, lung, head and neck, and kidney (8Daya-Makin M. Sanghera J.S. Mogentale T. Lipp M. Parchomchuk J. Hogg J.

Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although neither phosphorylation event is completely understood, there are indications that autophosphorylation of CK2β enhances its stability (27Zhang C. Vilk G. Canton D.A. Litchfield D.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3754-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Detailed investigation of CK2β protein stability and turnover revealed that CK2β exhibits a biphasic degradation pattern (32Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). More specifically, CK2β is normally expressed at a higher level than the catalytic subunits of CK2, allowing some CK2β to be incorporated into CK2 tetramers and stabilized, whereas the excess CK2β is rapidly degraded with a half-life of less than 1 h (32Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observed ubiquitination of CK2β and the accumulation of CK2β protein upon proteasome inhibition suggested that polyubiquitination of CK2β targets it for degradation (27Zhang C. Vilk G. Canton D.A. Litchfield D.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3754-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the stability of CK2β could be altered by mutations that disrupt its ubiquitination. Alterations in CK2β protein levels may influence the mechanisms that govern the affect of CK2 on cell proliferation, which may be important in understanding the onset of cancer. In this report we successfully generated a form of CK2β, designated 6KR, that exhibits altered stability in cells. Further studies characterize the 6KR protein and examine its effect on cell proliferation. Plasmid Constructs—The previously described (24Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5003-5010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) HA-CK2β construct was inserted into the HindIII/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to individually mutate the nine lysine residues of CK2β (amino acids 33, 100, 134, 139, 147, 177, 191, 208, and 212) to arginine, creating a set of HA-tagged single lysine mutants of CK2β. The following primers were used: 5′-CCAGGACAGATTTAATCTTAC-3′ (K33R-sense), 5′-AAGATTAAATCTGTCCTGGATG-3′ (K33R-antisense), 5′-ATGTTGGAAAGGTACCAG-3′ (K100R-sense), 5′-CTGGTACCTTTCCAACATCTG-3′ (K100R-antisense), 5′-CCATGGTGAGGCTCTACTG-3′ (K134R-sense), 5′-GCAGTAGAGCCTCACCATGG-3′ (K134R-antisense), 5′-ACTGCCCCAGGTGCATGG-3′ (K139R-sense), 5′-TCCATGCACCTGGGGCAG-3′ (K139R-antisense), 5′-CACACCCAGGTCATCAAG-3′ (K147R-sense), 5′-TCTTGATGACCTGGGTGTG-3′ (K147R-antisense), 5′-ACCGGCCCAGGAGACCTG-3′ (K177R-sense), 5′-GCAGGTCTCCTGGGCCGG-3′ (K177R-antisense), 5′-CGGTTTCAGGATCCATCCG-3′ (K191R-sense), 5′-GGATGGATCCTGAAACCG-3′ (K191-antisense), 5′-GCAACTTCAGGAGCCCAG-3′ (K208R-sense), 5′-GACTGGGCTCCTGAAGTTG-3′ (K208R-antisense), 5′-CCCAGTCAGGACGATTCG-3′ (K212R-sense), and 5′-CGAATCGTCCTGACTGGG-3′ (K212R-antisense). Double and multiple lysine to arginine mutations were introduced into HA-CK2β sequentially, using the appropriate primers to generate HA-K177R/K139R and HA-K177R/K191R, HA-5KR, HA-6KR, HA-7KR, HA-8KR, and HA-9KR (Fig. 1C). Plasmids encoding N-terminal His-tagged CK2β or 6KR were constructed by inserting CK2β or 6KR DNA into the NotI/ApaI sites located 3′ to the 6×-histidine tag in pcDNA3.1(+) (His-CK2β and His-6KR, respectively). Myc-6KR was constructed by inserting Myc-tagged 6KR DNA into the MluI and NheI sites of the pRc/CMV vector. Full-length Myc-CK2β was described previously (33Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). pMT107, a plasmid encoding His-tagged ubiquitin was obtained from D. Bohmann. Full-length CK2α and CK2α′ were cloned into pGEX-3X and pEGFP-C2 using BamHI, as described previously (34Bosc D.G. Graham K.C. Saulnier R.B. Zhang C. Prober D. Gietz R.D. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14295-14306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pBABEpuro encoding a puromycin N-acetyltransferase was obtained from G. Evan. Bidirectional plasmids encoding both CK2α-HA and Myc-CK2β or Myc-6KR were constructed by inserting CK2α-HA into the PstI sites and inserting Myc-CK2β or Myc-6KR into the MluI/NheI sites of the tetracycline-regulated vector pBI (Clontech). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies raised against CK2β, CK2α, and CK2α′ have been previously described (28Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against the HA epitope (12CA5) and the biotinylated anti-HA (3F10) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal biotinylated anti-Myc (9E10) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies directed against green fluorescent protein (GFP) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Anti-β-tubulin antibodies were a generous gift from Lina Dagnino (Dept. of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario). Goat-anti-rabbit and Goat-anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Bio-Rad. Monoclonal anti-biotin secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS7 (green monkey kidney) and HeLa (human cervical cancer) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method described previously (33Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 16-18 h after transfection, cells were washed and supplied with fresh medium. 24-48 h later cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Lysates were prepared and used directly or stored at -80 °C. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein were separated by SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblots were performed using the following primary antibody dilutions: anti-CK2β (1:2000), anti-CK2α (1:1000), biotinylated anti-HA(3F10) (1:500), anti-GFP (1:2000), and anti-β-tubulin (1:100). Degradation Assays and Proteasome Inhibition Assays—Cells were co-transfected with HA-CK2β or HA-6KR and EGFP-C2 (transfection efficiency marker) as described above. After the DNA precipitate was washed from the cells, each plate of cells was used to seed the appropriate number of new plates so that protein levels could be compared under equivalent transfection efficiencies and allowed to recover for 24 h. For degradation assays, 10-cm plates of cells were treated with 95% ethanol (carrier) or with 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, to inhibit protein synthesis. At various time intervals ranging from 0 to 3 h, cells were harvested and cell lysates prepared. For proteasome inhibition assays, cells were treated with Me2SO (carrier) or with final concentrations of N-carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132), a proteasome inhibitor, ranging from 0.1 μg/ml (1 μm) to 10 μg/ml (20 μm). After 5 h, cells were harvested and cell lysates were prepared. Total protein concentrations of each lysate were determined, and 30 μg of total protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations and Binding Assays—Immunoprecipitations and binding assays were performed by transiently transfecting cells as indicated and preparing cell lysates as described above. Immunoprecipitations were preformed on equivalent amounts of total protein using protein-A-Sepharose and anti-HA(12CA5), anti-CK2β, anti-CK2α, or anti-CK2α′ antibodies as indicated and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. After washing, beads were used for CK2 kinase assays or proteins were eluted from the beads. Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot as indicated. For binding assays cell lysates with equivalent amounts of total protein were incubated with 100 μl of nickel-Sepharose bead slurry (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation to specifically isolate histidine-tagged CK2β proteins. Nickel-Sepharose beads were collected, washed twice with 6 m guanidine-HCl, 12 mm imidazole, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, twice with 8 m urea, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, and twice with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 7 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted by incubating the beads with 35 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot as indicated. For ubiquitination experiments, lysates were prepared as described above in urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaPO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole), and ubiquitinated complexes were isolated by incubating 1500 μg of total protein with 40 μl of Talon resin (BD Biosciences), equilibrated in urea buffer, for 2 h at 4 °C. The Talon resin was washed thoroughly with urea buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling with 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot as indicated. Protein Purification—Bacterially expressed, catalytically active GST-CK2α′ protein was produced using standard GST fusion protein purification methods. Briefly, BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli-expressing GST-CK2α or GST-CK2α′ cultures were grown, and protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial lysates were prepared and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C with rotation for at least 1 h. Unbound proteins were removed by thorough washing, and GST-CK2α and GST-CK2α′ proteins were eluted with 10 mm or 30 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions containing the highest amounts of GST-CK2α or GST-CK2α′ protein (as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis) were combined, dialyzed into CK2 dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol), aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. CK2 Kinase Assays—Immunocomplexes were prepared as described above. CK2 kinase assays were performed using enzyme immobilized on protein-A-Sepharose beads in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ATP (specific activity 500-1000 cpm/pmol) in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 2 mm α-casein to each sample. Control reactions contained 2 mm α-casein and were initiated by adding 2 μg of GST-CK2α′. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to phosphor screens overnight and scanned. Incorporation of 32P into α-casein was analyzed, which is directly proportional to the catalytic activity exhibited by the immunoprecipitated CK2 complexes. Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle analysis, HeLa cells were transfected as described above with HA-CK2β or HA-6KR and EGFP-C2. At the indicated times (ranging from 1 to 5 days) cells were collected using PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, resuspended in PBS, filtered using a 40-μm nylon filter, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS and permeabilized by dropwise addition into cold 70% ethanol and stored at -20 °C until FACS analysis. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark and filtered again. 50,000 cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur cytometer at a flow rate of less than 200 cells/s. Cell cycle profiles were generated using CellQuest data acquisition and FlowJo cytometry analysis software. Cell Proliferation Assays—HeLa cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/6-cm plate. Cells were co-transfected, using ExGen500 (MBI Fermentas), with 4.5 μg of p27, HA-CK2β, HA-6KR, or pcDNA3.1(+) and 0.5 μg of pBABEpuro, a puromycin resistance plasmid. Cells transfected only with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1(+) were used as a negative control. Media was changed 6 h after transfection and 3 h later cells were selected for 16 h with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Five days after transfection, plates were washed with PBS and stained in 0.2% (w/v) methylene blue in methanol at room temperature for 20 min followed by washing with ddH2O. Images of each plate were converted to grayscale using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The number of gray pixels (defined as pixels whose levels range from 50 to 200) out of the total number of pixels per image was used to determine colony density. 35S Labeling—HeLa cells were transiently transfected as described with HA-CK2β, HA-6KR, pBI(CK2α-HA/Myc-CK2β), pBI(CK2α-HA/Myc-6KR), or left untransfected. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without tetracycline to induce protein expression from the bidirectional constructs. To label, cells were washed four times with PBS, once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine. Cells were labeled with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine per plate of cells for 18 h at 37 °C. Lysates were prepared in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer, and 150 μg of total protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above except that anti-HA (12CA5) was coupled to the protein-A-Sepharose beads using standard protocols. To visualize labeled proteins, eluted samples were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, fixed in 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, soaked in Enhance solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), soaked in cold ddH2O, dried and exposed to autoradiography film for 20 h or more. Analysis of Potential Ubiquitination Sites in CK2β—Previous studies demonstrated that CK2β is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (27Zhang C. Vilk G. Canton D.A. Litchfield D.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3754-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To further define the mechanisms controlling CK2 regulation, we were interested in determining whether CK2β protein stability could be altered by systematically removing potential ubiquitination sites. Alignment of the primary amino acid sequence of CK2β from various organisms revealed that each of the nine lysine residues present in human CK2β are highly conserved among species (Fig. 1A). Examination of the crystal structure of CK2β identified six lysines (including 33, 139, 177, 191, 208, and 212) that appear to be surface-exposed and prime targets for ubiquitination (Fig. 1B). Of these six lysines, 33 and 177 protruded further from the surface of CK2β than 139 and 191. Lysines 208 and 212, not present in the crystal structure, are likely surface-exposed because they are located on the extreme C-terminal tail. The remaining three lysines, 100, 134, and 147, are buried within the structure and are likely important for maintaining CK2β protein structure. Based on this analysis, the six surface-exposed lysines in CK2β were individually mutated to arginine to remove potential ubiquitin attachment sites while maintaining overall protein charge. Fig. 1C illustrates the location of each lysine in CK2β with respect to its functional domains. It is important to note that the HA tag used to facilitate detection of CK2β did not contain any additional lysine residues. Another important consideration is the low site specificity characteristic of the ubiquitination process (37Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that removal of multiple surface-accessible lysines and perhaps even all of the lysines may be required to abrogate ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CK2β. To facilitate examination of this possibility a number of other multiple lysine mutants lacking 5, 6, 7, 8, or all 9 lysine residues were created (Fig. 1C). Comparison of CK2β Single Lysine Mutant Expression and Degradation—To begin examining the importance of each lysine residue in the regulation of CK2β protein levels, the steady-state expression levels of the single lysine mutants were compared. As shown in Fig. 2A, each mutant was expressed at comparable levels to wild-type CK2β, with the exception of HA-K212R, in COS7 cells. No protein was detected in mock transfected (control) or pcDNA3.1(+) (vector) transfected cells. To ensure equal loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-tubulin as shown in the lower panel (Fig. 2A). Similarly, mutation of single surface-exposed lysines did not significantly alter the sensitivity of CK2β to degradation by the proteasome, as indicated by the accumulation of each mutant upon treatment with MG132 (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results suggest that substitution of a single lysine residue is insufficient to alter CK2β stability by preventing ubiquitin attachment. Comparison of CK2β Multiple Lysine Mutant Expression and Degradation—Because substitution of single lysines was ineffective in stabilizing CK2β, we investigated the effects of multiple lysine mutations in CK2β on steady-state expression levels. Each of the double lysine mutants, HA-K177R/K139R and HA-K177R/K191R, as well as HA-5KR, HA-6KR, and HA-7KR, exhibited increased steady-state expression compared with HA-CK2β (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, HA-5KR, HA-7KR, and particularly HA-6KR showed an increase in the level of autophosphorylated protein, as evidenced by a band with diminished electrophoretic mobility, compared with HA-CK2β and even the double lysine mutants. HA-8KR and HA-9KR, exhibited decreased protein expression, possibly due to improper protein folding and subsequent rapid degradation of these mutants (Fig. 3A). Two or more lysine to arginine mutations resulted in little to no protein accumulation upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 3B) indicating that mutation of as few as two lysine residues could compromise the ability of CK2β to be degraded. Particularly striking was the complete abrogation of proteasome-dependent degradation of CK2β, observed with mutation of 5, 6, or 7 lysine residues. The HA-6KR mutant was selected for further investigation because it demonstrated the highest increase in expression compared with HA-CK2β, and it showed the greatest accumulation of autophosphorylated protein. Furthermore, HA-6KR was representative of a group of stabilized forms of CK2β (HA-5KR, HA-6KR, and HA-7KR), because modification of its six surface-exposed lysines removed the most potential ubiquitination sites but would have the least impact on overall CK2β structure. Examination of the Effect of Proteasome Inhibition on 6KR—Because HA-6KR protein was stabilized in cells, we hypothesized that it may no longer be ubiquitinated and therefore no longer sensitive to proteasome inhibition. To test this hypothesis, COS7 cells transfected with HA-CK2β or HA-6KR were treated with increasing concentrations of MG132. No exogenously expressed HA-CK2β or HA-6KR protein could be detected in mock transfected (control) or pcDNA3.1(+) (vector) transfected cells. Whereas HA-CK2β protein accumulated with increasing concentrations of MG132, HA-6KR protein did not, confirming that HA-6KR was not affected by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, increased levels of autophosphorylated HA-6KR compared with HA-CK2β suggested that HA-6KR is readily incorporated into CK2 tetramers and supramolecular complexes where it is subsequently autophosphorylated. This observation could also indicate that HA-6KR is a less desirable protein phos"
https://openalex.org/W2152934236,"Background The p24 family is thought to be somehow involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi protein transport. A subset of the p24 proteins (p24α3, -β1, -γ3 and -δ2) is upregulated when Xenopus laevis intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells are physiologically activated to produce vast amounts of their major secretory cargo, the prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Methodology/Principal Findings Here we find that transgene expression of p24α3 or p24δ2 specifically in the Xenopus melanotrope cells in both cases causes an effective displacement of the endogenous p24 proteins, resulting in severely distorted p24 systems and disparate melanotrope cell phenotypes. Transgene expression of p24α3 greatly reduces POMC transport and leads to accumulation of the prohormone in large, ER-localized electron-dense structures, whereas p24δ2-transgenesis does not influence the overall ultrastructure of the cells nor POMC transport and cleavage, but affects the Golgi-based processes of POMC glycomaturation and sulfation. Conclusions/Significance Transgenic expression of two distinct p24 family members has disparate effects on secretory pathway functioning, illustrating the specificity and non-redundancy of our transgenic approach. We conclude that members of the p24 family furnish subcompartments of the secretory pathway with specific sets of machinery cargo to provide the proper microenvironments for efficient and correct secretory protein transport and processing."
https://openalex.org/W2053448620,"The family of SLPs (Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte adaptor proteins) are cytoplasmic signal effectors of lymphocyte antigen receptors. A main function of SLP is to orchestrate the assembly of Ca2+-mobilizing enzymes at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. For this purpose, SLP-76 in T cells utilizes the transmembrane adaptor LAT, but the mechanism of SLP-65 membrane anchoring in B cells remains an enigma. We now employed two genetic reconstitution systems to unravel structural requirements of SLP-65 for the initiation of Ca2+ mobilization and subsequent activation of gene transcription. First, mutational analysis of SLP-65 in DT40 B cells revealed that its C-terminal Src homology 2 domain controls efficient tyrosine phosphorylation by the kinase Syk, plasma membrane recruitment, as well as downstream signaling to NFAT activation. Second, we dissected these processes by expressing SLP-65 in SLP-76-deficient T cells and found that a kinase-independent adaptor function of Syk is required to link phosphorylated SLP-65 to Ca2+ mobilization. These approaches unmask a mechanistic complexity of SLP-65 activation and coupling to signaling cascades in that Syk is upstream as well as downstream of SLP-65. Moreover, membrane anchoring of the SLP-65-assembled Ca2+ initiation complex, which appears to be fundamentally different from that of closely related SLP-76, does not necessarily involve a B cell-specific component.

Most prominently, their scaffolding functions are mandatory for the correct subcellular localization and activation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) isoforms to induce mobilization of the second messenger Ca2+. Surprisingly and despite the common protein architecture, the molecular mechanisms through which SLP-65 and SLP-76 assemble and target the Ca2+ initiation complexes in B and T cells, respectively, appear to be different (5Koretzky G.A. Abtahian F. Silverman M.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Src homology B cell antigen receptor Bruton's tyrosine kinase phospholipase C T cell antigen receptor immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif hemagglutinin enhanced green fluorescent protein. Downstream of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), phosphorylated SLP-65 provides docking sites for the SH2 domains of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and PLC-γ2 (2Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6461-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Simultaneous recruitment of both enzymes must occur in cis, i.e. to a given SLP-65 molecule because only tri-molecular complex formation enables Btk to phosphorylate and thereby activate its target PLC-γ2 (9Chiu C.W. Dalton M. Ishiai M. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6461-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To provide PLC-γ2 with access to its lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, the assembled Ca2+ initiation complex needs to be tethered at the plasma membrane. As shown more recently, membrane anchoring requires an N-terminal leucine zipper motif in SLP-65, but the exact mechanism remains elusive (10Kohler F. Storch B. Kulathu Y. Herzog S. Kuppig S. Reth M. Jumaa H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the N terminus of SLP-76 does not contain such a leucine zipper. In fact, nucleation of the Ca2+ initiation complex upon engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) involves not only the intracellular adaptor SLP-76 but also (the transmembraneous linker of activated T cells) LAT (5Koretzky G.A. Abtahian F. Silverman M.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT binds PLC-γ1 directly and associates simultaneously with a SLP-76/Itk complex through the Grb2 family member Gads. Itk is the T cell paralogue of Btk. LAT- and Gads-related molecules in B cells are NTAL (13Brdicka T. Imrich M. Angelisova P. Brdickova N. Horvath O. Spicka J. Hilgert I. Luskova P. Draber P. Novak P. Engels N. Wienands J. Simeoni L.

We recently showed that the NTAL/Grb2 module is indeed critically involved in BCR-triggered Ca2+ elevation but through a SLP-65-independent mechanism (15Stork B. Engelke M. Frey J. Horejsi V.

One mode of stimulation-dependent membrane recruitment of SLP-65 involves its SH2 domain, which directly binds the phosphorylated BCR signaling subunit Ig-α (17Engels N. Wollscheid B. Wienands J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2126-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The corresponding phosphotyrosine residue in Ig-α is located outside of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (17Engels N. Wollscheid B. Wienands J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2126-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Kabak S. Skaggs B.J. Gold M.R. Affolter M. West K.L. Foster M.S. Siemasko K. Chan A.C. Aebersold R. Clark M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The non-ITAM phospho-acceptor site of Ig-α is conserved within and across species but absent in other ITAM-containing immunoreceptor signaling subunits (19Sayegh C.E. Demaries S.L. Pike K.A. Friedman J.E. Ratcliffe M.J. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 187-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an important and B cell-specific signaling function. Indeed, B cells expressing an Ig-α mutant lacking the SLP-65-binding site mount impaired responses to T cell-independent antigens in vivo (20Patterson H.C. Kraus M. Kim Y.M. Ploegh H. Rajewsky K. Immunity. 2006; 25: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hence, SH2-mediated SLP-65 recruitment to the BCR appears to amplify signaling rather than to provide indispensable membrane linkage for the SLP-65-assembled Ca2+ initiation complex. A second known ligand for the SLP-65 SH2 domain and also for that of SLP-76 is the serine/threonine kinase HPK1 (21Sauer K. Liou J. Singh S.B. Yablonski D. Weiss A. Perlmutter R.M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the SH2 domain of SLP-76 functions in another completely different pathway. It regulates TCR-induced integrin activation and T cell adhesion by binding tyrosine-phosphorylated ADAP, which couples to Rac1 activation (23Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M.

Hence, although similar in many aspects, the structural entities of SLP-65 and SLP-76 execute cell type-specific functions by binding distinct interaction partners. We have explored this topic further and show herein that the SH2 domain of SLP-65 controls the subcellular localization of the adaptor, which is critical for BCR-proximal and -distal activation signals in a Syk-dependent manner. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Jurkat T cells, their derivative J14 (slp-76-/-, syk-/-, kindly provided by D. Yablonski, Haifa, Israel) and DT40 B cells deficient for either SLP-65 or PLC-γ2 (kindly provided by T. Kurosaki, Yokohama, Japan) were cultured as described (27Grabbe A. Wienands J. Blood. 2006; 108: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and stimulated through their antigen receptors with 20 μg/ml anti-human CD3 (C305, kindly provided by B. Schraven, Magdeburg, Germany) and 10 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM (M4, Southern Biotechnology, BioMol, Hamburg, Germany), respectively. T cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer I (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors P2714; Sigma-Aldrich) and B cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer II (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors P2714). Lysates of 3 × 107 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-PLC-γ2 (Q20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-Syk (4D10; Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), or anti-HA antibodies (12CA5; Roche Applied Science). In the latter case, antibodies were immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instruction. Antibodies for immunoblotting are specific for HA peptide (3F10; Roche Applied Science), chicken SLP-65 (kindly provided by T. Kurosaki, Yokohama, Japan), human actin (Sigma-Aldrich), phosphotyrosine (4G10; BioMol, Hamburg, Germany), human SLP-76 (BioMol, Hamburg, Germany), human Syk (4D10), and PLC-γ2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Expression Constructs—The cDNA encoding N-terminally HA-tagged chicken SLP-65 was ligated into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate expression constructs for the SH2 domain deletion mutant of chicken SLP-65 (ΔSH2; amino acids 1-441) and to inactivate the SH2 domain by a single amino acid exchange, i.e. R468L. The resulting cDNAs were ligated into the expression vector pAbes-puro (28Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen) and introduced into SLP-65-negative DT40 B cells by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarad). The cDNA encoding C-terminally EGFP-tagged chicken SLP-65 was ligated via BglII/NotI into pMSCV vector (Becton Dickinson-Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), and SLP-65-deficient B cells were retrovirally transduced as described (15Stork B. Engelke M. Frey J. Horejsi V. Hamm-Baarke A. Schraven B. Kurosaki T. Wienands J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Wild-type murine slp-76 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from EL-4 T cells and ligated via BamHI and EcoRV into pAbes-puro. Using a PCR-generated expression cassette encoding N-terminal HA-tagged murine SLP-65 inserted into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), the leucine zipper deletion mutant (ΔLZ; amino acids 46-442) and the SH2 domain deletion mutant (ΔSH2; amino acids 1-339) of SLP-65 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and ligated via EcoRI into pApuro. Wild-type human syk cDNA was isolated from pDSyk vector (a kind gift from M. Reth, Freiburg, Germany) and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) via EcoRI. A kinase-inactive mutant of Syk (Syk*) and truncated Syk constructs were created by amino acid substitution (K402G; see also Ref. 29Wang L. Devarajan E. He J. Reddy S.P. Dai J.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or deletion using site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. The tandem SH2 domains of Syk were inactivated by replacement of R42G/Q43G/S44I in the N-terminal and R195G/R197L in the C-terminal SH2 domain Syk*(SH2*)2. To delete the N-terminal, C-terminal, or tandem SH2 domains or the kinase domain of Syk, cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1-168 (Syk*ΔSH2N), 167-260 (Syk*ΔSH2C), 1-260 (Syk*Δ(SH2)2) or 367-635 (SykΔKD) of Syk* were ligated into pcDNA3, respectively. J14 cells were transfected by electroporation and selected in the presence of G418 (2 mg/ml) and/or puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). Ca2+ Analysis and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—The concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ions was measured by flow cytometry using the ratiometric Ca2+ chelator dye Indo1-AM (Molecular Probes, BioMol, Hamburg, Germany) as described (27Grabbe A. Wienands J. Blood. 2006; 108: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For monitoring NFAT/AP1-driven gene transcription, 1 × 107 DT40 cells were transiently cotransfected with 10 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV-β and 20 μg of the pNFAT-luc construct (kindly provided by T. Brummer, Sydney, Australia), which harbors three tandem copies of an NFAT/AP1 composite element of the human interleukin-2 promotor (position -286 to -257 (30Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R.

Induction of luciferase protein expression upon BCR activation was measured as described (27Grabbe A. Wienands J. Blood. 2006; 108: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—A total of 1 × 106 DT40 cells were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer solution composed of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. After 30 min of seeding onto chambered coverglasses (Labtek, Stadtlohn, Germany), the cells were examined on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) in the absence or presence of BCR stimulation via anti-IgM antibodies as described in Ref. 16Stork B.

EGFP was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was recorded at 510 nm. Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Membrane Recruitment of SLP-65 Requires a Functional SH2 Domain—To investigate the functional relevance of the SLP-65 SH2 domain, we reconstituted SLP-65-deficient DT40 B cells (31Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) with HA-tagged wild-type SLP-65 and SH2 domain mutants, which harbor an inactivated SH2 domain (single amino acid exchange of R468L) or lack the SH2 domain at all (ΔSH2). Anti-HA immunoblotting revealed that all SLP-65 proteins were expressed by the transfectants in similar amounts (Fig. 1A). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of anti-HA precipitates obtained from resting or anti-IgM-stimulated transfectants revealed robust phosphorylation of wild-type SLP-65 in activated cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4). In contrast, the SH2 domain mutants of SLP-65 were slightly but significantly less phosphorylated (Fig. 1B, lanes 5-8). Hence, efficient communication between the activated BCR and its proximal effector SLP-65 is dependent on a functional SLP-65 SH2 domain. SLP-65 is a specific substrate of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk (1Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), which upon cellular activation translocates from the cytosol to the phospho-ITAMs of Ig-α/β at the plasma membrane (32Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 33Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 34Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, we next analyzed the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant SLP-65 proteins. For this purpose, we transfected slp-65-/- DT40 cells with expression constructs encoding fusion proteins between the EGFP and either wild-type SLP-65 or SLP-65ΔSH2. Untreated and BCR-activated transfectants were examined by laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 1C). In unstimulated cells, the majority of SLP-65 was randomly distributed in the cytosol (upper left image). Following BCR activation, wild-type SLP-65 became almost quantitatively recruited to the plasma membrane (upper right image). The dotted staining pattern of these cells indicates that SLP-65 is concentrated and clustered at specific sites at the plasma membrane where signaling occurs. This stimulation-dependent translocation of wild-type SLP-65 was completely lost for the ΔSH2 mutant of SLP-65 (lower left and right images). The result identifies the SH2 domain as an indispensable structural element for membrane anchoring of SLP-65 in activated B cells. The SH2 Domain of SLP-65 Controls the Activation of Down-stream Signaling Cascades—To assess whether impaired phosphorylation and lack of membrane recruitment of SLP-65 SH2 domain mutants also affects SLP-65-regulated downstream signaling, we analyzed BCR-induced activation of PLC-γ2 and concomitant Ca2+ mobilization as well as the transcriptional activity of NFAT in the cell lines described above (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous reports (31Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), BCR-induced PLC-γ2 phosphorylation required SLP-65 expression (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4). Similar to SLP-65-negative DT40 B cells, almost no PLC-γ2 phosphorylation was observed in transfectants expressing SH2-defective SLP-65 proteins (Fig. 2B, lanes 5-8). Block of PLC-γ2 activation was associated with drastically diminished assembly of the Ca2+ initiation complex (data not shown) and directly correlated with defective Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 2B). Only a very weak and transient Ca2+ flux was observed in cells expressing the R468L mutant of SLP-65 (red line). BCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization was completely abrogated in cells expressing SLP-65ΔSH2 (magenta line) or no SLP-65 at all (black line). To test whether the residual Ca2+ flux observed in cells with mutant SLP-65 is still sufficient to trigger nuclear responses, we monitored Ca2+-sensitive activation of the transcription factor NFAT. For this purpose, the slp-65-/- parental cells and the different SLP-65 transfectants were equipped with a luciferase reporter gene construct under the transcriptional control of a NFAT-responsive promotor. Empty vector-transfected cells served as control, and cotransfection of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid allowed for normalization of the reporter gene activity according to the transfection efficiencies. As previously published (27Grabbe A. Wienands J. Blood. 2006; 108: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Junicho A. Kishi H. Yoshimura A. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Tan J.E. Wong S.C. Gan S.K. Xu S. Lam K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), anti-BCR stimulation of cells expressing wild-type SLP-65 resulted in strong activation of NFAT-mediated gene transcription, which was almost undetectable in SLP-65-deficient cells (Fig. 2C, column pairs 1 and 2). Reconstitution with SH2 domain mutants of SLP-65 did not restore this response (column pairs 3 and 4). Collectively, this set of experiments reveals that the SLP-65 SH2 domain is critically involved in proper formation of the Ca2+ initiation complex to activate PLC-γ2 and to raise intracellular Ca2+ concentrations above a threshold level that allows activation of gene transcription. A Concerted Action of Phosphorylated SLP-65 and Syk Compensates for Loss of SLP-76 in T Cells—The indispensable role of the SLP-65 SH2 domain for efficient coupling to upstream as well as downstream signaling partners of Ca2+ mobilization suggested another fundamental difference to the T cell paralogue SLP-76, whose SH2 domain is involved neither in SLP-76 membrane anchoring nor TCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization (38Myung P.S. Derimanov G.S. Jordan M.S. Punt J.A. Liu Q.H. Judd B.A. Meyers E.E. Sigmund C.D. Freedman B.D. Koretzky G.A.

A. 2002; 99: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To further confirm this notion and to directly assess whether the SLP-65 SH2 domain needs a B cell-specific ligand, we expressed HA-tagged wild-type SLP-65 in the SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cell mutant J14 (40Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, upper two panels, lanes 2 and 4). As control, J14 cells were reconstituted with wild-type SLP-76 (lanes 2 and 3). Because the J14 variant lacks not only SLP-76 but also Syk (third panel, lanes 1-4), we generated additional J14 transfectants expressing either Syk alone or in combination with HA-tagged wild-type SLP-65 (lanes 5 and 6). After having established these cell lines, we first tested for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-65. Anti-HA precipitates were prepared from resting and stimulated J14 parental cells as well as from SLP-65 single transfectants and SLP-65/Syk double transfectants. Subsequently, purified proteins were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-HA immunoblotting (Fig. 3B, upper and lower panel, respectively). SLP-65 became inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in the single and double transfectants (lanes 3-6). The presence of Syk in the latter cells caused a low level of constitutive SLP-65 phosphorylation (lane 5). No specific signal was obtained in the analysis of J14 parental cells (lanes 1 and 2). These data show that SLP-65 can be coupled to the TCR signaling machinery independent of Syk. Most likely, SLP-65 phosphorylation is accomplished by the Syk-related kinase ZAP-70. However, flow cytometric analysis of TCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the various T cell lines described above showed that expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-65 alone is not sufficient to restore the Ca2+ response in SLP-76-deficient J14 cells (Fig. 3C, red and black lines). In marked contrast to the SLP-65 single transfectants, the SLP-65/Syk double transfectants of J14 mounted robust Ca2+ signaling (orange line) similar to that observed in wild-type Jurkat T cells or SLP-76-reconstituted J14 cells (dark and light blue lines, respectively). Expression of Syk alone did not confer TCR responsiveness to J14 cells (magenta line), even though the single transfectants produced Syk in large amounts (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Indeed, the analysis of a panel of independent SLP-65/Syk double transfectants revealed that it is the coexpression of Syk and SLP-65 rather than the level of expression of each protein that allows the cells to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (only one representative SLP-65/Syk-positive clone is shown in Fig. 3A, lane 6). Hence, SLP-65 and Syk appear to form a functional unit that is required for coupling phosphorylated SLP-65 to downstream Ca2+ signaling. It is important to note that this function of Syk cannot be studied in B cells because here Syk is already upstream of SLP-65 activation in that it is required for SLP-65 phosphorylation. The C-terminal Half of Syk Couples Phospho-SLP-65 to Ca2+ Signaling in a Kinase-independent Manner—Given the lack of Ca2+ mobilization in the presence of phosphorylated SLP-65, we next asked the question of whether the enzymatic activity of Syk is at all required to restore the Ca2+ response in SLP-65-expressing J14 cells. An expression vector for a kinase-negative mutant of Syk (Syk*) was constructed (Fig. 4A) and expressed in SLP-65-positive J14 cells (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lanes 1-4). We additionally generated transfectants expressing a Syk* variant in which both SH2 domains were inactivated by amino acid exchanges (Syk*(SH2*)2) (Fig. 4, A and B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). Following TCR activation of the cells, the Syk* variant became tyrosine-phosphorylated (presumably by ZAP-70), whereas the Syk*(SH2*)2 mutant did not (Fig. 4B, lower panel) because it lacks functional SH2 domains required for Syk recruitment to the ITAMs of the activated TCR. Yet both Syk mutants were equally capable of fully reconstituting a TCR-induced Ca2+ response (Fig. 4C). These results were unexpected because they show that neither the function of the kinase domain nor that of the tandem SH2 domains of Syk is required for coupling phosphorylated SLP-65 to Ca2+ elevation. The data indicated the existence of an as yet unknown functional element in Syk that operates downstream of SLP-65 phosphorylation and critically supports SLP-65-mediated Ca2+ elevation. To further dissect the structural requirements of Syk, a series of Syk deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 4D, see also schematic representation in Fig. 4A) and tested for their Ca2+ signaling capacity in SLP-65-positive J14 cells (Fig. 4E). Ablation of single or tandem SH2 domains in the Syk* variant did not significantly alter the ability of this kinase-inactive mutant to support Ca2+ mobilization. In marked contrast but identical to J14 control cells, no Ca2+ response was detected in SLP-65-positive J14 transfectants expressing a"

https://openalex.org/W2093106644,"Abstract Numerous heptahelical receptors use activation of heterotrimeric G proteins to convey a multitude of extracellular signals to appropriate effector molecules in the cell. Both high specificity and correct integration of these signals are required for reliable cell function. Yet the molecular machineries that allow each cell to merge information flowing across different receptors are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels can operate as dynamic integrators of α-adrenergic and cholinergic signals in atrial myocytes. Acting at the last step of the cholinergic signaling cascade, these channels are activated by direct interactions with βγ subunits of the inhibitory G proteins (Gβγ), and efficiently translate M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) activation into membrane hyperpolarization. The parallel activation of α-adrenergic receptors imposed a distinctive “signature” on the function of M2R-activated GIRK1/4 channels, affecting both the probability of Gβγ binding to the channel and its desensitization. This modulation of channel function was correlated with a parallel depletion of Gβ and protein phosphatase 1 from the oligomeric GIRK1 complexes. Such plasticity of the immediate GIRK signaling environment suggests that multireceptor integration involves large protein networks undergoing dynamic changes upon receptor activation."

Agrp expression in the brain is restricted to neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and is elevated by states of negative energy balance. The molecular mechanisms underlying Agrp regulation, however, remain poorly defined. Using a combination of transgenic and comparative sequence analysis, we have previously identified a 760 bp conserved region upstream of Agrp which contains STAT binding elements that participate in Agrp transcriptional regulation. In this study, we attempt to improve the specificity for detecting conserved elements in this region by comparing genomic sequences from 10 mammalian species. Our analysis reveals a symmetrical organization of conserved sequences upstream of Agrp, which cluster into two inverted repeat elements. Conserved sequences within these elements suggest a role for homeodomain proteins in the regulation of Agrp and provide additional targets for functional evaluation."

Here we show that the transcription of these two genes in the nucleus engages in “on/off” phases. During each “on” phase, cotranscription of rho and epsilon in cis is favored. We propose that these two chicken beta globin genes are transcribed not by competing for a transcription initiation complex, but in a cooperative way."
