Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene, polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polystyrene with and without polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for 28 days. Their predators, white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), were exposed to clams from each treatment for 28 days. In both species, we examined bioaccumulation of PCBs and effects (i.e., immunohistochemistry, histology, behavior, condition, mortality) across several levels of biological organization. PCBs were not detected in prey or predator, and thus differences in bioaccumulation of PCBs among polymers and biomagnification in predators could not be measured. One of the main objectives of this study was to test the hypothesis that bioaccumulation of PCBs would differ among polymer types. Because we could not answer this question experimentally, a bioaccumulation model was run and predicted that concentrations of PCBs in clams exposed to polyethylene and polystyrene would be greater than PET and PVC. Observed effects, although subtle, seemed to be due to microplastics rather than PCBs alone. For example, histopathology showed tubular dilation in clams exposed to microplastics with PCBs, with only mild effects in clams exposed to PCBs alone."

Here we investigated the spatial scale of homeostatic changes in spine size following sensory deprivation in a subset of inhibitory (layer 2/3 GAD65-positive) and excitatory (layer 5 Thy1-positive) neurons in mouse visual cortex. Using repeated in vivo two-photon imaging, we find that increases in spine size are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) dependent and thus are likely associated with synaptic scaling. Rather than occurring at all spines, the observed increases in spine size are spatially localized to a subset of dendritic branches and are correlated with the degree of recent local spine loss within that branch.

Following a reduction in activity resulting from sensory deprivation, excitatory synapses have been shown to strengthen, which is thought to facilitate the restoration of activity levels (Hengen et al., 2013Hengen K.B.

There are two well-studied mechanisms that lead to strengthening of synapses: homeostatic mechanisms, such as synaptic scaling (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar), and Hebbian mechanisms, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Hebbian processes occur over small spatial scales, on the order of single synapses or small groups of neighboring synapses (Harvey et al., 2008Harvey C.D. Yasuda R. Zhong H. Svoboda K. The spread of Ras activity triggered by activation of a single dendritic spine.Science. 2008; 321: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and are thought to strengthen spared inputs following sensory deprivation and facilitate cortical reorganization (Cheetham et al., 2012Cheetham C.E.J.

In contrast, synaptic scaling is believed to occur across a larger, cell-wide spatial scale (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar) and is potentially implemented through global changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) properties (Makino and Malinow, 2011Makino H. Malinow R.

However, studies in reduced preparations have demonstrated that synaptic scaling can be locally induced in dendritic branches (Sutton et al., 2006Sutton M.A. Ito H.T. Cressy P. Kempf C. Woo J.C. Schuman E.M. Miniature neurotransmission stabilizes synaptic function via tonic suppression of local dendritic protein synthesis.Cell. 2006; 125: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and that AMPARs can be synthesized locally within branches (Ju et al., 2004Ju W. Morishita W. Tsui J. Gaietta G. Deerinck T.J. Adams S.R. Garner C.C. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Malenka R.C. Activity-dependent regulation of dendritic synthesis and trafficking of AMPA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that scaling could be implemented independently within dendritic branches (Yu and Goda, 2009Yu L.M.Y. Goda Y. Dendritic signalling and homeostatic adaptation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that the dendritic branch is a fundamental computational unit for the processing of neural information (Branco and Häusser, 2010Branco T. Häusser M. The single dendritic branch as a fundamental functional unit in the nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, Poirazi et al., 2003Poirazi P. Brannon T. Mel B.W. Pyramidal neuron as two-layer neural network.Neuron. 2003; 37: 989-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Homeostatic mechanisms are thought to restore activity after deprivation while maintaining input-output properties of the cell. Whether these processes occur homogenously across a cell or are targeted to individual compartments in vivo is still unclear. This issue is of particular interest given recent evidence that inputs with similar properties cluster on dendritic branches (Iacaruso et al., 2017Iacaruso M.F. Gasler I.T. Hofer S.B. Synaptic organization of visual space in primary visual cortex.Nature. 2017; 547: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2012Takahashi N. Kitamura K. Matsuo N. Mayford M. Kano M. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. Locally synchronized synaptic inputs.Science. 2012; 335: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2016Wilson D.E. Whitney D.E. Scholl B. Fitzpatrick D. Orientation selectivity and the functional clustering of synaptic inputs in primary visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, input levels across the dendritic arbor may become disparate following sensory deprivation, as deprivation-induced reductions of input may vary considerably across branches. A global homeostatic strategy that modifies synaptic strengths cell-wide would perturb inputs onto branches that may have been unaffected by sensory deprivation. Thus, global scaling may come at the cost of interfering with initially unaffected input-output relationships. Understanding the spatial scales at which synapses are altered is necessary to understand how the neuron can regulate activity levels and still maintain the specific circuitry associated with memory storage established through experience. Synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses occurs in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons following reduction of activity in reduced preparations (Hartman et al., 2006Hartman K.N. Pal S.K. Burrone J. Murthy V.N. Activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Synaptic scaling in inhibitory neurons will likely affect activity levels in those cells, which could in turn alter the balance between excitation and inhibition onto excitatory cells. Thus, synaptic scaling in inhibitory neurons, which has received relatively little attention to date, could have implications for overall cortical activity levels. In mouse visual cortex, we have previously described a population of inhibitory neurons that exhibit visual deprivation-induced increases in spine dynamics in vivo (Keck et al., 2011Keck T. Scheuss V. Jacobsen R.I. Wierenga C.J. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Loss of sensory input causes rapid structural changes of inhibitory neurons in adult mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 869-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting that changes to spines do occur in this cell type. Our more recent work, however, shows that inhibitory neurons have a wide range of activity profiles following sensory deprivation, from cells that become functionally silent to those that increase their activity (Barnes et al., 2015Barnes S.J. Sammons R.P. Jacobsen R.I. Mackie J. Keller G.B. Keck T. Subnetwork-specific homeostatic plasticity in mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1290-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results indicate that homeostatic recovery of activity in inhibitory neurons may be different from that in excitatory cells. Thus, whether excitatory synapses in inhibitory neurons undergo similar processes of strengthening to those seen in excitatory neurons in vivo following deprivation is still unclear. Here we examined the spatial scale of spine size increases within individual cells following visual deprivation in mouse monocular visual cortex. Using in vivo imaging, we found that, following monocular enucleation, dendritic spines show an increase in size on both a subset of layer 2/3 inhibitory and layer 5 excitatory pyramidal neurons. When we examined the spatial extent of these spine size increases, we found that they do not occur across all dendritic branches. Instead, in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons, spine size increases were most prominent on branches that had undergone spine loss after deprivation, such that branches with greater spine loss had larger subsequent increases in the sizes of the remaining spines. Using simulations, we show that this local regulation results in higher information capacity for the neuron than global changes. To examine the spatial scale of spine size changes following sensory deprivation via monocular enucleation in inhibitory and excitatory neurons, we used repeated (Figures 1A–1C, every 24 hr for 4 days) two-photon imaging of dendritic spines in the monocular visual cortex of anaesthetized adult mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) either in a subset of spiny layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons (under the GAD65 promoter; GAD65-GFP) (López-Bendito et al., 2004López-Bendito G. Sturgess K. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Molnár Z. Paulsen O. Preferential origin and layer destination of GAD65-GFP cortical interneurons.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 1122-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or in layer 5 excitatory pyramidal cells (under the Thy1 promoter; Thy1-GFP) (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Imaging neuronal subsets in transgenic mice expressing multiple spectral variants of GFP.Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the cell bodies of these distinct cell types are in different cortical layers, but they both have dendrites in the upper layers of the cortex. Thus, for both cell types we repeatedly imaged the same dendritic spines in cortical layers 1 and 2/3 before and after deprivation and measured spine sizes as a proxy for synaptic strength, as spine size correlates with both AMPAR expression and the strength of functional synaptic responses (Noguchi et al., 2011Noguchi J. Nagaoka A. Watanabe S. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Kitamura K. Kano M. Matsuzaki M. Kasai H.

Physiol. 2011; 589: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we focus on layer 5 excitatory cells, as we have previously reported that they exhibit spine size increases following sensory deprivation (Keck et al., 2013Keck T. Keller G.B. Jacobsen R.I. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Synaptic scaling and homeostatic plasticity in the mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2013; 80: 327-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas in layer 2/3 excitatory cells, we have previously found no evidence for either net increases in spine size or synaptic scaling in adult animals (Barnes et al., 2015Barnes S.J. Sammons R.P. Jacobsen R.I. Mackie J. Keller G.B. Keck T. Subnetwork-specific homeostatic plasticity in mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1290-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We first determined whether spine size increased in layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons following monocular enucleation. We focused on a subset of inhibitory neurons that have dendritic spines, a majority of which contain excitatory synapses (Keck et al., 2011Keck T. Scheuss V. Jacobsen R.I. Wierenga C.J. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Loss of sensory input causes rapid structural changes of inhibitory neurons in adult mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 869-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These cells are largely (∼90%) neuropeptide-Y (NPY) positive (Keck et al., 2011Keck T. Scheuss V. Jacobsen R.I. Wierenga C.J. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Loss of sensory input causes rapid structural changes of inhibitory neurons in adult mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 869-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and located in layer 2/3, which also technically facilitates imaging dendritic spines. In these inhibitory neurons, we found an average increase in the population spine size 48 hr after deprivation (Figures 1A, 1D, and S1A–S1D). This time course was slower than for layer 5 excitatory neurons (Figures 1B, 1E, and S1E–S1H), where the population spine size increased within 24 hr, consistent with previous results (Keck et al., 2013Keck T. Keller G.B. Jacobsen R.I. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Synaptic scaling and homeostatic plasticity in the mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2013; 80: 327-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). An increase in spine size in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons in response to a decrease in overall cortical activity levels could be due to either synaptic scaling or Hebbian-like processes. Before examining the spatial scale of the spine changes we observed in vivo, we wanted to establish whether these changes in spine size shared mechanisms with classical synaptic scaling studied in in vitro preparations or Hebbian LTP-like processes. Previous work has demonstrated that synaptic scaling, but not Hebbian plasticity, is dependent on TNF-α, a cell signaling cytokine released from glial cells (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). TNF-α is thought to be released in response to a reduction in glutamate and to support the persistent expression of synaptic scaling by upregulating AMPA receptor insertion (Steinmetz and Turrigiano, 2010Steinmetz C.C. Turrigiano G.G. Tumor necrosis factor-α signaling maintains the ability of cortical synapses to express synaptic scaling.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14685-14690Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). We used a pharmacological approach to inhibit TNF-α by injecting mice before and after they underwent deprivation with a dominant-negative TNF (XPRo1595, see STAR Methods; Lewitus et al., 2014Lewitus G.M. Pribiag H. Duseja R. St-Hilaire M. Stellwagen D. An adaptive role of TNFα in the regulation of striatal synapses.J.

Microglial TNF-α suppresses cocaine-induced plasticity and behavioral sensitization.Neuron. 2016; 90: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to inhibit soluble TNF-α in vivo (Figure 1C). Although we still observed a range of spine size changes similar to what we measured in control animals (Figures S1I–S1L), we found that the net in vivo spine size increases were blocked in both inhibitory (Figures 1D, S1I, and S1J) and excitatory (Figures 1E, S1K, and S1L) neurons in deprived animals that were injected with the TNF-α inhibitor, suggesting that the net increases in spine size reflect a synaptic scaling-like process. To confirm that TNF-α inhibition also prevented functional measures of synaptic scaling, we made electrophysiological recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in acute slices prepared from mice 48 hr after enucleation or sham-enucleation (Figure 1F). In agreement with the observed in vivo spine changes, we observed a multiplicative increase in mEPSC amplitude in enucleated mice in both inhibitory (Figures 1G, S1M, S2I, and S2K) and excitatory (Figures 1H, S1N, S2M, and S2O) neurons. Synaptic scaling was abolished in deprived animals when they were injected with the TNF-α inhibitor (Figures 1G and 1H, gray; Figures S1O and S1P), consistent with past work (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P.

Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). We found a significant increase in mEPSC inter-event interval (consistent with a decrease in frequency) in deprived animals and deprived animals that were injected with the TNF-α inhibitor (Figures S1Q–S1T). Synaptic scaling is also associated with an increase in the AMPAR subunit GluA2 (Gainey et al., 2009Gainey M.A. Hurvitz-Wolff J.R. Lambo M.E. Turrigiano G.G. Synaptic scaling requires the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6479-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which is facilitated by interactions with the AMPAR-binding protein Glutamate Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (GRIP1) (Gainey et al., 2015Gainey M.A. Tatavarty V. Nahmani M. Lin H. Turrigiano G.G. Activity-dependent synaptic GRIP1 accumulation drives synaptic scaling up in response to action potential blockade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E3590-E3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To examine this molecular signature of synaptic scaling, we again prepared brain slices from mice 48 hr after deprivation and performed immunohistochemistry against GFP, GluA2, and GRIP1 (Figures 1I and S1U–S1Y). Spine size (Figure 1J), the intensity of GluA2 that is co-localized with GRIP1 in spines (Figure 1K), and the GluA2 intensity per unit spine size (Figure S1Z) increased following deprivation in both inhibitory and excitatory cells, consistent with measures of synaptic scaling (Gainey et al., 2009Gainey M.A. Hurvitz-Wolff J.R. Lambo M.E. Turrigiano G.G. Synaptic scaling requires the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6479-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Gainey et al., 2015Gainey M.A. Tatavarty V. Nahmani M. Lin H. Turrigiano G.G. Activity-dependent synaptic GRIP1 accumulation drives synaptic scaling up in response to action potential blockade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E3590-E3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the observed net increases in spine size are likely due to synaptic scaling, not Hebbian mechanisms, in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. While synaptic scaling is generally thought to occur cell-wide (Turrigiano, 2012Turrigiano G. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity: local and global mechanisms for stabilizing neuronal function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005736Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated to be inducible locally at individual dendritic branches in reduced preparations (Sutton et al., 2006Sutton M.A. Ito H.T. Cressy P. Kempf C. Woo J.C. Schuman E.M. Miniature neurotransmission stabilizes synaptic function via tonic suppression of local dendritic protein synthesis.Cell. 2006; 125: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It is still unclear, however, if synaptic scaling is compartmentalized to individual dendritic branches in vivo. Given the evidence that in vivo spine size changes reflect a TNF-α-dependent scaling-like process, we used spine size increases as a proxy for synaptic scaling to investigate the spatial scale of this process in vivo. To this end, we analyzed the spatial clustering of spine size changes following deprivation. We first quantified if there is clustering of increasing spines within a dendritic branch (see STAR Methods) and found no evidence for spatial clustering more local than branch-wide in either inhibitory (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, S2C, and S2E) or excitatory (Figures 2A, 2C, S2B, S2D, and S2F) neurons. We then expanded the spatial scale of our analysis to determine if all branches on a cell undergo spine size increases. We found that spines on the same branch as an increasing spine were more likely to increase in size than the population average (Figures 2B and 2C), while spines on a different branch (DB) of the same cell were not (Figures 2B and 2C). We then calculated whether each dendritic branch underwent average increases in spine size or not (see STAR Methods for criteria for “increasing branches”). Overall, we found that roughly half of all branches in both inhibitory (18/31 branches, or 58%) and excitatory (12/24 branches, or 50%) neurons underwent increases in spine size (see STAR Methods). This proportion was greater than both the fraction of branches that we would expect to increase by chance given the number of increasing spines (see STAR Methods; inhibitory cell branches, 30% ± 1%; excitatory cell branches, 31% ± 1%), and those we measured in control animals (inhibitory cell branches, 11/40 or 28%; excitatory cell branches, 7/34 or 21%). Within individual cells, we found that pairs of branches on the same cell did not always both undergo increases in spine size following enucleation in either inhibitory or excitatory neurons (Figure 2D). We confirmed these in vivo findings by imaging dendritic branches in slices prepared from mice that had previously undergone deprivation, showing that pairs of branches on the same cell do not always both have increases in spine size (Figure 2E). In these slices, we were able to reconstruct a larger percentage of the dendritic arbor and found that branches with spines that increase in size occurred across all branch orders on the dendritic tree (Figures S2G and S2H). These results suggest that increases in spine size do not occur uniformly across all dendritic branches of a given neuron. Instead, spines that increase in size were preferentially located on a subset of the branches in the dendritic tree. This result seemed inconsistent with the observation of multiplicative synaptic scaling from the electrophysiology data (Figures S2I, S2K, S2M, and S2O), so we used established methods (Kim et al., 2012Kim J. Tsien R.W. Alger B.E. An improved test for detecting multiplicative homeostatic synaptic scaling.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e37364Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, see STAR Methods) to determine if multiplicative scaling could occur with only 50% of inputs increasing in size. Consistent with the in vivo imaging results, we found that multiplicative scaling of only 50% of the control mEPSC amplitude distribution gave a better fit to the deprived distribution than scaling 100% of the control distribution (Figures S2I–S2P). The engagement of homeostatic synaptic strengthening mechanisms, including synaptic scaling, is thought to depend on strong changes in supra-threshold postsynaptic activity (Ibata et al., 2008Ibata K. Sun Q. Turrigiano G.G. Rapid synaptic scaling induced by changes in postsynaptic firing.Neuron. 2008; 57: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To test if differences in supra-threshold dendritic activity between branches on the same cell could explain the branch-specific changes in spine size that we observed in vivo, we expressed GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar) in (NPY-positive) inhibitory or, in a separate set of animals, layer 5 excitatory cells (see STAR Methods). We then measured dendritic calcium transients, as a proxy for suprathreshold activity (back-propagating action potentials and dendritic spikes) in awake head-fixed mice, which were free to run on a spherical treadmill with visual stimulation coupled to the mouse’s movement. In dendritic branches (Figures 2H and 2I) that shared a branchpoint (as with the structural imaging data in Figures 2D and 2E) located in layer 2/3, we examined calcium transients after enucleation, but before we observed spine size increases (see STAR Methods). We compared the activity in a dendritic branch with (1) activity in another branch that shared a branchpoint, (2) activity in a neighboring region 10 μm away on the same dendritic branch (which provides an approximation of the within-branch signal variability over a spatial scale in which we measured all of the structural imaging branches and do not observe differences in spine size changes, see Figures 2B and 2C), or (3) activity in a branch from a different cell in the same imaging region. Activity levels (measured as the integral of the ΔF/F0 signal in the imaging session) were similar in all conditions (Figures 2J and 2K). The variation in activity patterns (measured as the correlation and mutual information) between branch pairs was indistinguishable from that measured within a single dendritic branch (Figures 2L, 2M, S2Q, and S2R) but was very different from branches of other neurons in the same imaging field of view for both cell types (Figures 2L, 2M, S2Q, and S2R). We next examined branch-specific calcium events that occurred in only one of the two dendritic branches (Figure 2N; see STAR Methods). We measured the peak amplitude (Figure 2O) and frequency (Figure 2P) of branch-specific events and found that these events accounted for a small fraction (<1%) of the overall activity in the branches (Figure S2S). Specifically, the activity differences between the branches as a result of these branch-specific calcium events was very small (on the order of 0.20%) and was also similar to the difference in activity between branch pairs attributable to branch-specific events in control animals (Figure 2Q). Together, these results indicate that between dendritic branchpoint pairs, there are not strong differences in suprathreshold activity that are typically associated with the induction of synaptic scaling (Ibata et al., 2008Ibata K.

https://openalex.org/W2767328742,"Curcumin (CUR) has been used as photosensitizer in antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT). However its poor water solubility, instability, and scarce bioavalibility hinder its in vivo application. The aim of this study was to synthesize curcumin in polymeric nanoparticles (NP) and to evaluate their antimicrobial photodynamic effect and cytoxicity. CUR in anionic and cationic NP was synthesized using polylactic acid and dextran sulfate by the nanoprecipitation method. For cationic NP, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was added. CUR-NP were characterized by physicochemical properties, photodegradation, encapsulation efficiency and release of curcumin from nanoparticles. CUR-NP was compared with free CUR in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a photosensitizer for aPDT against planktonic and biofilms (mono-, dual- and triple-species) cultures of Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The cytotoxicity effect of formulations was evaluated on keratinocytes. Data were analysed by parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests (α = 0.05). CUR-NP showed alteration in the physicochemical properties along time, photodegradation similar to free curcumin, encapsulation efficiency up to 67%, and 96% of release after 48h. After aPDT planktonic cultures showed reductions from 0.78 log10 to complete eradication, while biofilms showed no antimicrobial effect or reductions up to 4.44 log10. Anionic CUR-NP showed reduced photoinactivation of biofilms. Cationic CUR-NP showed microbicidal effect even in absence of light. Anionic formulations showed no cytotoxic effect compared with free CUR and cationic CUR-NP and NP. The synthesized formulations improved the water solubility of CUR, showed higher antimicrobial photodynamic effect for planktonic cultures than for biofilms, and the encapsulation of CUR in anionic NP reduced the cytotoxicity of 10% DMSO used for free CUR."
https://openalex.org/W2630417408,"Sufficiently strong modulation of the interaction strength in a Bose–Einstein condensate induces inelastic atom–atom scattering and causes collective emission of matter-wave jets from the condensate. Scattering of one entity by another is at the heart of many physical phenomena. In the quantum many-body regime, the complex interplay of many collision events can result in collective behaviours that are distinct from those expected from simple pair-wise scattering processes. Ultracold atomic gases can be used to explore these possibilities because they offer an experimental platform in which the scattering interactions can be tuned. Logan Clark et al. describe a vivid example of such collective behaviour, identifying a regime in which the atom–atom scattering within a Bose–Einstein condensate results in the laser-like emission of jets of atoms from the body of the condensate. Scattering is used to probe matter and its interactions in all areas of physics. In ultracold atomic gases, control over pairwise interactions enables us to investigate scattering in quantum many-body systems1. Previous experiments on colliding Bose–Einstein condensates have revealed matter–wave interference2,3, haloes of scattered atoms4,5, four-wave mixing6,7 and correlations between counter-propagating pairs8,9,10. However, a regime with strong stimulation of spontaneous collisions11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 analogous to superradiance21,22,23 has proved elusive. In this regime, the collisions rapidly produce highly correlated states with macroscopic population. Here we find that runaway stimulated collisions in Bose–Einstein condensates with periodically modulated interaction strength cause the collective emission of matter-wave jets that resemble fireworks. Jets appear only above a threshold modulation amplitude and their correlations are invariant even when the number of ejected atoms grows exponentially. Hence, we show that the structures and atom occupancies of the jets stem from the quantum fluctuations of the condensate. Our findings demonstrate the conditions required for runaway stimulated collisions and reveal the quantum nature of matter-wave emission."
https://openalex.org/W2767973912,"Consumption of a typical Western diet is a risk factor for several disorders. Metabolic syndrome is the most common disease associated with intake of excess fat. However, the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is also greater in subjects consuming a Western diet, although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not clearly understood. We examined the morphological and functional changes of the intestine, the first site contacting dietary fat, in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) inducing obesity. Paneth cell area and production of antimicrobial peptides by Paneth cells were decreased in HFD-fed mice. Goblet cell number and secretion of mucin by goblet cells were also decreased, while intestinal permeability was increased in HFD-fed mice. HFD-fed mice were more susceptible to experimental colitis, and exhibited severe colonic inflammation, accompanied by the expansion of selected pathobionts such as Atopobium sp. and Proteobacteria. Fecal microbiota transplantation transferred the susceptibility to DSS-colitis, and antibiotic treatment abrogated colitis progression. These data suggest that an experimental HFD-induced Paneth cell dysfunction and subsequent intestinal dysbiosis characterized by pathobiont expansion can be predisposing factors to the development of inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2766332190,"Multi-electrode recordings in the non-human primate provide a critical method for measuring the widely distributed activity patterns that underlie brain function. However, common techniques rely on small, often immovable arrays, or microdrives, that are only capable of manipulating a small number of closely spaced probes. These techniques restrict the number of cortical areas that can be simultaneously sampled and are typically not capable of reaching subcortical targets. To overcome these limitations, we developed a large-scale, semi-chronic microdrive recording system with up to 256 independently movable microelectrodes spanning an entire cerebral hemisphere. The microdrive system is hermetically sealed, free of internal connecting wires, and has been used to simultaneously record from up to 37 cortical and subcortical areas in awake behaving monkeys for up to 9 months. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to address network-level questions using a graph theoretic analysis of functional connectivity data."
https://openalex.org/W2767502010,"Gender differences in psychiatric disorders such as addiction may be modulated by the steroid hormone estrogen. For instance, 17β-estradiol (E2), the predominant form of circulating estrogen in pre-menopausal females, increases ethanol consumption, suggesting that E2 may affect the rewarding properties of ethanol and thus the development of alcohol use disorder in females. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is critically involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of ethanol. In order to determine the role of E2 in VTA physiology, gonadally intact female mice were sacrificed during diestrus II (high E2) or estrus (low E2) for electrophysiology recordings. We measured the excitation by ethanol and inhibition by dopamine (DA) of VTA DA neurons and found that both excitation by ethanol and inhibition by dopamine were greater in diestrus II compared with estrus. Treatment of VTA slices from mice in diestrus II with an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) reduced ethanol-stimulated neuronal firing, but had no effect on ethanol-stimulated firing of neurons in slices from mice in estrus. Surprisingly, ICI 182,780 did not affect the inhibition by DA, indicating different mechanisms of action of estrogen receptors in altering ethanol and DA responses. We also examined the responses of VTA DA neurons to ethanol and DA in ovariectomized mice treated with E2 and found that E2 treatment enhanced the responses to ethanol and DA in a manner similar to what we observed in mice in diestrus II. Our data indicate that E2 modulates VTA neuron physiology, which may contribute to both the enhanced reinforcing and rewarding effects of alcohol and the development of other psychiatric disorders in females that involve alterations in DA neurotransmission."

Among these molecules, synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are a class of membrane proteins essential for the establishment and maturation of synaptic connections. Recent studies have identified a growing number of synaptic CAMs, including Neuroligins (NLs) and leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) that bind to presynaptic neurexins, Slit- and Trk-like family proteins (Slitrks) that bind to presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), immunoglobulin superfamily proteins (IgSFs) that mediate trans-synaptic homophilic or heterophilic adhesion interactions, cadherin family proteins, and transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (Craig and Kang, 2007Craig A.M.

Although these molecules are involved in various stages of synapse development, how diverse synaptic CAMs work in concert to control synapse formation remains largely unclear. GABAergic synapses are the dominant source of inhibition throughout the mammalian brain, providing a critical inhibitory balance to the excitatory glutamatergic drive for control of neuronal/network excitability. Because GABAergic inhibition is important in almost every aspect of brain physiology, and the dysregulation of GABAergic synapse development has been implicated in many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (Ko et al., 2015Ko J.

Furthermore, hippocampal GABAergic transmission is reduced to approximately half of control levels in NL2 or ST3 knockout (KO) mice (Poulopoulos et al., 2009Poulopoulos A. Aramuni G. Meyer G.

Collectively, these studies implicate NL2 and ST3 as critical CAMs for GABAergic synapse development in the hippocampus. However, how NL2 and ST3 work together to control GABAergic synaptogenesis remains unknown. Here we report a hierarchical process orchestrated by NL2 and ST3 for GABAergic synapse development. In developing hippocampal neurons, NL2, but not ST3, essentially accounts for initial GABAergic synapse development. As neurons mature, both NL2 and ST3 are required for development of GABAergic synapses. Importantly, an interaction between NL2 and ST3 in the nanomolar range facilitates ST3 trafficking to the plasma membrane and potently promotes GABAergic synapse development. Selective disruption of this NL2-ST3 interaction impairs development of GABAergic transmission, decreases hippocampal network activities associated with inhibitory pacing, and increases seizure susceptibility. To determine the role of NL2 in GABAergic synapse development, we performed in utero electroporation to express an NL2 shRNA (small hairpin RNA) (Chih et al., 2005Chih B. Engelman H. Scheiffele P. Control of excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation by neuroligins.Science. 2005; 307: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) along with GFP in hippocampal progenitor cells at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and probed GABAergic inhibition in hippocampal slices at post-natal days 8–10 (P8–P10) (Figure 1A; Figure S1A). Measurement of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) showed that GABAergic transmission was barely detectable in shRNA-expressing CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 1B). In contrast, NL2 shRNA expression in hippocampal neurons from NL2 KO (NL2−/−) mice did not significantly reduce GABAergic transmission (Figure S1C), confirming the specificity of the construct. In addition, although more mature, P19–P21 CA1 neurons expressing NL2 shRNAs continued to exhibit reduced GABAergic transmission (∼70% reduction in mIPSC frequency), the deficit was less severe than at P8–P10 (Figure S2A). These data suggest that NL2 is essential for establishing GABAergic transmission in developing hippocampal neurons and that, as neurons mature, GABAergic transmission in NL2 knockdown neurons, although strongly reduced, can develop. In contrast to our single-cell NL2 knockdown data in vivo, previous work in adult NL2−/− mice observed only a modest reduction in GABAergic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons (∼50%; Poulopoulos et al., 2009Poulopoulos A. Aramuni G. Meyer G. Soykan T. Hoon M. Papadopoulos T. Zhang M. Paarmann I. Fuchs C. Harvey K. et al.Neuroligin 2 drives postsynaptic assembly at perisomatic inhibitory synapses through gephyrin and collybistin.Neuron. 2009; 63: 628-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that the reduction in GABAergic transmission in developing CA1 neurons in P8–P9 NL2−/− mice (∼70%) was less severe than the deficit induced by NL2 shRNA (Figure S2B). We thus probed, in NL2−/− mouse hippocampal lysates, for other synaptic molecules that might be upregulated. Although there was no change in total expression levels of other NL family members, including NL1, NL3, and several other synaptic proteins, ST3 expression was significantly increased in NL2−/− mice (Figure 1C). Thus, selective upregulation of ST3 might partially compensate for the loss of NL2 in promoting GABAergic synapse development in NL2−/− mice. We next examined the temporal expression profiles of NL2 and ST3 in the mouse hippocampus. Although NL2 was abundantly expressed in perinatal hippocampi, ST3 expression was relatively low until after 1 week after birth (Figure 1D). Similarly, although NL2 puncta were readily detected in immature hippocampal cultures at 8 days in vitro (DIV8), ST3 puncta were much less abundant, so the majority of NL2 puncta did not contain ST3 at the early developmental stage (Figure 1E). However, as neurons matured, ST3 puncta strongly increased, and most ST3 immunolabeling co-localized with NL2 in DIV18 cultures (Figure 1E). These data show distinct expression profiles of NL2 and ST3 during development, suggesting that these two molecules play differential roles in GABAergic synapse development. To further interrogate the functions of NL2 and ST3 in GABAergic synapse development, we performed single-cell shRNA-mediated knockdown of NL2 or ST3 in DIV2 hippocampal cultures and conducted electrophysiological and cell biological analyses of GABAergic synapses at DIV8. In agreement with the data collected in vivo (Figure 1A), and consistent with the expression profile of NL2 and ST3 (Figure 1D), we found that NL2 knockdown in DIV2 neurons caused more than ∼95% decrease in mIPSC frequency and a strong reduction in mIPSC amplitude (Figure 2A). This functional deficit was accompanied by severe reductions in immunolabeling for vGAT (vesicular GABA transporter) and gephyrin in NL2 shRNA-transfected neurons (Figure 2B), consistent with a strong reduction in GABAergic synapse density. In contrast, ST3 knockdown, induced by an ST3 shRNA (Takahashi et al., 2012Takahashi H. Katayama K. Sohya K. Miyamoto H. Prasad T. Matsumoto Y. Ota M. Yasuda H. Tsumoto T. Aruga J. Craig A.M. Selective control of inhibitory synapse development by Slitrk3-PTPdelta trans-synaptic interaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15 (S1–S2): 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), in neurons at the same developmental stage did not affect either mIPSCs or vGAT/gephyrin punctum density (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S1B). In addition, knockdown of both NL2 and ST3 in DIV2 neurons yielded similar deficits of GABAergic synapses as NL2 knockdown alone (Figures 2A and 2B). These data indicate that NL2 is the dominant synaptic CAM responsible for the establishment of GABAergic transmission in developing hippocampal neurons. ST3, conversely, is expressed at relatively low levels early in development and, thus, minimally contributes to the initial formation of GABAergic synapses. To further understand the role of NL2 in GABAergic synapse development in immature neurons, we employed a molecular replacement approach. In this approach, the NL2 and ST3 double-knockdown construct simultaneously expressed shRNA-resistant NL2, ST3, or their mutants (Figures 2C and 2D; Figures S3A–S3E). We found that, although knockdown of both NL2 and ST3 at DIV2 essentially eliminated mIPSCs measured at DIV8, co-expression of shRNA-resistant NL2 with the double-knockdown plasmid fully rescued mIPSC deficits (Figures 2A and 2C). In contrast, very little rescue occurred with NL2 ΔCT, a mutant lacking the C terminus (C-tail), suggesting a critical role for the NL2 C-tail (Figure 2C). In addition, an NL2 mutant (NL2/1 [2N + 1C]), in which the NL2 C-tail was replaced by the same domain from NL1 that is enriched at excitatory synapses, was not able to rescue mIPSC deficits (Figure 2C). Interestingly, although ST3 knockdown on its own did not affect mIPSCs in DIV8 neurons, co-expression of shRNA-resistant ST3 with the double-knockdown vector could rescue mIPSC deficits (Figure 2C), suggesting that expressed ST3 is sufficient to drive GABAergic synapse development, even in the absence of NL2. The rescue of mIPSC deficits by ST3 also depended on its C-tail because neither ST3 ΔCT, which lacked the entire C-tail, nor ST3/5 (3N + 5C), in which the ST3 C-tail was swapped with the same domain from Slitrk5 (ST5) that regulates excitatory synapse development (Yim et al., 2013Yim Y.S. Kwon Y. Nam J. Yoon H.I. Lee K. Kim D.G. Kim E. Kim C.H. Ko J. Slitrks control excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation with LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), could rescue mIPSC deficits in double-knockdown neurons (Figure 2C). Finally, we made two mutants in which the C-tails of NL2 and ST3 were swapped with each other. Co-expression of either of these two mutants with the double-knockdown vector did not rescue mIPSC deficits (Figure 2C). Further investigation revealed that an NL2 mutant (NL2 820Δ) lacking the last 17 residues after the proline-rich region (PRR), including the PDZ domain binding motif, was sufficient to restore mIPSC deficits in double-knockdown neurons (Figure 2D), indicating that this region is not critical for NL2 function in GABAergic synapse development. In contrast, an NL2 C-tail mutant lacking the gephyrin binding domain (GBD) (Poulopoulos et al., 2009Poulopoulos A. Aramuni G. Meyer G. Soykan T. Hoon M. Papadopoulos T. Zhang M. Paarmann I. Fuchs C.

Tyrosine 770 (Y770) within the GBD domain is critical for the NL2-gephyrin interaction (Giannone et al., 2013Giannone G. Mondin M. Grillo-Bosch D. Tessier B. Saint-Michel E. Czöndör K. Sainlos M.

Specifically, NL2 Y770A, but not the Y770F mutation, disrupted the binding to gephyrin. Consistently, Y770F, but not Y770A, rescued mIPSC deficits (Figure 2D), further confirming that the NL2 GBD is critical for GABAergic synapse development in immature neurons. Recently, the PRR in the NL2 C-tail was shown to regulate the function of collybistin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) important for GABAergic synapse formation (Kins et al., 2000Kins S.

https://openalex.org/W2767705688,"Plant disease is a major challenge to agriculture worldwide, and it is exacerbated by abiotic environmental factors. During some plant-pathogen interactions, heat stress allows pathogens to overcome host resistance, a phenomenon which could severely impact crop productivity considering the global warming trends associated with climate change. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. To better understand host plant responses during simultaneous heat and pathogen stress, we conducted a transcriptomics experiment for rice plants (cultivar IRBB61) containing Xa7, a bacterial blight disease resistance (R) gene, that were infected with Xanthomonas oryzae, the bacterial blight pathogen of rice, during high temperature stress. Xa7-mediated resistance is unusual relative to resistance mediated by other R genes in that it functions better at high temperatures. Using RNA-Seq technology, we identified 8,499 differentially expressed genes as temperature responsive in rice cultivar IRBB61 experiencing susceptible and resistant interactions across three time points. Notably, genes in the plant hormone abscisic acid biosynthesis and response pathways were up-regulated by high temperature in both mock-treated plants and plants experiencing a susceptible interaction and were suppressed by high temperature in plants exhibiting Xa7-mediated resistance. Genes responsive to salicylic acid, an important plant hormone for disease resistance, were down-regulated by high temperature during both the susceptible and resistant interactions, suggesting that enhanced Xa7-mediated resistance at high temperature is not dependent on salicylic acid signaling. A DNA sequence motif similar to known abscisic acid-responsive cis-regulatory elements was identified in the promoter region upstream of genes up-regulated in susceptible but down-regulated in resistant interactions. The results of our study suggest that the plant hormone abscisic acid is an important node for cross-talk between plant transcriptional response pathways to high temperature stress and pathogen attack. Genes in this pathway represent an important focus for future study to determine how plants evolved to deal with simultaneous abiotic and biotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2767268646,"Process-based models can be usefully employed for the assessment of field and regional-scale impact of drought on crop yields. However, in many instances, especially when they are used at the regional scale, it is necessary to identify the parameters and input variables that most influence the outputs and to assess how their influence varies when climatic and environmental conditions change. In this work, two different crop models, able to represent yield response to water, Aquacrop and SAFYE, were compared, with the aim to quantify their complexity and plasticity through Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), using Morris and EFAST (Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) techniques, for moderate to strong water limited climate scenarios. Although the rankings of the sensitivity indices was influenced by the scenarios used, the correlation among the rankings, higher for SAFYE than for Aquacrop, assessed by the top-down correlation coefficient (TDCC), revealed clear patterns. Parameters and input variables related to phenology and to water stress physiological processes were found to be the most influential for Aquacrop. For SAFYE, it was found that the water stress could be inferred indirectly from the processes regulating leaf growth, described in the original SAFY model. SAFYE has a lower complexity and plasticity than Aquacrop, making it more suitable to less data demanding regional scale applications, in case the only objective is the assessment of crop yield and no detailed information is sought on the mechanisms of the stress factors affecting its limitations."

The characteristics were recorded at presentation. Treatment was at the discretion of patients' physicians. The primary study outcome, all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes of PE-specific mortality, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding were assessed during the first month of follow-up after PE diagnosis.Overall, the women were older than the men and had significantly higher rates of immobilization. They had significantly lower rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer. Women had a higher prevalence of syncope and elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was similar between women and men (7.1% versus 6.2%; P = 0.38). Male gender was not independently significantly associated with PE-related death (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.02; 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.07; P = 0.96). Restricting the analyses to haemodynamically stable patients (n = 2,021), female gender was an independent predictor of all-cause (adjusted OR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.28; P = 0.02) and PE-specific mortality (adjusted OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.02 to 3.33; P = 0.04). Compared with men, women were 2.05 times more likely to experience a major bleed.Women and men with PE had different clinical characteristics, presentation, and outcomes. Women receiving anticoagulation have a significantly higher risk of major bleeding, suggesting the need for careful monitoring of anticoagulant intensity in women."
https://openalex.org/W2767304705,"Chitin, a polymer of β(1–4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine found in e.g. arthropods, is a valuable resource that may be used to produce chitosan and chitooligosaccharides, two compounds with considerable industrial and biomedical potential. Deacetylating enzymes may be used to tailor the properties of chitin and its derived products. Here, we describe a novel CE4 enzyme originating from a marine Arthrobacter species (ArCE4A). Crystal structures of this novel deacetylase were determined, with and without bound chitobiose [(GlcNAc)2], and refined to 2.1 Å and 1.6 Å, respectively. In-depth biochemical characterization showed that ArCE4A has broad substrate specificity, with higher activity against longer oligosaccharides. Mass spectrometry-based sequencing of reaction products generated from a fully acetylated pentamer showed that internal sugars are more prone to deacetylation than the ends. These enzyme properties are discussed in the light of the structure of the enzyme-ligand complex, which adds valuable information to our still rather limited knowledge on enzyme-substrate interactions in the CE4 family."
https://openalex.org/W2767260707,"Single-stranded oligonucleotides (ON) comprise a promising therapeutic platform that enables selective modulation of currently undruggable targets. The development of novel ON drug candidates has demonstrated excellent efficacy, but in certain cases also some safety liabilities were reported. Among them are events of thrombocytopenia, which have recently been evident in late stage trials with ON drugs. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and the risk for ON candidates causing such events cannot be sufficiently assessed pre-clinically. We investigated potential thrombocytopenia risk factors of ONs and implemented a set of in vitro assays to assess these risks. Our findings support previous observations that phosphorothioate (PS)-ONs can bind to platelet proteins such as platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and activate human platelets in vitro to various extents. We also show that these PS-ONs can bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Binding to platelet proteins and subsequent activation correlates with ON length and connected to this, the number of PS in the backbone of the molecule. Moreover, we demonstrate that locked nucleic acid (LNA) ribosyl modifications in the wings of the PS-ONs strongly suppress binding to GPVI and PF4, paralleled by markedly reduced platelet activation. In addition, we provide evidence that PS-ONs do not directly affect hematopoietic cell differentiation in culture but at higher concentrations show a pro-inflammatory potential, which might contribute to platelet activation. Overall, our data confirm that certain molecular attributes of ONs are associated with a higher risk for thrombocytopenia. We propose that applying the in vitro assays discussed here during the lead optimization phase may aid in deprioritizing ONs with a potential to induce thrombocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2767904188,"Fossil sites from Brazil have yielded specimens of spinosaurid theropods, among which the most informative include the cranial remains of Irritator, Angaturama, and Oxalaia. In this work some of their craniodental features are reinterpreted, providing new data for taxonomic and evolutionary issues concerning this particular clade of dinosaurs. The mesial-most tooth of the left maxilla of the holotype of Irritator is regarded as representing the third tooth position, which is also preserved in the holotype of Angaturama. Thus, both specimens cannot belong to the same individual, contrary to previous assumptions, although they could have been the same taxon. In addition, the position of the external nares of Irritator is more comparable to those of Baryonyx and Suchomimus instead of other spinosaurine spinosaurids. In fact, with regards to some craniodental features, Brazilian taxa represent intermediate conditions between Baryonychinae and Spinosaurinae. Such a scenario is corroborated by our cladistic results, which also leave open the possibility of the former subfamily being non-monophyletic. Furthermore, the differences between spinosaurids regarding the position and size of the external nares might be related to distinct feeding habits and degrees of reliance on olfaction. Other issues concerning the evolution and taxonomy of Spinosauridae require descriptions of additional material for their clarification."
https://openalex.org/W2767478843,"Background Preeclampsia has become the world’s major maternal health problem putting a huge burden on mothers, newborns and also on the health systems. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia seems to include events in very early pregnancy affecting differentiation of placental villous trophoblast. The arising changes of the cell death spectrum from apoptosis via increased autophagy and aponecrosis to necrosis in turn induce systemic inflammation of the mother. Methods Placental tissue samples and maternal serum samples from 40 pregnant women were collected from normal pregnancy, IUGR, early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia. Immunohistochemistry for LC3B and Beclin-1 was quantified using systematic random sampling techniques. Serum levels of LDH and other markers were assessed in serum. Results Expression of the autophagy markers LC3B and Beclin-1 was significantly different between groups as was the LC3B/Beclin-1 ratio. Early-onset preeclampsia and IUGR had the highest autophagy protein expression levels, while normal pregnancy and late-onset preeclampsia had the highest LC3B/Beclin-1 ratio. Early-onset preeclampsia had the highest negative correlation with free LDH as cell defect marker. Conclusions Autophagy plays a critical role in the cell death spectrum and cellular survival capacity of villous trophoblast. Alterations in autophagic protein expression are involved in pathological pregnancies such as preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2767551651,"Purpose We examined openly shared substance-related tweets to estimate prevalent sentiment around substance use and identify popular substance use activities. Additionally, we investigated associations between substance-related tweets and business characteristics and demographics at the zip code level. Methods A total of 79,848,992 tweets were collected from 48 states in the continental United States from April 2015-March 2016 through the Twitter API, of which 688,757 were identified as being related to substance use. We implemented a machine learning algorithm (maximum entropy text classifier) to estimate sentiment score for each tweet. Zip code level summaries of substance use tweets were created and merged with the 2013 Zip Code Business Patterns and 2010 US Census Data. Results Quality control analyses with a random subset of tweets yielded excellent agreement rates between computer generated and manually generated labels: 97%, 88%, 86%, 75% for underage engagement in substance use, alcohol, drug, and smoking tweets, respectively. Overall, 34.1% of all substance-related tweets were classified as happy. Alcohol was the most frequently tweeted substance, followed by marijuana. Regression results suggested more convenience stores in a zip code were associated with higher percentages of tweets about alcohol. Larger zip code population size and higher percentages of African Americans and Hispanics were associated with fewer tweets about substance use and underage engagement. Zip code economic disadvantage was associated with fewer alcohol tweets but more drug tweets. Conclusions The patterns in substance use mentions on Twitter differ by zip code economic and demographic characteristics. Online discussions have great potential to glorify and normalize risky behaviors. Health promotion and underage substance prevention efforts may include interactive social media campaigns to counter the social modeling of risky behaviors."

In this study, we sought to determine if Apoptosis Signal-Regulated Kinase 1 (ASK1), an upstream regulator of cellular stress response, mediates cardiac hypertrophy and cardiorenal fibrosis induced by indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) in vitro, and whether ASK1 inhibition is beneficial to ameliorate these cellular effects. PCS augmented cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast collagen synthesis (as determined by 3H-leucine and 3H-proline incorporation, respectively), similar to our previous finding with IS. IS and PCS also increased collagen synthesis of proximal tubular cells and renal mesangial cells. Pro-hypertrophic (α-skeletal muscle actin and β-MHC) and pro-fibrotic genes (TGF-β1 and ctgf) were induced by both IS and PCS. Western blot analyses revealed the activation of ASK1 and downstream mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (p38MAPK and ERK1/2) as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) by IS and PCS. ASK1, OAT1/3, ERK1/2 and p38MAPK inhibitors suppressed all these effects. In summary, IS and PCS exhibit pro-hypertrophic and pro-fibrotic properties, at least in part, via the activation of ASK1 and its downstream pathways. ASK1 inhibitor is an effective therapeutic agent to alleviate protein-bound uremic toxin-induced cardiac hypertrophy and cardiorenal fibrosis in vitro, and may be translated further for cardiorenal syndrome therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2768013131,"In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasias (NENs), intratherapeutic dosimetry is mandatory for organs at risk (e.g. kidneys) and tumours. We evaluated commercial dosimetry software (Dosimetry Toolkit) using varying imaging scenarios, based on planar and/or tomographic data, regarding the differences in calculated organ/tumour doses and the use for clinical routines. A total of 16 consecutive patients with NENs treated by PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE were retrospectively analysed. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/low-dose computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen and whole body (WB) scintigraphy were acquired up to 7 days p.i. (at a maximum of five imaging time points). Different dosimetric scenarios were evaluated: (1) a multi-SPECT-CT scenario using SPECT/CT only; (2) a planar scenario using WB scintigraphy only; and (3) a hybrid scenario using WB scintigraphy in combination with a single SPECT/low-dose CT. Absorbed doses for the kidneys, liver, spleen, lungs, bladder wall and tumours were calculated and compared for the three different scenarios. The mean absorbed dose for the kidneys estimated by the multi-SPECT-CT, the planar and the hybrid scenario was 0.5 ± 0.2 Sv GBq-1, 0.8 ± 0.4 Sv GBq-1 and 0.6 ± 0.3 Sv GBq-1, respectively. The absorbed dose for the residual organs was estimated higher by the planar scenario compared to the multi-SPECT-CT or hybrid scenario. The mean absorbed tumour doses were 2.6 ± 1.5 Gy GBq-1 for the multi-SPECT-CT, 3.1 ± 2.2 Gy GBq-1 for the hybrid scenario and 5.3 ± 6.3 Gy GBq-1 for the planar scenario. SPECT-based dosimetry methods determined significantly lower kidney doses than the WB scintigraphy-based method. Dosimetry based completely on SPECT data is time-consuming and tedious. Approaches combining SPECT/CT and WB scintigraphy have the potential to ensure compromise between accuracy and user-friendliness."
https://openalex.org/W2766868115,"Retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) have the remarkable ability to encode motion over a wide range of contrasts, relying on well-coordinated excitation and inhibition (E/I). E/I is orchestrated by a diverse set of glutamatergic bipolar cells that drive DSGCs directly, as well as indirectly through feedforward GABAergic/cholinergic signals mediated by starburst amacrine cells. Determining how direction-selective responses are generated across varied stimulus conditions requires understanding how glutamate, acetylcholine, and GABA signals are precisely coordinated. Here, we use a combination of paired patch-clamp recordings, serial EM, and large-scale multi-electrode array recordings to show that a single high-sensitivity source of glutamate is processed differentially by starbursts via AMPA receptors and DSGCs via NMDA receptors. We further demonstrate how this novel synaptic arrangement enables DSGCs to encode direction robustly near threshold contrasts. Together, these results reveal a space-efficient synaptic circuit model for direction computations, in which “silent” NMDA receptors play critical roles."

We quantify the association between early administration of tranexamic acid compared to late or no administration and severe acute maternal morbidity and blood loss among women suffering from persistent severe postpartum hemorrhage in a high-income country.We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study in 61 hospitals in the Netherlands. The study population consisted of 1260 women with persistent postpartum hemorrhage who had received at least four units of red cells, or fresh frozen plasma or platelets in addition to red cells. A review of medical records was performed and cross-referenced with blood bank data. The composite endpoint comprised maternal morbidity (hysterectomy, ligation of the uterine arteries, emergency B-Lynch suture, arterial embolization or admission into an intensive care unit) and mortality.247 women received early tranexamic acid treatment. After adjustment for confounding, odds ratio for the composite endpoint for early tranexamic acid (n = 247) versus no/late tranexamic acid (n = 984) was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.27). Propensity matched analysis confirmed the absence of a difference between women with and without tranexamic acid. Blood loss after administration of first line therapy did not differ significantly between the two groups (adjusted difference -177 mL, CI -509.4 to +155.0).Our findings suggest that in a high-resource country the effect of tranexamic acid on both blood loss and the combined endpoint of maternal mortality and morbidity may be disappointing."
https://openalex.org/W2767403660,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent cause of lung infections, particularly in chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. However, treatment is challenging due to P. aeruginosa evasion of the host immune system and the rise of antibiotic resistant strains. Host defense peptides (HDPs) and synthetic derivatives called innate defense regulators (IDRs) have shown promise in several infection models as an alternative to antibiotic treatment. Here we tested peptide IDR-1002 against P. aeruginosa in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages with IDR-1002 or in combination with live P. aeruginosa or its LPS led to the reduction of agonist-induced cytokines and chemokines and limited cell killing by live P. aeruginosa. In an in vivo model using P. aeruginosa combined with alginate to mimic a chronic model, IDR-1002 did not reduce the bacterial burden in the lungs, but IDR-1002 mice showed a significant decrease in IL-6 in the lungs and in gross pathology of infection, while histology revealed that IDR-1002 treated mice had reduced alveolar macrophage infiltration around the site of infection and reduced inflammation. Overall, these results indicate that IDR-1002 has promise for combating P. aeruginosa lung infections and their resulting inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2767442953,"The core principles of the evolutionary theories of emotions declare that affective states represent crucial drives for action selection in the environment and regulated the behavior and adaptation of natural agents in ancestrally recurrent situations. While many different studies used autonomous artificial agents to simulate emotional responses and the way these patterns can affect decision-making, few are the approaches that tried to analyze the evolutionary emergence of affective behaviors directly from the specific adaptive problems posed by the ancestral environment. A model of the evolution of affective behaviors is presented using simulated artificial agents equipped with neural networks and physically inspired on the architecture of the iCub humanoid robot. We use genetic algorithms to train populations of virtual robots across generations, and investigate the spontaneous emergence of basic emotional behaviors in different experimental conditions. In particular, we focus on studying the emotion of fear, therefore the environment explored by the artificial agents can contain stimuli that are safe or dangerous to pick. The simulated task is based on classical conditioning and the agents are asked to learn a strategy to recognize whether the environment is safe or represents a threat to their lives and select the correct action to perform in absence of any visual cues. The simulated agents have special input units in their neural structure whose activation keep track of their actual “sensations” based on the outcome of past behavior. We train five different neural network architectures and then test the best ranked individuals comparing their performances and analyzing the unit activations in each individual’s life cycle. We show that the agents, regardless of the presence of recurrent connections, spontaneously evolved the ability to cope with potentially dangerous environment by collecting information about the environment and then switching their behavior to a genetically selected pattern in order to maximize the possible reward. We also prove the determinant presence of an internal time perception unit for the robots to achieve the highest performance and survivability across all conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2767595791,"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is characterized by an “old” encapsulated collection of blood and blood breakdown products between the brain and its outermost covering (the dura). Recognized risk factors for development of CSDH are head injury, old age and using anticoagulation medication, but its underlying pathophysiological processes are still unclear. It is assumed that a complex local process of interrelated mechanisms including inflammation, neomembrane formation, angiogenesis and fibrinolysis could be related to its development and propagation. However, the association between the biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis, and the clinical and radiological characteristics of CSDH patients, need further investigation. The high number of biomarkers compared to the number of observations, the correlation between biomarkers, missing data and skewed distributions may limit the usefulness of classical statistical methods. We therefore explored lasso regression to assess the association between 30 biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis at the site of lesions, and selected clinical and radiological characteristics in a cohort of 93 patients. Lasso regression performs both variable selection and regularization to improve the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model. The results from the lasso regression showed analysis exhibited lack of robust statistical association between the biomarkers in hematoma fluid with age, gender, brain infarct, neurological deficiencies and volume of hematoma. However, there were associations between several of the biomarkers with postoperative recurrence requiring reoperation. The statistical analysis with lasso regression supported previous findings that the immunological characteristics of CSDH are local. The relationship between biomarkers, the radiological appearance of lesions and recurrence requiring reoperation have been inclusive using classical statistical methods on these data, but lasso regression revealed an association with inflammatory and angiogenic biomarkers in hematoma fluid. We thus suggest that lasso regression should be a recommended statistical method in research on biological processes in CSDH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2767834836,"To characterize the incidence and risk factors for monochorionic diamniotic(MC-DA) twinning after assisted reproductive technologies (ART).Retrospective population-based study.The study was conducted in China; Department of Reproductive Medicine Center at The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University.A cohort of 8860 clinical pregnancies after embryo transfer (ET) carried out in our center between 2011 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed for the incidence of MC-DA twinning.Logistic regression was used to model the effect on the incidence of MC-DA twinning after ART. Different clinical data (maternal age) and laboratory procedures (type of ET (fresh versus frozen), insemination (IVF or ICSI)), embryo stage at time of ET (cleavage or blastocyst)) on the incidence of MC-DA twinning were evaluated.Monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies were identified when more than one fetal poles was visualized in one gestational sac via trans-vaginal ultrasound at early first-trimester (7 to 8 weeks).The overall MC-DA twinning rate was 2.55% (226/8860). Eighty one MC-DA twinnings occurred in the fresh cycles and 145 in the frozen cycles (2.67% vs. 2.49%). MC-DA twinning incidence showed no significant difference whether ICSI was performed or not (2.79% vs. 2.44%). The MZT that resulted from single embryo transfer (SET) cycles (1.99%) was slightly lower than multiple embryo transfer cycles (2.61%),but with non-significance. However, women <35 years displayed a significant higher rate (2.81%) than women ≥35 years old (1.16%). Blastocyst transfer was associated with a significantly increase in MC-DA twinning incidence than cleavage-stage embryos transfer (2.79% VS 2.02%, P = 0.008). In the results of logistic regression analysis, blastocyst transfer is a major risk factor of MZT in the fresh cycles (P = 0.044), while maternal age plays a more important role in the frozen cycles (P = 0.004).There is an elevated prevalence of MC-DA twinning after ART. Both maternal age and blastocyst transfer are risk factors of monozygotic pregnancy independently. Blastocyst transfer is a major risk factor of MC-DA twinning in the fresh cycles, while maternal age plays a more important role in the frozen cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2767448069,"OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 mediate hepatic uptake of many drugs (e.g., statins) and can mediate transporter-mediated drug-drug-interactions (DDIs). Bortezomib is the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The potential of bortezomib to cause OATP-mediated DDIs has not been assessed. The current study investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 degradation and determined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-OATP1B1/1B3 and HA-ubiquitin was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged OATP1B1/OATP1B3 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin, suggesting that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 can be ubiquitin-modified. Although blocking proteasome activity by bortezomib treatment (50 nM, 7 h) increased the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP1B1 and FLAG-OATP1B3 in HEK293-FLAG-OATP1B1 and–OATP1B3 cells, such treatment did not affect the total protein levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, suggesting that the UPS plays a minor role in degradation of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 under current constitutive conditions. Pretreatment with bortezomib (50–250 nM, 2–7 h) significantly decreased transport of [3H]CCK-8, a specific OATP1B3 substrate, in HEK293-OATP1B3 and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). However, bortezomib pretreatment had negligible effects on the transport of [3H]E217βG and [3H]pitavastatin, dual substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in HEK293-OATP1B1/1B3 cells and/or human SCH. Compared with vehicle control treatment, bortezomib pretreatment significantly decreased the maximal transport velocity (Vmax) of OATP1B3-mediated transport of CCK-8 (92.25 ± 14.2 vs. 133.95 ± 15.5 pmol/mg protein/min) without affecting the affinity constant (Km) values. Treatment with other proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin, and carfilzomib also significantly decreased OATP1B3-mediated [3H]CCK-8 transport. In summary, the current studies for the first time report ubiquitination of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and the apparent substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of bortezomib on OATP1B3-mediated transport. The data suggest that bortezomib has a low risk of causing OATP-mediated DDIs."
https://openalex.org/W2265753182,"Geometric approaches to network analysis combine simply defined models with great descriptive power. In this work we provide a method for embedding directed acyclic graphs (DAG) into Minkowski spacetime using Multidimensional scaling (MDS). First we generalise the classical MDS algorithm, defined only for metrics with a Riemannian signature, to manifolds of any metric signature. We then use this general method to develop an algorithm which exploits the causal structure of a DAG to assign space and time coordinates in a Minkowski spacetime to each vertex. As in the causal set approach to quantum gravity, causal connections in the discrete graph correspond to timelike separation in the continuous spacetime. The method is demonstrated by calculating embeddings for simple models of causal sets and random DAGs, as well as real citation networks. We find that the citation networks we test yield significantly more accurate embeddings that random DAGs of the same size. Finally we suggest a number of applications in citation analysis such as paper recommendation, identifying missing citations and fitting citation models to data using this geometric approach."
https://openalex.org/W2767877580,"Background The vast majority of research on mental health has been undertaken in high income countries. This study aimed at investigating the long-term course of maternal depressive symptoms and its association with various mother- and child-related characteristics in two West African lower middle income countries with focus on the relationship with long-term anxiety symptoms. Methods In the Child Development Study, a prospective birth cohort study in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was answered by N = 776 women 3 months antepartum, and 3, 12, and 24 months postpartum between April 2010 and March 2014. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms. Several psychosocial, obstetric, and sociodemographic characteristics were assessed and multinomial regression analysis was performed to investigate the influence of these variables on the different depression trajectories. Results We found three distinct classes of depressive symptoms that were characterized by an asymptomatic trajectory (91.5%), by recurrent risk (4.3%) and by postnatal risk (4.3%). The longitudinal course of depressive symptoms was strongly associated with anxiety symptoms (χ2 = 258.54, df = 6, p < 0.001; φ = .577). Among other factors, higher levels of anxiety, new pregnancy 2 years after birth, economic stress, and family stress were associated with the risk classes. Conclusions A substantial proportion of West African women in our sample developed unfavorable patterns of depressive symptoms during the vulnerable phase of pregnancy and early motherhood. Psychosocial factors, especially antepartum anxiety symptoms, played a decisive role in this process. Perceived economic hardship further exaggerated the mental health burden."
https://openalex.org/W2767441581,"Root rots are a constraint for staple food crops and a long-lasting food security problem worldwide. In common beans, yield losses originating from root damage are frequently attributed to dry root rot, a disease caused by the Fusarium solani species complex. The aim of this study was to model the current potential distribution of common bean dry root rot on a global scale and to project changes based on future expectations of climate change. Our approach used a spatial proxy of the field disease occurrence, instead of solely the pathogen distribution. We modeled the pathogen environmental requirements in locations where in-situ inoculum density seems ideal for disease manifestation. A dataset of 2,311 soil samples from commercial farms assessed from 2002 to 2015 allowed us to evaluate the environmental conditions associated with the pathogen's optimum inoculum density for disease occurrence, using a lower threshold as a spatial proxy. We encompassed not only the optimal conditions for disease occurrence but also the optimal pathogen's density required for host infection. An intermediate inoculum density of the pathogen was the best disease proxy, suggesting density-dependent mechanisms on host infection. We found a strong convergence on the environmental requirements of both the host and the disease development in tropical areas, mostly in Brazil, Central America, and African countries. Precipitation and temperature variables were important for explaining the disease occurrence (from 17.63% to 43.84%). Climate change will probably move the disease toward cooler regions, which in Brazil are more representative of small-scale farming, although an overall shrink in total area (from 48% to 49% in 2050 and 26% to 41% in 2070) was also predicted. Understanding pathogen distribution and disease risks in an evolutionary context will therefore support breeding for resistance programs and strategies for dry root rot management in common beans."
https://openalex.org/W2767420540,"We have developed a drug delivery nanosystem based on chitosan and capsaicin. Both substances have a wide range of biological activities. We investigated the nanosystem’s influence on migration and morphology of Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK-C7) epithelial cells in comparison to the capsaicin-free nanoformulation, free capsaicin, and control cells. For minimally-invasive quantification of cell migration, we applied label-free digital holographic microscopy (DHM) and single-cell tracking. Moreover, quantitative DHM phase images were used as novel stain-free assay to quantify the temporal course of global cellular morphology changes in confluent cell layers. Cytoskeleton alterations and tight junction protein redistributions were complementary analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Calcium influx measurements were conducted to characterize the influence of the nanoformulations and capsaicin on ion channel activities. We found that both, capsaicin-loaded and unloaded chitosan nanocapsules, and also free capsaicin, have a significant impact on directed cell migration and cellular motility. Increase of velocity and directionality of cell migration correlates with changes in the cell layer surface roughness, tight junction integrity and cytoskeleton alterations. Calcium influx into cells occurred only after nanoformulation treatment but not upon addition of free capsaicin. Our results pave the way for further studies on the biological significance of these findings and potential biomedical applications, e.g. as drug and gene carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2767447057,"Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are important determinants of neurodegeneration in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). We previously showed that febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, ameliorated both relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by preventing neurodegeneration in mice. In this study, we investigated how febuxostat protects neuron in secondary progressive EAE. A DNA microarray analysis revealed that febuxostat treatment increased the CNS expression of several mitochondria-related genes in EAE mice, most notably including GOT2, which encodes glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2). GOT2 is a mitochondrial enzyme that oxidizes glutamate to produce α-ketoglutarate for the Krebs cycle, eventually leading to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Whereas GOT2 expression was decreased in the spinal cord during the chronic progressive phase of EAE, febuxostat-treated EAE mice showed increased GOT2 expression. Moreover, febuxostat treatment of Neuro2a cells in vitro ameliorated ATP exhaustion induced by rotenone application. The ability of febuxostat to preserve ATP production in the presence of rotenone was significantly reduced by GOT2 siRNA. GOT2-mediated ATP synthesis may be a pivotal mechanism underlying the protective effect of febuxostat against neurodegeneration in EAE. Accordingly, febuxostat may also have clinical utility as a disease-modifying drug in SPMS."
https://openalex.org/W2767885461,"The regulatory networks governing morphogenesis of a pleomorphic fungus, Candida albicans are extremely complex and remain to be completely elucidated. This study investigated the function of C. albicans yeast casein kinase 2 (CaYck2p). The yck2Δ/yck2Δ strain displayed constitutive pseudohyphae in both yeast and hyphal growth conditions, and formed enhanced biofilm under non-biofilm inducing condition. This finding was further supported by gene expression analysis of the yck2Δ/yck2Δ strain which showed significant upregulation of UME6, a key transcriptional regulator of hyphal transition and biofilm formation, and cell wall protein genes ALS3, HWP1, and SUN41, all of which are associated with morphogenesis and biofilm architecture. The yck2Δ/yck2Δ strain was hypersensitive to cell wall damaging agents and had increased compensatory chitin deposition in the cell wall accompanied by an upregulation of the expression of the chitin synthase genes, CHS2, CHS3, and CHS8. Absence of CaYck2p also affected fungal-host interaction; the yck2Δ/yck2Δ strain had significantly reduced ability to damage host cells. However, the yck2Δ/yck2Δ strain had wild-type susceptibility to cyclosporine and FK506, suggesting that CaYck2p functions independently from the Ca+/calcineurin pathway. Thus, in C. albicans, Yck2p is a multifunctional kinase that governs morphogenesis, biofilm formation, cell wall integrity, and host cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2768086043,"Motivation Cortical bone is an important contributor to bone strength and is pivotal to understand the etiology of osteoporotic fractures and the specific mechanisms of antiosteoporotic treatment regimen. 3D computed tomography (CT) can be used to measure cortical thickness, density, and mass in the proximal femur, lumbar vertebrae, and distal forearm. However, the spatial resolution of clinical whole body CT scanners is limited by radiation exposure; partial volume artefacts severely impair the accurate assessment of cortical parameters, in particular in locations where the cortex is thin such as in the lumbar vertebral bodies or in the femoral neck. Method Model-based deconvolution approaches recover the cortical thickness by numerically deconvolving the image along 1D profiles using an estimated scanner point spread function (PSF) and a hypothesized uniform cortical bone mineral density (reference density). In this work we provide a new essentially analytical unique solution to the model-based cortex recovery problem using few characteristics of the measured profile and thus eliminate the non-linear optimization step for deconvolution. Also, the proposed approach allows to get rid of the PSF in the model and reduces sensitivity to errors in the reference density. Additionally, run-time and memory effective computation of cortical thickness was achieved with the help of a lookup table. Results The method accuracy and robustness was validated and compared to that of a deconvolution approach recently proposed for cortical bone and of the 50% relative threshold technique: in a simulated environment with noise and various error levels in the reference density and using CT acquisitions of the European Forearm Phantom (EFP II), a modification of a widely used anthropomorphic standard of cortical and trabecular bone compartments that was scanned with various scan protocols. Conclusion Results of simulations and of phantom data analysis verified the following properties of the new method: 1) Robustness against errors in the reference density. 2) Excellent accuracy on ground truth data with various noise levels. 3) Very fast computation using a lookup table."
https://openalex.org/W2767412367,"Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) enhance the survival of organisms inhabiting cold environments by affecting the formation and/or structure of ice. We report the crystal structure of the first multi-domain AFP that has been characterized. The two ice binding domains are structurally similar. Each consists of an irregular β-helix with a triangular cross-section and a long α-helix that runs parallel on one side of the β-helix. Both domains are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. A flat plane on the same face of each domain’s β-helix was identified as the ice binding site. Mutating any of the smaller residues on the ice binding site to bulkier ones decreased the antifreeze activity. The bulky side chain of Leu174 in domain A sterically hinders the binding of water molecules to the protein backbone, partially explaining why antifreeze activity by domain A is inferior to that of domain B. Our data provide a molecular basis for understanding differences in antifreeze activity between the two domains of this protein and general insight on how structural differences in the ice-binding sites affect the activity of AFPs."
https://openalex.org/W2767225572,"Background Helicobacter pylori BabA is an important outer membrane protein that involves in the attachment to the gastric mucosa and enhances the virulence property of the bacterium. This study was aimed to characterize the bab genotypes, to evaluate its association with cagA, vacA and clinical diseases as well as degree of gastric inflammation. Methods H. pylori isolates from four countries were subjected for the characterization of bab. The locus specific forward and bab specific reverse primers were used to get the specific products by PCR, which could distinguish the three locus (A, B and C). The histological activities were evaluated according to the Updated Sydney system. Result In patients from high risk countries (Bhutan and Myanmar) relatively higher frequencies of strains with babA-positivity (91.8% and 90.7%, respectively), babA at locus A (98% and 91.2%, respectively) and with single babA (96.8% and 91.2%, respectively) were found. Strains with two loci occupied were the most prevalent in Bhutan (84.6%), Myanmar (74.7%), Nepal (58.3%) and Bangladesh (56.9%). The genotype babA at locus A/babB at locus B/bab-negative at locus C (babA/babB/-) was the most common genotype isolated from Bhutan (82.7%), Myanmar (58.7%), Nepal (32%) and Bangladesh (31.4%) among all genotypes assessed. This genotype was also associated with the peptic ulcer disease (P = 0.013) when compared to gastritis. babA-positive characteristics and the genotype babA/babB/- exhibited the enhanced histological activities. Conclusions The higher prevalence of virulence associated babA-positive characteristics and enhanced histological activities in Bhutan than in Myanmar, Nepal and Bangladesh might partly explain why the peoples in Bhutan are at higher risk for developing severe gastric complications."
https://openalex.org/W2767563282,"This study investigated sleep quality and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among long-term survivors of Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The aim was to explore the impact of personal and health-related factors on sleep quality as well as associations between sleep quality and HRQOL. For the postal survey, participants with a minimum age of 18 years initially treated between 1998 and 2008 were recruited via the population-based cancer registry in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Questionnaires included amongst others the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v1). Descriptive and comparative statistics were performed. Additionally, a regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of sleep quality. In total, we recruited 515 participants (398 NHL, 117 HL) with a mean age of 63.1 years. Approximately half of the survivors were classified as good sleepers. HRQOL scores differed between good and poor sleepers with lower scores in poor sleepers. In a prediction model, self-reported depression, exhaustion, higher age, inability to work, endocrinological disorders and female gender classified as predictors of sleep quality. This study highlights the impact of sleep quality on HRQOL in long-term survivors of NHL and HL. Thus, sleep quality should be routinely assessed during follow-up of cancer survivors with special attention to patients with potential risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2767995561,"Health risks associated with poor sanitation behaviours continue to be reported mostly from low-income countries (LICs). Reports show that various factors limit many people from accessing and using improved latrines, forcing some to opt for sharing latrines with neighbours, others practicing open defecation. Meanwhile, debate prevails on whether shared latrines should be categorised as unimproved according to WHO/UNICEF-JMP criteria. We contribute to this debate based on results from a study undertaken in three regions, Tanzania.Data were collected through observations in 1,751 households with latrines, coupled with collection of opinions from heads of such households regarding the latrine-sharing practices. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between the outcome and possible predictor variables.Of all 1,751 latrines, 14.6% were shared. Among the shared latrines, 74.2% were found being generally clean as compared to 69.2% of the non-shared ones. Comparing the shared and non-shared latrines, the non-shared latrines were significantly less likely to be found with floors built with permanent materials (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.98); washable floors (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.93); and lockable doors (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.95). Shared latrines were less likely to have floors with faecal matter, functional handwashing facilities (HWFs), HWFs with running water, and roofs; albeit the differences in all these scenarios were not statistically significant. Respondents expressed desire for improved latrines, but also did not find it wrong to share latrines if cleanliness was maintained.Having an 'improved' latrine remains important as JMP recommends, but based on our study findings, we argue that possessing a non-shared latrine neither guarantees safety to its users nor its categorisation as 'improved'. Instead, the state of the latrine, the construction technology used and the behaviours of the users may be more important."

ECG, beat-by-beat blood pressure, respiratory activity were continuously recorded during rest (10') and 75-degrees-head-up tilt (10'). C1-INH, C4, cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (cHK) were assessed; in 16 patients and 11 controls plasma catecholamines were also evaluated. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability allowed extraction of low-(LF) and high-(HF) frequency components, markers of sympathetic and vagal modulation respectively.HAE patients showed higher mean systolic arterial pressure (SAP) than controls during both rest and tilt. Tilt induced a significant increase in SAP and its variability only in controls. Although sympathetic modulation (LFnu) increased significantly with tilt in both groups, LF/HF ratio, index of sympathovagal balance, increased significantly only in controls. At rest HAE patients showed higher noradrenaline values (301.4±132.9 pg/ml vs 210.5±89.6pg/ml, p = 0.05). Moreover, in patients tilt was associated with a significant increase in cHK, marker of contact system activation (49.5 ± 7.5% after T vs 47.1 ± 7.8% at R, p = 0.01).Our data are consistent with altered ANS modulation in HAE patients, i.e. increased sympathetic activation at rest and blunted response to orthostatic challenge. Tilt test-induced increased HK cleavage suggests a link between stress and bradykinin production."
https://openalex.org/W2768007220,"The possibility to control the rate of sexual stimulation that the female rat receives during a mating encounter (pacing) increases the number of newborn neurons that reach the granular layer of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). If females mate repeatedly, the increase in the number of neurons is observed in other regions of the AOB and in the main olfactory bulb (MOB). It has also been shown that paced mating induces a reward state mediated by opioids. There is also evidence that opioids modulate neurogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated whether the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (NX) could reduce the increase in neurogenesis in the AOB induced by paced mating. Ovariectomized female rats were randomly divided in 5 different groups: 1) Control (not mated) treated with saline, 2) control (not mated) treated with naloxone, 3) females that mated without controlling the sexual interaction (no-pacing), 4) females injected with saline before pacing the sexual interaction and 5) females injected with NX before a paced mating session. We found, as previously described, that paced mating induced a higher number of new cells in the granular layer of the AOB. The administration of NX before paced mating, blocked the increase in the number of newborn cells and prevented these cells from differentiating into neurons. These data suggest that opioid peptides play a fundamental role in the neurogenesis induced by paced mating in female rats."
https://openalex.org/W2767240320,"Background ClinicalTrials.gov is valuable for aggregate-level analysis of trials. The recently published final rule aims to improve reporting of trial results. We aimed to assess variability in ClinicalTirals.gov records reporting participants’ baseline measures. Methods and findings The September 2015 edition of the database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT), was used in this study. To date, AACT contains 186,941 trials of which 16,660 trials reporting baseline (participant) measures were analyzed. We also analyzed a subset of 13,818 Highly Likely Applicable Clinical Trials (HLACT), for which reporting of results is likely mandatory and compared a random sample of 30 trial records to their journal articles. We report counts for each mandatory baseline measure and variability reporting in their formats. The AACT dataset contains 8,161 baseline measures with 1206 unique measurement units. However, of these 6,940 (85%) variables appear only once in the dataset. Age and Gender are reported using many different formats (178 and 49 respectively). “Age” as the variable name is reported in 60 different formats. HLACT subset reports measures using 3,931 variables. The most frequent Age format (i.e. mean (years) ± sd) is found in only 45% of trials. Overall only 4 baseline measures (Region of Enrollment, Age, Number of Participants, and Gender) are reported by > 10% of trials. Discrepancies are found in both the types and formats of ClinicalTrials.gov records and their corresponding journal articles. On average, journal articles include twice the number of baseline measures (13.6±7.1 (sd) vs. 6.6±7.6) when compared to the ClinicalTrials.gov records that report any results. Conclusions We found marked variability in baseline measures reporting. This is not addressed by the final rule. To support secondary use of ClinicalTrials.gov, a uniform format for baseline measures reporting is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2767320751,"Oxidative stress has been closely linked to the progressive cell damage associated with emerging non-communicable disease (NCDs). Early detection of these biochemical abnormalities before irreversible cell damage occurs may therefore be useful in identifying disease risk at an individual level. In order to test this hypothesis, this study assessed the relationship between a simple measure of redox status and lifestyle risk factors for NCDs, and the population-based risk score of Framingham. In a cross-sectional study design, 100 apparently healthy middle-aged males (n = 48) and females (n = 52) were asked to complete a comprehensive lifestyle assessment questionnaire, followed by body fat percentage and blood pressure measurements, and blood collection. The ratio of plasma total antioxidant capacity to hydroperoxide (TAC/HPX) was used as an index of redox balance. One-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to analyse the association between TAC/HPX, lifestyle components and other plasma biomarkers. The TAC/HPX ratio was higher in males compared to females (t96 = 2.34, P = 0.021). TAC/HPX was also lower in participants with poor sleep quality (t93 = 2.39, P = 0.019), with high sleep apnoea risk (t62.2 = 3.32, P = 0.002), with high caffeine (F(2, 93) = 3.97, P = 0.022) and red meat intake (F(2, 93) = 5.55, P = 0.005). These associations were independent of gender. Furthermore, the TAC/HPX ratio decreased with increasing body fat percentage (F(2, 95) = 4.74, P = 0.011) and depression score (t94 = 2.38, P = 0.019), though these associations were dependent on gender. Importantly, a negative association was observed between TAC/HPX levels and the Framingham risk score in both males (r(45) = -0.39, P = 0.008) and females (r(50) = -0.33, P = 0.019) that was independent of other Framingham risk score components. Findings from this study suggests that a relatively simple measure of redox balance such as the TAC/HPX ratio may be a sensitive indicator of redox stress, and may therefore serve as a useful biomarker for assessing an individual's specific NCD risk linked to unhealthy lifestyle practices."
https://openalex.org/W2767637446,"Tumor vasculature is critical for tumor growth, formation of distant metastases and efficiency of radio- and chemotherapy treatments. However, how the vasculature itself is affected during cancer treatment regarding to the metastatic behavior has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of hypofractionated radiotherapy and cisplatin chemotherapy on vessel tree geometry and metastasis formation in a small cell lung cancer xenograft mouse tumor model to investigate the spread of malignant cells during different treatments modalities.The biological data gained during these experiments were fed into our previously developed computer model ""Cancer and Treatment Simulation Tool"" (CaTSiT) to model the growth of the primary tumor, its metastatic deposit and also the influence on different therapies. Furthermore, we performed quantitative histology analyses to verify our predictions in xenograft mouse tumor model.According to the computer simulation the number of cells engrafting must vary considerably to explain the different weights of the primary tumor at the end of the experiment. Once a primary tumor is established, the fractal dimension of its vasculature correlates with the tumor size. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the tumor vasculature changes during treatment, indicating that the therapy affects the blood vessels' geometry. We corroborated these findings with a quantitative histological analysis showing that the blood vessel density is depleted during radiotherapy and cisplatin chemotherapy. The CaTSiT computer model reveals that chemotherapy influences the tumor's therapeutic susceptibility and its metastatic spreading behavior.Using a system biological approach in combination with xenograft models and computer simulations revealed that the usage of chemotherapy and radiation therapy determines the spreading behavior by changing the blood vessel geometry of the primary tumor."

Because the lung has a distinct immune system against pathogens, the immune-stimulatory effect of LNA-ASOs should be considered for the development of novel inhaled LNA-ASOs therapies. However, there have been no reports on the relationship between knock-down (KD) and the immune-stimulatory effects of inhaled LNA-ASOs in the lung. In this report, LNA-ASOs targeting Scarb1 (Scarb1-ASOs) or negative control LNA-ASOs targeting ApoB (ApoB-ASOs) were intratracheally administered to mice to investigate the KD of the gene expression and the immune-stimulatory effects in the lung. We confirmed that the intratracheal administration of Scarb1-ASOs exerted a KD effect in the lung without a drug delivery system. On the other hand, both Scarb1-ASOs and ApoB-ASOs induced neutrophilic infiltration in the alveoli and increased the expression levels of G-CSF and CXCL1 in the lung. The dose required for KD was the same as the dose that induced the neutrophilic immune response. In addition, in our in vitro experiments, Scarb1-ASOs did not increase the G-CSF or CXCL1 expression in primary lung cells, even though Scarb1-ASOs exerted a strong KD effect. Hence, we hypothesize that inhaled LNA-ASOs have the potential to exert a KD effect in the lung, but that they may be associated with a risk of immune stimulation. Further studies about the mechanism underlying the immune-stimulatory effect of LNA-ASOs is necessary for the development of novel inhaled LNA-ASO therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2767306958,"Behavioral evidence has suggested that a small number of muscle synergies may be responsible for activating a variety of muscles. Nevertheless, such dimensionality reduction may also be explained using the perspective of alternative hypotheses, such as predictions based on linear combinations of joint torques multiplied by corresponding coefficients. To compare the explanatory capacity of these hypotheses for describing muscle activation, we enrolled 12 male volunteers who performed isometric plantar flexor contractions at 10–100% of maximum effort. During each plantar flexor contraction, the knee extensor muscles were isometrically contracted at 0%, 50%, or 100% of maximum effort. Electromyographic activity was recorded from the vastus lateralis, medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and soleus muscles and quantified using the average rectified value (ARV). At lower plantar flexion torque, regression analysis identified a clear linear relationship between the MG and soleus ARVs and between the MG and LG ARVs, suggesting the presence of muscle synergy (r2 > 0.65). The contraction of the knee extensor muscles induced a significant change in the slope of this relationship for both pairs of muscles (MG × soleus, P = 0.002; MG × LG, P = 0.006). Similarly, the slope of the linear relationship between the plantar flexion torque and the ARV of the MG or soleus changed significantly with knee extensor contraction (P = 0.031 and P = 0.041, respectively). These results suggest that muscle synergies characterized by non-mechanical constraints are selectively recruited according to whether contraction of the knee extensor muscles is performed simultaneously, which is relatively consistent with the muscle synergy hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2767990424,"Predicting the behavior of objects in the environment is an important requirement to overcome latencies in the sensorimotor system and realize precise actions in rapid situations. Internal forward models that were acquired during motor training might not only be used for efficiently controlling fast motor behavior but also to facilitate extrapolation performance in purely perceptual tasks. In this study, we investigated whether preceding virtual cart-pole balancing training facilitates the ability to extrapolate the virtual pole motion. Specifically, subjects had to report the expected pole orientation after an occlusion of the pole of 900ms duration. We compared a group of 10 subjects, proficient in performing the virtual cart-pole balancing task, to 10 naïve subjects without motor experience in cart-pole balancing task. Our results demonstrate that preceding motor training increases the accuracy of pole movement extrapolation, although extrapolation is not trained explicitly. Additionally, we modelled subjects' behaviors and show that the difference in extrapolation performance can be explained by individual differences in the accuracy of internal forward models. When subjects are provided with feedback about the true orientation of the pole after the occlusion in a second phase of the experiment, both groups improve rapidly. The results indicate that the perceptual capability to extrapolate the state of the cart-pole system accurately is implicitly trained during motor learning. We discuss these results in the context of shared representations and action-perception transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2767281001,"With the continuing growth of multi-media learning resources, it is important to offer methods helping learners to explore and acquire relevant learning information effectively. As services that organize multi-media learning materials together to support programming learning, the digital case-based learning system is needed. In order to create a case-oriented e-learning system, this paper concentrates on the digital case study of multi-media resources and learning processes with an integrated framework. An integration of multi-media resources, testing and learning strategies recommendation as the learning unit is proposed in the digital case-based learning framework. The learning mechanism of learning guidance, multi-media materials learning and testing feedback is supported in our project. An improved personalized genetic algorithm which incorporates preference information and usage degree into the crossover and mutation process is proposed to assemble the personalized test sheet for each learner. A learning strategies recommendation solution is proposed to recommend learning strategies for learners to help them to learn. The experiments are conducted to prove that the proposed approaches are capable of constructing personalized sheets and the effectiveness of the framework."
https://openalex.org/W2767591459,"Objectives To evaluate whether the endocervical brush (ECB) is better accepted by patients and health care providers for endocervical evaluation when compared to the endocervical curette (ECC), without a decrease in the quality of sampling. Methods Two hundred patients with cervical dysplasia were randomized at the colposcopy clinic of the University Hospital of Geneva into two groups according to technique. Patients and physicians’ preference regarding the technique as well as the quality of samples were assessed. ECB samples were analyzed using both cytological (cell block) and histologic analysis, while ECC samples were analyzed using standard histologic analysis. Results Of the 200 patients, 89 were randomized to ECC, 101 to ECB and 10 were excluded due to incomplete information or cervical stenosis. Physicians preferred ECB against ECC, classifying it more frequently as an easy technique (94.1% vs.61.4%, p<0.001). Physicians more frequently evaluated the ECB as little or not uncomfortable for patients (28.7% vs.10.2%, p<0.001), though patients themselves didn’t express a preference for either technique. From a quality standpoint, the brush allowed for a better quality of samples, with a lower rate of inadequate samples (2.0% vs 14.3%, p = 0.002) and greater amount of material. Conclusion Endocervical sampling using ECB seems to be easier to perform and provides better quality samples. ECB can therefore be an acceptable alternative to ECC in standard practice.

https://openalex.org/W2767288246,"Despite a robust capacity for adult neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory sensory losses are common. Identification of mechanisms regulating adult OE neurogenesis is, therefore, of interest. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are broadly important in regulating vertebrate neurodevelopment, and are required in embryonic olfactory differentiation. We report here that a panel of miRNAs is differentially expressed by either progenitor or progeny cells in the regenerating mouse OE. Progenitor cells were purified from lesioned OE based on c-Kit expression, and miRNA expression was assayed in c-Kit (+) and c-Kit (-) cell populations. 28 miRNAs were significantly downregulated by at least 4 fold in the c-Kit (+) fraction, which marks the globose basal progenitor cell population. In addition, 10 miRNAs were upregulated in these basal cells. MiR-486, the most strongly downregulated miRNA identified, was further characterized to verify results. MiR-486 expression was confirmed in the c-Kit (-) OE layers using in situ hybridization. As a functional assay, over-expression of miR-486 in purified c-Kit (+) basal cell cultures resulted in a reduction in neurogenesis, consistent with a possible negative feedback regulatory model. Our data provide new insights regarding miRNA expression and function during adult OE neurogenesis, and identify candidate miRNAs warranting further study."
https://openalex.org/W2767526573,"In an age when people are predisposed to report real-world events through their social media accounts, many researchers value the benefits of mining user generated content from social media. Compared with the traditional news media, social media services, such as Twitter, can provide more complete and timely information about the real-world events. However events are often like a puzzle and in order to solve the puzzle/understand the event, we must identify all the sub-events or pieces. Existing Twitter event monitoring systems for sub-event detection and summarization currently typically analyse events based on partial data as conventional data collection methodologies are unable to collect comprehensive event data. This results in existing systems often being unable to report sub-events in real-time and often in completely missing sub-events or pieces in the broader event puzzle. This paper proposes a Sub-event detection by real-TIme Microblog monitoring (STRIM) framework that leverages the temporal feature of an expanded set of news-worthy event content. In order to more comprehensively and accurately identify sub-events this framework first proposes the use of adaptive microblog crawling. Our adaptive microblog crawler is capable of increasing the coverage of events while minimizing the amount of non-relevant content. We then propose a stream division methodology that can be accomplished in real time so that the temporal features of the expanded event streams can be analysed by a burst detection algorithm. In the final steps of the framework, the content features are extracted from each divided stream and recombined to provide a final summarization of the sub-events. The proposed framework is evaluated against traditional event detection using event recall and event precision metrics. Results show that improving the quality and coverage of event contents contribute to better event detection by identifying additional valid sub-events. The novel combination of our proposed adaptive crawler and our stream division/recombination technique provides significant gains in event recall (44.44%) and event precision (9.57%). The addition of these sub-events or pieces, allows us to get closer to solving the event puzzle."
https://openalex.org/W2767270751,"The study of complex networks has become an important subject over the last decades. It has been shown that these structures have special features, such as their diameter, or their average path length, which in turn are the explanation of some functional properties in a system such as its fault tolerance, its fragility before attacks, or the ability to support routing procedures. In the present work, we study some of the forces that help a network to evolve to the point where structural properties are settled. Although our work is mainly focused on the possibility of applying our ideas to Information and Communication Technologies systems, we consider that our results may contribute to understanding different scenarios where complex networks have become an important modeling tool. Using a discrete event simulator, we get each node to discover the shortcuts that may connect it with regions away from its local environment. Based on this partial knowledge, each node can rewire some of its links, which allows modifying the topology of the entire underlying graph to achieve new structural properties. We proposed a distributed rewiring model that creates networks with features similar to those found in complex networks. Although each node acts in a distributed way and seeking to reduce only the trajectories of its packets, we observed a decrease of diameter and an increase in clustering coefficient in the global structure compared to the initial graph. Furthermore, we can find different final structures depending on slight changes in the local rewiring rules."
