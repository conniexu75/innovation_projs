https://openalex.org/W2001313012,"PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is a negative regulator of the hepatic LDL receptor, and clinical studies with PCSK9-inhibiting antibodies have demonstrated strong LDL-c-lowering effects. Here we screened phage-displayed peptide libraries and identified the 13-amino acid linear peptide Pep2-8 as the smallest PCSK9 inhibitor with a clearly defined mechanism of inhibition that has been described. Pep2-8 bound to PCSK9 with a KD of 0.7 μm but did not bind to other proprotein convertases. It fully restored LDL receptor surface levels and LDL particle uptake in PCSK9-treated HepG2 cells. The crystal structure of Pep2-8 bound to C-terminally truncated PCSK9 at 1.85 Å resolution showed that the peptide adopted a strand-turn-helix conformation, which is remarkably similar to its solution structure determined by NMR. Consistent with the functional binding site identified by an Ala scan of PCSK9, the structural Pep2-8 contact region of about 400 Å2 largely overlapped with that contacted by the EGF(A) domain of the LDL receptor, suggesting a competitive inhibition mechanism. Consistent with this, Pep2-8 inhibited LDL receptor and EGF(A) domain binding to PCSK9 with IC50 values of 0.8 and 0.4 μm, respectively. Remarkably, Pep2-8 mimicked secondary structural elements of the EGF(A) domain that interact with PCSK9, notably the β-strand and a discontinuous short α-helix, and it engaged in the same β-sheet hydrogen bonds as EGF(A) does. Although Pep2-8 itself may not be amenable to therapeutic applications, this study demonstrates the feasibility of developing peptidic inhibitors to functionally relevant sites on PCSK9.

As a result, LDL receptor recycling to the cell surface is prevented, and instead, the PCSK9·LDL receptor complex is directed to lysosomes for degradation. This “sorting” of the PCSK9·LDL receptor complex seems to be mediated by APLP2, which interacts with PCSK9 at low pH in the endosomal compartment (9DeVay R.M. Shelton D.L. Liang H.

A compound heterozygous individual with no detectable PCSK9 and extremely low LDL-c levels is healthy (12Zhao Z. Tuakli-Wosornu Y. Lagace T.A. Kinch L. Grishin N.V. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H.

Genet. 2006; 79: 514-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), suggesting that pharmacologic PCSK9 inhibition for lipid lowering might be safe. PCSK9 is an ideal antibody target because it circulates in blood and has only modest binding affinity to cell surface LDL receptor and its main interaction site is an exposed ∼500-Å2 slightly convex region that is readily available for antibody binding. Recent clinical studies with anti-PCSK9 antibodies have borne this out, demonstrating strong and sustained LDL-c lowering after a single dose injection (13Stein E.A. Swergold G.D. Potential of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 based therapeutics.Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2013; 15: 310Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Whereas the clinical development of antibody-based inhibitors has advanced rapidly, the development of small molecule inhibitors appears still to be at an early stage, probably due to the challenging nature of PCSK9 as a small molecule target. As its name implies, PCSK9 bears recognizable sequence homology to proteolytic enzymes of the subtilisin family. The molecular structure of PCSK9 determined using x-ray crystallography confirms its close conformational relationship with subtilisin-like proteases (14Cunningham D. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F.

Unlike typical enzymes, whose active sites are essential for function and generally offer good binding sites for small molecules, the PCSK9 active site is non-essential for LDL receptor down-regulation (17Li J.

Therefore, aside from an approach that would block maturation by inhibiting the autocatalytic enzyme activity during biosynthesis, the PCSK9 active site is not attractive as a traditional protease target. The ability of PCSK9 to mediate LDL receptor degradation involves protein-protein interactions between LDL receptor and the PCSK9 prodomain (19Lo Surdo P. Bottomley M.J. Calzetta A. Settembre E.C.

Protein-protein interactions are inherently challenging small molecule targets because they frequently contain large, relatively flat contact surfaces devoid of the pockets required for efficient binding of small organic chemicals. However, protein-protein interactions have been successfully inhibited by peptides, which can recapitulate key protein contacts (24Ross N.T. Katt W.P. Hamilton A.D. Synthetic mimetics of protein secondary structure domains.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A. 2010; 368: 989-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To identify a peptidic PCSK9 inhibitor, we screened both linear and disulfide-constrained phage-displayed peptide libraries with final diversities of 1.8 × 1011 and 7.8 × 1011, respectively, and identified the 13-amino acid peptide Pep2-8. Structural and biochemical characterization provided the molecular details of its inhibitory mechanism, which includes structural mimicry of the natural binding domain of LDL receptor. Two groups of phage-displayed peptide libraries, the linear peptide library called Linear-lib and cysteine-restrained cyclic library called Cyclic-lib, were constructed by fusing randomized peptides to the N terminus of M13 major coat protein p8 (25Stanger K. Steffek M. Zhou L. Pozniak C.D. Quan C. Franke Y. Tom J. Tam C. Krylova I. Elliott J.M. Lewcock J.W. Zhang Y. Murray J. Hannoush R.N. Allosteric peptides bind a caspase zymogen and mediate caspase tetramerization.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Linear-lib consisted of random peptides with 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 amino acids, and Cyclic-lib consisted of 14-mer random peptides with varied length between two invariant cysteines. The final diversities for Linear-lib and Cyclic-Lib were 1.8 × 1011 and 7.8 × 1011, respectively. The soft randomized library was constructed using degenerate oligonucleotides synthesized with 70:10:10:10 mixtures of nucleotide bases, in which the wild type base was in excess. This results in the wild type amino acids occurring at ∼50% frequency at the targeted position. Phage pools of Linear-lib and Cyclic-lib library were cycled through rounds of binding selections using 130, 65, 26, and 26 nm biotinylated PCSK9 in a buffer of PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20 for round 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (26Zhang Y. Zhou L. Kong-Beltran M. Li W. Moran P. Wang J. Quan C. Tom J. Kolumam G. Elliott J.M. Skelton N.J. Peterson A.S. Kirchhofer D. Calcium-independent inhibition of PCSK9 by affinity-improved variants of the LDL receptor EGF(A) domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 422: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After four rounds of binding selection, individual phage clones were analyzed in a high throughput spot phage ELISA using plate-immobilized PCSK9 as the target (27Tonikian R. Zhang Y. Boone C. Sidhu S.S. Identifying specificity profiles for peptide recognition modules from phage-displayed peptide libraries.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1368-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was defined as phage particle binding to NeutrAvidin. Clones with phage binding signal to PCSK9 over 0.5 and signal/noise ratio of >5 were considered to be positive clones and were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. The soft randomized library was used for affinity maturation of clone 2. Phage pools were subjected to four rounds of binding selection with decreasing concentrations of biotinylated PCSK9 from round 1 to round 4 at 130, 20, 2, and 2 nm, respectively, and produced Pep2-2. The sequence of Pep2-2 was fused to the N terminus of M13 major coat protein (p8) using Kunkel mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Rapid and efficient site-specific mutagenesis without phenotypic selection.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was transformed to Escherichia coli XL1 blue, and single colonies were grown in 1 ml of 2YT supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, and M13 KO7 helper phage at 37 °C for 2 h. After the addition of kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, the culture was transferred to 30 ml of 2YT supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37 °C overnight. Phage were harvested and purified using the standard protocol (27Tonikian R. Zhang Y. Boone C. Sidhu S.S. Identifying specificity profiles for peptide recognition modules from phage-displayed peptide libraries.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1368-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The serially diluted phage solution was added to a 384-well MaxiSorp ImmunoPlate containing biotinylated PCSK9 immobilized to NeutrAvidin-coated wells. The plate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and extensively washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and bound phage was quantified after the addition of anti-M13-HRP and HRP substrate on a microplate reader at A450. After subtracting background binding (i.e. phage binding to NeutrAvidin-coated plates), the data were fitted to a binding curve using KaleidaGraph, and the subsaturating phage concentration that gave 80% of maximum binding was calculated. For the peptide affinity determinations, biotinylated PCSK9 was immobilized to NeutrAvidin-coated MaxiSorp ImmunoPlates and incubated with a mixture of serially diluted synthetic peptide (Pep2-2 or Pep2 at 0–100 μm) and the corresponding peptide-displaying phage at the earlier determined subsaturating concentration (see above). After a 1-h incubation in PBT buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20), the plate was washed extensively, and the bound phage was detected by anti-M13-HRP. The data were fitted to a four-parameter equation (KaleidaGraph) to determine the IC50 values. For IC50 measurements of the Pep2-2 derivatives (Fig. 1C) and for the truncated Pep2-8 peptides (Table 1), we used the peptides in a concentration range of 0–250 μm and the Pep2-2-displaying phage at subsaturating concentrations. The results were the average ± S.D. of three independent experiments.TABLE 1IC50 values for synthetic peptides binding to PCSK9Peptide IDN-12345678910111213-CIC50μmPep2AcVVFTSWQDYLFWVAmide37.7 ± 1.0Pep2-2AcTVFTSWEEYLLWVAmide0.76 ± 0.01Pep2-2ΔT1AcVFTSWEEYLLWVAmide4.0 ± 0.4Pep2-2ΔV13AcTVFTSWEEYLLWAmide6.2 ± 0.5Pep2-2ΔW12, V13AcTVFTSWEEYLLAmide10.0 ± 0.6Pep2-2ΔL11-V13AcTVFTSWEEYLAmide17.6 ± 3.7Pep2-2ΔL10-V13AcTVFTSWEEYAmideUndetectablePep2-8AcTVFTSWEEYLDWVAmide1.4 ± 0.2Pep-ctrlAcTVATSAEEYLLWVAmideUndetectable Open table in a new tab Human PCSK9 cDNA containing a His8 C-terminal tag was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRK5. Using this expression construct as a template, the PCSK9 mutants S153A, P155A, L158A, R194A, D238A, D367A, I369A, D374A, F379A, V380A, S381A, and Q382A were constructed by ACTG Inc. (Wheeling, IL) using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and, in the case of S153A, P155A, and L158A, by additional N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified proteins. The recombinant PCSK9 proteins (wild type and mutants) were transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and purified from conditioned media by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) followed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 ºC. PCSK9-ΔCRD (Gln31–Gly452) was cloned by PCR amplification from the full-length PCSK9 cDNA using GC Advantage Polymerase (Clontech). The PCR product contained the sequence coding for PCSK9-ΔCRD and the restriction endonuclease sites BamHI and EcoRI at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. The PCR product was ligated into a modified pAcGP67 baculovirus transfer vector containing the DNA sequence coding for a hexahistidine affinity tag. The inserted PCR product was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein was produced in Trichoplusia ni insect cells (Expression Systems LLC, Woodland, CA) grown for 2 days after infection with baculovirus. Cells were removed from the production medium by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. Pooled fractions were further purified on an S75 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm CaCl2. By use of a spin concentrator, the pooled fractions were concentrated to 8 mg in 0.9 ml. The DNA sequences encoding Pep2-8 (TVFTSWEEYLDWV) or Pep-ctrl (TVATSAEEYLFWV) plus a linker with a sequence of GGGSGAAQVTNKTHT followed by the Fc domain of human IgG1 (Cys222–Lys443) were cloned into pRK5 vector and designated as Pep2-8-Fc-pRK5 or Pep-ctrl-Fc-pRK5. The DNA sequences encoding LDL receptor ectodomain (Met1–Val787) plus a linker with a sequence of GRAQVTDKTHT followed by the Fc domain of human IgG1 (Cys222–Lys443) were cloned into pRK5 vector. The fusion proteins were transiently expressed in CHO and purified on a Protein A resin followed by size exclusion chromatography. The identities of the proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing, and SDS-PAGE. Unexpectedly, the purified LDL receptor-Fc lacked the first four LDL receptor repeats due to cleavage by an unknown protease at Gly192–Asp193 in the linker region between LDL receptor repeats 4 and 5. The binding affinity of PCSK9 to this LDL receptor-Fc construct determined by biolayer interferometry at neutral pH was 106.7 ± 5.8 nm (average ± S.D. of three experiments), suggesting that the N-terminal truncation of LDL receptor did not impair PCSK9 binding. The binding affinities of Pep2-8_Fc and Pep-ctrl_Fc to PCSK9 were measured by biolayer interferometry on an OctetRed 384 (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA). Anti-hIgG-Fc capture biosensors (ForteBio) were loaded with Pep2-8_Fc or Pep-ctrl_Fc in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, washed in the same buffer, and transferred to wells containing PCSK9 at concentrations ranging from 8 to 6000 nm in the same buffer. The kon and koff values were obtained by fitting the association and dissociation data to a 1:1 model algorithm using Octet software. The KD derived from kinetic fitting was calculated as koff/kon. To assess Pep2-8 specificity, the binding to other members of the proprotein convertase family, including furin, PC1, PC2, PC7 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and PC4 (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan), was measured. Pep2-8_Fc and Pep-ctrl_Fc were captured on biosensors as described above. The binding to each different proprotein convertase was then measured in optimized assay buffer as suggested by the manufacturer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 for PC1 and PC7 (and PCSK9); 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.04% Brij-35 for furin; 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 for PC4; and 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 for PC2. The loaded biosensors were washed in the respective assay buffers and transferred to pairs of wells, containing the tested proprotein convertase member and PCSK9 at the same concentration (700 nm, 750 nm, 1 μm, 500 nm, and 500 nm for furin, PC7, PC2, PC4, and PC1, respectively). The association responses over 899 s for each pair were obtained, and the binding response relative to that of PCSK9 (“relative response”) was calculated. Biotinylated Pep2-8 was captured by NeutrAvidin-coated 384-well MaxiSorp ImmunoPlates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Serially diluted wild type and mutants of PCSK9 (starting at 10 μm) in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 were added to the wells and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, bound PCSK9 was detected by the sequential addition of anti-His HRP conjugate (1:5000 dilution; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMBE-1000, Moss (Pasadena, MD)). The data were fitted to a four-parameter equation (KaleidaGraph) to determine the concentrations for half-maximal binding (EC50 values). The relative binding was calculated as the ratio of EC50 for wild type PCSK9 over PCSK9 variants. Synthetic peptides were prepared on an automated Protein Technologies Inc. synthesizer. Peptides were assembled using standard Fmoc chemistry protocols on an Fmoc Rink amide linker attached to aminomethyl resin, and peptides were acetylated on the N terminus. Upon completion of the linear chains, peptides were cleaved off the solid support with trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water (95:2.5:2.5) for 1 h at room temperature. Trifluoroacetic acid was evaporated, and peptides were precipitated with ethyl ether; extracted with acetic acid, acetonitrile, and water; and lyophilized. Crude peptides were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide and purified by reverse phase chromatography on a C18 column using acetonitrile/water buffers. Purified fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (PE-Sciex), pooled, and lyophilized. LDL receptor-Fc (2 μg/ml) or EGF(A)-Fc (1 μg/ml) in DPBS (with calcium) (Invitrogen) was added to 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc International) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing the plates with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, His-tagged PCSK9 (2 μg/ml for LDL receptor-Fc and 4 μg/ml for EGF(A)-Fc experiments) preincubated for 30 min with serially diluted Pep2-8 or Pep-ctrl in 25 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 0.15% DMSO (final concentration) was added to the wells. After a 2-h incubation, plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, and bound PCSK9 was detected with anti-His-HRP antibody (Roche Applied Science) plus substrate TMB (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and A450 was measured on a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The effects of Pep2-8 and Pep-ctrl on PCSK9-mediated LDL receptor degradation were measured in a HepG2 cell assay essentially as described (26Zhang Y. Zhou L. Kong-Beltran M. Li W. Moran P. Wang J.

Biol. 2012; 422: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Peptides at various concentrations were preincubated with 15 μg/ml PCSK9 in the presence of 0.5% DMSO for 30 min prior to the addition to cells. After a 4-h incubation, the cells were processed for measurements of LDL receptor surface levels by flow cytometry as described (26Zhang Y. Zhou L. Kong-Beltran M. Li W. Moran P. Wang J. Quan C.

After 24 h, the medium was changed to 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (Intracel) in DMEM (Invitrogen). After 24 h, Pep2-8 or Pep-ctrl at various concentrations was preincubated with 15 μg/ml PCSK9 in 0.5% DMSO for 30 min prior to the addition to the cells.

A growing body of data strongly suggests that early aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) plays a key role in AD pathogenesis (1Bateman R.J. Xiong C. Benzinger T.L. Fagan A.M. Goate A.

Aβ is a post-proteolytic product generated as the result of the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE and γ-secretase (3Wilquet V. De Strooper B. Amyloid-beta precursor protein processing in neurodegeneration.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The initial cut position of the γ-secretase in the transmembrane domain of APP is rather imprecise, which explains why Aβ comes in different lengths: the longest Aβ peptide identified is Aβ51 while the shortest is Aβ30 as we describe herein. Aβ40 is the most abundant form and Aβ42 has received increasing attention in AD research, as it is very prone to aggregation and the major species deposited in the center of senile plaques, which are neuropathological hallmarks for AD. Furthermore, familial forms of AD (FAD) caused by mutations in the transmembrane sequence of APP frequently result in an increased Aβ42/40 ratio (4Goate A. Hardy J. Twenty years of Alzheimer's disease-causing mutations.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A high Aβ42/40 ratio positively correlates with the age of disease onset and is the key determinant of amyloidogenesis rather than total Aβ (5Kim J. Onstead L,. Randle S. Price R. Smithson L.

Alzheimer disease γ-secretase modulators amyloid precursor protein familial Alzheimer disease amyloid beta. To inhibit Aβ production, in particular of Aβ42, is therefore a prioritized strategy for therapy development against AD. γ-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which completely abrogate γ-secretase cleavage, have encountered several problems in clinical trials, because they block cleavage also of other γ-secretase-processed proteins, notably Notch receptors (8Andersson E.R. Sandberg R. Lendahl U. Notch signaling: Simplicity in design, versatility in function.Development. 2011; 138: 3593-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). So-called γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), which modulate Aβ production without affecting overall γ-secretase activity, have therefore emerged as an interesting alternative. In contrast to GSIs, GSMs do not affect overall enzyme activity but cause a parallel decrease in Aβ40 and Aβ42 accompanied by increase in Aβ37 and Aβ38 (and sometimes Aβ39) (9Weggen S. Eriksen J.L.

The mechanism by which GSMs or FAD mutations modulate levels of specific Aβ forms however remains elusive, and reflects an underlying lack of understanding of the distinct steps in the sequential Aβ processing cascade, where longer Aβ forms are converted into shorter peptides. Takami et al. have proposed a stepwise cleavage model where γ-secretase processing of the APP transmembrane sequence begins at either Aβ49, Aβ51, or Aβ52 (the so called epsilon cut) followed by processing at every third or fourth amino acid leading to the release of progressively shortened Aβ peptides (15Takami M.

De Strooper B. The mechanism of γ-secretase dysfunction in familial Alzheimer disease.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2261-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that not only membrane bound stubs but also Aβ peptides are direct substrates for γ-secretase, which are converted into shortened Aβ peptides (16Okochi M. Tagami S. Yanagida K. Takami M. Kodama T.S. Mori K. Nakayama T. Ihara Y.

It is however important to note that in all these studies, data were derived from biochemical experiments with solubilized membrane extracts and Escherichia coli-produced truncated APP molecules (beta-stub or C99) or recombinant Aβ peptides (Aβ43 and Aβ42), rather than membrane bound native substrates expressed in mammalian cells. There are reasons to believe that not all aspects of γ-secretase-mediated APP processing and GSM functions are fully recapitulated in reconstituted systems (10Borgegard T. Juréus A. Olsson F.

Invest. 2003; 112: 440-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). There is therefore a need to examine Aβ processing in more native systems. In our study we combined immuno- and LC-MS-based assays to analyze γ-secretase mediated APP processing in native membranes in the absence of detergents and without recombinant substrates. We delineate γ-secretase mediated processing of the entire APP transmembrane sequence which ranges from the longest (Aβ51) to the shortest (Aβ30) form of Aβ. Our data identifies novel γ-secretase cleavage events and show that the entire APP transmembrane sequence is subjected to γ-secretase processing. The data suggest that Aβ42 could be generated through different cleavage reactions and that the Aβ42/40 ratio could be regulated at several steps of γ-secretase-mediated APP processing (Fig. 1A). Our data also provide novel insights into how amyloidogenic Aβ production is promoted and changed by FAD APP mutations and by GSMs, respectively; information that is highly relevant for therapeutic development in AD.

Mesoscale discovery assay (MSD): Aβ38, 40, and 42 triplex plates and antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 were from the supplier, rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Aβ34, 37, and 39 were custom made. Peptide standards were from Polypeptide Laboratories. Internal standard, leucine, enkephalin, and formic acid were purchased from Sigma, acetonitrile (Gradient grade) was from Applichem. Water of 18-MΩ quality was prepared from Milli-Q system (Millipore). HEK293 cells overexpressing the APPSwe mutant (HEK/APPswe) were split and seeded into 384-well tissue culture plates at day 1. At day 2, medium were removed and replaced with medium with or without compound. 5 h later, the conditioned media was assayed for Aβ production using the MesoScale Discovery (MSD) platform. Briefly, the conditioned media was transferred to MSD assay plates coated with either Aβ34, Aβ37, or Aβ39 specific antibodies, or MSD triplex plates coated with Aβ38, 40, 42 specific antibodies, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the plates were washed three times following the addition of 4G8 as detection antibody (recognizing Aβ17–24) and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before 3 repeated washes and measurement of the electrochemiluminescence signal according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes from HEK/APPswe cells and SH-SY5Y cells stably over expressing APP, APP714, APP717, or APP723 were prepared as described before (10Borgegard T. Juréus A. Olsson F. Rosqvist S. Sabirsh A.

The cells were exposed to 0.5 μm of the reversible GSI Semagacestat for 19 h prior to cell harvesting to accumulate non-γ-secretase processed APP metabolites (i.e. C99 and C83) and thereby enhance the amount of γ-secretase products generated in the subsequent membrane based γ-secretase activity assay (see below). P2 membranes were re-suspended in assay buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm sodium citrate, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and stored at −80 °C. Membranes were thawed on ice and diluted in assay buffer (see above) to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. In each reaction, 150 μl of ice-cold membranes were treated with compounds diluted in 100% DMSO (final DMSO concentration 4%) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were thereafter kept on ice and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min to remove any cell debris. 70 μl of the reaction mixture were then subjected to LC-MS analysis (see below), and 50 μl of the reaction mixture were added to MSD assay plates coated with either Aβ34, Aβ37, Aβ39, Aβ42 specific antibodies or MSD triplex plates (Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, 4G8 or 6E10 (recognizing Aβ1–10) antibodies were added and analyzed for specific Aβ peptides in accordance with the assay described under “Cellular Assay of Aβ Production.” Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from BACE deficient mice, which lack the ability to generate Aβ but that has an intact non-amyloidogenic pathway where α-secretase and subsequently γ-secretase cleavage of APP results in sAPPα and P3 peptide production, respectively. The MEFs were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates and grown to ∼80% confluency. The cells were subsequently exposed to either AZ4126 or R-Flurbiprofen for 24 h. The conditioned media was subsequently removed for P3 peptide analysis. P3 levels were analyzed using Aβ38/40/42 triplex plates (MSD) and 4G8 (epitope 17–24 of N-terminally intact Aβ peptide) as detection antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard peptides were diluted in water, typically 0.4 mg to 1 ml of water except for LVML, which was diluted in water and 16% acetonitrile. The prepared stock solution was divided into aliquots in polypropylene tubes and stored at −20 °C. 70 μl of sample were mixed (in a 96-well propylene plate, Thermo-Fast 96 Skirted, Thermo Scientific) with 20 μl of internal standard (571 nm). The samples were then transferred to a filter plate (MultiScreen HTS, HV, 0.45 μm, low protein binding, Millipore) and centrifuged at 2600 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The collection plate was of the same type as the plate used for mixing before the centrifugation step. Analysis of peptides was performed by the use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, Quantum Ultra and a ultrahigh pressure (UPLC) pump, Accela, (ThermoFisher, CA) an auto sampler (CTC Analytics AG, Switzerland) equipped with a 100 μl syringe (Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Switzerland), a chilled (5 °C) 96-well plate holder a six-port injection valve with a 50 μl sample loop VICI (Valco Instruments, TX). The chromatographic column was a Hypersil gold 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.9 μm particles (ThermoFisher) kept at 40 °C by a column heater, Model 7955 (Gracevydac, CA). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A: 0.05% formic acid and solvent B: 95% acetonitrile, 5% water, 0.05% formic acid. The gradient (350 μl/min) conditions were as follows: 0–10 min 2–15% B; 10–15 min 15–70% B; 15–20 min 2% B. The electro spray ionization was in the positive ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring. The vaporizer temperature, capillary voltage, and temperature were set to 150 °C, 4500 volts, and 300 °C, respectively. The collision pressure was 1.5 mTorr. Settings of the mass spectrometer for the detection of specific peptides are shown in Fig. 2B. The standard curve was analyzed by a dilution series of a mixture of all the peptides (70 μl) in water (200, 40, 8, 1.6, 0.32, and 0.064 nm) and treated in the same procedure as the samples. Quantification was performed by weighting the response of each peptide divided by the response of the internal standard (area/area) 1/× (ignore origo). The response in matrix was tested by adding 5 μl of a mixture of all the peptides at different concentrations (standard curve) to 65 μl of an aliquot of sample previously exposed to a large excess of the γ-secretase inhibitor semagacestat. The response of the added peptides was found to be linear. Typically variation of the method was 10% (rel.std. deviation, n = 6). The limit of quantification was set to 0.2 nm. Through conventional immuno-based methods with Aβ species-specific antibodies it has been possible to identify a range of Aβ species, but not the cleaved smaller peptides, and information about those would be needed to conclusively establish the internal order in the Aβ processing cascade. To overcome this limitation, we established an assay combining an immuno-based electrochemiluminescence assay (Mesoscale discovery technology, MSD), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect longer Aβ peptides and to identify all smaller (3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-) peptides derived from APP processing (Fig. 1 and 2). Importantly, analysis of de novo Aβ peptide generation is carried out in the absence of detergents and recombinant substrate. We used HEK cells expressing APPswe (HEK/APPswe cells) that we incubated with the reversible γ-secretase inhibitor semagacestat for 19 h prior to cell harvesting in order to accumulate non-γ-secretase processed APP and thereby increase the signal by subsequent MSD and LC-MS analysis (Fig. 1B). We observed that the cell membrane preparation contained relatively more α-secretase-generated APP CTFs (C83) than BACE-catalyzed beta-stub C99 (Fig. 1C), presumably as the incubation of the cells with semagacestat prior to cell harvesting allowed α-secretase processing of C99 to C83. Both, APP intracellular domain (AICD) and Aβ42 were readily detected in the membrane assay and their production was γ-secretase activity dependent, since the addition of semagacestat blocked the production of both peptides (Fig. 1, B and C). We next compared the membrane-assay derived Aβ profile to that obtained from conditioned medium from HEK/APPswe cells. The profiles were similar and peptides of different lengths (Aβ34, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 42) were detected in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1D) and in the membrane assay indicating the near-native condition. Some differences were also observed, as the relative amounts of Aβ34 was higher and of Aβ37 and Aβ42 lower in the membrane preparation as compared with conditioned medium (Fig. 1D) and as calculated from the raw data obtained by MSD analysis of the membrane de novo Aβ assay (Fig. 1E). The reasons for these differences are unknown but may stem from the fact that we compare total Aβ production with the secreted pool of Aβ (conditioned media, non-membrane associated Aβ) or that the clearance rate of selected Aβ peptides are different in the two systems. Several shorter peptides were detected by LC-MS, using the same membrane preparation from the HEK/APPswe cells (Fig. 2). By analyzing the short peptide spectrum we identified 3- and 4-peptides as well as a 6-peptide (Aβ40–35) resulting from γ-secretase cleavage (Fig. 2, A–E). In some experiments the sensitivity of the assay enabled us to identify γ-secretase dependent generation of 3- and 4-peptides across the entire transmembrane sequence, including reactions that results in Aβ34–32 and Aβ34–31 (data not shown). We identified some non-γ-secretase-dependent impurities, exhibiting the same retention time as Aβ51–49, Aβ42–40, and Aβ41–39, which precluded determination of their absolute levels (peptides marked with an asterisk in Fig. 2E). In sum, we have developed a membrane assay for de novo Aβ detection to monitor all major Aβ peptides as well as a number of shorter 3-, 4-, and 6-mer peptides derived from γ-secrease mediated processing of the APP transmembrane sequence. By combining the data from the immuno and LC-MS analyses on the longer and shorter peptides, respectively, we identified major cleavage events that aligned along two distinct routes across the APP transmembrane helices (Fig. 2E). One processing route spans from Aβ51 via Aβ48, Aβ45, Aβ42, Aβ39, or Aβ38 and then further to Aβ34. Such processing events will from herein be denoted as the Aβ42 product line. The other processing route started from Aβ49 via Aβ46, Aβ43, Aβ40, to Aβ36 or Aβ37, and then further to Aβ34 and will from herein be denoted the Aβ40 product line (Fig. 2E). In some experiments we could also identify γ-secretase-dependent Aβ34–32 and Aβ34–31 peptides, which result in Aβ31 and Aβ30 production (data not shown). γ-Secretase cleavages at every third amino acid thus dominated the production of Aβ peptides. Based on the abundance of each 3- or 4-peptide, our data suggest that the reactions resulting in Aβ49–47, Aβ46–44, Aβ43–41, and Aβ40–37 are the most prominent (Fig. 2D). Our experiments did not address whether Aβ production is a stepwise cascade of proteolytic reactions, starting at the epsilon cleavage site and continues in a precursor-product manner resulting in shorter Aβ peptides, or reflects single independent cleavage events of the APP transmembrane sequence. However, the results obtained are in large compatible with both of these potential mechanisms. It is worth to mention that the amount of the Aβ43–41 peptide was almost twice as high as the upstream Aβ46–44 peptide, suggesting that either other precursors of Aβ43 exists, that the quantification is less precise for this particular Aβ species or that the precursor-product hypothesis could not fully explain γ-secretase-mediated APP processing. The data also indicate that γ-secretase processing is not limited to the two routes and a switch from the Aβ40 product line to the Aβ42 product line can happen at two cleavage steps. The first switch point occurs at Aβ49, which besides forming Aβ49–47 produces the 4-peptide Aβ49–46. The second switch point occurs at Aβ46, which besides forming Aβ46–44 also generates Aβ46–43 (Fig. 2E). We also identified additional positions within the APP transmembrane sequence where γ-secretase processing in a similar manner resulted in either 3- or 4-peptides: Aβ48–45 and Aβ48–46; Aβ45–42 and Aβ45–41; and Aβ34–32 and Aβ34- 31 (Fig. 2E and data not shown). In addition to all 3- and 4-peptides identified, we also discovered Aβ40-Aβ35, the only 6-peptide identified in our analysis. Together, these data suggest that γ-secretase mediated APP processing occurs across the entire APP transmembrane sequence and that the major cleavage reactions occur along two major routes, denoted the Aβ40 and 42 product lines, respectively, which both converge at Aβ34. The data also define proteolytic events that result in switch points between the major routes revealing alternative reactions to Aβ42 production and to the regulation of the Aβ42/40 production ratio. We next used the immuno/LC-MS assay to study the impact of FAD APP mutations on APP processing, and to explore why the mutations cause elevated Aβ42 levels. We selected three different mutants, (T714I, V717F, and L723P), which correspond to Aβ numbering 43, 46, and 52, localizing the mutations to the Aβ40 product line. To assess the effect of the mutations, we analyzed membrane preparations of SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the different FAD APP constructs. All three FAD mutants showed an increased or retained relative production of Aβ38, Aβ39, and Aβ42, as compared with wild-type APP (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the T714I and L723P mutants caused a decrease in Aβ40 production relative to wild-type APP (Fig. 3A). All three APP FAD mutants caused an increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio as compared with wild-type APP (Fig. 3B), in agreement with previous data from tissue culture studies (20Munter L.M. Botev A.

https://openalex.org/W2092471274,"Whether the Hippo pathway has downstream targets other than YAP and TAZ is unknown. In this report, we have identified angiomotin (Amot) family members as novel substrates of Hippo core kinases. The N-terminal regions of Amot proteins contain a conserved HXRXXS consensus site for LATS1/2-mediated phosphorylation. Phospho-specific antibodies showed that Hippo core kinases could mediate phosphorylation of endogenous as well as exogenous Amot family members. Knockdown of LATS1 and LATS2 endogenously reduced the phosphorylation of Amots detected by the phospho-specific antibodies. Mutation of the serine to alanine within this HXRXXS site in Amot and AmotL2 established that this site was essential for Hippo core kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Wild-type and non-phosphorylated Amot (Amot-S175A) were targeted to actin filaments, whereas phospho-mimic Amot (Amot-S175D) failed to be localized with actin. Overexpression of LATS2 caused dissociation of Amot from actin but not Amot-S175A. Mapping of the actin-binding site of Amot showed that serine 175 of Amot was important for the actin-binding activity. Amot-S175A promoted, whereas Amot and Amot-S175D inhibited, cell proliferation. These results collectively suggest that the Hippo pathway negatively regulates the actin-binding activity of Amot family members through direct phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2082258030,"Abiotic stress is a major environmental factor that limits cotton growth and yield, moreover, this problem has become more and more serious recently, as multiple stresses often occur simultaneously due to the global climate change and environmental pollution. In this study, we sought to identify genes involved in diverse stresses including abscisic acid (ABA), cold, drought, salinity and alkalinity by comparative microarray analysis. Our result showed that 5790, 3067, 5608, 778 and 6148 transcripts, were differentially expressed in cotton seedlings under treatment of ABA (1 μM ABA), cold (4°C), drought (200 mM mannitol), salinity (200 mM NaCl) and alkalinity (pH=11) respectively. Among the induced or suppressed genes, 126 transcripts were shared by all of the five kinds of abiotic stresses, with 64 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated. These common members are grouped as stress signal transduction, transcription factors (TFs), stress response/defense proteins, metabolism, transport facilitation, as well as cell wall/structure, according to the function annotation. We also noticed that large proportion of significant differentially expressed genes specifically regulated in response to different stress. Nine of the common transcripts of multiple stresses were selected for further validation with quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, several well characterized TF families, for example, WRKY, MYB, NAC, AP2/ERF and zinc finger were shown to be involved in different stresses. As an original report using comparative microarray to analyze transcriptome of cotton under five abiotic stresses, valuable information about functional genes and related pathways of anti-stress, and/or stress tolerance in cotton seedlings was unveiled in our result. Besides this, some important common factors were focused for detailed identification and characterization. According to our analysis, it suggested that there was crosstalk of responsive genes or pathways to multiple abiotic or even biotic stresses, in cotton. These candidate genes will be worthy of functional study under diverse stresses."

Methods A total of 23,392 people aged 20+ years were selected for the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey 2008–2011, using stratified, multistage, clustered sampling. Refractive error was measured by autorefraction without cycloplegia, and interviews were performed regarding associated risk factors including gender, age, height, education level, parent's education level, economic status, light exposure time, and current smoking history. Results Of 23,392 participants, refractive errors were examined in 22,562 persons, including 21,356 subjects with phakic eyes. The overall prevalences of myopia (< -0.5 D), high myopia (< -6.0 D), and hyperopia (> 0.5 D) were 48.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4–48.8), 4.0% (CI, 3.7–4.3), and 24.2% (CI, 23.6–24.8), respectively. The prevalence of myopia sharply decreased from 78.9% (CI, 77.4–80.4) in 20–29 year olds to 16.1% (CI, 14.9–17.3) in 60–69 year olds. In multivariable logistic regression analyses restricted to subjects aged 40+ years, myopia was associated with younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.93-0.94, p < 0.001), education level of university or higher (OR, 2.31; CI, 1.97–2.71, p < 0.001), and shorter sunlight exposure time (OR, 0.84; CI, 0.76–0.93, p = 0.002). Conclusions This study provides the first representative population-based data on refractive error for Korean adults. The prevalence of myopia in Korean adults in 40+ years (34.7%) was comparable to that in other Asian countries. These results show that the younger generations in Korea are much more myopic than previous generations, and that important factors associated with this increase are increased education levels and reduced sunlight exposures."
https://openalex.org/W1994409997,"Blood-borne transmission of infectious prions during the symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of disease occurs for both human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The geographical distribution of the cervid TSE, chronic wasting disease (CWD), continues to spread across North America and the prospective number of individuals harboring an asymptomatic infection of human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the United Kingdom has been projected to be ~1 in 3000 residents. Thus, it is important to monitor cervid and human blood products to ensure herd health and human safety. Current methods for detecting blood-associated prions rely primarily upon bioassay in laboratory animals. While bioassay provides high sensitivity and specificity, it requires many months, animals, and it is costly. Here we report modification of the real time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to detect blood-borne prions in whole blood from prion-infected preclinical white-tailed deer, muntjac deer, and Syrian hamsters, attaining sensitivity of >90% while maintaining 100% specificity. Our results indicate that RT-QuIC methodology as modified can provide consistent and reliable detection of blood-borne prions in preclinical and symptomatic stages of two animal TSEs, offering promise for prionemia detection in other species, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W1976566701,"Tuberculosis is one of the world's leading killers, stealing 1.4 million lives and causing 8.7 million new and relapsed infections in 2011. The only vaccine against tuberculosis is BCG which demonstrates variable efficacy in adults worldwide. Human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in the influx of inflammatory cells to the lung in an attempt to wall off bacilli by forming a granuloma. Gr1(int)CD11b(+) cells are called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and play a major role in regulation of inflammation in many pathological conditions. Although MDSC have been described primarily in cancer their function in tuberculosis remains unknown. During M. tuberculosis infection it is crucial to understand the function of cells involved in the regulation of inflammation during granuloma formation. Understanding their relative impact on the bacilli and other cellular phenotypes is necessary for future vaccine and drug design.We compared the bacterial burden, lung pathology and Gr1(int)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cell immune responses in M. tuberculosis infected NOS2-/-, RAG-/-, C3HeB/FeJ and C57/BL6 mice. Gr-1(+) cells could be found on the edges of necrotic lung lesions in NOS2-/-, RAG-/-, and C3HeB/FeJ, but were absent in wild-type mice. Both populations of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) cells expressed high levels of arginase-1, and IL-17, additional markers of myeloid derived suppressor cells. We then sorted the Gr1(hi) and Gr1(int) populations from M. tuberculosis infected NOS-/- mice and placed the sorted both Gr1(int) populations at different ratios with naïve or M. tuberculosis infected splenocytes and evaluated their ability to induce activation and proliferation of CD4+T cells. Our results showed that both Gr1(hi) and Gr1(int) cells were able to induce activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells. However this response was reduced as the ratio of CD4(+) T to Gr1(+) cells increased. Our results illustrate a yet unrecognized interplay between Gr1(+) cells and CD4(+) T cells in tuberculosis."

However, the mechanism of the interaction between NdhS and ferredoxin is unclear. In this study, we analyzed their interaction in planta by using site-directed mutagenesis of NdhS. In general, binding of ferredoxin to its target proteins depends on electrostatic interaction. In silico analysis predicted the presence of a positively charged pocket in the SH3-like domain of NdhS, where nine charged residues are highly conserved among plants. Systematic alteration of these sites with neutral glutamine revealed that only arginine 193 was required for high NDH activity in vivo. Further replacement of arginine 193 with negatively charged aspartate or glutamate or hydrophobic alanine significantly decreased the efficiency of ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reduction by NDH in ruptured chloroplasts. Similar results were obtained in in vivo analyses of NDH activity and electron transport.

https://openalex.org/W2091028633,"In China, the rapid rate of population aging and changes in the prevalence of disability among elderly people could have significant effects on the demand for long-term care. This study aims to describe the urban-rural differences in use and cost of long-term care of the disabled elderly and to explore potential influencing factors.This study uses data from a cross-sectional survey and a qualitative investigation conducted in Zhejiang province in 2012. The participants were 826 individuals over 60 years of age, who had been bedridden or suffered from dementia for more than 6 months. A generalized linear model and two-part regression model were applied to estimate costs, with adjustment of covariates.Pensions provide the main source of income for urban elderly, while the principal income source for rural elderly is their family. Urban residents spend more on all services than do rural residents. Those who are married spend less on daily supplies and formal care than the unmarried do. Age, incapacitation time, comorbidity number, level of income, and bedridden status influence spending on medical care (β=-0.0316, -0.0206, 0.1882, 0.3444, and -0.4281, respectively), but the cost does not increase as the elderly grow older. Urban residents, the married, and those with a higher income level tend to spend more on medical equipment. Urban residence and living status are the two significant factors that affect spending on personal hygiene products.The use of long-term care services varies by living area. Long-term care of the disabled elderly imposes a substantial burden on families. Our study revealed that informal care involves huge opportunity costs to the caregivers. Chinese policy makers need to promote community care and long-term care insurance to relieve the burden of families of disabled elderly, and particular attention should be given to the rural elderly."
https://openalex.org/W1990276193,"There are not “universal methods” to determine diet composition of predators. Most traditional methods are biased because of their reliance on differential digestibility and the recovery of hard items. By relying on assimilated food, stable isotope and Bayesian mixing models (SIMMs) resolve many biases of traditional methods. SIMMs can incorporate prior information (i.e. proportional diet composition) that may improve the precision in the estimated dietary composition. However few studies have assessed the performance of traditional methods and SIMMs with and without informative priors to study the predators’ diets. Here we compare the diet compositions of the South American fur seal and sea lions obtained by scats analysis and by SIMMs-UP (uninformative priors) and assess whether informative priors (SIMMs-IP) from the scat analysis improved the estimated diet composition compared to SIMMs-UP. According to the SIMM-UP, while pelagic species dominated the fur seal’s diet the sea lion’s did not have a clear dominance of any prey. In contrast, SIMM-IP’s diets compositions were dominated by the same preys as in scat analyses. When prior information influenced SIMMs’ estimates, incorporating informative priors improved the precision in the estimated diet composition at the risk of inducing biases in the estimates. If preys isotopic data allow discriminating preys’ contributions to diets, informative priors should lead to more precise but unbiased estimated diet composition. Just as estimates of diet composition obtained from traditional methods are critically interpreted because of their biases, care must be exercised when interpreting diet composition obtained by SIMMs-IP. The best approach to obtain a near-complete view of predators’ diet composition should involve the simultaneous consideration of different sources of partial evidence (traditional methods, SIMM-UP and SIMM-IP) in the light of natural history of the predator species so as to reliably ascertain and weight the information yielded by each method."
https://openalex.org/W2063875041,"Background The phytohormone gibberellic acid (GA3) is widely used in the table grape industry to induce seedlessness in seeded varieties. However, there is a paucity of information concerning the mechanisms by which GAs induce seedlessness in grapes. Methodology/Principal Findings In an effort to systematically analyze the cause of this GA3-induced seed abortion, we conducted an in depth characterization of two seeded grape cultivars (‘Kyoho’ and ‘Red Globe’), along with a seedless cultivar (‘Thompson Seedless’), following treatment with GA3. In a similar fashion to the seedless control, which exhibited GA3-induced abortion of the seeds 9 days after full bloom (DAF), both ‘Kyoho’ and ‘Red Globe’ seeded varieties exhibited complete abortion of the seeds 15 DAF when treated with GA3. Morphological analyses indicated that while fertilization appeared to occur normally following GA3 treatment, as well as in the untreated seedless control cultivar, seed growth eventually ceased. In addition, we found that GA3 application had an effect on redox homeostasis, which could potentially cause cell damage and subsequent seed abortion. Furthermore, we carried out an analysis of antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as transcript levels from various genes believed to be involved in seed development, and found several differences between GA3-treated and untreated controls. Conclusion Therefore, it seems that the mechanisms driving GA3-induced seedlessness are similar in both seeded and seedless cultivars, and that the observed abortion of seeds may result at least in part from a GA3-induced increase in cell damage caused by reactive oxygen species, a decrease in antioxidant enzymatic activities, and an alteration of the expression of genes related to seed development."
https://openalex.org/W1978040816,"There is now considerable evidence that climate change is disrupting the phenology of key pollinator species. The recently reported UK winter activity of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris brings a novel set of thermal challenges to bumblebee workers that would typically only be exposed to summer conditions. Here we assess the ability of workers to survive acute and chronic cold stress (via lower lethal temperatures and lower lethal times at 0°C), the capacity for rapid cold hardening (RCH) and the influence of diet (pollen versus nectar consumption) on supercooling points (SCP). Comparisons are made with chronic cold stress indices and SCPs in queen bumblebees. Results showed worker bees were able to survive acute temperatures likely to be experienced in a mild winter, with queens significantly more tolerant to chronic cold temperature stress. The first evidence of RCH in any Hymenoptera is shown. In addition, dietary manipulation indicated the consumption of pollen significantly increased SCP temperature. These results are discussed in the light of winter active bumblebees and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2165556429,"Understanding of adaptive behavior requires the precisely controlled presentation of multisensory stimuli combined with simultaneous measurement of multiple behavioral modalities. Hence, we developed a virtual reality apparatus that allows for simultaneous measurement of reward checking, a commonly used measure in associative learning paradigms, and navigational behavior, along with precisely controlled presentation of visual, auditory and reward stimuli. Rats performed a virtual spatial navigation task analogous to the Morris maze where only distal visual or auditory cues provided spatial information. Spatial navigation and reward checking maps showed experience-dependent learning and were in register for distal visual cues. However, they showed a dissociation, whereby distal auditory cues failed to support spatial navigation but did support spatially localized reward checking. These findings indicate that rats can navigate in virtual space with only distal visual cues, without significant vestibular or other sensory inputs. Furthermore, they reveal the simultaneous dissociation between two reward-driven behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2314886776,"The frequency of extreme meteorological events such as heat waves and rainstorms is predicted to increase with climate change. However, there is still little information about how extreme weather influences reproduction in animals. It may not only affect breeding success but might also alter offspring sex ratio if males and females are differentially sensitive to meteorological conditions during development. We investigated the relationship between meteorological conditions and reproductive success over 6 years in a house sparrow population in central Europe. We found that hatching success increased with the number of extremely hot days (daily maximum >31°C) and decreased with the number of extremely cold days (<16°C) during incubation, although the latter effect held only for clutches with relatively short incubation periods. Fledging success was unrelated to weather variables. However, the frequency of extremely hot days had a negative effect on fledglings’ body mass and tarsus length, although both of these traits were positively related to average temperature. Additionally, fledglings’ body mass increased with the length of period without rainfall before fledging. Male to female ratio among fledglings did not differ from 1:1 and did not vary with weather variables. The magnitude of the effects of extreme meteorological events was usually small, although in some cases comparable to those of ecologically relevant predictors of reproductive success. Our results indicate that meteorological conditions have complex effects on breeding success, as the effects of extreme weather can differ between different aspects of reproduction and also from the effects of overall meteorological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2045160978,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of multifunctional serine/threonine phosphatases consisting of a catalytic C, a structural A, and a regulatory B subunit. The substrate and therefore the functional specificity of PP2A are determined by the assembly of the enzyme complex with the appropriate regulatory B subunit families, namely B55, B56, PR72, or PR93/PR110. It has been suggested that additional levels of regulating PP2A function may result from the phosphorylation of B56 isoforms. In this study, we identified a novel phosphorylation site at Ser(41) of B56α. This phosphoamino acid residue was efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by PKCα. We detected a 7-fold higher phosphorylation of B56α in failing human hearts compared with nonfailing hearts. Purified PP2A dimeric holoenzyme (subunits C and A) was able to dephosphorylate PKCα-phosphorylated B56α. The potency of B56α for PP2A inhibition was markedly increased by PKCα phosphorylation. PP2A activity was also reduced in HEK293 cells transfected with a B56α mutant, where serine 41 was replaced by aspartic acid, which mimics phosphorylation. More evidence for a functional role of PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of B56α was derived from Fluo-4 fluorescence measurements in phenylephrine-stimulated Flp293 cells. The endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release was increased by 23% by expression of the pseudophosphorylated form compared with wild-type B56α. Taken together, our results suggest that PKCα can modify PP2A activity by phosphorylation of B56α at Ser(41). This interplay between PKCα and PP2A represents a new mechanism to regulate important cellular functions like cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2017197774,"Objectives The frequency of common oncogenic mutations and TP53 was determined in Asian oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and Methods The OncoCarta™ panel v1.0 assay was used to characterize oncogenic mutations. In addition, exons 4-11 of the TP53 gene were sequenced. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify associations between mutations and selected clinico-pathological characteristics and risk habits. Results Oncogenic mutations were detected in PIK3CA (5.7%) and HRAS (2.4%). Mutations in TP53 were observed in 27.7% (31/112) of the OSCC specimens. Oncogenic mutations were found more frequently in non-smokers (p = 0.049) and TP53 truncating mutations were more common in patients with no risk habits (p = 0.019). Patients with mutations had worse overall survival compared to those with absence of mutations; and patients who harbored DNA binding domain (DBD) and L2/L3/LSH mutations showed a worse survival probability compared to those patients with wild type TP53. The majority of the oncogenic and TP53 mutations were G:C > A:T and A:T > G:C base transitions, regardless of the different risk habits. Conclusion Hotspot oncogenic mutations which are frequently present in common solid tumors are exceedingly rare in OSCC. Despite differences in risk habit exposure, the mutation frequency of PIK3CA and HRAS in Asian OSCC were similar to that reported in OSCC among Caucasians, whereas TP53 mutations rates were significantly lower. The lack of actionable hotspot mutations argue strongly for the need to comprehensively characterize gene mutations associated with OSCC for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools."
https://openalex.org/W2082287210,"L265P mutation in the MYD88 gene has recently been reported in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia; however the incidence has been different according to the methods used. To determine the relevance and compare the incidence by different methods, we analyzed the L265P mutation in bone marrow mononuclear cells from lymphoid neoplasms. We first performed cloning and sequencing in 10 patients: 8 Waldenström's macroglobulinemia; 1 non-IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma; and 1 low grade B-cell lymphoma with monoclonal IgG protein. The L265P mutation was detected in only 1/8 Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients (2 of 9 clones). To confirm these results, direct sequencing was performed in the 10 patients and an additional 17 Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients and 1 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma patient. Nine of 28 patients (7/25 Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, 1/2 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and B-cell lymphoma) harbored the mutation. We next tested for the mutation with BSiE1 digestion and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction in the 28 patients and 38 patients with myeloma. Aberrant bands corresponding to the mutation were detected by BSiE1 digestion in 19/25 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (76%), 1/2 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma, but not in the 38 myeloma patients. The L265P mutation was more frequent in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia than in those with myeloma (p=1.3x10(-10)). The mutation was detected by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction in 18/25 Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients (72%). In the 25 Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients, the L265P was more frequently detected by BSiE1 digestion than by direct sequencing (p=5.3x10(-4)), and in males (15/16, 94%) than in females (4/9, 44%) (p=1.2x10(-2)). No siginificant difference was observed in the incidence of the L265P mutation between BSiE1 digestion and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (p=0.32). These results suggest that the L265P mutation is involved in the majority of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. BSiE1 digestion and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction may detect a small fraction of mutated cells in some cases."
https://openalex.org/W2063629303,"Arginase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a loss of the liver arginase isoform, arginase 1 (ARG1), which is the final step in the urea cycle for detoxifying ammonia. ARG1 deficiency leads to hyperargininemia, characterized by progressive neurological impairment, persistent growth retardation and infrequent episodes of hyperammonemia. Using the Cre/loxP-directed conditional gene knockout system, we generated an inducible Arg1-deficient mouse model by crossing ""floxed"" Arg1 mice with CreER(T2) mice. The resulting mice (Arg-Cre) die about two weeks after tamoxifen administration regardless of the starting age of inducing the knockout. These treated mice were nearly devoid of Arg1 mRNA, protein and liver arginase activity, and exhibited symptoms of hyperammonemia. Plasma amino acid analysis revealed pronounced hyperargininemia and significant alterations in amino acid and guanidino compound metabolism, including increased citrulline and guanidinoacetic acid. Despite no alteration in ornithine levels, concentrations of other amino acids such as proline and the branched-chain amino acids were reduced. In summary, we have generated and characterized an inducible Arg1-deficient mouse model exhibiting several pathologic manifestations of hyperargininemia. This model should prove useful for exploring potential treatment options of ARG1 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1975695279,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) of the family Paramyxoviridae is a major cause of respiratory illness worldwide. Phosphoproteins (P) from Paramyxoviridae are essential co-factors of the viral RNA polymerase that form tetramers and possess long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). We located the central region of HMPV P (Pced) which is involved in tetramerization using disorder analysis and modeled its 3D structure ab initio using Rosetta fold-and-dock. We characterized the solution-structure of Pced using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and carried out direct fitting to the scattering data to filter out incorrect models. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and ensemble optimization were employed to select correct models and capture the dynamic character of Pced. Our analysis revealed that oligomerization involves a compact central core located between residues 169-194 (Pcore), that is surrounded by flexible regions with α-helical propensity. We crystallized this fragment and solved its structure at 3.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement, using the folded core from our SAXS-validated ab initio model. The RMSD between modeled and experimental tetramers is as low as 0.9 Å, demonstrating the accuracy of the approach. A comparison of the structure of HMPV P to existing mononegavirales Pced structures suggests that Pced evolved under weak selective pressure. Finally, we discuss the advantages of using SAXS in combination with ab initio modeling and MDS to solve the structure of small, homo-oligomeric protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2056356945,"More than 200 heterozygous mutations in the type 2 BMP receptor gene, BMPR2, have been identified in patients with Heritable Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (HPAH). More severe clinical outcomes occur in patients with BMPR2 mutations by-passing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD negative mutations). These comprise 40% of HPAH mutations and are predicted to express BMPR2 mutant products. However expression of endogenous NMD negative BMPR2 mutant products and their effect on protein trafficking and signaling function have never been described. Here, we characterize the expression and trafficking of an HPAH-associated NMD negative BMPR2 mutation that results in an in-frame deletion of BMPR2 EXON2 (BMPR2ΔEx2) in HPAH patient-derived lymphocytes and in pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) from mice carrying the same in-frame deletion of Exon 2 (Bmpr2ΔEx2/+ mice). The endogenous BMPR2ΔEx2 mutant product does not reach the cell surface and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, chemical chaperones 4-PBA and TUDCA partially restore cell surface expression of Bmpr2ΔEx2 in PECs, suggesting that the mutant product is mis-folded. We also show that PECs from Bmpr2ΔEx2/+ mice have defects in the BMP-induced Smad1/5/8 and Id1 signaling axis, and that addition of chemical chaperones restores expression of the Smad1/5/8 target Id1. These data indicate that the endogenous NMD negative BMPRΔEx2 mutant product is expressed but has a folding defect resulting in ER retention. Partial correction of this folding defect and restoration of defective BMP signaling using chemical chaperones suggests that protein-folding agents could be used therapeutically in patients with these NMD negative BMPR2 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2129449220,"Blast-induced traumatic brain injury has dramatically increased in combat troops in today’s military operations. We previously reported that antioxidant treatment can provide protection to the peripheral auditory end organ, the cochlea. In the present study, we examined biomarker expression in the brains of rats at different time points (3 hours to 21 days) after three successive 14 psi blast overpressure exposures to evaluate antioxidant treatment effects on blast-induced brain injury. Rats in the treatment groups received a combination of antioxidants (2,4-disulfonyl α-phenyl tertiary butyl nitrone and N-acetylcysteine) one hour after blast exposure and then twice a day for the following two days. The biomarkers examined included an oxidative stress marker (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, 4-HNE), an immediate early gene (c-fos), a neural injury marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and two axonal injury markers [amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein, APP, and 68 kDa neurofilament, NF-68]. The results demonstrate that blast exposure induced or up-regulated the following: 4-HNE production in the dorsal hippocampus commissure and the forceps major corpus callosum near the lateral ventricle; c-fos and GFAP expression in most regions of the brain, including the retrosplenial cortex, the hippocampus, the cochlear nucleus, and the inferior colliculus; and NF-68 and APP expression in the hippocampus, the auditory cortex, and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Antioxidant treatment reduced the following: 4-HNE in the hippocampus and the forceps major corpus callosum, c-fos expression in the retrosplenial cortex, GFAP expression in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), and APP and NF-68 expression in the hippocampus, auditory cortex, and MGN. This preliminary study indicates that antioxidant treatment may provide therapeutic protection to the central auditory pathway (the DCN and MGN) and the non-auditory central nervous system (hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex), suggesting that these compounds have the potential to simultaneously treat blast-induced injuries in the brain and auditory system."
https://openalex.org/W1984055044,"Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical features and prognostic factors of surgical outcome of foot drop caused by lumbar degenerative disease and put forward the clinical stage. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 135 patients with foot drop due to lumbar degenerative disease. The clinical features and mechanism were analyzed. Age, sex, duration of palsy, preoperative muscle strength of tibialis anterior (TA), sensation defect of affected lower limb, affected foot, diagnosis and compressed nerve roots were recorded and compared with surgical outcome. Results Foot drop was observed in 8.1% of all inpatients of lumbar degenerative disease. L5 nerve root compression was observed in 126 of all 135 patients (93.3%). Single, double and triple roots compression was observed respectively in 43, 83, and 9 patients (31.9%, 61.5%, and 6.6%). But there was no significant relationship between preoperative muscle strength of TA and the number of compressed roots. The muscle strength of TA was improved in 113 (83.7%) patients after surgery, but it reached to >=4 in only 21 (15.6%) patients. Improvement of the muscle strength of TA was almost stable at the 6-month follow-up. At the last follow-up, the muscle strength of TA was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively in 28, 24, 62, 13, 8 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed duration of palsy (p=0.0360, OR=2.543), preoperative muscle strength of TA (p=0.0064, OR=5.528) and age (p=0.0309, OR=3.208) were factors that influenced recovery following an operation. Conclusions L5 nerve root was most frequently affected. The muscle strength of TA improved in most patients after surgery, but few patients can get a good recovery from foot drop. Patients of shorter duration of palsy, better preoperative muscle strength of TA and younger age showed a better surgical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1984583460,"KLK12, a kallikrein peptidase, is thought to take part in the control of angiogenesis. Our analysis of the secretome of endothelial cells (ECs) that had been treated with KLK12 showed that KLK12 converts the extracellular matrix- or membrane-bound precursor of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) into a soluble form. Both PDGF-B and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) take part in the induction of angiogenesis by KLK12 in a coculture model of angiogenesis that mimics endothelial tubule formation. We used a cellular approach to analyze the interplay between KLK12, PDGF-B, and VEGF-A and showed that release of PDGF-B by KLK12 leads to the fibroblastmediated secretion of VEGF-A. This then stimulates EC differentiation and the formation of capillary tube-like structures. Thus, KLK12 favors the interaction of ECs and stromal cells. The released PDGF-B acts as a paracrine factor that modulates VEGF-A secretion by stromal cells, which ultimately leads to angiogenesis. Moreover, the genes encoding KLK12 and PDGFB are both expressed in ECs and up-regulated in tumor cells kept under hypoxic conditions, which is consistent with the physiological involvement of KLK12 in PDGF-B maturation.—Kryza, T., Achard, C., Parent, C., Marchand-Adam, S., Guillon-Munos, A., Iochmann, S., Korkmaz, B., Respaud, R., Courty, Y., Heuzé-Vourc'h, N.

https://openalex.org/W1991060586,"Background Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a highly aggressive malignancy, has a poor prognosis, and the consensus on the most effective treatment is needed. Methods Clinical data from all ATC patients treated in our institution over a 30-year period (between May 1980 and May 2010) were analyzed retrospectively with regard to mortality and survival rates (Kaplan–Meier). Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results Sixty cases were analyzed. The overall 1- and 3-year survival rates were 35.0% and 22.9%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the best prognosis was seen in patients younger than 55 years, those without distant metastases, those with white blood cell (WBC) counts < 10.0 × 109/L or blood platelet (PLT) counts < 300.0 × 109/L at presentation, those who did not receive chemotherapy, and those who received radiotherapy doses ≥ 40 Gy or underwent surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy. According to multivariate analysis, the WBC count at first presentation and the type of therapeutic regimen independently influenced survival. Conclusions We found that the elevated peripheral PLT count may be an adverse prognostic factor of ATC patients. The prognosis for ATC is especially poor for patients with distant metastasis, a WBC count ≥ 10.0×109/L, a PLT count ≥ 300.0 × 109/L, or age ≥ 55 years. WBC count at presentation and surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy independently influenced the prognosis. Intensive treatment combining surgery with postoperative radiotherapy is recommended for ATC patients with stage IVA/B disease."
https://openalex.org/W2117240435,"The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of overweight, general obesity, and abdominal obesity and examine their associations with socioeconomic status in a rural Chinese adult population.This cross-sectional study was performed on 15,236 participants ≥ 35 years of age (6,313 men [41.4%] and 8,923 women [58.6%]). Each participant's weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and hipline circumference (HC) were measured, and demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using questionnaires.The mean body mass index (BMI) values were 23.31 ± 2.96 and 23.89 ± 3.23 kg m(-2) and the mean WC values were 79.13 ± 8.43 and 79.54 ± 8.27 cm for men and women, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence rates of overweight (BMI ≥ 24.0 kg m(-2)), general obesity (BMI ≥ 28.0 kg m(-2)), and abdominal obesity (WC ≥ 85 cm for men and ≥ 80 cm for women) were 32.0%, 6.7%, and 27.0% for men and 35.1%, 9.7%, and 48.3% for women, respectively. All gender differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). In addition, the age-specific prevalence rates of general and abdominal obesity slowly decreased among men but sharply increased among women as age increased (p < 0.001). In subsequent logistic regression analysis, educational level was negatively associated with both general obesity and abdominal obesity among women but positively associated with abdominal obesity among men. No significant correlation was found between obesity and income.These results suggest a high prevalence of obesity which might differ by gender and age, and an inverse association among women and a mixed association among men noted between education and obesity in our locality. Preventive and therapeutic programs are warranted to control this serious public health problem. The gender-specific characteristics of populations at high-risk of developing obesity should be taken into consideration when designing interventional programs."
https://openalex.org/W1997759416,"Neurovascular coupling (NVC) in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is a mechanism that provides regions of the brain with more oxygen and glucose upon increased levels of neural activation. Hemodynamic changes that go along with neural activation evoke a blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that can be used to study brain activity non-invasively. A correct correlation of the BOLD signal to neural activity is pivotal to understand this signal in neuronal development, health and disease. However, the function of NVC during development is largely unknown. The rodent whisker-to-barrel cortex is an experimentally well established model to study neurovascular interdependences. Using extracellular multi-electrode recordings and laser-Doppler-flowmetry (LDF) we show in the murine barrel cortex of postnatal day 7 (P7) and P30 mice in vivo that NVC undergoes a physiological shift during the first month of life. In the mature CNS it is well accepted that cortical sensory processing results in a rise in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). We show in P7 animals that rCBF decreases during prolonged multi-whisker stimulation and goes along with multi unit activity (MUA) fatigue. In contrast at P30, MUA remains stable during repetitive stimulation and is associated with an increase in rCBF. Further we characterize in both age groups the responses in NVC to single sensory stimuli. We suggest that the observed shift in NVC is an important process in cortical development that may be of high relevance for the correct interpretation of brain activity e.g. in fMRI studies of the immature central nervous system (CNS)."
https://openalex.org/W2155719221,"Rrp6 is a conserved catalytic subunit of the eukaryotic nuclear exosome ribonuclease complex that functions in the productive 3' end maturation of stable RNAs, the degradation of transiently expressed noncoding transcripts and in discard pathways that eradicate the cell of incorrectly processed or assembled RNAs. The function of Rrp6 in these pathways is at least partially dependent upon its interaction with a small nuclear protein called Rrp47/Lrp1, but the underlying mechanism(s) by which Rrp47 functions in concert with Rrp6 are not established. Previous work on yeast grown in rich medium has suggested that Rrp6 expression is not markedly reduced in strains lacking Rrp47. Here we show that Rrp6 expression in rrp47∆ mutants is substantially reduced during growth in minimal medium through effects on both transcript levels and protein stability. Exogenous expression of Rrp6 enables normal levels to be attained in rrp47∆ mutants. Strikingly, exogenous expression of Rrp6 suppresses many, but not all, of the RNA processing and maturation defects observed in an rrp47∆ mutant and complements the synthetic lethality of rrp47∆ mpp6∆ and rrp47∆ rex1∆ double mutants. Increased Rrp6 expression in the resultant rrp47∆ rex1∆ double mutant suppresses the defect in the 3' maturation of box C/D snoRNAs. In contrast, increased Rrp6 expression in the rrp47∆ mpp6∆ double mutant diminishes the block in the turnover of CUTs and in the degradation of the substrates of RNA discard pathways. These results demonstrate that a principal function of Rrp47 is to facilitate appropriate expression levels of Rrp6 and support the conclusion that the Rrp6/Rrp47 complex and Rex1 provide redundant exonuclease activities for the 3' end maturation of box C/D snoRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1973601749,"Hybridization has the potential to contribute to phenotypic and genetic variation and can be a major evolutionary mechanism. However, when hybridization is extensive it can also lead to the blurring of species boundaries and the emergence of cryptic species (i.e., two or more species not distinguishable morphologically). In this study, we address this hypothesis in Epidendrum, the largest Neotropical genus of orchids where hybridization is apparently so common that it may explain the high levels of morphological diversity found. Nonetheless, this hypothesis is mostly based on the intermediacy of morphological characters and intermediacy by itself is not a proof of hybridization. Therefore, in this study, we first assessed the existence of hybrids using cpDNA and AFLP data gathered from a large-scale sampling comprising 1038 plants of three species of Epidendrum (E. calanthum, E. cochlidium and E. schistochilum). Subsequently, a Bayesian assignment of individuals into different genetic classes (pure species, F1, F2 or backcross generations) revealed that hybrid genotypes were prevalent in all sympatric populations. In most cases, parental species were not assigned as pure individuals, rather consisting in backcrossed genotypes or F1 hybrids. We also found that reproductive barriers are apparently very weak in Epidendrum because the three species largely overlapped in their flowering periods and interspecific crosses always produced viable seeds. Further, hybridization contributed to enhance floral variability, genome size and reproductive success since we found that these traits were always higher in hybrid classes (F1, F2 and backcrosses) than in pure parental species, and offer an explanation for the blurring of species boundaries in this genus of orchids. We hypothesize that these natural hybrids possess an evolutionary advantage, which may explain the high rates of cryptic species observed in this genus."
https://openalex.org/W2018414133,"β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but its physiological function is largely undetermined. APP has been found to regulate retrograde transport of nerve growth factor (NGF), which plays a crucial role in mediating neuronal survival and differentiation. Herein, we reveal the mechanism underlying APP-mediated NGF trafficking, by demonstrating a direct interaction between APP and the two NGF receptors, TrkA and p75NTR. Downregulation of APP leads to reduced cell surface levels of TrkA/p75NTR and increased endocytosis of TrkA/p75NTR and NGF. In addition, APP-deficient cells manifest defects in neurite outgrowth and are more susceptible to Aβ-induced neuronal death at physiological levels of NGF. However, APP-deficient cells show better responses to NGF-stimulated differentiation and survival than control cells. This may be attributed to increased receptor endocytosis and enhanced activation of Akt and MAPK upon NGF stimulation in APP-deficient cells. Together, our results suggest that APP mediates endocytosis of NGF receptors through direct interaction, thereby regulating endocytosis of NGF and NGF-induced downstream signaling pathways for neuronal survival and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2024300454,"Background Most epidemiological studies of calcium intake and mortality risk have been conducted in populations with moderate to high calcium intake, and limited studies have focused on populations with low habitual calcium intake (i.e., mean dietary calcium intake <700 mg/d). Objective This study investigated the association between dietary calcium intake and death from all causes and cardiovascular disease in Chinese population with low habitual calcium intake. Design Data from 3,139 Chinese men and women in a population-based prospective cohort study, aged >=65 years and free of heart diseases or stroke at baseline, were analyzed. Primary outcome measures, identified from the death registry, were death from all causes and cardiovascular disease. Dietary calcium intake assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire was categorized into sex-specific quartiles. Data on use of supplemental calcium (yes or no) including individual calcium supplements and other calcium containing supplement were collected. Cox regression models adjusted for demographic and lifestyle variables were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results During a median of 9.1 years of follow-up, 529 all-cause deaths (344 men, 185 women) and 114 (74 men, 40 women) deaths from cardiovascular disease were identified. An inverse trend between dietary calcium intake and mortality was observed. Compared with the lowest quartile (<458 mg/d for men, <417 mg/d for women), the highest quartile of dietary calcium intake (>762 mg/d for men, >688 mg/d for women) had a significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality (multivariate HR=0.63, 95% CI=0.49-0.81, Ptrend<0.001) but an insignificant decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality (multivariate HR=0.70, 95% CI=0.41-1.21, Ptrend=0.228). Similar inverse association was observed when the analyses were stratified on calcium supplemental use. Conclusions Higher intake of dietary calcium was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and possibly cardiovascular mortality in Chinese older people with low habitual calcium intake."
https://openalex.org/W1980104349,"Widely expressed in the adult central nervous system, the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is implicated in a variety of processes, including neuronal excitability. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) was first identified as a PrP(C) interactor using in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking of wild type (WT) mouse brain. This finding was confirmed in three cell lines and, because DPP6 directs the functional assembly of K(+) channels, we assessed the impact of WT and mutant PrP(C) upon Kv4.2-based cell surface macromolecular complexes. Whereas a Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease version of PrP with eight extra octarepeats was a loss of function both for complex formation and for modulation of Kv4.2 channels, WT PrP(C), in a DPP6-dependent manner, modulated Kv4.2 channel properties, causing an increase in peak amplitude, a rightward shift of the voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation curve, a slower inactivation, and a faster recovery from steady-state inactivation. Thus, the net impact of wt PrP(C) was one of enhancement, which plays a critical role in the down-regulation of neuronal membrane excitability and is associated with a decreased susceptibility to seizures. Insofar as previous work has established a requirement for WT PrP(C) in the Aβ-dependent modulation of excitability in cholinergic basal forebrain neurons, our findings implicate PrP(C) regulation of Kv4.2 channels as a mechanism contributing to the effects of oligomeric Aβ upon neuronal excitability and viability."
https://openalex.org/W1975916633,"Isolation of gene transcripts from desiccated leaf tissues of the resurrection grass, Sporobolus stapfianus, resulted in the identification of a gene, SDG8i, encoding a Group 1 glycosyltransferase (UGT). Here, we examine the effects of introducing this gene, under control of the CaMV35S promoter, into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Results show that Arabidopsis plants constitutively over-expressing SDG8i exhibit enhanced growth, reduced senescence, cold tolerance and a substantial improvement in protoplasmic drought tolerance. We hypothesise that expression of SDG8i in Arabidopsis negatively affects the bioactivity of metabolite/s that mediate/s environmentally-induced repression of cell division and expansion, both during normal development and in response to stress. The phenotype of transgenic plants over-expressing SDG8i suggests modulation in activities of both growth- and stress-related hormones. Plants overexpressing the UGT show evidence of elevated auxin levels, with the enzyme acting downstream of ABA to reduce drought-induced senescence. Analysis of the in vitro activity of the UGT recombinant protein product demonstrates that SDG8i can glycosylate the synthetic strigolactone analogue GR24, evoking a link with strigolactone-related processes in vivo. The large improvements observed in survival of transgenic Arabidopsis plants under cold-, salt- and drought-stress, as well as the substantial increases in growth rate and seed yield under non-stress conditions, indicates that overexpression of SDG8i in crop plants may provide a novel means of increasing plant productivity."

We addressed this knowledge gap by using tri-axial accelerometer data loggers attached to VHF radio collars to examine activity patterns of adult male and female koalas in a high-density population at Cape Otway, Victoria, Australia. Data were obtained from 27 adult koalas over two 7-d periods during the breeding season: 12 in the early-breeding season in November 2010, and 15 in the late-breeding season in January 2011. Multiple 15 minute observation blocks on each animal were used for validation of activity patterns determined from the accelerometer data loggers. Accelerometry was effective in distinguishing between inactive (sleeping, resting) and active (grooming, feeding and moving) behaviors. Koalas were more active during the early-breeding season with a higher index of movement (overall dynamic body acceleration [ODBA]) for both males and females. Koalas showed a distinct temporal pattern of behavior, with most activity occurring from mid-afternoon to early morning. Accelerometry has potential for examining fine-scale behavior of a wide range of arboreal and terrestrial species."
https://openalex.org/W2035558465,"Language has been extensively investigated by functional neuroimaging studies. However, only a limited number of structural neuroimaging studies have examined the relationship between language performance and brain structure in healthy adults, and the number is even less in older adults. The present study sought to investigate correlations between grey matter volumes and three standardized language tests in late life. The participants were 344 non-demented, community-dwelling adults aged 70-90 years, who were drawn from the population-based Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. The three language tests included the Controlled Oral Word Association Task (COWAT), Category Fluency (CF), and Boston Naming Test (BNT). Correlation analyses between voxel-wise GM volumes and language tests showed distinctive GM correlation patterns for each language test. The GM correlates were located in the right frontal and left temporal lobes for COWAT, in the left frontal and temporal lobes for CF, and in bilateral temporal lobes for BNT. Our findings largely corresponded to the neural substrates of language tasks revealed in fMRI studies, and we also observed a less hemispheric asymmetry in the GM correlates of the language tests. Furthermore, we divided the participants into two age groups (70-79 and 80-90 years old), and then examined the correlations between structural laterality indices and language performance for each group. A trend toward significant difference in the correlations was found between the two age groups, with stronger correlations in the group of 70-79 years old than those in the group of 80-90 years old. This difference might suggest a further decline of language lateralization in different stages of late life."
https://openalex.org/W2005059392,"The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe secretes the extracellular maltase Agl1, which hydrolyzes maltose into glucose, thereby utilizing maltose as a carbon source. Whether other maltases contribute to efficient utilization of maltose and how Agl1 expression is regulated in response to switching of carbon sources are unknown. In this study, we show that three other possible maltases and the maltose transporter Sut1 are not required for efficient utilization of maltose. Transcription of agl1 was induced when the carbon source was changed from glucose to maltose. This was dependent on Atf1 and Pcr1, which are highly conserved transcription factors that regulate stress-responsive genes in various stress conditions. Atf1 and Pcr1 generally bind the TGACGT motif as a heterodimer. The agl1 gene lacks the exact motif, but has many degenerate TGACGT motifs in its promoter and coding region. When the carbon source was switched from glucose to maltose, Atf1 and Pcr1 associated with the promoters and coding regions of agl1, fbp1, and gpx1, indicating that the Atf1-Pcr1 heteromer binds a variety of regions in its target genes to induce their transcription. In addition, the association of Mediator with these genes was dependent on Atf1 and Pcr1. These data indicate that Atf1 and Pcr1 induce the transcription of agl1, which allows efficient utilization of extracellular maltose."

The new system for rhG-CSF purification was performed using not only temperature shift strategy without isopropyl-l-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) induction but also the purification method by a single step of prep-HPLC after the pH precipitation of the refolded samples. Through these processes, the final cell density and overall yield of homogenous rhG-CSF were obtained 42.8 g as dry cell weights, 1.75 g as purified active proteins, from 1 L culture broth, respectively. The purity of rhG-CSF was finally 99% since the isoforms of rhG-CSF could be separated through the prep-HPLC step. The result of biological activity indicated that purified rhG-CSF has a similar profile to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2nd International Standard for G-CSF. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the simple purification through a single step of prep-HPLC may be valuable for the industrial-scale production of biologically active proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2043841716,"Mutations in the human KCNE3 potassium channel ancillary subunit gene are associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Most genes underlying inherited cardiac arrhythmias, including KCNE3, are not exclusively expressed in the heart, suggesting potentially complex disease etiologies. Here we investigated mechanisms of KCNE3-linked arrhythmogenesis in Kcne3-/- mice using real-time qPCR, echo- and electrocardiography, ventricular myocyte patch-clamp, coronary artery ligation/reperfusion, blood analysis, cardiac synaptosome exocytosis, microarray and pathway analysis, and multitissue histology. Kcne3 transcript was undetectable in adult mouse atria, ventricles, and adrenal glands, but Kcne3-/- mice exhibited 2.3-fold elevated serum aldosterone (P= 0.003) and differentially expressed gene networks consistent with an adrenal-targeted autoimmune response. Furthermore, 8/8 Kcne3-/- mice vs. 0/8 Kcne3+/+ mice exhibited an activated-lymphocyte adrenal infiltration (P=0.0002). Kcne3 deletion also caused aldosterone-dependent ventricular repolarization delay (19.6% mean QTc prolongation in females; P<0.05) and aldosterone-dependent predisposition to postischemia arrhythmogenesis. Thus, 5/11 Kcne3-/- mice vs. 0/10 Kcne3+/+ mice exhibited sustained ventricular tachycardia during reperfusion (P<0.05). Kcne3 deletion is therefore arrhythmogenic by a novel mechanism in which secondary hyperaldosteronism, associated with an adrenal-specific lymphocyte infiltration, impairs ventricular repolarization. The findings highlight the importance of considering extracardiac pathogenesis when investigating arrhythmogenic mechanisms, even in inherited, monogenic channelopathies.—Hu, Z., Crump, S.

In this study, we attempt to determine the occurrence and pathways of gene flow and the degree of genetic similarity between sympatric resident and anadromous O. mykiss in three river systems, and investigate whether resident O. mykiss are producing anadromous offspring in these rivers, two of which have complete barriers to upstream migration. We found that the population structure of the O. mykiss in these rivers appears to be influenced more by the presence of a barrier to upstream migration than by life history type. The sex ratio of resident O. mykiss located above a barrier, and smolts captured in screw traps was significantly skewed in favor of females, whereas the reverse was true below the barriers, suggesting that male resident O. mykiss readily migrate downstream over the barrier, and that precocious male maturation may be occurring in the anadromous populations. Through paternity analyses, we also provide direct confirmation that resident O. mykiss can produce offspring that become anadromous. Most (89%) of the resident O. mykiss that produced anadromous offspring were males. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that shows that gene flow does readily occur between sympatric resident and anadromous O. mykiss life history types, and indicates that resident O. mykiss populations may be a potential repository of genes for the anadromous life history type."
https://openalex.org/W2054374004,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of death among males. It is currently estimated that inflammatory responses are linked to 15-20% of all deaths from cancer worldwide. PCa is dominated by complications arising from metastasis to the bone where the tumor cells interact with the bone microenvironment impairing the balance between bone formation and degradation. However, the molecular nature of this interaction is not completely understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counteracts oxidative damage and inflammation. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that HO-1 is implicated in PCa, demonstrating that endogenous HO-1 inhibits bone derived-prostate cancer cells proliferation, invasion and migration and decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of HO-1 modulated PCa cells on osteoblasts proliferation in vitro and on bone remodeling in vivo. Using a co-culture system of PC3 cells with primary mice osteoblasts (PMOs), we demonstrated that HO-1 pharmacological induction (hemin treatment) abrogated the diminution of PMOs proliferation induced by PCa cells and decreased the expression of osteoclast-modulating factors in osteoblasts. No changes were detected in the expression of genes involved in osteoblasts differentiation. However, co-culture of hemin pre-treated PC3 cells (PC3 Hem) with PMOs provoked an oxidative status and activated FoxO signaling in osteoblasts. The percentage of active osteoblasts positive for HO-1 increased in calvarias explants co-cultured with PC3 Hem cells. Nuclear HO-1 expression was detected in tumors generated by in vivo bone injection of HO-1 stable transfected PC3 (PC3HO-1) cells in the femur of SCID mice. These results suggest that HO-1 has the potential to modify the bone microenvironment impacting on PCa bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2001581980,"Isoaspartate (isoAsp) formation is a major source of protein damage that is kept in check by the repair function of protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT). Mice deficient in PIMT accumulate isoAsp-containing proteins, resulting in cognitive deficits, abnormal neuronal physiology and cytoarchitecture, and fatal epileptic seizures 30–60 days after birth. Synapsins I and II, dynamin-1, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), and α/β-tubulin are major targets of PIMT in brain. To investigate links between isoAsp accumulation and the neurological phenotype of the KO mice, we used Western blotting to compare patterns of in vivo phosphorylation or acetylation of the major PIMT targets listed above. Phosphorylations of synapsins I and II at Ser-9 were increased in female KO vs. WT mice, and acetylation of tubulin at Lys-40 was decreased in male KO vs. WT mice. Average levels of dynamin-1 phosphorylation at Ser-778 and Ser-795 were higher in male KO vs. WT mice, but the statistical significance (P>0.1) was low. No changes in phosphorylation were found in synapsins I and II at Ser-603, in CRMP2 at Ser-522 or Thr-514, in DARPP-32 at Thr-34, or in PDK1 at Ser-241. General levels of phosphorylation assessed with Pro-Q Diamond stain, or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, appeared similar in the WT and KO mice. We conclude that isoAsp accumulation is associated with altered functional status of several neuronal proteins that are highly susceptible to this type of damage. We also uncovered unexpected differences in how male and female mice respond to isoAsp accumulation in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2016125665,"Fenugreek is a medicinal plant whose seeds are widely used in traditional medicine, mainly for its laxative, galactagogue and antidiabetic effects. However, consumption of fenugreek seeds during pregnancy has been associated with a range of congenital malformations, including hydrocephalus, anencephaly and spina bifida in humans. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of prenatal treatment of fenugreek seeds on the development of sensorimotor functions from birth to young adults. Pregnant mice were treated by gavage with 1g/kg/day of lyophilized fenugreek seeds aqueous extract (FSAE) or distilled water during the gestational period. Behavioral tests revealed in prenatally treated mice a significant delay in righting, cliff avoidance, negative geotaxis responses and the swimming development. In addition, extracellular recording of motor output in spinal cord isolated from neonatal mice showed that the frequency of spontaneous activity and fictive locomotion was reduced in FSAE-exposed mice. On the other hand, the cross-correlation coefficient in control mice was significantly more negative than in treated animals indicating that alternating patterns are deteriorated in FSAE-treated animals. At advanced age, prenatally treated mice displayed altered locomotor coordination in the rotarod test and also changes in static and dynamic parameters assessed by the CatWalk automated gait analysis system. We conclude that FSAE impairs sensorimotor and coordination functions not only in neonates but also in adult mice. Moreover, spinal neuronal networks are less excitable in prenatally FSAE-exposed mice suggesting that modifications within the central nervous system are responsible, at least in part, for the motor impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2062907236,"This study investigates the long term economic impact of severe obstetric complications for women and their children in Burkina Faso, focusing on measures of food security, expenditures and related quality of life measures. It uses a hospital based cohort, first visited in 2004/2005 and followed up four years later. This cohort of 1014 women consisted of two main groups of comparison: 677 women who had an uncomplicated delivery and 337 women who experienced a severe obstetric complication which would have almost certainly caused death had they not received hospital care (labelled a ""near miss"" event). To analyze the impact of such near miss events as well as the possible interaction with the pregnancy outcome, we compared household and individual level indicators between women without a near miss event and women with a near miss event who either had a live birth, a perinatal death or an early pregnancy loss. We used propensity score matching to remove initial selection bias. Although we found limited effects for the whole group of near miss women, the results indicated negative impacts: a) for near miss women with a live birth, on child development and education, on relatively expensive food consumption and on women's quality of life; b) for near miss women with perinatal death, on relatively expensive foods consumption and children's education and c) for near miss women who had an early pregnancy loss, on overall food security. Our results showed that severe obstetric complications have long lasting consequences for different groups of women and their children and highlighted the need for carefully targeted interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2082478996,"Recent studies in patients suffering from inflammatory autoimmune myopathies suggested that moderate exercise training improves or at least stabilizes muscle strength and function without inducing disease ﬂares. However, the precise mechanisms involved in this beneficial effect have not been extensively studied. Here we used a model of in vitro stretched C2C12 myoblasts to investigate whether mechanical stretch could influence myoblast proliferation or the expression of proinflammatory genes. Our results demonstrated that cyclic mechanical stretch stimulated C2C12 cell cycling and early up-regulation of the molecules related to mechanical-stretch pathway in muscle (calmodulin, nNOS, MMP-2, HGF and c-Met). Unexpectedly, mechanical stretch also reduced the expression of TLR3 and of proteins known to represent autoantigens in inflammatory autoimmune myopathies (Mi-2, HRS, DNA-PKcs, U1-70). Interestingly, stimulation or inhibition of calmodulin, NOS, HGF or c-Met molecules in vitro affected the expression of autoantigens and TLR3 proteins confirming their role in the inhibition of autoantigens and TLR3 during mechanical stretch. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time that mechanical stretch could be beneficial by reducing expression of muscle autoantigens and of pro-inflammatory TLR3 and may provide new insight to understand how resistance training can reduce the symptoms associated with myositis."
https://openalex.org/W1982113188,"Purpose To evaluate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in a study of cross-modal plasticity in the visual cortex of binocular blindness macaque monkeys. Materials and Methods Four healthy neonatal macaque monkeys were randomly divided into 2 groups, with 2 in each group. Optic nerve transection was performed in both monkeys in the experimental group (group B) to obtain binocular blindness. Two healthy macaque monkeys served as a control group (group A). After sixteen months post-procedure, 1H-MRS was performed in the visual cortex of all monkeys. We compared the peak areas of NAA, Cr, Cho, Glx and Ins and the ratios of NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, Glx/Cr and Ins/Cr of each monkey in group B with group A. Results The peak area of NAA and the NAA/Cr ratio in the visual cortex of monkey 4 in group B were found to be dramatically decreased, the peak area of NAA slightly decreased and the NAA/Cr ratio clearly decreased in visual cortex of monkey 3 in group B than those in group A. The peak area of Ins and the Ins/Cr ratio in the visual cortex of monkey 4 in group B slightly increased. The peak area of Cho and the Cho/Cr ratio in the visual cortex of all monkeys in group B dramatically increased compared with group A. The peak area of Glx in the visual cortex of all monkeys in group B slightly increased compared with group A. Conclusions 1H-MRS could detect biochemical and metabolic changes in the visual cortex and therefore this technique can be used to provide valuable information for investigating the mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity of binocular blindness in a macaque monkey model."
https://openalex.org/W2029054155,"The role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in the development of vascular diseases remains incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new small-molecule multi-FGF receptor blocker with allosteric properties, SSR128129E, on neointimal proliferation after a vein graft procedure in mice and on the development of atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice.Vein grafts were performed in 3 month-old male C57BL6 mice. Segments of the vena cava were interposed at the level of the carotid artery. In SSR128129E (50 mg/kg/d)-treated animals, a dramatic decrease in neointimal proliferation was observed 2 and 8 weeks after the graft (72.5%, p<0.01, and 47.8%, p<0.05, respectively). Four-week old male apoE-deficient mice were treated with SSR128129E (50 mg/kg/d) for 3 and 5 months in comparison with a control group. SSR128129E treatment resulted in a reduction of lesion size in the aortic sinus (16.4% (ns) at 3 months and 42.9% (p<0.01) at 5 months, without any change in serum lipids. SSR128129 significantly reduced FGFR2 mRNA levels in the aortic sinus (p<0.05, n=5-6), but did not affect the mRNA expression levels of other FGF receptors or ligands.These studies indicate that FGFs have an important role in the development of vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and graft arteriosclerosis. These data suggest that inhibition of FGF receptors by compounds like SSR128129E might be useful as a new therapeutic approach for these vascular pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2041363073,"Restriction enzyme (REase) RM.BpuSI can be described as a Type IIS/C/G REase for its cleavage site outside of the recognition sequence (Type IIS), bifunctional polypeptide possessing both methyltransferase (MTase) and endonuclease activities (Type IIC) and endonuclease activity stimulated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) (Type IIG). The stimulatory effect of SAM on cleavage activity presents a major paradox: a co-factor of the MTase activity that renders the substrate unsusceptible to cleavage enhances the cleavage activity. Here we show that the RM.BpuSI MTase activity modifies both cleavage substrate and product only when they are unmethylated. The MTase activity is, however, much lower than that of M1.BpuSI and is thought not to be the major MTase for host DNA protection. SAM and sinefungin (SIN) increase the Vmax of the RM.BpuSI cleavage activity with a proportional change in Km, suggesting the presence of an energetically more favorable pathway is taken. We further showed that RM.BpuSI undergoes substantial conformational changes in the presence of Ca(2+), SIN, cleavage substrate and/or product. Distinct conformers are inferred as the pre-cleavage/cleavage state (in the presence of Ca(2+), substrate or both) and MTase state (in the presence of SIN and substrate, SIN and product or product alone). Interestingly, RM.BpuSI adopts a unique conformation when only SIN is present. This SIN-bound state is inferred as a branch point for cleavage and MTase activity and an intermediate to an energetically favorable pathway for cleavage, probably through increasing the binding affinity of the substrate to the enzyme under cleavage conditions. Mutation of a SAM-binding residue resulted in altered conformational changes in the presence of substrate or Ca(2+) and eliminated cleavage activity. The present study underscores the role of the MTase domain as facilitator of efficient cleavage activity for RM.BpuSI."
https://openalex.org/W2124651595,"The current global spread of multi-resistant Gram-negatives, particularly extended spectrum β-lactamases expressing bacteria, increases the likelihood of inappropriate empiric treatment of critically ill patients with subsequently increased mortality. From a clinical perspective, fast detection of resistant pathogens would allow a pre-emptive correction of an initially inappropriate treatment. Here we present diagnostic amplification-sequencing approach as proof of principal based on the fast molecular detection and correct discrimination of CTX-M-β-lactamases, the most frequent ESBL family. The workflow consists of the isolation of total mRNA and CTX-M-specific reverse transcription (RT), amplification and pyrosequencing. Due to the high variability of the CTX-M-β-lactamase-genes, degenerated primers for RT, qRT as well as for pyrosequencing, were used and the suitability and discriminatory performance of two conserved positions within the CTX-M genes were analyzed, using one protocol for all isolates and positions, respectively. Using this approach, no information regarding the expected CTX-M variant is needed since all sequences are covered by these degenerated primers. The presented workflow can be conducted within eight hours and has the potential to be expanded to other β-lactamase families."
https://openalex.org/W2170644650,"Social responsibility links personal behavior with societal expectations and plays a key role in affecting an agent’s emotional state following a decision. However, the neural basis of responsibility attribution remains unclear. In two previous event-related brain potential (ERP) studies we found that personal responsibility modulated outcome evaluation in gambling tasks. Here we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify particular brain regions that mediate responsibility attribution. In a context involving team cooperation, participants completed a task with their teammates and on each trial received feedback about team success and individual success sequentially. We found that brain activity differed between conditions involving team success vs. team failure. Further, different brain regions were associated with reinforcement of behavior by social praise vs. monetary reward. Specifically, right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) was associated with social pride whereas dorsal striatum and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were related to reinforcement of behaviors leading to personal gain. The present study provides evidence that the RTPJ is an important region for determining whether self-generated behaviors are deserving of praise in a social context."
https://openalex.org/W2048957764,"In humans, emaciation from long-term dietary deficiencies, such as anorexia, reportedly increases physical activity and brain atrophy. However, the effects of single short-term fasting on brain tissue or behavioral activity patterns remain unclear. To clarify the impact of malnutrition on brain function, we conducted a single short-term fasting study as an anorexia model using male adult mice and determined if changes occurred in migratory behavior as an expression of brain function and in brain tissue structure. Sixteen-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were divided into either the fasted group or the control group. Experiments were conducted in a fixed indoor environment. We examined the effects of fasting on the number of nerve cells, structural changes in the myelin and axon density, and brain atrophy. For behavior observation, the amount of food and water consumed, ingestion time, and the pattern of movement were measured using a time-recording system. The fasted mice showed a significant increase in physical activity and their rhythm of movement was disturbed. Since the brain was in an abnormal state after fasting, mice that were normally active during the night became active regardless of day or night and performed strenuous exercise at a high frequency. The brain weight did not change by a fast, and brain atrophy was not observed. Although no textural change was apparent by fasting, the neuronal neogenesis in the subventricular zone and hippocampus was inhibited, causing disorder of the brain function. A clear association between the suppression of encephalic neuropoiesis and overactivity was not established. However, it is interesting that the results of this study suggest that single short-term fasting has an effect on encephalic neuropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004821621,"Coastal vegetation comprises a number of coastal specialists and terrestrial generalists. It remains unclear how they persist on disturbed and undisturbed coastal conditions. We tested the hypothesis that coastal specialists may be superior to terrestrial generalists on supratidal zones of coasts, but their superiority can be influenced by human disturbances. Eight separate sandy coasts of the Shandong Peninsula were sampled, representing for disturbed and undisturbed sandy coasts. Plants growing on their supratidal zones were surveyed. On this basis, we compared the relative dominances, niche widths, and commonness of all species, and also analyzed species diversities of the coasts. Coastal specialists were found to be more common and widespread on supratidal zones of the sandy coasts than terrestrial generalists haphazardly invading from hinterlands. Coastal specialists exhibited lower Sørensen dissimilarities than terrestrial generalists among the coasts. Tourist trampling seemed more detrimental than pond fishery to coastal vegetation. Relative to terrestrial generalists, coastal specialists responded to human disturbances more deterministically, with steady decreases in species diversities. These evidences verify that coastal specialists are intrinsically superior to terrestrial generalists on supratidal zones of coasts, especially of undisturbed coasts, because their dispersal among coasts adapts well to local storm surge regime. They also validate that human disturbances can depress the superiority of coastal specialists, partly by inducing invasion of terrestrial generalists."
