https://openalex.org/W2056782561,"According to the disease module hypothesis, the cellular components associated with a disease segregate in the same neighborhood of the human interactome, the map of biologically relevant molecular interactions. Yet, given the incompleteness of the interactome and the limited knowledge of disease-associated genes, it is not obvious if the available data have sufficient coverage to map out modules associated with each disease. Here we derive mathematical conditions for the identifiability of disease modules and show that the network-based location of each disease module determines its pathobiological relationship to other diseases. For example, diseases with overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns, symptom similarity, and comorbidity, whereas diseases residing in separated network neighborhoods are phenotypically distinct. These tools represent an interactome-based platform to predict molecular commonalities between phenotypically related diseases, even if they do not share primary disease genes."

These data reveal that AgRP and POMC neurons receive real-time information about the availability of food in the external world, suggesting a primary role for these neurons in controlling appetitive behaviors such as foraging that promote the discovery of food. Food intake is controlled by evolutionarily hard-wired neural circuits that contain specialized neural cell types. Two cell types in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus are known to be particularly important for the control of feeding. These neurons are identified by expression of the neuropeptides Agouti-related Protein (AgRP) and Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and have opposing functions. AgRP neurons are activated by energy deficit (Hahn et al., 1998Hahn T.M. Breininger J.F. Baskin D.G. Schwartz M.W. Coexpression of Agrp and NPY in fasting-activated hypothalamic neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) and promote food seeking and consumption. Optogenetic or chemogenetic activation of AgRP neurons induces voracious eating in sated mice (Aponte et al., 2011Aponte Y. Atasoy D. Sternson S.M.

These effects of AgRP neurons are mediated by release of GABA as well as two neuropeptides, AgRP and NPY, that stimulate food intake when delivered into the brain (Clark et al., 1985Clark J.T.

These two cell types interact in part through a common set of downstream neural targets that express melanocortin receptors, which are activated by POMC and inhibited by AgRP (Fan et al., 1997Fan W.

Thus, AgRP and POMC neurons are two intermingled, interacting neural cell types that have opposing roles in the control of feeding. Despite intense investigation of these cells over the past 20 years, their activity dynamics during behavior remain unknown. This knowledge gap reflects the difficulty of recording cell-type-specific neural activity within heterogeneous deep brain structures such as the hypothalamus. As a result, our current understanding of the regulation of AgRP and POMC neurons is based on a combination of approaches that include in vitro electrophysiology, c-fos staining, pharmacology, and genetic manipulations. These pioneering studies have revealed a dominant role for circulating hormones and nutrients in the control of these cells (Williams and Elmquist, 2012Williams K.W. Elmquist J.K. From neuroanatomy to behavior: central integration of peripheral signals regulating feeding behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1350-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). AgRP and POMC neurons are modulated by hormones such as ghrelin and leptin (Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Cerdán M.G. Diano S. Horvath T.L. Cone R.D. Low M.J.

Schwartz G.J. Hypothalamic nutrient sensing in the control of energy homeostasis.Behav. Brain Res. 2010; 209: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) in part via their metabolic effects on mitochondrial dynamics (Dietrich et al., 2013Dietrich M.O. Liu Z.W. Horvath T.L.

Together, these findings have led to a generally accepted model in which AgRP and POMC neurons function as interoceptors that monitor the concentration of hormones and nutrients in the blood and then gradually adjust their activity in parallel with changes in nutritional state. This model provides a compelling explanation for how nutritional changes can be translated into counterregulatory responses but leaves unanswered the question of whether these neurons are also subject to rapid regulation on the timescale of behavior. AgRP and POMC neurons also receive abundant synaptic input which provides the potential for more rapid modulation. However, the function of this afferent input is not well understood. Fasting increases excitatory tone onto AgRP neurons (Liu et al., 2012Liu T. Kong D. Shah B.P. Ye C. Koda S. Saunders A. Ding J.B. Yang Z. Sabatini B.L. Lowell B.B.

Hunger states switch a flip-flop memory circuit via a synaptic AMPK-dependent positive feedback loop.Cell. 2011; 146: 992-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and one source of such excitatory input is neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) (Krashes et al., 2014Krashes M.J. Shah B.P. Madara J.C. Olson D.P. Strochlic D.E. Garfield A.S. Vong L. Pei H. Watabe-Uchida M. Uchida N. et al.An excitatory paraventricular nucleus to AgRP neuron circuit that drives hunger.Nature. 2014; 507: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). AgRP neurons also receive inhibitory input from the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) among other sources (Krashes et al., 2014Krashes M.J. Shah B.P. Madara J.C. Olson D.P. Strochlic D.E. Garfield A.S.

POMC neurons by contrast receive inhibitory input from cells in the ARC, including neighboring AgRP neurons, as well as excitatory input from the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and other regions (Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L.

As these circuit connections have only recently been described, their regulation and function are not yet clear. An important open question regards the nature of the information that these presynaptic cells communicate to their AgRP and POMC targets. In the present study, we have used an optical approach to record the natural activity of AgRP and POMC neurons in awake behaving mice. These experiments have unexpectedly revealed that AgRP and POMC neurons are strongly regulated in vivo by the sensory detection of food. This rapid sensory regulation resets the activation state of these cells induced by food deprivation prior to the start of food consumption. This rapid regulation also contains information about the food’s hedonic properties and depends on the animal’s nutritional state. These findings reveal that AgRP and POMC neurons receive real-time information about the availability of food in the outside world, which they then use to anticipate the nutritional value of a forthcoming meal and adjust their activity in advance. This anticipatory regulation provides a mechanism to rapidly inhibit foraging upon food discovery, suggesting a primary role for these neurons in the regulation of appetitive behaviors in vivo. In order to gain deeper insight into the regulation of AgRP and POMC neurons, we sought to record their natural activity during feeding behavior. To do this, we used fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Concurrent activation of striatal direct and indirect pathways during action initiation.Nature. 2013; 494: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, Gunaydin et al., 2014Gunaydin L.A.

Zalocusky K.A. et al.Natural neural projection dynamics underlying social behavior.Cell. 2014; 157: 1535-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), an approach that employs a multimode optical fiber to record the total fluorescence from a population of neurons expressing a calcium reporter for neural activity (Figure 1F). By targeting the calcium reporter to a specific cell type, this method enables optical recording of the real-time activity of a molecularly defined population of neurons within a deep brain structure. The resulting trace represents the integrated activity of the neurons defined by a genetic marker and anatomic location and therefore is particularly well-suited for use in the hypothalamus, which contains genetically separable populations of neurons with distinct functions. We first confirmed that calcium signals from AgRP and POMC neurons correlate with changes in firing rate ex vivo. We targeted the sixth generation calcium reporter GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar) to AgRP and POMC neurons by stereotaxic injection of Cre-dependent AAVs into AgRP-IRES-Cre and POMC-Cre mice (Figure 1A). We then prepared acute brain slices for imaging, and fluorescent cells in the ARC were identified for whole-cell current clamp recordings. Activation by depolarizing current ramp (0–40 pA, 10 s) induced bursts in firing accompanied by increased GCaMP6s fluorescence (Figure 1B). To quantify the relationship between firing rate and fluorescence signal, we applied step currents (−20 pA to +120 pA, 10 pA increments), which resulted in progressive increases in spikes and fluorescence (Figure 1C). Quantification of this response revealed a linear correlation between action potential number and GCaMP6s signal (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, GCaMP6s can report on activity dynamics in AgRP and POMC neurons as shown for other cell types (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar). To apply this approach in vivo, we injected AAVs expressing GCaMP6s into the ARC of the corresponding Cre mice and in the same surgery installed an optical fiber unilaterally above the ARC (Figure S1). After allowing 2 weeks for transgene expression, we connected mice to a photometry rig and recorded fluorescence from these cells as mice explored a feeding chamber without access to food. Baseline recordings from AgRP and POMC neurons showed dynamic fluctuations (∼10%–20% ΔF/F) that resembled bursts of synchronous activity observed in other cell types (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Concurrent activation of striatal direct and indirect pathways during action initiation.Nature. 2013; 494: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, Gunaydin et al., 2014Gunaydin L.A.

These dynamics were unrelated to mouse movement, unaffected by changes in ambient lighting, and absent from recordings from control mice expressing GFP in AgRP or POMC neurons (Figure 1H), indicating that they represent calcium-dependent GCaMP6s signals. To test the sensitivity of this assay to detect changes in neural activity, we challenged mice with ghrelin, a hormone that activates AgRP neurons and inhibits POMC neurons (Cowley et al., 2003Cowley M.A. Smith R.G. Diano S. Tschöp M. Pronchuk N. Grove K.L. Strasburger C.J. Bidlingmaier M. Esterman M. Heiman M.L. et al.The distribution and mechanism of action of ghrelin in the CNS demonstrates a novel hypothalamic circuit regulating energy homeostasis.Neuron. 2003; 37: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, Nakazato et al., 2001Nakazato M. Murakami N. Date Y. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Matsukura S. A role for ghrelin in the central regulation of feeding.Nature. 2001; 409: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar). Mice expressing GCaMP6s in either AgRP or POMC neurons were acclimated to a behavioral chamber, given an intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin, and then returned to the chamber. Ghrelin sharply increased calcium signals from AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = 71% ± 10% at 5 min, p < 0.001 compared to vehicle) (Figures 2A and 2B ; Movie S1). This increase began within seconds of injection (mean latency = 33 ± 7 s) and reached a plateau within 2 min (τ = 76 ± 12 s, where τ is the exponential time constant corresponding to the time after injection resulting in ∼63.8% of the total change). In the absence of further intervention, this increase in AgRP activity was sustained for the duration of the recording (ΔF/F = 62% ± 10% at 15 min) (Figure 2B). By contrast injection of vehicle (PBS) had no effect on the activity of AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = −3% ± 2% at 5 min) (Figure 2B; Movie S1). POMC neurons showed the opposite response, with ghrelin injection rapidly and potently inhibiting POMC activity (τ = 160 ± 17 s; ΔF/F = −49% ± 4% at 15 min, p = 0.001 compared to vehicle) (Figures 2C and 2D; Movie S2). Interestingly, vehicle injection alone produced a small but reversible drop in POMC activity (Figure 2D; Movie S2). This transient decline in POMC activity was consistently observed following animal handling, suggesting that POMC but not AgRP neurons receive an inhibitory stress regulated input. We next tested the effect of food on the response to ghrelin. Our prediction based on the known nutritional regulation of these cells was that food consumption would gradually inhibit AgRP neurons and activate POMC neurons as animals transitioned from hunger to satiety. To test this, we challenged mice with ghrelin and then 20 min later presented them with a pellet of chow. Unexpectedly, we found that food presentation alone rapidly reversed much of the effect of ghrelin treatment (ΔF/F = −29% ± 3% at 2 min for AgRP neurons and ΔF/F = 80% ± 3% at 2 min for POMC neurons) (Figure 2). This response began immediately upon placing food in the cage and was complete within seconds (τ = 12 ± 2 s for AgRP neurons; τ = 44 ± 3 s for POMC neurons). All animals tested showed this response to food presentation (traces for ten mice are shown in Figure 2E), suggesting that it represents a general mechanism that regulates the activity of these neurons in vivo. The regulation of AgRP and POMC neurons by sensory detection of food has not previously been described. To investigate this phenomenon under more physiologic conditions, we fasted mice overnight and then presented a pellet of chow. As observed for ghrelin-treated animals, food presentation to fasted mice strongly inhibited AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = −37% ± 4%, at 5 min, p < 0.001 compared to object) and activated POMC neurons (ΔF/F = 38% ± 5% at 5 min, p < 0.001 compared to object) (Figure 3; Movies S3 and S4). These responses began the moment that food was presented and were rapidly complete (τ = 20 ± 4 s for AgRP neurons and τ = 42 ± 18 s for POMC neurons). To quantify the extent to which these changes required food consumption, we analyzed video data to estimate the moment at which the first bite of food was consumed in each trial and then aligned calcium traces to this event. This revealed that most of the activity changes in these neurons were already complete by the time food intake was initiated (96% ± 6% complete before feeding in AgRP neurons, 85% ± 5% in POMC neurons) (Figures 3H and 3I). Thus, the response of AgRP and POMC neurons to food is triggered primarily by food detection rather food consumption. Of note, these stereotyped responses to food presentation were consistently observed in the first trial of each mouse (Figure 3G), indicating that this effect does not require prior training. We investigated the determinants of this rapid response to food discovery. Presentation of an inedible object (a rubber stopper similar in size to a piece of chow) had little effect on the activity of AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = 4.9% ± 2.2%) and induced a small change in POMC neurons in the opposite direction of food (ΔF/F = −10% ± 2%). Thus, the response of these neurons to food presentation is food-specific (Figure 3; Movies S3 and S4). The sensitivity of these cells to food presentation also depended on nutritional state, as AgRP neurons from ad-libitum-fed mice showed no response to food presentation (ΔF/F = −4.7% ± 1.0%, p = 0.21 compared to object) whereas POMC neurons from ad-libitum-fed mice showed a greatly diminished response (ΔF/F = 4.7% ± 2.4%, p = 0.01 compared to object) (Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, conditions that reflect energy deficit, such as fasting or ghrelin treatment, potentiate the response of AgRP and POMC neurons to food detection. We considered the possibility that the response of AgRP and POMC neurons to food presentation depends on the food’s hedonic properties. In this regard, sensory cues associated with palatable or energy dense foods trigger activation of brain regions involved in reward, but how this hedonic information is integrated with homeostatic signals remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we first measured the response to peanut butter, an energy dense food that mice will eat in preference to chow and is considered rewarding. Mice were fasted overnight, acclimated to a behavioral chamber, and then presented with either pellet of chow or a dollop of peanut butter. Presentation of peanut butter strongly inhibited AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = −54% ± 6% at 5 min) (Figure 4A) and activated POMC neurons (ΔF/F = 101% ± 31% at 5 min) (Figure 4C). These responses began immediately upon food presentation (Movies S5 and S6) and were complete in <1 min (τ = 23 ± 6 s for AgRP and τ = 29 ± 6 s for POMC). The responses to peanut butter were significantly larger than the responses to chow (Figure 4E) and indeed were comparable in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to the effect of injection with pharmacologic doses of ghrelin (Figure 4F), which to our knowledge is the strongest known stimulus that modulates these cells. A defining feature of palatable foods is that animals will consume them in the absence of hunger because they are intrinsically rewarding (e.g., eating dessert after a meal). We therefore tested whether AgRP and POMC neurons from ad-libitum-fed mice, which show little or no response to chow (Figure 3), would nonetheless respond to the presentation of peanut butter. Indeed, we found that presentation of peanut butter to ad-libitum-fed mice strongly inhibited AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = −24% ± 4%, at 5 min, p < 0.001 compared to chow) and activated POMC neurons (ΔF/F = 55% ± 11%, at 5 min, p = 0.14 compared to chow) (Figures 4A and 4C). Thus, more palatable food can modulate these neurons even in the absence of signals of energy deficit. To further probe this relationship, we tested whether the response of these neurons to different foods depended on the order in which they were presented. Mice were fasted overnight and then sequentially presented with an inedible object, peanut butter, or chow in randomized order at 10-min intervals. We then calculated the change in activity that occurred following each of these presentations. This revealed that presentation of peanut butter could completely block the subsequent neural response to presentation of chow (Figures 4B and 4D). By contrast, presentation of chow had no effect on the response to peanut butter in POMC neurons (Figure 4D) and only partially diminished the response in AgRP neurons (Figure 4B). The asymmetry in the response to these two foods is consistent with their differential effects in fasted and fed mice. To extend these findings we tested a chocolate, a second food that is commonly used in rodent studies of reward. We found that presentation of chocolate (Hershey Kiss) to fasted mice inhibited AgRP neurons to a greater extent than chow (Figure S2A). Like peanut butter, chocolate also elicited a response in AgRP neurons from ad-libitum-fed mice that are unresponsive to chow (Figure S2B). Sequential presentation experiments revealed that chocolate could block the neural response to subsequent presentation of chow, but not vice versa, similar to our observations with peanut butter (Figures S2D and S2E). Although chocolate was a novel food for these animals, we observed responses to chocolate presentation in the first trial, indicating mice could identify it as food without prior experience. However, the speed of the response to chocolate increased during subsequent tests, suggesting involvement of a learning process as well (τ = 40 ± 8 s in trial 1 versus 17 ± 2 s in trial 4, p < 0.01) (Figure S2C). Collectively, these data show that the rapid sensory regulation of AgRP and POMC neurons contains information about the hedonic properties of the food that has been detected. Most of the response of AgRP and POMC neurons to food presentation occurred before food intake was initiated (Figures 3H and 3I). We therefore wondered whether food consumption played any role in this response. To test this, mice were fasted overnight and then presented with peanut butter in a container that allowed the food to be seen and smelled but not consumed (Figure 5A). Presentation of this inaccessible peanut butter rapidly activated POMC neurons (ΔF/F = 43% ± 9% after 2 min; τ = 31 ± 8 s) and inhibited AgRP neurons (ΔF/F = −39% ± 4% after 2 min; τ = 21 ± 4 s) (Figures 5B and 5C). Similar responses were observed in mice pretreated with ghrelin (Figures S3A and S3B). These responses occurred as quickly as the response to accessible food, but were somewhat smaller in magnitude (Figures S3C and S3D), and the response of POMC neurons was less durable (Figures 5B and 5C). This indicates that food accessibility can modulate the strength of the response to food presentation.Figure S3Peanut Butter Accessibility, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A and B) Effect of caged peanut butter in mice pretreated with ghrelin.(C and D) Comparison of effects of presentation of peanut butter that was either accessible, caged, or hidden to fasted mice.

https://openalex.org/W1967114867,"Regulated blood production is achieved through the hierarchical organization of dormant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) subsets that differ in self-renewal potential and division frequency, with long-term (LT)-HSCs dividing the least. The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation. Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis. Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system."
https://openalex.org/W2051916693,"Navigation depends on multiple neural systems that encode the moment-to-moment changes in an animal's direction and location in space. These include head direction (HD) cells representing the orientation of the head and grid cells that fire at multiple locations, forming a repeating hexagonal grid pattern. Computational models hypothesize that generation of the grid cell signal relies upon HD information that ascends to the hippocampal network via the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN). We inactivated or lesioned the ATN and subsequently recorded single units in the entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum. ATN manipulation significantly disrupted grid and HD cell characteristics while sparing theta rhythmicity in these regions. These results indicate that the HD signal via the ATN is necessary for the generation and function of grid cell activity."

Cognitive deficits are initially observed at a stage in which pathological tau affects a fraction of the neurons, prior to substantial neurodegeneration (Hoover et al., 2010Hoover B.R. Reed M.N.

Electrophysiological studies in rTg4510 mice have mostly been performed in mice over 7 months old, following substantial neuronal death. These studies have suggested hyperexcitability of neocortical neurons recorded in vitro (Crimins et al., 2011Crimins J.L. Rocher A.B. Peters A. Shultz P. Lewis J. Luebke J.I.

Neurol. 2010; 223: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The effects of pathological tau on the functional activity of the intact neocortical network are still unclear. In the intact neocortical network, the membrane potentials of pyramidal neurons show characteristic patterns of spontaneous ongoing activity, which are not present in acute reduced preparations. During slow-wave sleep (SWS) and under ketamine-xylazine (KX) anesthesia, the membrane potential spontaneously transitions between the hyperpolarized silent Down state and the depolarized Up state, from which action potentials (APs or spikes) arise, with a dominant oscillatory frequency of ∼1 Hz (Cowan and Wilson, 1994Cowan R.L.

Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 17-32PubMed Google Scholar, Steriade et al., 1993Steriade M. Nuñez A. Amzica F. A novel slow (< 1 Hz) oscillation of neocortical neurons in vivo: depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3252-3265PubMed Google Scholar). The Up states are generated by a barrage of simultaneous convergent synaptic inputs, occasionally inducing the cell to spontaneously fire, and when ceased, cause the membrane potential to fall into the Down state (Haider et al., 2006Haider B. Duque A. Hasenstaub A.R. McCormick D.A. Neocortical network activity in vivo is generated through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, Léger et al., 2005Léger J.F. Stern E.A. Aertsen A. Heck D. Synaptic integration in rat frontal cortex shaped by network activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). KX anesthesia serves as a model for SWS, as both show slow rhythmic, stereotypical fluctuations of the membrane potential in the subthreshold range, which are also seen in the field potential recordings, and reflect high synchronization of network synaptic activity. However, fine differences exist between these two states. Under anesthesia, a stronger rhythmicity of slow oscillation is observed in field potential and intracellular recordings of cats, as well as longer durations of Down states (Chauvette et al., 2011Chauvette S. Crochet S. Volgushev M. Timofeev I. Properties of slow oscillation during slow-wave sleep and anesthesia in cats.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 14998-15008Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ongoing background activity of the neuron shapes the responses of the neuron to evoked inputs (Arieli et al., 1996Arieli A. Sterkin A. Grinvald A. Aertsen A.

Wilson C.J. Spontaneous subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations and action potential variability of rat corticostriatal and striatal neurons in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1697-1715PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the effects of pathological tau on the function of the intact neocortical network using in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings of spontaneous ongoing activity from frontal pole (medial and lateral agranular cortex) pyramidal neurons in rTg4510 transgenic mice (Tg) and their age-matched non-transgenic littermates (Ctrl or controls). We used intracellular recordings from neurons in KX anesthetized animals to measure changes to subthreshold membrane potential dynamics and spiking, and extracellular recordings in freely moving animals to measure single-cell and multicellular activity during SWS and quiet wakefulness (QW). Changes in the overall pattern of spontaneous subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations of single neurons reveal changes in the envelope of activity of the cortical network of afferents, as these states are induced by periods of intense (Up state) and sparse (Down state) background network activity (Haider et al., 2006Haider B. Duque A. Hasenstaub A.R. McCormick D.A. Neocortical network activity in vivo is generated through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, Léger et al., 2005Léger J.F. Stern E.A. Aertsen A. Heck D. Synaptic integration in rat frontal cortex shaped by network activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Chronic extracellular in vivo recordings in freely behaving transgenic mice and their age-matched controls further elucidate the effects of pathological tau on the function of the nonanesthetized intact neocortical network. Ongoing activity was measured using in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings in separate experiments. We recorded intracellularly from 63 frontal pole neurons in 39 anesthetized rTg4510 transgenic and control mice. Recordings were made in two age cohorts: 3- to 3.5-month-old mice (“3mo”) and 4.5- to 6-month-old mice (“5mo”), displaying moderate NFT accumulation in the neocortex prior to appreciable cell death (Figure S1), with the latter group showing variable yet significantly higher levels of NFT accumulation (p = 0.02, t test). This is in agreement with a previous study showing significant NFT accumulation in rTg4510 cortex at 2.5 months, but no significant cortical cell loss until 8.5 months (Spires et al., 2006Spires T.L. Orne J.D. SantaCruz K. Pitstick R. Carlson G.A. Ashe K.H. Hyman B.T. Region-specific dissociation of neuronal loss and neurofibrillary pathology in a mouse model of tauopathy.Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 1598-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Intracellular recordings were conducted in physiologically identified neocortical pyramidal neurons (Figure 1A). Spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations between Up and Down states were observed in all intracellularly recorded neurons (Figures 1B and 1C). No differences among the membrane potential or input resistance values were observed between groups (Table S1), indicating that passive electrical properties of these cells are not altered by pathological tau. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the frontal pole of the cortex (Figure 1D) of four 5mo transgenic mice (n = 10 LFPs) and seven 5mo controls (n = 16 LFPs) during QW and SWS. Extracellular single units were recorded during QW and SWS from a subset of three 5mo transgenic mice and three 5mo controls, yielding 27 units/group. Single-unit recordings of neocortical pyramidal neurons from both groups were identified by waveform parameters (Figures 1E and 1F). Mice from both groups showed LFPs typical of QW and SWS epochs (Figures 1E, 1F, and S2). To quantify differences in patterns of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations between neurons in transgenic and control mice (Figure 2A), we compared the mean membrane potential oscillatory cycle in our intracellular recordings among groups. Membrane potentials in 5mo transgenic mice had longer periods than controls (Figures 2B and 3B; p ≈0, Anderson-Darling test; pgenotype = 0.0006, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). Spectral analysis of subthreshold activity revealed all groups to have a principal frequency in the slow oscillation range (<1 Hz). However, neurons in 5mo transgenic mice had a lower principal frequency than controls (Figure 2C; pgenotype = 0.012, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05), in accordance with their slower membrane potential dynamics. The principal frequency of individual LFPs during QW and SWS in 5mo control mice was either in the delta (1–4 Hz) or the spindle (7–14 Hz) frequency ranges, while the principal frequency of individual LFPs in 5mo transgenic mice was always in the delta range. To quantify the differences, we calculated the spindle-delta power ratio of the LFPs. During both QW and SWS, 5mo transgenic mice had a reduced spindle-delta power ratio compared with that of controls (Figure 2D; pQW = 0.02, pSWS = 0.008, t test). All groups had a mean principal frequency in the delta frequency range during both behavioral states (Figure 2D). During SWS, 5mo transgenic mice had a lower principal frequency than controls (p = 0.03, t test), while during QW no difference was observed (Figure 2D; p = 0.15, t test). These findings suggest that pathological tau perturbs highly synchronous epochs of synaptic activity, as during SWS and under anesthesia. To identify the affected components of the membrane potential periodicity, we measured the individual durations of membrane potential states and their transitions during intracellular recordings. No differences were found for mean Up state durations (pgenotype = 0.098, Genotype × Age ANOVA). Down state durations of neurons in transgenic mice were longer than those in controls (Figure 2E; p = 0.02, Anderson-Darling test; pgenotype = 0.0009, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). The within-cell variability of Down state durations of neurons in 5mo transgenic mice was greater than in controls (Figure 2E; pgenotype = 0.0034, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). Within a given neuron, the transitions of the membrane potential from Down to Up states (Up transitions) and from Up to Down states (Down transitions) normally occur in a highly stereotypical pattern (Stern et al., 1997Stern E.A. Kincaid A.E. Wilson C.J. Spontaneous subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations and action potential variability of rat corticostriatal and striatal neurons in vivo.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1697-1715PubMed Google Scholar). The durations of Up transitions were longer in neurons in transgenic mice than in controls (Figure 2F; p = 0.002, Anderson-Darling test; pgenotype ≈0, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). Similar results were found for Down transitions in neurons in 3mo transgenic mice compared to controls (Figure 2G; p = 0.018, Anderson-Darling test; pgenotype = 0.001, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). Up and Down transition durations were more variable within neurons in transgenic mice than in controls (Figures 2F and 2G; Up transitions: pgenotype ≈0, Down transitions: pgenotype = 0.0062, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). The observed increase in the mean Down state duration, without a parallel change in the mean Up state duration, in addition to the increase in state transition durations in transgenic mice, probably underlie the slower neuronal oscillation frequency observed in intracellular and extracellular recordings. Transgenic neurons showed an increase in the frequency of small depolarizing events in the Down state (false Up transitions; Figure 2A). Neurons in 5mo transgenic mice displayed a greater number of false Up transitions, and a smaller number of true Up transitions than controls (Figure 3A; false transitions: pgenotype = 0.0007, true transitions: pgenotype = 0.0081, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05), the latter consistent with our finding of a lower principal frequency of membrane potential fluctuations. The longer intervals observed between successive (true) Up transitions in 5mo transgenic neurons compared to controls (pgenotype = 0.0006, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05) were not observed when false Up transitions were included in Up transition interval calculations (Figure 3B; pgenotype = 0.9, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). This indicates that false Up transitions portray a pathological tau-induced loss of function. The higher number of false Up transitions found in 5mo transgenic mice may be a consequence of the longer time they spent in Down state, allowing them a longer time window during which to emerge. To correct for this, we compared the proportion of false Up transitions among groups of neurons that had a comparable low principal frequency and found the higher proportion of false Up transitions in transgenic mice to be maintained (Figure 3C). The changes observed in subthreshold membrane potential dynamics would be expected to cause changes in the firing properties of the neuron. APs are induced by a more stringent input timing pattern of simultaneous afferent synaptic inputs than those generating the Up state, either by additional synchronous (within the postsynaptic membrane time constant) synaptic inputs (Léger et al., 2005Léger J.F. Stern E.A. Aertsen A. Heck D. Synaptic integration in rat frontal cortex shaped by network activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or by reduction of inhibitory inputs (Rudolph et al., 2007Rudolph M. Pospischil M. Timofeev I. Destexhe A. Inhibition determines membrane potential dynamics and controls action potential generation in awake and sleeping cat cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5280-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We found no changes related to pathological tau in spike properties measured from intracellularly recorded neurons (Table S2), indicating basic electrical properties intrinsic to the neuron and conductances underlying AP generation are unaltered. We compared the firing rate of extracellularly recorded single units in 5mo transgenic and control mice during QW and SWS. Transgenic neurons had lower firing rates than controls, as did neurons during SWS compared to during QW (Figure 4A; pgenotype = 0.01; pstate = 0.01; no interaction; Genotype × State ANOVA). Intracellular recordings revealed that neurons in transgenic mice had lower spontaneous firing rates than those in controls (pgenotype = 0.035, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05), even when firing rate was calculated solely within the Up states (Figure 4B; pgenotype = 0.047, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). These results suggest that the reduction of firing rate in transgenic neurons is governed by two separate mechanisms: the longer Down states, from which APs do not arise, and the reduced firing rates in the Up states. To quantify the changes in firing patterns in intracellular recordings, we compared the firing pattern within Up states among groups. Neurons in 5mo transgenic mice had longer inter-spike intervals (ISIs) than controls (Figure 4C; pgenotype = 0.026, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05), and neurons in transgenic mice showed longer latencies to spike from Up transition than controls (Figure 4D; pgenotype = 0.032, Genotype × Age ANOVA; pHSD ≤ 0.05). The changes in firing patterns within the Up state of transgenic neurons are not due solely to the changes in firing rate, as firing patterns differed between groups, even when compared using firing probability over time (Figure 4C). Taken together, the results reveal significant reduction of neuronal activity in the tau transgenic neurons. We have demonstrated that pathological tau reduces the activity of single neocortical pyramidal cells and of the neocortical network. We found a lower degree of background activity in neurons in transgenic mice, reflected in altered patterns of both subthreshold membrane potential dynamics and spiking activity. These changes include slower neuronal oscillations and reduced firing rates. The net result is a reduction in reliability of synaptic information transmission in the transgenic neocortex. Our main findings differ from those of in vitro intracellular studies (Crimins et al., 2011Crimins J.L. Rocher A.B. Peters A. Shultz P. Lewis J. Luebke J.I.

Neurol. 2013; 521: 1334-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). While this mutation has not been identified in AD, and despite the diversity of tauopathies, the shared pathological hallmark of NFTs suggests a common mechanism of disease pathogenesis in all tauopathies (Gendron and Petrucelli, 2009Gendron T.F. Petrucelli L. The role of tau in neurodegeneration.Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and validates the rTg4510 strain as an experimental model. Intracellular and extracellular recordings revealed that transgenic mice had lower principal frequency during SWS and under anesthesia and reduced firing rates. The latter method, but not the former, is free from possible differential effects of anesthesia and intracellular-pipette damage and enables better sampling of activity of neuronal populations. These findings indicate that pathological tau alters the functional connectivity of the cortical network in a manner that disrupts activity mainly during highly synchronous epochs of synaptic activity, such as SWS and anesthesia, and to a lesser extent during less synchronized epochs, as QW. The reduced delta-spindle power ratio found in nonanesthetized 5mo transgenic mice suggests a reduction in the power of the thalamically gated spindle rhythm. This may imply that pathological tau alters corticothalamic functional connectivity in addition to the neocortical activity (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003De Gennaro L. Ferrara M. Sleep spindles: an overview.Sleep Med. Rev. 2003; 7: 423-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Our findings of altered activity in neurons in transgenic mice may be attributed to synaptic input insufficiency; i.e., the lack of enough inputs arriving within a specific time window to elicit and maintain an Up state and generate normal firing patterns (Bernander et al., 1991Bernander O. Douglas R.J. Martin K.A. Koch C. Synaptic background activity influences spatiotemporal integration in single pyramidal cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These findings suggest that the underlying synaptic input insufficiency is mainly caused by a reduction in synaptic synchrony and to a lesser extent by a reduction in the number of synaptic inputs. Underlying mechanisms may involve impaired cellular trafficking or synaptic anchoring (Hoover et al., 2010Hoover B.R. Reed M.N. Su J. Penrod R.D. Kotilinek L.A. Grant M.K. Pitstick R. Carlson G.A.

Neurol. 2010; 223: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Some of the observed changes may also be explained by pathological tau-induced changes in the electrical properties of the neuron. The longer durations of Down states and rise times to Up states observed in transgenic mice, along with the reduction in successful Up states and the corresponding increase in Up transition failures, could be induced by both synaptic input insufficiency and/or intrinsic electrical properties of the membrane. The larger within-cell variability of the durations of Down states and Up transitions probably reflect a reduction in sufficient simultaneous synaptic input, given the implausibility of changes in cell parameters occurring over the time of recording. Down transitions are the response of the membrane potential to removal of synaptic inputs (Haider et al., 2006Haider B. Duque A. Hasenstaub A.R. McCormick D.A. Neocortical network activity in vivo is generated through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, Léger et al., 2005Léger J.F. Stern E.A. Aertsen A. Heck D.

Timofeev I. Destexhe A. Inhibition determines membrane potential dynamics and controls action potential generation in awake and sleeping cat cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5280-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and therefore reflect a change in the intrinsic electrical properties of the neurons. Thus, the longer Down transitions observed in 3mo transgenic mice probably reflect changes in intrinsic mechanisms in these neurons, while their larger within-cell variability, found in both transgenic groups, probably indicates synaptic input insufficiency. It is unlikely that the changes in firing rates and patterns observed in transgenic neurons are a result of changes in electrical properties intrinsic to the neuron, as we found no changes related to pathological tau in the mean Up state voltage, spike properties, or voltage trajectory leading to spikes. The firing patterns observed in the intracellularly recorded transgenic neurons are driven by synaptic inputs induced by the spiking of other, presynaptic neurons. However, the lower principal oscillation frequencies observed in transgenic mice during highly synchronized synaptic activity epochs, such as anesthesia and SWS, suggest that the reduced firing rates and altered firing patterns found in transgenic neurons are likely due to changes in synaptic input patterns to these cells amounting to synaptic input insufficiency. Our study has not differentiated between the effects of soluble tau and NFTs on neocortical neuronal activity. We have established that the neocortical activity of 5mo transgenics is affected to a greater extent than that of 3mo transgenics, with the former displaying significantly higher levels of NFT aggregation than the latter. Unfortunately, we could not recover all recorded neurons to demonstrate that not all were burdened by pathological tau. However, our findings indicate that only a fraction of neurons are directly affected by NFTs in the investigated age cohorts, in accordance with previously published findings (Glat et al., 2013Glat M. Skaat H. Menkes-Caspi N. Margel S. Stern E.A. Age-dependent effects of microglial inhibition in vivo on Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology using bioactive-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles.J. Nanobiotechnology. 2013; 11: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Spires et al., 2006Spires T.L. Orne J.D. SantaCruz K. Pitstick R. Carlson G.A. Ashe K.H. Hyman B.T.

Pathol. 2006; 168: 1598-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Given these data, it is unlikely that our recordings were exclusively from neurons bearing NFTs. Thus, we suggest the altered activity observed in neocortical neurons in transgenic mice does not depend on whether the individual recorded neuron contains an NFT, as also corroborated by in vitro studies (Crimins et al., 2011Crimins J.L. Rocher A.B. Peters A. Shultz P. Lewis J. Luebke J.I. Homeostatic responses by surviving cortical pyramidal cells in neurodegenerative tauopathy.Acta Neuropathol. 2011; 122: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Crimins et al., 2012Crimins J.L.

Neurol. 2010; 223: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since soluble tau is also increased at this age, it is reasonable to assume that this tau species also affects neuronal activity. However, the possibility exists that pathological tau affects neuronal activity at levels below that of detections with the immunocytochemical and perfusion methods used in this study (Oh et al., 2010Oh K.J. Perez S.E. Lagalwar S. Vana L. Binder L. Mufson E.J. Staging of Alzheimer’s pathology in triple transgenic mice: a light and electron microscopic analysis.Int. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 2010: 2010Google Scholar). We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that many more neurons have accumulated pathological tau than we can detect. Our results reveal a global reduction in activity, probably caused by pathological-tau-affected individual neurons, which reduce the activity of downstream unaffected neurons. A possible mechanism could be morphological changes in tau-affected neurons (Crimins et al., 2011Crimins J.L. Rocher A.B. Peters A. Shultz P. Lewis J. Luebke J.I.

A reduction in synaptic synchrony or, less likely, in the number of synaptic inputs, as revealed by the changes in subthreshold membrane potential fluctuation patterns and the lower principal oscillatory frequencies, while allowing for partial function of the cortical neurons, significantly changes the firing patterns and spike rates of these cells. Taken together, the changes described in this study inevitably affect the fine scale of the neurons’ ability to encode multidimensional information by complex patterns of spike trains. This may explain the discrepancy between the evidence for functional integration of NFT-bearing neurons in visual cortex (Kuchibhotla et al., 2014Kuchibhotla K.V. Wegmann S. Kopeikina K.J. Hawkes J. Rudinskiy N. Andermann M.L. Spires-Jones T.L. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. Neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons are functionally integrated in cortical circuits in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and, on the other hand, cognitive dysfunction (Crimins et al., 2011Crimins J.L. Rocher A.B. Peters A. Shultz P. Lewis J.

Neurons may show normal tuning to stimulus parameters when integrating over a long period of time, while fine structure of neuronal activity, on the millisecond timescale, is disrupted. Our study has shown a disruption in the pattern of inputs, regardless of whether the recorded neuron bears NFTs. An intracellular neuropathology affecting only a fraction of the neurons therefore escalates to a disruption of the entire neuronal network. We suggest that this reduction in global neuronal activity caused by neuropathology in a subset of the affected network, prior to substantial neurodegeneration, may explain the cognitive decline characteristic of human tauopathy and Alzheimer’s disease.

Our evolutionary reconstruction combined with x-ray structures of the common ancestor and pre-steady-state kinetics reveals a detailed atomistic mechanism for selectivity of the successful cancer drug Gleevec. Gleevec affinity is gained during the evolutionary trajectory toward Abl and lost toward Src, primarily by shifting an induced-fit equilibrium that is also disrupted in the clinical T315I resistance mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2037347257,"Pancreatic β cells lower insulin release in response to nutrient depletion. The question of whether starved β cells induce macroautophagy, a predominant mechanism maintaining energy homeostasis, remains poorly explored. We found that, in contrast to many mammalian cells, macroautophagy in pancreatic β cells was suppressed upon starvation. Instead, starved β cells induced lysosomal degradation of nascent secretory insulin granules, which was controlled by protein kinase D (PKD), a key player in secretory granule biogenesis. Starvation-induced nascent granule degradation triggered lysosomal recruitment and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin that suppressed macroautophagy. Switching from macroautophagy to insulin granule degradation was important to keep insulin secretion low upon fasting. Thus, β cells use a PKD-dependent mechanism to adapt to nutrient availability and couple autophagy flux to secretory function."
https://openalex.org/W2091066178,"Spontaneous neuronal activity is spatiotemporally structured, influencing brain computations. Nevertheless, the neuronal interactions underlying these spontaneous activity patterns, and their biological relevance, remain elusive. Here, we addressed these questions using two-photon calcium imaging of intact zebrafish larvae to monitor the neuron-to-neuron spontaneous activity fine structure in the tectum, a region involved in visual spatial detection. Spontaneous activity was organized in topographically compact assemblies, grouping functionally similar neurons rather than merely neighboring ones, reflecting the tectal retinotopic map despite being independent of retinal drive. Assemblies represent all-or-none-like sub-networks shaped by competitive dynamics, mechanisms advantageous for visual detection in noisy natural environments. Notably, assemblies were tuned to the same angular sizes and spatial positions as prey-detection performance in behavioral assays, and their spontaneous activation predicted directional tail movements. Therefore, structured spontaneous activity represents ""preferred"" network states, tuned to behaviorally relevant features, emerging from the circuit's intrinsic non-linear dynamics, adapted for its functional role."

https://openalex.org/W2067270162,"It is difficult to detect pancreatic cancer or biliary-tract cancer at an early stage using current diagnostic technology. Utilizing microRNA (miRNA) markers that are stably present in peripheral blood, we aimed to identify pancreatic and biliary-tract cancers in patients. With “3D-Gene”, a highly sensitive microarray, we examined comprehensive miRNA expression profiles in 571 serum samples obtained from healthy patients, patients with pancreatic, biliary-tract, or other digestive cancers, and patients with non-malignant abnormalities in the pancreas or biliary tract. The samples were randomly divided into training and test cohorts, and candidate miRNA markers were independently evaluated. We found 81 miRNAs for pancreatic cancer and 66 miRNAs for biliary-tract cancer that showed statistically different expression compared with healthy controls. Among those markers, 55 miRNAs were common in both the pancreatic and biliary-tract cancer samples. The previously reported miR-125a-3p was one of the common markers; however, it was also expressed in other types of digestive-tract cancers, suggesting that it is not specific to cancer types. In order to discriminate the pancreato-biliary cancers from all other clinical conditions including the healthy controls, non-malignant abnormalities, and other types of cancers, we developed a diagnostic index using expression profiles of the 10 most significant miRNAs. A combination of eight miRNAs (miR-6075, miR-4294, miR-6880-5p, miR-6799-5p, miR-125a-3p, miR-4530, miR-6836-3p, and miR-4476) achieved a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC of 80.3%, 97.6%, 91.6% and 0.953, respectively. In contrast, CA19-9 and CEA gave sensitivities of 65.6% and 40.0%, specificities of 92.9% and 88.6%, and accuracies of 82.1% and 71.8%, respectively, in the same test cohort. This diagnostic index identified 18/21 operable pancreatic cancers and 38/48 operable biliary-tract cancers in the entire cohort. Our results suggest that the assessment of these miRNA markers is clinically valuable to identify patients with pancreato-biliary cancers who could benefit from surgical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1997368981,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting produces alternative proteins from a single transcript. −1 frameshifting occurs on Escherichia coli’s dnaX mRNA containing a slippery sequence AAAAAAG and peripheral mRNA structural barriers. Here, we reveal hidden aspects of the frameshifting process, including its exact location on the mRNA and its timing within the translation cycle. Mass spectrometry of translated products shows that ribosomes enter the −1 frame from not one specific codon but various codons along the slippery sequence and slip by not just −1 but also −4 or +2 nucleotides. Single-ribosome translation trajectories detect distinctive codon-scale fluctuations in ribosome-mRNA displacement across the slippery sequence, representing multiple ribosomal translocation attempts during frameshifting. Flanking mRNA structural barriers mechanically stimulate the ribosome to undergo back-and-forth translocation excursions, broadly exploring reading frames. Both experiments reveal aborted translation around mutant slippery sequences, indicating that subsequent fidelity checks on newly adopted codon position base pairings lead to either resumed translation or early termination."

https://openalex.org/W1981966610,"Upregulation of the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) emerges as a critical player in the cancer development and metabolism, yet the underlying mechanism of PKM2 overexpression remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that IGF-1/IGF-IR regulates PKM2 expression by enhancing HIF-1α-p65 complex binding to PKM2 promoter. PKM2 expression is regulated by miR-148a/152 suppression. PKM2 directly interacts with NF-κB p65 subunit to promote EGR1 expression for regulating miR-148a/152 feedback circuit in normal cells, but not in cancer cells because of the DNA hypermethylation of miR-148a and miR-152 gene promoters. The silencing of miR-148a/152 contributes to the overexpression of PKM2, NF-κB or/and IGF-IR in some cancer cells. We show that disruption of PKM2/NF-κB/miR-148a/152 feedback loop can regulate cancer cell growth and angiogenesis, and is also associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype, which may have clinical implication for providing novel biomarker(s) of TNBC and potential therapeutic target(s) in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2081530370,"Here we define activities of RIM-binding protein (RBP) that are essential for baseline neurotransmission and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. At baseline, rbp mutants have a ∼10-fold decrease in the apparent Ca(2+) sensitivity of release that we attribute to (1) impaired presynaptic Ca(2+) influx, (2) looser coupling of vesicles to Ca(2+) influx, and (3) limited access to the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP). During homeostatic plasticity, RBP is necessary for the potentiation of Ca(2+) influx and the expansion of the RRP. Remarkably, rbp mutants also reveal a rate-limiting stage required for the replenishment of high release probability (p) vesicles following vesicle depletion. This rate slows ∼4-fold at baseline and nearly 7-fold during homeostatic signaling in rbp. These effects are independent of altered Ca(2+) influx and RRP size. We propose that RBP stabilizes synaptic efficacy and homeostatic plasticity through coordinated control of presynaptic Ca(2+) influx and the dynamics of a high-p vesicle pool."
https://openalex.org/W2314194122,"Climate change can profoundly alter species’ distributions due to changes in temperature, precipitation, or seasonality. Migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) may be particularly susceptible to climate-driven changes in host plant abundance or reduced overwintering habitat. For example, climate change may significantly reduce the availability of overwintering habitat by restricting the amount of area with suitable microclimate conditions. However, potential effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations remain largely unknown, particularly with respect to their milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants. Given that monarchs largely depend on the genus Asclepias as larval host plants, the effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations will most likely be mediated by climate change effects on Asclepias. Here, I used MaxEnt species distribution modeling to assess potential changes in Asclepias and monarch distributions under moderate and severe climate change scenarios. First, Asclepias distributions were projected to extend northward throughout much of Canada despite considerable variability in the environmental drivers of each individual species. Second, Asclepias distributions were an important predictor of current monarch distributions, indicating that monarchs may be constrained as much by the availability of Asclepias host plants as environmental variables per se. Accordingly, modeling future distributions of monarchs, and indeed any tightly coupled plant-insect system, should incorporate the effects of climate change on host plant distributions. Finally, MaxEnt predictions of Asclepias and monarch distributions were remarkably consistent among general circulation models. Nearly all models predicted that the current monarch summer breeding range will become slightly less suitable for Asclepias and monarchs in the future. Asclepias, and consequently monarchs, should therefore undergo expanded northern range limits in summer months while encountering reduced habitat suitability throughout the northern migration."
https://openalex.org/W1970939790,"Isolated Schwann cells (SCs) respond to cAMP elevation by adopting a differentiated post-mitotic state that exhibits high levels of Krox-20, a transcriptional enhancer of myelination, and mature SC markers such as the myelin lipid galactocerebroside (O1). To address how cAMP controls myelination, we performed a series of cell culture experiments which compared the differentiating responses of isolated and axon-related SCs to cAMP analogs and ascorbate, a known inducer of axon ensheathment, basal lamina formation and myelination. In axon-related SCs, cAMP induced the expression of Krox-20 and O1 without a concomitant increase in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and without promoting axon ensheathment, collagen synthesis or basal lamina assembly. When cAMP was provided together with ascorbate, a dramatic enhancement of MBP expression occurred, indicating that cAMP primes SCs to form myelin only under conditions supportive of basal lamina formation. Experiments using a combination of cell permeable cAMP analogs and type-selective adenylyl cyclase (AC) agonists and antagonists revealed that selective transmembrane AC (tmAC) activation with forskolin was not sufficient for full SC differentiation and that the attainment of an O1 positive state also relied on the activity of the soluble AC (sAC), a bicarbonate sensor that is insensitive to forskolin and GPCR activation. Pharmacological and immunological evidence indicated that SCs expressed sAC and that sAC activity was required for morphological differentiation and the expression of myelin markers such as O1 and protein zero. To conclude, our data indicates that cAMP did not directly drive myelination but rather the transition into an O1 positive state, which is perhaps the most critical cAMP-dependent rate limiting step for the onset of myelination. The temporally restricted role of cAMP in inducing differentiation independently of basal lamina formation provides a clear example of the uncoupling of signals controlling differentiation and myelination in SCs."
https://openalex.org/W1976328289,"Different soil types can significantly affect the composition of wine grapes and the final wine product. In this study, the effects of soil types on the composition of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wine produced in the Helan Mountains were evaluated. Three different representative soil types--aeolian, sierozem and irrigation silting soil were studied. The compositions of grapes and wines were measured, and in addition, the weights of 100-berry samples were determined. The grapes that grown on the aeolian and sierozem soils matured sooner than those grown on the irrigation silting soil. The highest sugar content, total soluble solids content, sugar to acid ratio and anthocyanin content were found in the grapes that grown on the aeolian soil. The wine produced from this soil had improved chroma and tone and higher-quality phenols. The grapes grown on the sierozem soil had the highest total phenol and tannin contents, which affected the wine composition. The grapes grown on the irrigation silting soil had higher acidities, but the remaining indices were lower. In addition, the grapes grown on the aeolian soil resulted in wines with better chroma and aroma. The sierozem soil was beneficial for the formation of wine tannins and phenols and significantly affected the wine composition. The quality of the grapes from the irrigation silting soil was relatively low, resulting in lower-quality wine."
https://openalex.org/W2045708409,"Background Low fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is a leading risk factor for chronic disease globally as well as in the United States. Much of the population does not consume the recommended servings of FV daily. This paper describes the development of psychosocial measures of FV intake for inclusion in the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s 2007 Food Attitudes and Behaviors Survey. Methods This was a cross-sectional study among 3,397 adults from the United States. Scales included conventional constructs shown to be correlated with fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) in prior studies (e.g., self-efficacy, social support), and novel constructs that have been measured in few- to- no studies (e.g., views on vegetarianism, neophobia). FVI was assessed with an eight-item screener. Exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha, and regression analyses were conducted. Results Psychosocial scales with Cronbach’s alpha ≥0.68 were self-efficacy, social support, perceived barriers and benefits of eating FVs, views on vegetarianism, autonomous and controlled motivation, and preference for FVs. Conventional scales that were associated (p<0.05) with FVI were self-efficacy, social support, and perceived barriers to eating FVs. Novel scales that were associated (p<0.05) with FVI were autonomous motivation, and preference for vegetables. Other single items that were associated (p<0.05) with FVI included knowledge of FV recommendations, FVI “while growing up”, and daily water consumption. Conclusion These findings may inform future behavioral interventions as well as further exploration of other potential factors to promote and support FVI."
https://openalex.org/W1967947358,"Cancer cells harboring oncogenic BRaf mutants, but not oncogenic KRas mutants, are sensitive to MEK inhibitors (MEKi). The mechanism underlying the intrinsic resistance to MEKi in KRas-mutant cells is under intensive investigation. Here, we pursued this mechanism by live imaging of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activities in oncogenic KRas or BRaf-mutant cancer cells. We established eight cancer cell lines expressing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors for ERK activity and S6K activity, which was used as a surrogate marker for mTORC1 activity. Under increasing concentrations of MEKi, ERK activity correlated linearly with the cell growth rate in BRaf-mutant cancer cells, but not KRas-mutant cancer cells. The administration of PI3K inhibitors resulted in a linear correlation between ERK activity and cell growth rate in KRas-mutant cancer cells. Intriguingly, mTORC1 activity was correlated linearly with the cell growth rate in both BRaf-mutant cancer cells and KRas-mutant cancer cells. These observations suggested that mTORC1 activity had a pivotal role in cell growth and that the mTORC1 activity was maintained primarily by the ERK pathway in BRaf-mutant cancer cells and by both the ERK and PI3K pathways in KRas-mutant cancer cells. FRET imaging revealed that MEKi inhibited mTORC1 activity with slow kinetics, implying transcriptional control of mTORC1 activity by ERK. In agreement with this observation, MEKi induced the expression of negative regulators of mTORC1, including TSC1, TSC2 and Deptor, which occurred more significantly in BRaf-mutant cells than in KRas-mutant cells. These findings suggested that the suppression of mTORC1 activity and induction of negative regulators of mTORC1 in cancer cells treated for at least 1 day could be used as surrogate markers for the MEKi sensitivity of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006276730,"Chicken egg lysozyme (cLY) is an enzyme with 129 amino acid (AA) residue enzyme. This enzyme is present not only in chicken egg white but also in mucosal secretions such as saliva and tears. The antibacterial properties of egg white can be attributed to the presence of lysozyme, which is used as an anti-cancer drug and for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this study, we constructed a lentiviral vector containing a synthetic cLY signal peptide and a 447 bp synthetic human lysozyme (hLY) cDNA sequence driven by an oviduct-specific ovalbumin promoter, and microinjected into the subgerminal cavity of stage X chick embryos to generate transgenic chicken. The transgene inserted in the chicken chromosomes directs the synthesis and secretion of hLY which has three times higher specific activity than cLY. Three G1 transgenic chickens were identified, the only female of which expressed recombinant human lysozyme (rhLY) at 57.66 ± 4.10 μg/ml in the egg white and the G2 transgenic hens of the G1 transgenic cock A011 expressed rhLY at 48.72 ± 1.54 μg/ml. This experiment demonstrated that transgenic hens with stable oviduct-specific expression of recombinant human lysozyme proteins can be created by microinjection of lentiviral vectors. The results of this research could be contribute to the technological development using transgenic hens as a cost-effective alternative to other mammalian systems, such as cow, sheep and goats, for the production of therapeutic proteins and other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2036009761,"Objective To investigate the effect of social deprivation and ethnicity on inpatient admissions due to diabetes in England. Design Facility-based cross-sectional analysis. Setting National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England reporting inpatient admissions with better than 80% data reporting quality from 2010–2011 (355 facilities). Participants Non-obstetric patients over 16 years old in all NHS facilities in England. The sample size after exclusions was 5,147,859 all-cause admissions. Main Outcome Measures The relative risk of inpatient admissions and readmissions due to diabetes adjusted for confounders. Results There were 445,504 diabetes-related hospital admissions in England in 2010, giving a directly (age-sex) standardized rate of 1049.0 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval (CI): 1046.0–1052.1). The relative risk of inpatient admission in the most deprived quintile was 2.08 times higher than that of the least deprived quintile (95% CI: 2.02–2.14), and the effect of deprivation varied across ethnicities. About 30.1% of patients admitted due to diabetes were readmitted at least once due to diabetes. South Asians showed 2.62 times (95% CI: 2.51 – 2.74) higher admission risk. Readmission risk increased with IMD among white British but not other ethnicities. South Asians showed slightly lower risk of readmission than white British (0.86, 95% CI: 0.80 – 0.94). Conclusions More deprived areas had higher rates of inpatient admissions and readmissions due to diabetes. South Asian British showed higher admission risk and lower readmission risk than white British. However, there was almost no difference by ethnicity in readmission due to diabetes. Higher rates of admission among deprived people may not necessarily reflect higher prevalence, but higher admission rates in south Asian British may be explained by their higher prevalence because their lower readmission risk suggests no inequality in primary care to prevent readmission. Better interventions in poorer areas, are needed to reduce these inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2038164645,"Although microRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies, limited information is available regarding mechanisms by which these noncoding RNAs contribute to initiation and progression of tobacco-induced esophageal cancers. In this study, array and quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR techniques were used to examine miR expression in immortalized esophageal epithelia (IEE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells cultured in normal media with or without cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). Under relevant exposure conditions, CSC significantly decreased miR-217 expression in these cells. Endogenous levels of miR-217 expression in cultured EAC cells (EACC)/primary EACs were significantly lower than those observed in IEE/ paired normal esophageal tissues. RNA crosslink immunoprecipitation, quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR) and immunoblot experiments demonstrated direct interaction of miR-217 with kallikrein 7 (KLK7), encoding a putative oncogene not previously implicated in EAC. Repression of miR-217 correlated with increased levels of KLK7 in primary EACs, particularly those from smokers. Chromatin and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CSC-mediated repression of miR-217 coincided with DNMT3b-dependent hypermethylation and decreased occupancy of nuclear factor 1 within the miR-217 genomic locus. Deoxyazacytidine induced miR-217 expression and downregulated KLK7 in EACC; deoxyazacytidine also attenuated CSC-mediated miR-217 repression and upregulation of KLK7 in IEE and EACC. Overexpression of miR-217 significantly decreased, whereas overexpression of KLK7 increased proliferation, invasion and tumorigenicity of EACC. Collectively, these data demonstrate that epigenetic repression of miR-217 contributes to the pathogenesis of EAC via upregulation of KLK7 and suggest that restoration of miR-217 expression may be a novel treatment strategy for these malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2047340553,"The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin complex regulates gene transcription via high-order chromatin organization of the genome. De novo methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region is an epigenetic hallmark of gene silencing in cancer. Although the CTCF/cohesin complex preferentially targets hypomethylated DNA, it remains unclear whether the CTCF/cohesin-mediated high-order chromatin structure is affected by DNA methylation during tumorigenesis. We found that DNA methylation downregulates the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is an inducible, rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis, by disrupting CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping. We show that the CTCF/cohesin complex is enriched near a CpG island associated with PTGS2 and that the PTGS2 locus forms chromatin loops through methylation-sensitive binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex. DNA methylation abolishes the association of the CTCF/cohesin complex with the PTGS2 CpG island. Disruption of chromatin looping by DNA methylation abrogates the enrichment of transcriptional components, such as positive elongation factor b, at the transcriptional start site of the PTGS2 locus. These alterations result in the downregulation of PTGS2. Our results provide evidence that CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping of the PTGS2 locus is dynamically influenced by the DNA methylation status."
https://openalex.org/W2111446513,"We detected very strong coupling between the oscillating concentration of ATP and the dynamics of intracellular water during glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results indicate that: i) dipolar relaxation of intracellular water is heterogeneous within the cell and different from dilute conditions, ii) water dipolar relaxation oscillates with glycolysis and in phase with ATP concentration, iii) this phenomenon is scale-invariant from the subcellular to the ensemble of synchronized cells and, iv) the periodicity of both glycolytic oscillations and dipolar relaxation are equally affected by D2O in a dose-dependent manner. These results offer a new insight into the coupling of an emergent intensive physicochemical property of the cell, i.e. cell-wide water dipolar relaxation, and a central metabolite (ATP) produced by a robustly oscillating metabolic process."
https://openalex.org/W2039172345,"Hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells develop morphologically distinct dendritic arbors, yet also share some common features. Both cell types form a long apical dendrite which extends from the apex of the cell soma, while short basal dendrites are developed only in pyramidal cells. Using quantitative morphometric analyses of mouse hippocampal cultures, we evaluated the differences in dendritic arborization patterns between pyramidal and granule cells. Furthermore, we observed and described the final apical dendrite determination during dendritic polarization by time-lapse imaging. Pyramidal and granule cells in culture exhibited similar dendritic patterns with a single principal dendrite and several minor dendrites so that the cell types were not readily distinguished by appearance. While basal dendrites in granule cells are normally degraded by adulthood in vivo, cultured granule cells retained their minor dendrites. Asymmetric growth of a single principal dendrite harboring the Golgi was observed in both cell types soon after the onset of dendritic growth. Time-lapse imaging revealed that up until the second week in culture, final principal dendrite designation was not stabilized, but was frequently replaced by other minor dendrites. Before dendritic polarity was stabilized, the Golgi moved dynamically within the soma and was repeatedly repositioned at newly emerging principal dendrites. Our results suggest that polarized growth of the apical dendrite is regulated by cell intrinsic programs, while regression of basal dendrites requires cue(s) from the extracellular environment in the dentate gyrus. The apical dendrite designation is determined from among multiple growing dendrites of young developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2080509422,"Maintenance of a balance between commensal bacteria and the mucosal immune system is crucial and intestinal dysbiosis may be a key event in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important pattern-recognition receptor that regulates inflammation and barrier function in the gut by a mechanism that involves activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor. Dietary and life style factors may impact these functions. We therefore used a Danish prospective case-cohort study of 1010 CRC cases and 1829 randomly selected participants from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort to investigate three polymorphisms in NFKB1 and TLR4 and their possible interactions with diet and life style factors in relation to risk of CRC. Homozygous carriage of the variant allele of the TLR4/rs5030728 polymorphism was associated with increased risk of CRC (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-1.60; P = 0.02 (gene-dose model); IRR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.01-1.51; P = 0.04 (recessive model)). Del-carriers of the NFKB1/rs28362491 polymorphism had a 17% (95%CI: 1.03-1.34; P = 0.02) increased risk of CRC compared to homozygous carriers of the ins-allele. However, none of these risk estimates withstood adjustment for multiple comparisons. We found no strong gene-environment interactions between the examined polymorphism and diet and life style factors in relation to CRC risk."

Because P- and E-selectin are required for vaso-occlusion in murine sickle cell disease (SCD), we investigated whether 2FF would inhibit vaso-occlusion in SCD mice. Microvascular stasis was measured in subcutaneous venules in NY1DD and HbSS-Townes SCD mice with dorsal skin-fold chambers after infusion of hemoglobin or exposure to hypoxia/reoxygenation. 2FF in drinking water or administered by gavage inhibited stasis in sickle mice in a dose-responsive manner. Significant inhibitory effects on stasis were seen 1 day post-treatment. 2FF treatment of SCD mice also significantly reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion along the vessel walls of SCD mice and the static adhesion of neutrophils and sickle red blood cells isolated from 2FF-treated SCD mice to resting and activated endothelial cells. Total white blood cell counts increased in response to 2FF. NF-ĸB activation and VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression were inhibited in the livers of SCD mice consistent with an overall decrease in vascular inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion physiology. Pretreatment with 2FF completely eliminated heme-induced lethality in HbSS-Townes mice, consistent with the observed anti-inflammatory and anti-adhesive properties of 2FF in SCD mice. These data suggest that 2FF may be beneficial for preventing or treating vaso-occlusive crises in SCD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2048034225,"Background Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) lyses erythrocytes and induces lipid peroxidation, indicated by increasing plasma concentrations of free hemoglobin, F2-isoprostanes, and isofurans. Acetaminophen attenuates hemeprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation, reduces plasma and urine concentrations of F2-isoprostanes, and preserves kidney function in an animal model of rhabdomyolysis. Acetaminophen also attenuates plasma concentrations of isofurans in children undergoing CPB. The effect of acetaminophen on lipid peroxidation in adults has not been studied. This was a pilot study designed to test the hypothesis that acetaminophen attenuates lipid peroxidation in adults undergoing CPB and to generate data for a clinical trial aimed to reduce acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery. Methods and Results In a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, sixty adult patients were randomized to receive intravenous acetaminophen or placebo starting prior to initiation of CPB and for every 6 hours for 4 doses. Acetaminophen concentrations measured 30 min into CPB and post-CPB were 11.9±0.6 μg/mL (78.9±3.9 μM) and 8.7±0.3 μg/mL (57.6±2.0 μM), respectively. Plasma free hemoglobin increased more than 15-fold during CPB, and haptoglobin decreased 73%, indicating hemolysis. Plasma and urinary markers of lipid peroxidation also increased during CPB but returned to baseline by the first postoperative day. Acetaminophen reduced plasma isofuran concentrations over the duration of the study (P = 0.05), and the intraoperative plasma isofuran concentrations that corresponded to peak hemolysis were attenuated in those subjects randomized to acetaminophen (P = 0.03). Perioperative acetaminophen did not affect plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes or urinary markers of lipid peroxidation. Conclusions Intravenous acetaminophen attenuates the increase in intraoperative plasma isofuran concentrations that occurs during CPB, while urinary markers were unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W1966621812,"Signal transfer in neural circuits is dynamically modified by the recent history of neuronal activity. Short-term plasticity endows synapses with nonlinear transmission properties, yet synapses in sensory and motor circuits are capable of signaling linearly over a wide range of presynaptic firing rates. How do such synapses achieve rate-invariant transmission despite history-dependent nonlinearities? Here, ultrastructural, biophysical, and computational analyses demonstrate that concerted molecular, anatomical, and physiological refinements are required for central vestibular nerve synapses to linearly transmit rate-coded sensory signals. Vestibular synapses operate in a physiological regime of steady-state depression imposed by tonic firing. Rate-invariant transmission relies on brief presynaptic action potentials that delimit calcium influx, large pools of rapidly mobilized vesicles, multiple low-probability release sites, robust postsynaptic receptor sensitivity, and efficient transmitter clearance. Broadband linear synaptic filtering of head motion signals is thus achieved by coordinately tuned synaptic machinery that maintains physiological operation within inherent cell biological limitations."
https://openalex.org/W1986115496,"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) has a major role in the development of human malignancies. We have previously shown that MDM2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase and major negative regulator of p53, binds to and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of RB. MDMX, a homolog of MDM2, also binds to and inhibits p53 transactivation activity, yet it does not possess intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity. Here, we show that MDMX binds to and promotes RB degradation in an MDM2-dependent manner. Specifically, the MDMX C-terminal ring domain binds to the RB C-pocket and enhances MDM2-RB interaction. Silencing MDMX induces RB accumulation, cell cycle arrest and senescence-like phenotypes, which are reverted by simultaneous RB knockdown. Furthermore, MDMX ablation leads to significant retardation of xenograft tumor growth, concomitant with RB accumulation. These results demonstrate that MDMX exerts oncogenic activity via suppression of RB, and suggest that both MDM2 and MDMX could be chemotherapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2153104540,"New enforcement strategies allow agents to gain the regulator’s trust and consequently face a lower audit probability. Prior research suggests that, in order to prevent lower compliance, a reduction in the audit probability (the “carrot”) must be compensated with the introduction of a higher penalty for non-compliance (the “stick”). However, such carrot-and-stick strategies reflect neither the concept of trust nor the strategies observed in practice. In response to this, we define trust-based regulation as a strategy that incorporates rules that allow trust to develop, and using a generic (non-cooperative) game of tax compliance, we examine whether trust-based regulation is feasible (i.e., whether, in equilibrium, a reduction in the audit probability, without ever increasing the penalty for non-compliance, does not lead to reduced compliance). The model shows that trust-based regulation is feasible when the agent sufficiently values the future. In line with the concept of trust, this strategy is feasible when the regulator is uncertain about the agent’s intentions. Moreover, the model shows that (i) introducing higher penalties makes trust-based regulation less feasible, and (ii) combining trust and forgiveness can lead to a lower audit probability for both trusted and distrusted agents. Policy recommendations often point toward increasing deterrence. This model shows that the opposite can be optimal."
https://openalex.org/W2029259641,"Field of cancerization in the airway epithelium has been increasingly examined to understand early pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer. However, the extent of field of cancerization throughout the lung airways is unclear. Here we sought to determine the differential gene and microRNA expressions associated with field of cancerization in the peripheral airway epithelial cells of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We obtained peripheral airway brushings from smoker controls (n=13) and from the lung contralateral to the tumor in cancer patients (n=17). We performed gene and microRNA expression profiling on these peripheral airway epithelial cells using Affymetrix GeneChip and TaqMan Array. Integrated gene and microRNA analysis was performed to identify significant molecular pathways. We identified 26 mRNAs and 5 miRNAs that were significantly (FDR <0.1) up-regulated and 38 mRNAs and 12 miRNAs that were significantly down-regulated in the cancer patients when compared to smoker controls. Functional analysis identified differential transcriptomic expressions related to tumorigenesis. Integration of miRNA-mRNA data into interaction network analysis showed modulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway in the contralateral lung field of cancerization. In conclusion, patients with lung adenocarcinoma have tumor related molecules and pathways in histologically normal appearing peripheral airway epithelial cells, a substantial distance from the tumor itself. This finding can potentially provide new biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer and novel therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W2031593010,"Background Media utilization has been identified as an important determinant of tobacco use. We examined the association between self-reported tobacco use and frequency of mass media utilization by women and men in nine low-to middle-income sub-Saharan African countries. Methodology/Principal Findings Data for the study came from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Liberia, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe over the period 2006–2011. Each survey population was a cross-sectional sample of women aged 15–49 years and men aged 15–59 years, with information on tobacco use and media access being obtained by face-to-face interviews. An index of media utilization was constructed based on responses to questions on the frequency of reading newspapers, frequency of watching television and frequency of listening to the radio. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were considered as potentially confounding covariates. Logistic regression models with country and cluster specific random effects were estimated for the pooled data. Results The risk of cigarette smoking increased with greater utilization to mass media. The use of smokeless tobacco and tobacco use in general declined with greater utilization to mass media. The risk of tobacco use was 5% lower in women with high media utilization compared to those with low media utilization [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.82–1.00]. Men with a high media utilization were 21% less likely to use tobacco compared to those with low media utilization [AOR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.73–0.85]. In the male sample, tobacco use also declined with the increased frequency of reading newspapers (or magazines), listening to radio and watching television. Conclusions Mass media campaigns, conducted in the context of comprehensive tobacco control programmes, can reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking in sub-Saharan Africa. The reach, intensity, duration and type of messages are important aspects of the campaigns but need to also address all forms of tobacco use."

https://openalex.org/W2043052195,"It is well documented that angiotensin (Ang) II contributes to kidney disease progression. The protease prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is highly expressed in the kidney and may be renoprotective by degrading Ang II to Ang-(1-7). The aim of the study was to investigate whether renal PRCP protein expression and activity are altered in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertensive mice. Left renal artery was constricted by using 0.12 mm silver clips. Blood pressure was measured using telemetry over the eleven weeks of study period and revealed an immediate increase in 2K1C animals during the first week of clip placement which was followed by a gradual decrease to baseline blood pressure. Similarly, urinary albumin excretion was significantly increased one week after 2K1C and returned to baseline levels during the following weeks. At 2 weeks and at the end of the study, renal pathologies were exacerbated in the 2K1C model as revealed by a significant increase in mesangial expansion and renal fibrosis. Renal PRCP expression and activity were significantly reduced in clipped kidneys. Immunofluorescence revealed the loss of renal tubular PRCP but not glomerular PRCP. In contrast, expression of prolyl endopeptidase, another enzyme capable of converting Ang II into Ang-(1-7), was not affected, while angiotensin converting enzyme was elevated in unclipped kidneys and renin was increased in clipped kidneys. Results suggest that PRCP is suppressed in 2K1C and that this downregulation may attenuate renoprotective effects via impaired Ang II degradation by PRCP."
https://openalex.org/W2086758270,"During vertebrate blood vessel development, lumen formation is the critical process by which cords of endothelial cells transition into functional tubular vessels. Here, we use Xenopus embryos to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lumen formation of the dorsal aorta and the posterior cardinal veins, the primary major vessels that arise via vasculogenesis within the first 48 hours of life. We demonstrate that endothelial cells are initially found in close association with one another through the formation of tight junctions expressing ZO-1. The emergence of vascular lumens is characterized by elongation of endothelial cell shape, reorganization of junctions away from the cord center to the periphery of the vessel, and onset of Claudin-5 expression within tight junctions. Furthermore, unlike most vertebrate vessels that exhibit specialized apical and basal domains, we show that early Xenopus vessels are not polarized. Moreover, we demonstrate that in embryos depleted of the extracellular matrix factor Epidermal Growth Factor-Like Domain 7 (EGFL7), an evolutionarily conserved factor associated with vertebrate vessel development, vascular lumens fail to form. While Claudin-5 localizes to endothelial tight junctions of EGFL7-depleted embryos in a timely manner, endothelial cells of the aorta and veins fail to undergo appropriate cell shape changes or clear junctions from the cell-cell contact. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time the mechanisms by which lumens are generated within the major vessels in Xenopus and implicate EGFL7 in modulating cell shape and cell-cell junctions to drive proper lumen morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2103352087,"Background Allergen exposure via the respiratory tract and in particular via the nasal mucosa boosts systemic allergen-specific IgE production. Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) represent a first line treatment of allergic rhinitis but their effects on this boost of allergen-specific IgE production are unclear. Aim Here we aimed to determine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study whether therapeutic doses of an INCS preparation, i.e., nasal fluticasone propionate, have effects on boosts of allergen-specific IgE following nasal allergen exposure. Methods Subjects (n = 48) suffering from grass and birch pollen allergy were treated with daily fluticasone propionate or placebo nasal spray for four weeks. After two weeks of treatment, subjects underwent nasal provocation with either birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 or grass pollen allergen Phl p 5. Bet v 1 and Phl p 5-specific IgE, IgG1–4, IgM and IgA levels were measured in serum samples obtained at the time of provocation and one, two, four, six and eight weeks thereafter. Results Nasal allergen provocation induced a median increase to 141.1% of serum IgE levels to allergens used for provocation but not to control allergens 4 weeks after provocation. There were no significant differences regarding the boosts of allergen-specific IgE between INCS- and placebo-treated subjects. Conclusion In conclusion, the application of fluticasone propionate had no significant effects on the boosts of systemic allergen-specific IgE production following nasal allergen exposure.

Parasite materials could be prepared in one hour, did not need to be sectioned, and were subsequently utilized for further whole-mount staining assays directly. Using these preparations, in combination with conventional fluorescence staining techniques, we could detect the expression and subcellular localization of a specific protein and identify in situ proliferative or apoptotic cells in the germinal layer of metacestode vesicles. Based on this approach, future molecular and cellular analysis of Echinococcus metacestode vesicles in the in vitro system will be greatly facilitated."
https://openalex.org/W1988204280,"To determine the optimal cut-off value of serum total adiponectin for managing the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS) in male Japanese workers.A total of 365 subjects without MetS aged 20-60 years were followed up prospectively for a mean of 3.1 years. The accelerated failure-time model was used to estimate time ratio (TR) and cut-off value for developing MetS.During follow-up, 45 subjects developed MetS. Age-adjusted TR significantly declined with decreasing total adiponectin level (≤ 4.9, 5.0-6.6, 6.7-8.8 and ≥ 8.9 μg/ml, P for trend = 0.003). In multivariate analyses, TR of MetS was 0.12 (95% CI 0.02-0.78; P = 0.03) in subjects with total adiponectin level of 5.0-6.6 μg/ml, and 0.15 (95% CI 0.02-0.97; P = 0.047) in subjects with total adiponectin level ≤ 4.9 μg/ml compared with those with total adiponectin level ≥ 8.9 μg/ml. The accelerated failure-time model showed that the optimal cut-off value of total adiponectin for managing the risk of developing MetS was 6.2 μg/ml. In the multivariate-adjusted model, the mean time to the development of MetS was 78% shorter for total adiponectin level ≤ 6.2 μg/ml compared with > 6.2 μg/ml (TR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.64, P = 0.005).Our findings suggest that the cut-off value for managing the risk of developing MetS is 6.2 μg/ml in male Japanese workers. Subjects with total adiponectin level ≤ 6.2 μg/ml developed MetS more rapidly than did those with total adiponectin level > 6.2 μg/ml."
https://openalex.org/W2034614014,"The levels of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver are associated with response to treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). However, associations between the responses of ISGs to IFN-based therapy and treatment efficacy or interleukin-28B (IL28B) genotype have not yet been determined. Therefore, we investigated the early responses of ISGs and interferon-lambdas (IFN-λs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during PEG-IFN/RBV plus NS3/4 protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. We prospectively enrolled 50 chronic hepatitis C patients with HCV genotype 1, and collected PBMCs at baseline, 8 and 24 h after the initial administration of PEG-IFN/RBV/PI. Levels of mRNAs for selected ISGs and IFN-λs were evaluated by real-time PCR. All 31 patients with a favorable IL28B genotype and 13 of 19 with an unfavorable genotype achieved sustained virological responses (SVR). Levels of mRNA for A20, SOCS1, and SOCS3, known to suppress antiviral activity by interfering with the IFN signaling pathway, as well as IRF1 were significantly higher at 8 h in patients with an unfavorable IL28B genotype than in those with a favorable one (P = 0.007, 0.026, 0.0004, 0.0006, respectively), especially in the non-SVR group. Particularly, the fold-change of IRF1 at 8 h relative to baseline was significantly higher in non-SVR than in SVR cases with an unfavorable IL28B genotype (P = 0.035). In conclusion, levels of several mRNAs of genes suppressing antiviral activity in PBMCs during PEG-IFN/RBV/PI differed according to IL28B genotypes, paralleling treatment efficacy."

https://openalex.org/W2062873312,"Weight control by dietary calorie restriction (DCR) or exercise has been shown to prevent cancer in various models. However, the mechanisms as to how weight control is beneficial are not well understood. While previous reports have investigated the effects of weight control on total lipid levels or lipid composition within cellular membranes, there has been little work surrounding changes to individual lipids following weight control interventions. In this study, using a model of skin carcinogenesis centered on the tumor promotion stage, CD-1 mice were randomly assigned into 4 groups: ad libitum and sedentary (control), ad libitum with exercise (AL+Exe), exercise with pair feeding of a diet isocaloric with control (PF+Exe), and sedentary with 20% DCR compared to control. After ten weeks, body weight and body fat percentages significantly decreased in the PF+Exe and DCR groups but not AL+Exe when compared with sedentary controls. Murine skin and plasma samples were obtained for analysis. Lipidomics using electrospray ionization MS/MS was employed to profile triacylglycerol (TG) and diacylglycerol (DG) species. Both plasma and tissue TG species containing fatty acid chains with length 18:1 were significantly decreased following DCR when compared to sedentary control animals. In regards to DG, the most significant changes occurred in the plasma. DG species containing fatty acids with lengths 16:1 or 18:1 were significantly decreased in PF+Exe and DCR groups when compared to sedentary controls. Due to the significant role of TG in energy storage and DG in cellular signaling, our findings of the effects of weight control on individual TG and DG species in plasma and skin tissue following exposure to a tumor promoter, may provide insight into the mechanism of weight control on cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1972259532,"Introduction Stereotype awareness—or an individual’s perception of the degree to which negative beliefs or stereotypes are held by the public—is an important factor mediating public stigma, self-stigma and their negative consequences. Research is required to assess how individuals become more sensitive to perceive stereotypes, pointing the way to therapeutic options to reduce its negative effects and increase stigma resilience. Because perception and interpretation can be guided by belief systems, and childhood trauma (CT) is reported to impact such beliefs, CT is explored in relation to stereotype awareness (SA) in persons with psychosis, their siblings and controls. Method Data from the GROUP project (Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis) were analyzed. SA was measured by devaluation scales which assess a respondent’s perception of the degree to which stereotypes about people with mental illness and about their families are held by the public. CT was measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (short form). Results In patients, symptoms of disorganization and emotional distress were associated with SA about people with mental illness. In siblings, schizotypal features were associated with both types of SA (more schizotypy = more SA). In both patients and siblings, CT was associated with both types of SA (more CT = more SA), independent of symptoms (patients) or schizotypy (siblings). Conclusion CT in people with psychosis and their siblings may sensitize to SA. Thus, CT may not only impact on risk for illness onset, it may also increase SA associated with mental illness, potentially interfering with the recovery process. CT-induced SA may indicate a heightened sensitivity to threat, which may also impact psychopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2067921148,"We developed and tested a multicomponent peptide-woven siRNA nanocomplex (PwSN) comprising different peptides designed for efficient cellular targeting, endosomal escape, and release of siRNA. To enhance tumor-specific cellular uptake, we connected an interleukin-4 receptor-targeting peptide (I4R) to a nine-arginine peptide (9r), yielding I4R-9r. To facilitate endosomal escape, we blended endosomolytic peptides into the I4R-9r to form a multicomponent nanocomplex. Lastly, we modified 9r peptides by varying the number and positions of positive charges to obtain efficient release of siRNA from the nanocomplex in the cytosol. Using this step-wise approach for overcoming the biological challenges of siRNA delivery, we obtained an optimized PwSN with significant biological activity in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance analyses and three-dimensional peptide models demonstrated that our designed peptide adopted a unique structure that was correlated with faster complex disassembly and a better gene-silencing effect. These studies further elucidate the siRNA nanocomplex delivery pathway and demonstrate the applicability of our stepwise strategy to the design of siRNA carriers capable of overcoming multiple challenges and achieving efficient delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2088103011,"Previously, in an attempt to isolate stem cells that would be capable of regenerating injured skeletal muscle, we cultured cells derived from muscle, non-adherently, in serum-free media. As a result of the culture conditions used, these cells formed spheres, and thus were referred to as myospheres. It was found that myosphere-derived cells expressed Sca-1, a marker that is not typically associated with myogenic cells, and as a result has generated some questions as to the origin of these cells. The goal of this study was to clearly determine the origin of myosphere-derived cells, and in particular to answer the question of whether myospheres contain myogenic cells. To determine if myospheres were composed of myogenic cells without altering the structure of myospheres or the culture conditions used to maintain myospheres, I isolated these cells from yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Myf5, YFP-MyoD, and ZsGreen-Pax7 lineage-tracing mice and monitored their growth over time. I found that myospheres do contain myogenic cells, but that these cells are gradually lost over time (within 2 months). Additionally, the use of the lineage-tracing mice gave an interesting perspective into the composition of myospheres. I found that myospheres were composed of two distinct cell types, one that is myogenic (α7 integrin+) and contains cells expressing Myf5, MyoD, and Pax7, and a second that is non-myogenic (α7 integrin-) expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) and Sca-1, both of which have been associated with fibro/adipocyte mesenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094546150,"Myxoma virus (MYXV) induces a lethal disease called Myxomatosis in European rabbits. MYXV is one of the rare viruses that encodes an α2,3-sialyltransferase through its M138L gene. In this study, we showed that although the absence of the enzyme was not associated with any in vitro deficit, the M138L deficient strains are highly attenuated in vivo. Indeed, while all rabbits infected with the parental and the revertant strains died within 9 days post-infection from severe myxomatosis, all but one rabbit inoculated with the M138L deficient strains survived the infection. In primary lesions, this resistance to the infection was associated with an increased ability of innate immune cells, mostly neutrophils, to migrate to the site of virus replication at 4 days post-infection. This was followed by the development of a better specific immune response against MYXV. Indeed, at day 9 post-infection, we observed an important proliferation of lymphocytes and an intense congestion of blood vessels in lymph nodes after M138L knockouts infection. Accordingly, in these rabbits, we observed an intense mononuclear cell infiltration throughout the dermis in primary lesions and higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Finally, this adaptive immune response provided protection to these surviving rabbits against a challenge with the MYXV WT strain. Altogether, these results show that expression of the M138L gene contributes directly or indirectly to immune evasion by MYXV. In the future, these results could help us to better understand the pathogenesis of myxomatosis but also the importance of glycans in regulation of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1992010131,"Isovaline is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that has analgesic properties. R-isovaline is a proposed agonist of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor in the thalamus and peripheral tissue. Interestingly, the responses to R-isovaline differ from those of the canonical GABA(B) receptor agonist R-baclofen, warranting further investigation. Using whole cell recording techniques we explored isovaline actions on GABA(B) receptors coupled to rectifying K+ channels in cells of recombinant and native receptor preparations. In AtT-20 cells transfected with GABA(B) receptor subunits, bath application of the GABA(B) receptor agonists, GABA (1 μM) and R-baclofen (5 μM) produced inwardly rectifying currents that reversed approximately at the calculated reversal potential for K+ R- isovaline (50 μM to 1 mM) and S-isovaline (500 μM) did not evoke a current. R-isovaline applied either extracellularly (250 μM) or intracellularly (10 μM) did not alter responses to GABA at 1 μM. Co-administration of R-isovaline (250 μM) with a low concentration (10 nM) of GABA did not result in a response. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons that natively express GABA(B) receptors, R-baclofen (5 μM) induced GABA(B) receptor-dependent inward currents. Under the same conditions R-isovaline (1 or 50 μM) did not evoke a current or significantly alter R-baclofen-induced effects. Therefore, R-isovaline does not interact with recombinant or native GABA(B) receptors to open K+ channels in these preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2091690302,"Afforestation is a prevalent practice carried out for soil recovery and carbon sequestration. Improved understanding of the effects of afforestation on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and dynamics is necessary to identify the particular processes of soil organic matter (SOM) formation and/or decomposition that result from afforestation. To elucidate these mechanisms, we have used a sequential density fractionation technique to identify the transfer mechanisms of forest derived C to soil fractions and investigate the impact of afforestation on SOC sequestration. Surface soil samples from continuous maize crop land (C4) and forest land (C3), which had been established 5, 12 and 25 yr, respectively, on the Northeast China Plain were separated into five density fractions. SOC, nitrogen (N) concentration and δ13C data from the three forests and adjacent cropland were compared. Afforestation decreased SOC concentration in the < 2.5 g cm-3 fractions from 5 yr forest sites, but increased SOC content in the < 2.0 g cm-3 fractions from 25 yr forest sites. Afforestation did not affect soil mass distribution, SOC and N proportional weight distributions across the density fractions. The < 1.8 g cm-3 fractions from 12 and 25 yr forests showed higher C/N and lower δ13C as compared to other fractions. Incorporation of forest litter-derived C occurred from low density (< 1.8 g cm-3) fractions to aggregates of higher density (1.8-2.5 g cm-3) through aggregate recombination and C transport in the pore system of the aggregates. Some forest litter-derived C could transfer from the light fractions or directly diffuse and adsorb onto mineral particles. Results from this study indicate that microaggregate protection and association between organic material and minerals provide major contribution to the SOC sequestration in the afforested soil system."
https://openalex.org/W2051650090,"The ability to identify the functional correlates of structural and sequence variation in proteins is a critical capability. We related structures of influenza A N10 and N11 proteins that have no established function to structures of proteins with known function by identifying spatially conserved atoms. We identified atoms with common distributed spatial occupancy in PDB structures of N10 protein, N11 protein, an influenza A neuraminidase, an influenza B neuraminidase, and a bacterial neuraminidase. By superposing these spatially conserved atoms, we aligned the structures and associated molecules. We report spatially and sequence invariant residues in the aligned structures. Spatially invariant residues in the N6 and influenza B neuraminidase active sites were found in previously unidentified spatially equivalent sites in the N10 and N11 proteins. We found the corresponding secondary and tertiary structures of the aligned proteins to be largely identical despite significant sequence divergence. We found structural precedent in known non-neuraminidase structures for residues exhibiting structural and sequence divergence in the aligned structures. In N10 protein, we identified staphylococcal enterotoxin I-like domains. In N11 protein, we identified hepatitis E E2S-like domains, SARS spike protein-like domains, and toxin components shared by alpha-bungarotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin I, anthrax lethal factor, clostridium botulinum neurotoxin, and clostridium tetanus toxin. The presence of active site components common to the N6, influenza B, and S. pneumoniae neuraminidases in the N10 and N11 proteins, combined with the absence of apparent neuraminidase function, suggests that the role of neuraminidases in H17N10 and H18N11 emerging influenza A viruses may have changed. The presentation of E2S-like, SARS spike protein-like, or toxin-like domains by the N10 and N11 proteins in these emerging viruses may indicate that H17N10 and H18N11 sialidase-facilitated cell entry has been supplemented or replaced by sialidase-independent receptor binding to an expanded cell population that may include neurons and T-cells."
