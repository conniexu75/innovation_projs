https://openalex.org/W1535828429,"Buthionine sulfoximine (S-n-butyl homocysteine sulfoximine), the most potent of a series of analogs of methionine sulfoximine thus far studied (Griffith, O.W., Anderson, M.E., and Meister, A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1205-1210), inhibited gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase about 20 times more effectively than did prothionine sulfoximine and at least 100 times more effectively than methionine sulfoximine. The findings support the conclusion that the S-alkyl moiety of the sulfoximine binds at the enzyme site that normally binds the acceptor amino acid. Thus, the affinity of the enzyme for the S-ethyl, S-n-propyl, and S-n-butyl sulfoximines increases in a manner which is parallel to those of the corresponding isosteric acceptor amino acid substrates, i.e. glycine, alanine, and alpha-aminobutyrate. Buthionine sulfoximine did not inhibit glutamine synthetase detectably, nor did it produce convulsions when injected into mice. Injection of buthionine sulfoximine into mice decreased the level of glutathione in the kidney to a greater extent (less than 20% of the control level) than found previously after giving prothionine sulfoximine. alpha-Methyl buthionine sulfoximine was also prepared and found to be almost as effective as buthionine sulfoximine; this compound would not be expected to undergo substantial degradative metabolism. Buthionine sulfoximine and alpha-methyl buthionine sulfoximine may be useful agents for inhibition of glutathione synthesis in various experimental systems."

The tissue contents of the reactants of the creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) reaction were measured in rat brain and muscle. In vitro the value of the expression: KG+G = [sigma3PG] . [sigmaATP] . [sigmalactate] KLDH = [sigmaHAP]/22] . [sigmaADP][sigmaPi] . [sigmaRUVATE] (1) was found to be 0.725 x 10(7) M-1 at I = 0.25, T = 38 degrees C, and free [Mg2+] = 0.15 mM and the value measured in vivo in red cell was 0.699 x 10(7) M-1. The value of the expression KMYK = ([sigma ATP] [sigma AMP]/[ADP2]) measured under the above conditions and at pH 7.2 was found to be 0.744 while the value found in red cell was 0.784 +/- 0.037. These reactions, therefore, appear to be in a state of near-equilibrium in the red cell and the measured tissue contents of ATP and ADP, which are common reactants in both reactions, approximate closely the activity of these reactants in vivo. In brain and muscle, the value of KG + G/KLDH calculated from the measured tissue contents of the reactants was a factor of 20 or more lower than that expected at equilibrium as was the measured value of the expression: KCK = [sigma ATP] [sigma creatine] divided by [sigma ADP] [sigma creatine-P] [H+] (2) Substitution of calculated free [sigma ADP] values in the expression of KG + G/KLDH gave values of 0.83 +/- 0.19 x 10(7) M-1 for brain and muscle, respectively, which agreed well with the value of 1.65 x 10(7) M-1 measured in vitro at I = 0.25, free [Mg2+] = 1 mM, T = 38 degrees C. This agreement between two highly active enzyme systems in the same compartment is taken as evidence of the existence of near-equilibrium in both these systems and suggests that free cytosolic [sigma ADP] is probably 20-fold lower than measured cell ADP content in mitochondrial-containing tissues."

This is around 10,000 times higher than the second order rate constant for the reaction between insulin and dithiothreitol, demonstrating the high affinity of insulin for thioredoxin-(SH)z. Nondisulfide oxidants such as Cu2+ ions, diamide, and vitamin KI, which are known to mimic the effects of insulin on cellular hexose transport, were rapidly reduced by the thioredoxin system. The exceptional reactivity of insulin and thioredoxin-(SH)2, in vitro, is consistent with a physiological function for mammalian thioredoxin in the degradation of insulin. Functions for thioredoxin in the “thiol oxidation-reduction model” of insulin action are discussed."

Another group of rats with implanted jugular catheters self-administered etonitazene (10 micrograms per kilogram) intravenously on a continuous reinforcement schedule, and the number of infusions increased significantly on days when they were deprived of food. These results suggest that feeding condition may be a powerful determinant of drug-reinforced behavior."

The stereoselectivity is ascribed to differences in stability of the diastereomeric amino acid-copper compexes formed in solution. A simple change in the chirality of the eluant reverses the order of the enantiomer elution. For detection and quantification of picomole amounts of amino acids, the eluant is monitored for fluorescence after reaction with o-phthalaldehyde, a reagent insensitive to proline but highly sensitive for amino acids containing a primary amino group."
https://openalex.org/W1527708502,"The reversibility of the stepwise reduction of Compound I to the ferric state via Compound II was confirmed in horseradish peroxidases A2 and C. The values of E'o (compound I/Compound II) and E'O (Compound II/ferric) were measured from equilibrium data coupled with the K2IrCl6-K3IrCl6 system in a narrow region of pH near 6.3. The ferric enzymes were also oxidized by ferricyanide to Compound II at alkaline pH and the values of E'O (Compound II/ferric) were measured from the equilibrium data. The pH dependence of E'O (Compound II/ferric) was in accord with the equation: E'O = EO + 0.058 log (Kr[H+] + [H+]2)/(KO + [H+]), where Kr and KO are proton dissociation constants in the ferric enzyme and Compound II, respectively. The pH-E'O (Compound I/Compound II) curves were likewise obtained from the equation, E'O = EO + 0.058 log (Kr + [H+]), where Kr is the proton dissociation constant in Compound II. The forward and backward rate constants were measured in each of one-electron transfer reactions of the peroxidases with the K2IrCl6-K3IrCl6 system at various pH values. The E'O values calculated on the assumption that the ratio of the rate constants equals the equilibrium constant were compared with those obtained from the equilibrium data."

https://openalex.org/W1538353123,"The subunits of the 11 S storage protein from soybean cultivar CX635-1-1-1 were purified and characterized. Six polypeptides with acidic isoelectric points and four with basic isoelectric points were isolated from the purified storage protein. The acidic polypeptides had phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and arginine at the NH2 termini, while the basic polypeptides all had glycine at the NH2 termini. Amino acid analysis indicated that certain acidic and basic polypeptides contained 3 to 6 times more methionine than the other polypeptides. Since the low nutritional quality of legume storage proteins is due to a deficiency in methionine, this observation will have significance in efforts to improve soybean quality. The purified polypeptides were further characterized by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Considerable homology was found between the members of individual families of acidic and basic polypeptides, indicating that the members of each family arose from a common ancestral gene. This study showed that the glycinin polypeptide composition is more complex than previous reports indicated, and for the first time characterized the various polypeptides of the 11 S storage protein by structural analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1569489894,"The substrate specificities of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases have been compared by kinetic analysis using synthetic peptides as substrates. Both enzymes catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from ATP to calf thymus histone H2B, as well as to two synthetic peptides, Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu and Arg-Lys-Glu-Ser36-Tyr-Ser-Val, corresponding to the amino acid sequences around serine 32 and serine 36 in histone H2B. Serine 38 in the latter peptide was not phosphorylated by either enzyme. Cyclic GMP-dependent kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent kinase catalyzed the incorporation of 1.1 and 2.0 mol of phosphate/mol of histone H2B, respectively. The phosphorylation of histone H2B, respectively. The phosphorylation of histone H2B by cyclic GMP-dependent kinase showed two distinct optima as the magnesium concentration was increased. However, the phosphorylation of either synthetic peptide by this enzyme was depressed at high magnesium concentrations. As the pH of reaction mixtures was elevated from pH 6 to pH 9, the rate of phosphorylation of Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu by cyclic GMP-dependent kinase continually increased. Acetylation of the NH2 terminus of the peptide did not qualitatively affect this pH profile, but did increase the Vmax value of the enzyme 3-fold. The apparent Km and Vmax values for the phosphorylation of Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu by cyclic GMP-dependent kinase were 21 microM and 4.4 mumol/min/mg, respectively. The synthetic peptide Arg-Lys-Glu-Ser36-Tyr-Ser-Val was a relatively poor substrate for cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, exhibiting a Km value of 732 microM, although the Vmax was 12 micromol/min/mg. With histone H2B as substrate for the cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, two different Km values were apparent. The Km values for cyclic AMP-dependent kinase for either synthetic peptide were approximately 100 microM, but the Vmax for Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu was 1.1 mumol/min/mg, while the Vmax for Arg-Lys-Glu-Ser36-Tyr-Ser-Val was 16.5 mumol/min/mg. These data suggest that although the two cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases have similar substrate specificities, the determinants dictated by the primary sequence around the two phosphorylation sites in histone H2B are different for the two enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1849264732,"p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) from Pseudomonas fluorescens is a NADPH-dependent, FAD-containing monooxygenase catalyzing the hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate to form 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate in the presence of NADPH and molecular oxygen. The mechanism of this three-substrate reaction was investigated in detail at pH 6.6, 4 degrees C, by steady state kinetics, stopped flow spectrophotometry, and equilibrium binding experiments. The initial velocity patterns are consistent with a ping-pong type mechanism which involves two ternary complexes between the enzyme and substrates. The first ternary complex is formed by random addition of p-hydroxybenzoate and NADPH to the enzyme, followed by the release of the first product (NADP+). The reduced enzyme . p-hydroxybenzoate complex now reacts with oxygen, the third substrate, to form the second ternary complex. The enzyme-bound p-hydroxybenzoate then reacts with the activated oxygen to give 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate which is released regenerating the oxidized enzyme for the next cycle. The binding of p-hydroxybenzoate to the oxidized enzyme to form a 1:1 complex causes large, characteristic spectral perturbations and fluorescence quenching. The dissociation constant for the enzyme . substrate complex was obtained by titrations in which absorbance and/or fluorescence quenching was measured. The binding constants of NADPH to the enzyme with and without p-hydroxybenzoate were determined kinetically by measuring the rate of reduction of the enzyme at different concentrations of NADPH. The reduction of the enzyme proceeds extremely slowly in the absence of p-hydroxybenzoate. The presence of the substrate causes a dramatic stimulation (140,000-fold) in the rate of enzyme reduction. The anaerobic reduction of the enzyme by NADPH in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate produces a transient charge-transfer intermediate. On the basis of the proposed mechanism, the dissociation constants for p-hydroxybenzoate and NADPH as well as the Michaelis constants for all the three substrates were calculated from the initial velocity data. The agreement obtained between various kinetic parameters from the initial rate measurements and those calculated from the individual rate constants determined in rapid reactions, strongly supports the proposed mechanism for the p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2071018066,"A reactive metabolite of acetaminophen is hepatotoxic in humans when the drug is ingested in large overdoses. The ability of the human fetal and adult liver to oxidize acetaminophen by trapping the potentially toxic metabolite as a glutathione conjugate has been measured. Oxidation by fetal liver was approximately ten times slower than by adult liver. However, there was a definite increase in acetaminophen oxidation with fetal age. Isolated human fetal liver cells conjugated acetaminophen with sulfate but not with glucuronic acid. The results indicate that the human fetal liver is able to detoxify acetaminophen by conjugation. However, it also catalyzes the formation of an active metabolite of acetaminophen through oxidation. Hence the fetus remains at risk should a large dose of the drug cross into the fetal circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2121423905,"Representative examples of the various classes of flavoproteins have been converted to their apoprotein forms and the native flavin replaced by 8-mercapto-FMN or 8-mercapto-FAD. The spectral and catalytic properties of the modified enzymes are characteristically different from one group to another; the results suggest that flavin interactions at positions N(1) or N(5) of the flavin chromophore have profound influences on the properties of the flavoprotein. 1. The 8-thiolate anion form of 8-mercaptoflavin has an absorption maximum in the region 520 to 550 nm epsilon approximately 30 mM-1 cm-1). This form is retained on binding to flavoproteins whose physiological reactions involve obligatory one-electron transfers (e.g. flavodoxin, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase). In the native form these enzymes stabilize the blue neutral radical of the flavin. A radical form of 8-mercaptoflavin is also stabilized by these proteins. 2. The p-quinoid form of 8-mercaptoflavin has an absorption maximum in the range 560 to 600 nm (epsilon approximately 30 mM-1 cm-1). This form is stabilized on binding to flavoproteins of the dehydrogenase-oxidase class (e.g. glucose oxidase, D-amino acid oxidase, lactate oxidase, Old Yellow Enzyme). These same enzymes in their native flavin form stabilize the red semiquinone, and have a pronounced reactivity with sulfite to form flavin N(5)-sulfite adducts. These properties of the native enzyme, including the ability to react with nitroalkane carbanions, are not exhibited by the 8-mercaptoflavoproteins. 3. A group of flavoenzymes fails to conform strictly to the above classification, exhibiting some properties of both classes. These include the examples of flavoprotein hydroxylases and transhydrogenases studied. 4. The riboflavin-binding protein of hen egg whites binds 8-mercaptoriboflavin preferentially in the unionized state, resulting in a shift in pK from 3.8 with free 8-mercaptoriboflavin to greater than or equal to 9.0 with the protein-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W2150296948,"The role of NO . catalase in the activation of partially purified soluble guanylate cyclase of rat liver by NaN3 and NH2OH was examined by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Equilibration of bovine liver catalase with NO resulted in formation of a paramagnetic species exhibiting a three-line ESR spectrum similar to that of NO . catalase. This paramagnetic complex produced concentration-dependent stimulation of preparations of partially purified guanylate cyclase that were devoid of detectable endogenous heme content. The stimulation of partially purified guanylate cyclase by NO . catalase was similar to that obtained with NO . hemoglobin and with NO . cytochrome P-420 prepared by reaction of hepatic microsomes of phenobarbital-treated rats with NO. By contrast, these same enzyme preparations did not respond to NO or catalase alone. Addition of hematin or hemoglobin plus a reducing agent to purified guanylate cyclase restored enzyme responsiveness to NO and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), but not to NaN3 or NH2OH. Responses to the latter agents were restored by catalase and potentiated by a H2O2-generating system. Formation of the NO . catalase complex was evident by ESR spectroscopy in test solutions containing NaN3 or nh2oh, catalase, and a glucose-glucose oxidase, H2O2-generating system. The presence of NO . catalase correlated well with the ability of test solutions to activate purified guanylate cyclase. These results provide evidence for catalase-dependent NO generation from NaN3 and NH2OH under conditions leading to guanylate cyclase activation. Preformed NO . hemoglobin or NO . cytochrome P-420 also activated heme-deficient partially purified guanylate cyclase. The ability of several preformed NO . heme protein complexes, but not NO, to stimulate heme-deficient guanylate cyclase supports the concept that formation of the paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complex, mediated by either enzymatic or nonenzymatic reactions, is a common and essential step in the process by which NO or NO-forming compounds activate guanylate cyclase. In the absence of the NO ligand, both hemoglobin and catalase suppress the stimulatory effects of the corresponding NO . heme proteins on guanylate cyclase. Release of each heme protein from the NO . heme protein complex occurs more rapidly under aerobic compared to anaerobic conditions. However, hemoglobin is approximately 2000 times more effective as an inhibitor of NO . hemoglobin stimulation of guanylate cyclase than is catalase as an inhibitor of NO . catalase action. This finding may explain the more pronounced decline in the rate of cGMP generation in air in the presence of NO . hemoglobin compared to NO . catalase. The results imply that guanylate cyclase responses to activators that can form NO are determined by both the stimulatory activity of the endogenous heme acceptors of NO and the relative inhibitory effects of the unliganded heme proteins present."
https://openalex.org/W1532140230,"Abstract The effect of antimycin on the ubiquinone cytochrome b-c2 (Q b-c2) oxidoreductase of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides has been studied under controlled oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) conditions by equilibrium measurements and by rapid kinetic analysis of single turnover flash.induced electron and proton translocations. 1. Antimycin shifts the alpha-band of ferro b50 (lambda max 560 nm) by 1 to 2 nm toward the red but has no apparent effect on the equilibrium oxidation-reduction midpoint potential of the cytochrome. 2. This red shift is proportional to the antimycin added until a of 0.7 +/- 0.1 antimycin per reaction center (RC) is approached. With a similar titer antimycin essentially abolishes the following millisecond reactions activated by saturating single turnover flashes: of ferri c2, oxidation of ferro b, Phase III of the membrane-potential-indicating band shift of endogenous carotenoid pigments, and the uptake of 1 of the 2 protons taken up per electron transferred. Such titrations indicate that the binding (KD approximately 10(-9) m) and mode of inhibition of antimycin are noncooperative and are independent of the membrane's coupling status and of the pH and Eb over the range in which electron transport is operative. 3. In the presence of excess antimycin a partial recovery of ferri c2 is seen when the intensity of the flash is diminished, but only at Eh values such that Z (a special quinone serving as reductant for ferri c2) is reduced but b50 is oxidized before activation. These results are consistent with the following model. Each Q b-c2 oxidoreductase complex includes one antimycin binding site, one b50, and one Z. These complexes and the c2 . RC complexes, present in an 0.7:1 ratio, are to some degree mobile with respect to each other. Ferri b50 can be reduced either via the quinones of the RC or via Z in a reaction also involving c2. The former route is kinetically dominant in the presence of antimycin, but the latter route is the means for oxidant-induced reduction and depends on the collisional interaction of the oxidoreductase and c2 . RC complexes. Antimycin interferes with neither of these two routes but does inhibit the oxidation of ferro b50; all the other inhibitory effects are consequent on this."
https://openalex.org/W2000979372,"Kindling is an experimental model of epilepsy in which periodic brain stimulation induces the progressive development of electrical and behavioral seizures. A kindling-induced electrical seizure (afterdischarge) in the rat hippocampus produces prolonged neuronal supersensitivity to microiontophoretically applied acetylcholine after a latency of 40 to 60 minutes. Neuronal acetylcholine supersensitivity is correlated with the further progression of kindling. A larger hippocampal after-discharge is elicited by a subsequent kindling stimulus delivered in the presence of acetylcholine supersensitivity, but not by one delivered before the onset of the supersensitivity. The results suggest that alteration of synaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine may contribute to kindling and epileptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2163357796,"Triacylglycerol lipase activity in homogenates from isolated rat hepatocytes was almost completely con- fined to the acidic region of the pH curve. Maximal activity was found at pH 4.4; a small shoulder was observed at pH 6.6. Very little lipolytic activity and no pH optimum could be detected over the pH range 7.4 to 9.6. The subcellular distribution patterns of lipolytic activity at pH 4.4 and 6.6 were nearly identical and almost completely coincided with the distribution of acid phosphatase. The pH profiles of lipolytic activity in whole cell homogenates and in X fractions thereof, severalfold enriched in lysosomes, were identical. Preincubation of hepatocytes with dibutyryl cyclic AMP or glucagon prior to homogenization or direct incubation of the homogenates with cyclic AMP, ATP, and Mg+ increased phosphorylase a activity but did not affect the low alkaline lipase activity. The lysosomotropic agents chloroquine, ammonia, and methylamine inhibited endogenous fatty acid oxi- dation by 33 to 41% in isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats but did not interfere with the oxidation of exoge- nously added radioactive oleate. When isolated hepa- tocytes were preincubated with radioactive oleate in order to label their triglycerides and subsequently in- cubated in the absence of oleate, the amount of radio- activity disappearing from the hepatocyte triglycerides was identical with the amount of radioactivity found in CO2 plus acid-soluble oxidation products, indicating that endogenous fatty acid oxidation was a valid index for lipolysis. Endogenous fatty acid oxidation and pro- teolysis in isolated hepatocytes were inhibited to a similar extent by all three lysosomotropic agents sug- gesting a common mechanism for inhibition of lipolysis and proteolysis. Our data suggest that the acid lysosomal lipase is the only intracellular triacylglycerol lipase in the paren- chymal cell and that the lysosomes are responsible for the breakdown of hepatic triglycerides.

Application of inosine elicited two types of transmitter-like membrane effects: a rapidly desensitizing excitatory response and a nondesensitizing inhibitory response. Flurazepam produced a similar excitatory response which showed cross-desensitization with the purine excitation. Flurazepam also blocked the inhibitory inosine response.

During a 60-fold purification of the enzyme, the ratios of the activities on these substrates did not change. When 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide was used as substrate the enzyme was active at pH values from 3.0 to 5.5, with maximal activity between pH values 4.0 and 4.5. Concentrations of NaCl from 0.15 to 0.3 M inhibited the activity at low pH values but activated the enzyme between pH 4.0 and 5.5. The enzyme was active on the chondroitin-6-SO4 hexasaccharide from pH 3.0 to 5.5, with a broad optimum between 3.0 and 4.5. NaCl inhibited the activity on the oligosaccharide substrate at all pH values. Eadie-Scatchard plots of rates of 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide hydrolysis at substrate concentrations ranging from 2 to 1000 microM showed multiple kinetic forms of the enzyme, a form with a Km of approximately 11 microM, and a second form with a Km of approximately 225 microM. The pH optimum of the low Km form was 3.5 to 4.0; that of the high Km form was pH 4.5. NaCl inhibited the activity of the low Km form, but activated the high Km form of the enzyme. Chondroitin SO4 oligosaccharides competed with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide for the low Km form of the enzyme but had little effect on the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide by the high Km form of the enzyme. The activities of the beta-glucuronidase on tetra-, hexa-, octa-, and decasaccharides of chondroitin-6-SO4 and chondroitin-4-SO4, measured using a new assay procedure which can detect the formation of 1 nmol of product, were similar, although rates were somewhat lower for the higher oligosaccharides. With the exception of the chondroitin-4-SO4 tetrasaccharide, all of the oligosaccharide substrates saturated the enzyme at concentrations of 20 to 30 microM, indicating Km values of less than 10 to 15 microM for the oligosaccharides. Highly purified beta-glcuronidases from human placenta and from rat preputial gland also showed multiple kinetic forms when assayed using 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide as substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1534993586,"The effects of pH upon the C-2 resonances of the 5 histidine residues of Escherichia coli MB 1428 dihydrofolate reductase in binary complexes with methotrexate, aminopterin, folate, methopterin, and trimethoprim were studied by 300-MHz 1H nmr spectroscopy. Three of the five histidine residues, labeled 1, 2, and 3, exhibited similar pK' values and chemical shifts for their C-2 protons in the five binary complexes. One histidine, 4, was quite different in the folate complex and the last histidine, 5 was quite different in the trimethoprim complex. For all five binary complexes, each histidine had a pK' which was significantly different from the other 4 histidines of that complex. Titration of the binary methotrexate complex of a 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate)-modified enzyme showed that 2 histidines were not perturbed by this modification of Cys 152, and that the alkaline form of histidine 2, the acid form of histidine 4, and, to a lesser extent, the acid form of histidine 3 were slightly perturbed. Titration of the binary methotrexate complex of a N-bromosuccinimide-modified enzyme demonstrated that this modification slightly affected all of the histidines and drastically affected histidine 5. Histidines 3 and 5 of the binary methotrexate complex reacted rapidly with the histidine-specific reagent, ethoxyformic anhydride, while histidines 2 and 4 reacted at a moderate rate and histidine 1 reacted slowly if at all. The local electrostatic environments of the 5 histidine residues as deduced from the crystal structure of the binary complex of the enzyme with methotrexate (Matthews, D.A., Alden, R.A., Bolin, J.T., Freer, S.T., Hamlin, R., Xuong, N., Kraut, J., Poe, M., Williams, M.N., and Hoogsteen, K. (1977) Science 197, 594-597) were used as the basis for proposed assignments of the five histidine C-2 nmr resonances. The assignments were: 1, pK' 7.9 to 8.2, His 124; 2, pK' 7.2 to 7.4, His 141; 3, pK' 6.5 to 6.7, His 149; 4, pK' 5.7 to 6.3, His 114; and 5, pK' 5.2 to 5.9, His 45. The effect of the chemical modifications upon the enzyme's histidine residues were consistent with the assignments, but no direct chemical evidence in support of the assignments was obtained. It was proposed that, since the crystallographic data provided consistent assignments of the histidine nmr data for both native and chemically modified enzyme, the local environment of each of the 5 histidine residues was similar in the crystal and in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1879784,"The binding of NAD+, NADH, and ADP-ribose to horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase has been studied calorimetrically as a function of pH at 25 degrees C. The enthalpy of NADH binding is 0 +/- 0.5 kcal mol-1 in the pH range 6 to 8.6. The enthalpy of NAD+ binding, however, varies with pH in a sigmoidal fashion and is -4.0 kcal mol(NAD)-1 at pH 6.0 and +4.5 kcal mol(NAD)-1 at pH 8.6 with an apparent pKa of 7.6 +/- 0.2. The enthalpy of proton ionization of the group on the enzyme is calculated to be in the range 8.8 to 9.8 kcal mol(H+)-1. In conjunction with the available thermodynamic data on the ionization of zinc-bound water in model compounds, it is concluded that the group with a pKa of 9.8 in the free enzyme and 7.6 in the enzyme . NAD+ binary complex is, most likely, the zinc-bound water molecule. Our studies with zinc-free enzyme provide further evidence for this conclusion. Therefore, the processes involving a conformational change of the enzyme upon NAD+ binding and the suggested mechanism of subsequent quenching of the fluorescence of Trp-314 implicating the participation of an ionized tyrosine group must be re-evaluated in the light of this thermodynamic study."

The reaction of nitrilotriacetic acid with chlorine-containing solutions produces a hitherto unknown degradation production, N-formyliminodiacetic acid, in high yield. The toxicological and environmental implications of this reaction are unclear."
