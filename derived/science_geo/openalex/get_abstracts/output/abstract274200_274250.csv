https://openalex.org/W2067062204,"The leaf-cutting ant Atta caphaloes L. stridulates whenever it is prevented from moving freely. Although audible to the human ear, the airborne sound produced has its main energy concentrated between 20 and 60 kilocycles per second. However, it is not the airborne, but the ground-conducted stridulation sound that acts as a distress alarm: a stridulating ant attracts other workers, and if the ""calling"" ant is covered by earth, intensive digging is released in the attracted nest mates."
https://openalex.org/W2037144780,"Uranium-lead data indicate that the high-pressure granulitic and charnockitic nuclei within the medium-grade metamorphic complex of the Peruvian coastal area must be related to an orogenic event 2 x 10(9) years ago. As in western Africa and Brazil, this old granulitic basement is reworked by Late Precambrian orogeny. Its presence along the Peru-Chile Trench must be taken into account in interpreting the anomalously high strontium isotopic ratios of recent calc-alkaline volcanism."

https://openalex.org/W1990392032,"Sands collected at 24 locations along the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 57°S and 38°N consist predominantly of olivine, diopsidic augite, hypersthene, enstatite, amphibole, quartz, plagioclase, and volcanic glass, suggesting an olivine tholeiitic source. Eight cores contain relatively pure mineral sands; three of these cores reflect local volcanic activity. In 16 cores the manganese-coated mineral grains are mixed in a current-winnowed foraminiferal sand or ooze."

https://openalex.org/W2076729002,"Seeds of the root parasite Orthocarpus densiflorus may be dispersed by the propagules of its host, Hypochoeris glabra. Such coordinated transport, which includes seed clustering, reinforces the integration and stability of populations of this host and parasite."

https://openalex.org/W2088226933,"A thermal diffusion column allows a recovery of 99+/-1 percent of the tritium originally contained in about 50 liters at standard temperature and pressure of hydrogen gas in a final volume of 3.8 liters over a 2-day period. After a tenfold enrichment by electrolysis, a tritium concentration of 10(-18) with an experimental error of a few percent may be measured with a low-level Geiger counter. The results on some well-dated Antarctic snow samples (between 1941 and 1953) are in general agreement with published data."
