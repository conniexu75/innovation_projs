https://openalex.org/W1495912963,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a signal-transducing protein required for sexual differentiation, development, and expression of the male phenotype. A series of human AR deletion mutants were created either by site-directed mutagenesis using restriction enzyme digestion, the polymerase chain reaction, or, for a series of unidirectional NH2-terminal deletions, exonuclease III digestion. Receptor mutants were expressed in monkey kidney COS cells as truncated AR proteins between 20 and 107 kDa as revealed on immunoblots, where wild type AR was a doublet of 114 and 108 kDa. Subcellular localization by immunocytochemical staining demonstrated androgen-dependent nuclear uptake of AR from a perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. A nuclear targeting signal similar in sequence and position to the glucocorticoid receptor and homologous to the SV40 large T antigen was required for androgen-induced nuclear uptake of wild type AR. AR mutants lacking the NH2-terminal and/or steroid binding domains were constitutively nuclear with reduced transcriptional activity. Transcriptional activation by wild type AR was androgen-dependent in cotransfection studies of CV1 cells using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene linked to the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Deletion mutagenesis revealed within the NH2-terminal region a domain required for full transcriptional activity and within the steroid binding domain, an inhibitory function, deletion of which yielded a constitutively active receptor. Inhibition of wild type AR by coexpression with an inactive NH2-terminal fragment suggested competition for nuclear factors required for transcriptional regulation. These studies demonstrate a concerted interplay among the domains of the AR protein in regulating gene transcription."

Spontaneous neurologic disease with spongiform degeneration and gliosis similar to that in mouse scrapie developed at a mean age of 166 days in 35 mice expressing mouse prion protein with the leucine substitution. Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome are reproduced in transgenic mice containing a prion protein with a single amino acid substitution, illustrating that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in animals."

https://openalex.org/W1969308562,"The localization of Ca2+ channels relative to the position of transmitter release sites was investigated at the frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ca2+ channels were labeled with fluorescently tagged omega-conotoxin GVIA, an irreversible Ca2+ channel ligand, and observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The Ca2+ channel labeling almost perfectly matched that of acetylcholine receptors which were labeled with fluorescent alpha-bung-arotoxin. This indicates that groups of Ca2+ channels are localized exclusively at the active zones of the frog NMJ. Cross sections of NMJs showed that Ca2+ channels are clustered on the presynaptic membrane adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1480581382,"A rapid purification procedure for the NF-kappa B transcription factor from the cytosol of human placenta is demonstrated which exploits the insensitivity of the NF-kappa B.DNA complex toward the intercalating agent chloroquine. Purified NF-kappa B required 100 mM KCl or NaCl and a pH of 7.5 to optimally bind to DNA. Equilibrium of binding was reached within less than 5 min in the absence of competitor DNA and after 1 h in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). DNA binding of NF-kappa B was specifically blocked by the chelating agent 1,10-orthophenantroline and could only be reconstituted by addition of Zn2+. Under optimal binding conditions, the dissociation constant for the complex of the purified NF-kappa B with its most frequent cognate DNA motif 5‘-GGGACTTTCC-3‘ was in the range of 10(-12) to 10(-13) M. Various other cis-acting kappa B motifs were recognized by NF-kappa B with lower affinities. A comparative analysis of known NF-kappa B-binding sites and competition experiments with synthetic polynucleotides and oligonucleotides encompassing only one half-site or single-stranded kappa B motifs suggested that the two DNA-binding monomers in the NF-kappa B protein complex can interact differentially with the half-sites of the decameric cognate motif."

https://openalex.org/W1522516056,"RNA polymerase II lacking the fourth and seventh largest subunits (pol II delta 4/7) was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain rpb-4, in which the gene for the fourth largest subunit is deleted. pol II delta 4/7 was indistinguishable from wild-type pol II (holoenzyme) in promoter-independent initiation/chain elongation activity (400-800 nmol of nucleotide incorporated/10 min/mg of protein at 22 degrees C), in rate of chain elongation (20-25 nucleotides/s), and in the recognition of pause sites in the DNA template. In contrast to pol II holoenzyme, pol II delta 4/7 was inactive in promoter-directed initiation of transcription in vitro. The addition of an equimolar complex of the fourth and seventh largest subunits, purified from pol II holoenzyme by ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of urea, restored promoter-directed initiation activity to pol II delta 4/7. The transcriptional activator protein Gal4-VP16 could also elicit promoter-directed initiation by pol II delta 4/7 from a promoter with a Gal4 binding site. Complementation was observed between extracts of strain rpb-4, lacking the fourth largest subunit, and strain Y260-1, with a defect in the largest subunit. These extracts were individually inactive, but a mixture would support promoter-directed initiation. The fourth and seventh largest subunits may, therefore, shuttle between polymerase molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1587508560,"Granzyme B has been purified to homogeneity from the granules of a human cytolytic lymphocyte line, Q31, in an enzymatically active form by a three-step procedure. Q31 granzyme B hydrolyzed Na-t-butyloxycarbonyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-aspartyl (Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp) thiobenzyl ester with a kcat of 11 +/- 5 mol/s/mol enzyme and catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of 76,000 +/- 44,000 M-1 s-1. The hydrolysis of Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp thiobenzyl ester by crude Q31 Percoll fractions paralleled the tryptase activity for granule-containing fractions, which showed that granzyme B was associated with granules. When chromatographed on Sephacryl S-300, Q31 granzyme B eluted in two broad bands corresponding to dimer and monomer, both of which electrophoresed at 35 kDa in reducing NaDodSo4 polyacrylamide, and both of which showed a lag phase in assays. The lag phase in assays could be extended with 0.03 mM pepstatin. Upon elution from ion-exchange chromatography Q31 granzyme B electrophoresed at 32 kDa in reducing NaDodSO4 polyacrylamide and did not have a lag phase in assays. The amino-terminal sequence of the 32-kDa Q31 granzyme B was identical to four other human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte granzymes B in 18 of 18 positions sequenced. Purified Q31 granzyme B had a preference for substrates with Glu or Asp as the residue amino-terminal to the scissile bond; little or no activity was noted with oligopeptide substrates for trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and elastase-like proteases. Human plasma alpha 1-protease inhibitor, human plasma alpha 2-protease macroglobulin, soybean and lima-bean trypsin inhibitors, bovine aprotinin, phosphoramidon, and chymostatin inhibited Q31 granzyme B. The inhibition by alpha 1-protease inhibitor was rapid enough to be of physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1522117207,"The conversion of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroids by the enzyme complex 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4 isomerase (3 beta-HSD) is an essential step in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. We report the characterization of two types of cDNA clones encoding rat 3 beta-HSD isolated from a rat ovary lambda gt11 cDNA library with a human 3 beta-HSD cDNA probe. Both type I and type II cDNAs encode proteins of 372 amino acids having 94% homology. Transient expression of the type I and the type II 3 beta-HSD cDNAs in HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells reveals that both proteins possess 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as well as delta 5-delta 4 isomerase activities for both delta 5-pregnene and delta 5-androstene precursors, although the type I 3 beta-HSD protein is more active than the type II. RNA blot analysis using type I 3 beta-HSD cDNA identifies major mRNA transcripts of 1.7 kilobase in rat ovary, testis, and adrenal poly(A)+ RNA. RNase protection assay using type I- and type II-specific cRNA probes revealed the existence of the two corresponding mRNAs in male and female rat adrenals and gonads as well as in female adipose tissue while only type I mRNA is present in male and female kidney. Moreover, in situ hybridization performed using type-specific labeled 24-mer oligonucleotides confirms that type I is the major mRNA species in the ovary and further indicates that both mRNA species have a similar cellular distribution in the ovarian tissue with the highest level of expression found in corpora lutea. Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against purified human placental 3 beta-HSD identified a single 42-kDa band in rat ovary, testis, and adrenal, which agrees with the calculated molecular masses of 41,911 and 42,150 daltons for the type I and II proteins, respectively. Determination of 3 beta-HSD enzymatic activity using [14C]pregnenolone and [14C]dehydroepiandrosterone as substrates shows that 3 beta-HSD activity is present not only in the gonads and adrenals of animals of both sexes, but also in many peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, mammary gland, kidney, liver, prostate, seminal vesicle, uterus, skin, brain, heart, thymus, pancreas, lung, and spleen. The present data indicate the existence of two mRNAs encoding rat 3 beta-HSD and their differential tissular distribution in both steroidogenic and peripheral tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1554288134,"Protein G was solubilized from 31 human group C and G streptococcal strains with the muralytic enzyme mutanolysin. As judged by the mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the binding patterns of the solubilized protein G molecules in Western blot experiments, the strains could be divided into three groups, represented by the group G streptococcal strains G148 and G43 and the group C streptococcal strain C40. The 65-kDa G148 protein G and the 58-kDa C40 protein G showed affinity for both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and human serum albumin (HSA), whereas the 40-kDa G43 protein G bound only IgG. Despite the different molecular patterns, the three protein G species had identical NH2-terminal amino acid sequences. Apart from the 65-kDa peptide, digestion of G148 streptococci with mutanolysin also produced a 52-kDa IgG- and HSA-binding peptide and a 14-kDa HSA-binding peptide. It was demonstrated that these peptides resulted from cleavage of 65-kDa protein G by proteolytic components in the mutanolysin preparation. The protein G genes of the C40 and G43 strains were cloned and sequenced, and their structure was compared to the previously published sequence of the G148 protein G gene. As compared to G148, both the C40 and G43 genes lacked a 210-base pair fragment in the IgG-binding region, accounting for the 10-fold lower affinity of these proteins for IgG. The G43 gene also lacked a 450-base pair fragment in the 5'-end of the gene, explaining why the G43 protein G did not bind HSA. The differences in protein G structure did not correlate with the clinical origin of the strains used in this study. The IgG-binding region of protein G was further mapped. Thus, a peptide corresponding to a single IgG-binding unit was obtained by the cloning and expression of a 303-base pair polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragment. The affinity of this 11.5-kDa peptide for human IgG was 8.0 x 10(7) M-1, as determined by Scatchard plots. Finally, a 55-amino acid-long synthetic peptide, corresponding to one of the three repeated domains in the COOH-terminal half of strain G148 protein G, effectively blocked binding of protein G to IgG."
https://openalex.org/W1581798949,"To study the regulation of insulin gene expression by physiological regulators, primary cultures of rat islet cells were transfected with portions of the rat insulin I gene 5'-flanking sequence linked to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Incubation of the cells in increasing glucose concentrations led to a parallel increase in both CAT activity and CAT mRNA levels. Pretreatment of the cells with the beta-cell-specific toxin streptozotocin reduced CAT activity 97%. Beta-Cell-specific expression of CAT was also demonstrated by co-staining the transfected cells with antisera to both CAT and insulin. Experiments showing a reduction in the response to glucose in the presence of the calcium channel blocker verapamil suggest that calcium plays a role in the glucose response, possibly via regulation of factors interacting with this limited portion of the insulin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2082762927,"In a neural cell line, the secretion of excitatory amino acids in response to a depolarizing stimulus is potentiated by the addition of serotonin. The duration of this potentiation is dependent on the strength of the stimulus. Persistent secretory potentiation induced by a strong stimulus requires the activation of both serotonin and NMDA receptors. Inhibiting the NMDA receptor during serotonin presentation prevented the induction of potentiation. The temporal characteristic of the potentiation is correlated with the elevation of cAMP levels. Serotonin exposure while inhibiting NMDA receptors results in a transient elevation of cAMP levels, whereas coactivation with NMDA and serotonin results in a persistent elevation of cAMP. Thus, it is possible to obtain potentiation of secretion in a single cell either transiently or persistently. The timing of potentiated responses in this system is of the same magnitude as that in similar systems used as models for short-term and long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2075233656,"As visualized by in situ hybridization with fluorescence detection, newly amplified CAD genes in 105 cell colonies are contained in multiple copies of very large regions of DNA, each tens of megabases long. The extra DNA is usually linked to the short arm of chromosome B9, which retains CAD at its normal site. The widely spaced genes are often interspersed with new G-negative regions. Individual cells within a clone have highly variable numbers of CAD genes (range 2–15). When resistant clones are examined later, at the 1015 cell stage, the amplified genes are usually found in much more condensed structures. We propose that, in the initial event of CAD gene amplification, much of the short arm is transferred from one B9 chromosome to another. In subsequent cell cycles this initial duplication expands rapidly through unequal but homologous sister chromatid exchanges. Relatively rare secondary events lead to more condensed structures."

https://openalex.org/W1555469750,"Three forms of the dimeric manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) were isolated from aerobically grown Escherichia coli which contained 2 Mn, 1 Mn and 1 Fe, or 2 Fe, respectively. These are designated Mn2-MnSOD, Mn,Fe-MnSOD, and Fe2-MnSOD. Substitution of iron in place of manganese, eliminated catalytic activity, decreased the isoelectric point, and increased the native electrophoretic anodic mobility, although circular dichroism, high performance liquid chromatography gel exclusion chromatography, and sedimentation equilibrium revealed no gross changes in conformation. Moreover, replacement of iron by manganese restored enzymatic activity. Fe2-MnSOD and the iron-superoxide (FeSOD) of E. coli exhibit distinct optical absorption spectra. These data indicate that the active site environments of E. coli MnSOD and FeSOD must differ. They also indicate that competition between iron and manganese for nascent MnSOD polypeptide chains occurs in vivo, and copurification of these variably substituted MnSODs can explain the substoichiometric manganese contents and the variable specific activities which have been reported for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1555993133,"Erythropoietin is a prime regulator of the growth and terminal differentiation of erythroid blood cells. However, little is understood concerning its molecular mechanism of action. Presently it is shown in the responsive, factor-dependent murine cell line B6SUt.EP that erythropoietin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of six plasma membrane-associated proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion (i.e. phosphoproteins PY153, PY140, PY100, PY93, PY74, and PY54). Among these, PY153 was prominent. For all proteins, maximal levels of phosphorylation were induced within 3-7 min at low factor concentrations (100-500 pM). These findings establish tyrosine kinase activation as a novel candidate pathway of erythropoietin-induced proliferation. In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation of six proteins with identical Mr, as well as a Mr 104,000 protein, was induced in B6SUt.EP cells by interleukin 3. In contrast, no induced tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable in the erythropoietin-responsive, leukemic erythroid cell line. Rauscher Red 1, yet proteins of Mr 153,000 and 54,000 were shown to be phosphorylated constitutively at relative levels greater than those observed in B6SUt.EP cells. A possible role for these phosphoproteins in hematopoietic cell transformation is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1537302992,"In this study, we examined the effects of T cell activators on the regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes present in thymocytes. Using affinity-purified anti-PKC antisera, we determined that the major PKC isoforms in murine thymocytes are PKC beta and PKC epsilon. The CD4+/CD8+ thymocyte subset expressed high levels of both PKC beta and PKC epsilon, whereas the CD4-/CD8- subset expressed much less of both. PKC beta was down-regulated following treatment of thymocytes with phorbol 12-myristate acetate (PMA) (2 x 10(-8) M) or ionomycin (0.4 microM). In contrast, PMA did not induce the down-regulation of PKC epsilon. Ionomycin alone, however, induced PKC epsilon down-regulation, similar to its effect on PKC beta. Similar observations were made on a promonocytic cell line, U937, which expresses PKC alpha, PKC beta (Strulovici, B., Daniel-Issakani, S., Oto, E., Nestor, J., Jr., Chan, H., and Tsou, A.-P. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3569-3576), and PKC epsilon. To facilitate the study of PKC beta and PKC epsilon, we established a Chinese hamster ovary cell line which expresses murine PKC epsilon in addition to endogenous PKC alpha and PKC beta. Both PKC isoforms (beta and epsilon) were mostly in particulate form. PMA treatment left the majority of immunoreactive PKC epsilon intact. By contrast, thrombin treatment caused the disappearance of particulate and cytosolic PKC epsilon (60% by 10 min and 80% by 1 h). PMA and thrombin promoted the down-regulation of PKC beta with similar kinetics (100% down-regulation by 3 h). These results indicate that: 1) thymocytes express PKC epsilon; and 2) this isozyme exhibits a novel form of regulation distinct from the other PKC isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1546500344,"The rat calbindin (molecular mass 9 kDa) gene sequence revealed the presence of an imperfect palindromic estrogen-responsive-like element (ERE) located at position +51 from the transcriptional initiation site. This element has the sequence AGGTCAGGGTGATCT which differs by one nucleotide from the vitellogenin ERE palindromic sequence AGGTCACTGTGACCT. The activity of this element to induce transcription in response to estrogen and the ability to bind estrogen receptor was investigated. This sequence confers estrogen-dependent transcriptional activity when cloned upstream from the tkp-CAT construct in pBLCAT2 plasmid and transfected into T47D cells, similar to the vitellogenin gene ERE activity but to a lesser extent. This element binds to the estrogen receptor in vitro as assessed by gel retardation assay similar to the vitellogenin gene ERE. No such binding was detected when a mutant sequence AGATCACTGTGATCT was used. The specificity of the complex was confirmed using polyclonal antibodies, ER712 raised against the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, competition assays showed that both sequences were able to compete for binding to the estrogen receptor. The in vivo transcriptional regulation of the calbindin D-9K gene by estrogen was also investigated in the rat. Female animals maintained on a vitamin D-sufficient or a vitamin D-deficient diet were ovariectomized, housed for 3 weeks, and then injected with 17 beta-estradiol (0.5 micrograms/kg body weight/day). Slot blot analysis of total RNA showed a marked increased in calbindin D-9K mRNA levels in the uterus but not in the intestine by 26 and 50 h post-injection. These results demonstrate that the calbindin D-9K gene is transcriptionally regulated by estrogen in the uterus mediated by an estrogen-responsive element identified in the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1544617408,"We have analyzed the proximal promoter of the Drosophila Kruppel (Kr) gene. A 44-base pair fragment containing the RNA start sites contains significant promoter activity, and this minimal promoter is flanked both upstream and downstream by binding sites for the GAGA factor. The GAGA factor is the predominant sequence-specific DNA binding factor that interacts with the Kr promoter region, and the purified protein activates Kr transcription in vitro. However, strong transcriptional activation of Kr as well as of Ultrabithorax, another GAGA factor-responsive gene, requires the presence of a DNA binding transcriptional repressor. The GAGA factor is able to relieve this repression in a binding site-dependent manner, and, thus, these data suggest that the GAGA factor functions as an antirepressor, rather than an activator, of the Kr gene."
https://openalex.org/W1494060254,"The structure and expression of rat sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) were studied by cloning and sequencing SCP2 cDNAs and by hybridizing the SCP2 cDNA to RNA from a variety of rat tissues. Initial screening of a rat liver cDNA library with an oligonucleotide probe derived from the rat SCP2 protein sequence revealed an 825-base pair cDNA clone coding for the complete SCP2 protein sequence. Our results suggest that rat liver SCP2 is 143 amino acid residues long, including a 20-amino acid residue prepeptide (pre-SCP2). Using the rat SCP2 cDNA as a probe for Northern blot hybridization analyses under high stringency conditions with rat liver poly(A) RNA, four mRNA species differing in their sizes and levels of expression are detected. The lengths of the corresponding mRNAs are 0.8, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.7 kilobases (kb), respectively. In all other tissues analyzed mRNAs hybridizing to the SCP2 cDNA probe were detected in levels much lower than in the liver. In these tissues the vast majority of the expressed SCP2 mRNAs consists of the 0.8-kb mRNA. Results from Southern blotting hybridization analyses with rat genomic DNA suggest that the four different mRNA species are products of a single gene. Extensive screening of rat liver cDNA libraries using rat liver SCP2 cDNA probes led to the isolation of 10 additional clones, all of them containing cDNA insertions longer than 0.8 kb. Restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing analyses of these cDNAs indicate that eight extend upstream of the SCP2 cDNA, and two extend 5' as well as 3'. Translation of the sequence extending most upstream suggests that this cDNA is a nearly full-length cDNA coding for a protein of 547 amino acids (SCP chi). SCP chi contains a 404-amino acid amino-terminal extension as compared with pre-SCP2 whereas its carboxyl-terminal part is identical with pre-SCP2. Sequencing of the 3' extension cDNAs suggests that polyadenylation had occurred 651 nucleotides downstream as compared with the remaining cDNAs. A probe from this region hybridizes to the 1.4- and 2.7-kb mRNAs. From our data we conclude that the 1.4- and 2.7-kb mRNA species are generated by alternative polyadenylation of the 0.8- and 2.1-kb mRNAs, respectively. In contrast, the 2.1- and 2.7-kb mRNAs contain an approximately 1300-nucleotide extension upstream of the 0.8- and 1.4-kb mRNAs, suggesting differential splicing of the primary SCP2 gene transcript leading to expression of pre-SCP2 and SCP chi from a single gene."
https://openalex.org/W1530436398,"A kinetic study of the reaction between vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid, AsH2) and a tocopheroxyl radical (7-tert-butyl-5-isopropyltocopheroxyl) in Triton X-100 micellar solution has been performed using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The second-order rate constants (k2) obtained showed notable pH dependence with a broad maximum around pH 8. For instance, the k2 values obtained were 26 M-1 S-1 at pH 3, 322 M-1 S-1 at pH 7, and 273 M-1 S-1 at pH 10. A good correlation between the rate constants and the mole fraction of ascorbate monoanion (AsH-) was observed, showing that ascorbate (AsH-) can regenerate the tocopherol from tocopheroxyl in biological systems. Furthermore, the results indicate that reduced ascorbic acid (AsH2) does not have the ability to regenerate the tocopherol in aqueous solution. On the other hand, it was found that AsH2 can reduce the tocopheroxyl to tocopherol in benzene/ethanol (2:1) mixtures, although the rate of reaction is only approximately 15% of that observed in micellar solution at pH 7."

https://openalex.org/W2040788453,"The sympathetic innervation of rat sweat glands undergoes a target-induced switch from a noradrenergic to a cholinergic and peptidergic phenotype during development. Treatment of cultured sympathetic neurons with sweat gland extracts mimics many of the changes seen in vivo. Extracts induce choline acetyltransferase activity and vasoactive intestinal peptide expression in the neurons in a dose-dependent fashion while reducing catecholaminergic properties and neuropeptide Y. The cholinergic differentiation activity appears in developing glands of postnatal day 5 rats and is maintained in adult glands. It is a heat-labile, trypsin-sensitive, acidic protein that does not bind to heparin-agarose. Immunoprecipitation experiments with an antiserum directed against an N-terminal peptide of a cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF/LIF) from heart cells suggest that the sweat gland differentiation factor is not CDF/LIF. The sweat gland activity is a likely candidate for mediating the target-directed change in sympathetic neurotransmitter function observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2094657897,"The v-erbA oncogene is a retrovirus-transduced and altered copy of a cellular gene for a thyroid hormone receptor. In animal cells, the v-erbA protein fails to respond to hormone and acts as a dominant negative allele, inhibiting gene activation normally conferred by the wild-type thyroid hormone receptor. We report here that, unexpectedly, the v-erbA protein acts as a hormone-regulated transcriptional activator in S. cerevisiae. We suggest that the ability of v-erbA protein to function as a transcriptional repressor or an activator is determined by interaction with, or modification by, other cellular factors, and that this phenomenon may be relevant to understanding ligand regulation of the normal thyroid and steroid hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1561537921,"Phospholipase A2 inhibitor (PLI), purified from the blood plasma of the Habu snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis), was separated into two distinct subunits, PLI-A and PLI-B. These subunits were shown to be glycoproteins with molecular weights of around 21,000-22,000. When they were deglycosylated chemically with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, the molecular weights were found to be 17,000. Their amino acid sequences were determined by alignment of peptides obtained by lysyl endopeptidase digestion and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion. PLI-A and PLI-B were each composed of 147 amino acid residues with one residue, Asn103, being for N-linked glycosylation, and the molecular weights of their protein portions were calculated to be 16,368 and 16,408, respectively. Each subunit contained four cysteine residues, all of which exist in disulfide linkages (Cys64-Cys141 and Cys119-Cys133). The sequences of PLI-A and PLI-B showed 89.9% homology to each other. When the sequences were compared with those of lipocortins, no significant homologies were detected. But the sequences were significantly homologous to those of COOH-terminal carbohydrate recognition portions of pulmonary surfactant apoprotein and animal lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1545280185,"Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11, NEP) is a Zn-metallopeptidase involved in the degradation of biologically active peptides, notably the enkephalins and atrial natriuretic peptide. Recently, the structure of the active site of this enzyme has been probed by site-directed mutagenesis, and 4 amino acid residues have been identified, namely 2 histidines (His583 and His587), which act as zinc-binding ligands, a glutamate (Glu584) involved in catalysis, and an arginine residue (Arg102), suggested to participate in substrate binding. Site-directed mutagenesis has now been used to investigate the role of 4 other arginine residues (Arg408, Arg409, Arg659, and Arg747) that have been proposed as possible active site residues and to further analyze the role of Arg102. In each case, the arginine was replaced with a methionine, and both enzymatic activity and the IC50 values of several NEP inhibitors were measured for the mutated enzymes and compared to wild-type enzyme. The results suggest that 2 arginines, Arg102 and Arg747, could both be important for substrate and inhibitor binding. Arg747 seems to be positioned to interact with the carbonyl amide group of the P'1 residue and can be modified when the enzyme is treated with the arginine-specific reagents phenylglyoxal and butanedione. Arg102 could be positioned to interact with the free carboxyl group of a P'2 residue in some substrates and inhibitors and can be modified by phenylglyoxal but not by butanedione. The results could explain the dual dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase and endopeptidase nature of NEP."
https://openalex.org/W1540971904,"The potential of lipid monolayers spread at an air-water interface was investigated as a well defined membrane model able to support protein kinase C (PKC) association and activation. PKC association to a mixed phospholipid film (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine) could be detected by an increase of the monolayer surface pressure. This association was strikingly dependent upon the presence of submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+. The effect of Ca2+ resulted in an increase of the PKC penetration into the lipid core at a given permissive surface pressure as well as in a marked increase of the critical surface pressure (29-38 dynes/cm) above which the enzyme was excluded from the membrane. Inclusion of diacylglycerol or tetradecanoate phorbol acetate (TPA) did not modify the PKC-monolayer association in a detectable manner. PKC associated to the lipid layer exhibited the expected catalytic property and was fully activated when diacylglycerol or TPA was included in the membrane. PKC activity was highly dependent upon the surface pressure of the lipid monolayer, being optimal between 30 and 35 dynes/cm. Study of the compression isotherm of various diacylglycerol structures revealed that all potent PKC agonists exhibited an expanded liquid phase behavior with collapse pressure below 40 dynes/cm, in contrast to weak activators which showed condensed isotherms with high collapse pressure (approximately equal to 60 dynes/cm). These observations showed that the lipid monolayer system is well adapted to the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PKC activity at a model membrane interface. They are in line with the suggestion of a major role of Ca2+ in the association (translocation) of PKC to membrane in living cell and suggest that diacylglycerol (and TPA) might activate membrane-associated PKC through local change in the surrounding lipid phase organization."
https://openalex.org/W1551578308,"By chemically modifying carboxyl groups we have investigated the role of the highly acidic COOH-terminal domains of alpha- and beta-tubulin in regulating microtubule assembly. Using a carbodiimide-promoted amidation reaction, as many as 25 carboxyl groups were modified by the addition of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and an amine nucleophile, [14C] glycine ethyl ester or [3H]methylamine, to assembled microtubules. Modification occurred primarily in the carboxyl-terminal region as demonstrated by limited proteolysis of modified tubulin by trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase Y. Modified tubulin polymerized into microtubules with a critical concentration that was 15% of that for unmodified tubulin. Assembly of modified tubulin and microtubules formed from modified tubulin were less sensitive to Ca2+ and high ionic strength. Ca2+ binding studies under low ionic strength conditions indicated that modified tubulin does not contain the high affinity Ca2+ binding site. While assembly of unmodified tubulin was stimulated by Mg2+ up to 10 mM, assembly of the modified protein was inhibited by concentrations greater than 1 mM. When 24 residues were modified, polymerization was no longer stimulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) or polylysine and incorporation of high molecular weight MAPs into the polymers was reduced by about 70% compared to unmodified tubulin. These studies demonstrate that chemical modification of carboxyl groups in tubulin, most of which are localized in the COOH-terminal region, leads to an enhanced ability to polymerize and a decrease in interaction with MAPs and other positively charged species."
https://openalex.org/W1508801046,"The properties of the Na-Ca exchanger in the plasma membrane of rod outer segments isolated from bovine retinas (ROS) were studied. Unidirectional Ca2+, Na+, and K+ fluxes were measured with radioisotopes and atomic absorption spectroscopy. We measured K+ fluxes associated with the Ca-Ca self-exchange mode of the Na-Ca exchanger to corroborate our previous conclusion that the ROS Na-Ca exchanger differs from Na-Ca exchangers in other tissues by its ability to transport K+ (Schnetkamp, P. P. M., Basu, D. K. & Szerencsei, R. T. (1989) Am. J. Physiol. 257, C153-C157). The Na-Ca-K exchanger was the only functional cation transporter in the plasma membrane of bovine ROS with an upper limit of a flux of 10(5) cations/ROS/s or a current of 0.01 pA contributed by other cation channels, pumps, or carriers; cation fluxes via the Na-Ca-K exchanger amounted to 5 x 10(6) cations/ROS/s or a current of 1 pA. Ca2+ efflux via the forward mode of the Na-Ca-K exchanger did not operate with a fixed single stoichiometry. 1) The Na/Ca coupling ratio was increased from three to four when ionophores were added that could provide electrical compensation for the inward Na-Ca exchange current. 2) The K/Ca coupling ratio could vary by at least 2-fold as a function of the external Na+ and K+ concentration. The results are interpreted in terms of a model that can account for the variable Ca/K coupling ratio: we conclude that the Ca2+ site of the exchanger can translocate independent of translocation of the K+ site, whereas translocation of the K+ site requires occupation of the Ca2+ site, but not its translocation. The results are discussed with respect to the physiological role of Na-Ca-K exchange in rod photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1523981564,"The formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid, the first committed precursor of chlorophyll biosynthesis, occurs in the chloroplast of plants and algae by the C5-pathway, a three-step, tRNA-dependent transformation of glutamate. Previously, we reported the purification and characterization of the first two enzymes of this pathway, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase and Glu-tRNA reductase from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chen, M.-W., Jahn, D., Schon, A., O'Neill, G. P., and Soll, D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4054-4057 and Chen, M.-W., Jahn, D., O'Neill, G. P., and Soll, D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4058-4063). Here we present the purification of the third enzyme of the pathway, the glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase from C. reinhardtii. The enzyme was purified from the membrane fraction of a whole cell extract employing four different chromatographic separations. The apparent molecular mass of the protein was approximately 43,000 Da as analyzed by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by nondenaturing rate zonal sedimentation on glycerol gradients, and by gel filtration. By these criteria, the enzyme in its active form is a monomer of 43,000 Da. In the presence of pyridoxal 5‘-phosphate, purified glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase converts synthetic glutamate 1-semialdehyde to delta-aminolevulinic acid. The enzyme is inhibited by gabaculine and aminooxyacetate, both typical inhibitors of aminotransferases. The purified glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase successfully reconstitutes the whole C5-pathway in vitro from glutamate in the presence of purified glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, Mg2+, ATP, NADPH, tRNA, and pyridoxal 5‘-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1527293772,"Two recent studies reported that Na-Ca exchange in the outer segments of tiger salamander rod photoreceptors (Cervetto, L., Lagnado, L., Perry, R. J., Robinson, D. W., and McNaughton, P. A. (1989) Nature 337, 740-743) and of bovine rod photoreceptors (Schnetkamp, P. P. M., Basu, D. K., and Szerencsei, R. T. (1989) Am. J. Physiol. 257, C153-157) requires and transports K+ in a 4Na/(1Ca+1K) stoichiometry. In this study, we have examined the effects of K+ ions and membrane potential on the kinetics of Na-Ca and Ca-Ca exchange in rod outer segments isolated from bovine retinas. The objective was to establish the ion selectivity and voltage dependence of the different cation binding sites on the Na-Ca-K exchange protein. Potassium ions activated Na-Ca exchange when present on the Ca2+ side, although the extent of activation decreased with decreasing Na+ concentration. Potassium ions inhibited Na-Ca exchange when present on the Na+ side; inhibition arose from competition between Na+ and K+ for a common single cation-binding site. Activation of Na-Ca exchange by K+ displayed a different ion selectivity than that observed for inhibition of Na-Ca exchange by K+. The results are interpreted in terms of a three-site model for the rod Na-Ca-K exchanger. The rate of forward Na-Ca exchange decreased by 1.75-fold for a 60 mV depolarization of the plasma membrane but only at lower Na+ concentrations. The rate of Ca-Ca exchange was not affected by changes in membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1482188132,"The possible role of protein kinase C in the regulation of glucose transport in the rat adipose cell has been examined. Both insulin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulate 3-O-methylglucose transport in the intact cell ein association with the subcellular redistribution of glucose transporters from the low density microsomes to the plasma membranes, as assessed by cytochalasin B binding. In addition, the actions of insulin and PMA on glucose transport activity and glucose transporter redistribution are additive. Furthermore, PMA accelerates insulin's stimulation of glucose transport activity, reducing the t1/2 from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 min (mean +/- S.E.). However, the effect of PMA on glucose transport activity is approximately 10% of that for insulin whereas its effect on glucose transporter redistribution is approximately 50% of the insulin response. Immunoblots of the GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporter isoforms in subcellular membrane fractions also demonstrate that the translocations of GLUT1 in response to PMA and insulin are of similar magnitude whereas the translocation of GLUT4 in response to insulin is markedly greater than that in response to PMA. Thus, glucose transport activity in the intact cell with PMA and insulin correlates more closely with the appearance of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane than cytochalasin B-assayable glucose transporters. Although these data do not clarify the potential role of protein kinase C in the mechanism of insulin action, they do suggest that the mechanisms through which insulin and PMA stimulate glucose transport are distinct but interactive."
https://openalex.org/W1543186331,"Abstract The phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine hydroxylase was examined in PC12 cells following depolarization with KCl or treatment with nerve growth factor. Both treatments activate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and increase enzyme phosphorylation. Site-specific analysis of the tryptic phosphopeptides of TH isolated from [32P]phosphate-labeled PC12 cells demonstrated that the major phosphorylated peptide (termed H25) did not contain any of the previously reported phosphorylation sites. Phosphoamino acid analysis of this peptide demonstrated that the phosphorylated residue was a serine. Synthetic tryptic peptides containing putative phosphorylation sites were prepared, and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography analysis and isoelectric focusing. The tryptic phosphopeptide containing serine 31 comigrated with the H25 peptide during both of these analytical techniques. The tryptic phosphopeptide produced by the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase by the recently discovered proline-directed protein kinase and the phosphorylated synthetic phosphopeptide TH2-12 are clearly separated from H25 by this analysis. We conclude that serine 31 is phosphorylated during KCl depolarization and nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells and that this phosphorylation is responsible for the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Since this site is not located in a sequence selective for any of the classical protein kinases, we suggest that a novel protein kinase may be responsible for the phosphorylation of this site. Since serine 31 has a proline residue on the carboxyl-terminal side, the possibility that this kinase may be related to the recently reported proline-directed protein kinase is discussed. Other sites that are also phosphorylated on TH during KCl depolarization include serine 19, which is known to be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. A schematic model for the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by phosphorylation of the NH2-terminal regulatory domain is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1500870267,"We examined the expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos and the early growth response gene, Egr-1, in Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing high levels of normal or mutated human insulin receptors (McClain, D. A., Maegawa, H., Lee, J., Dull, T. J., Ullrich, A., and Olefsky, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14663-14671). In cells expressing large numbers of normal human insulin receptors (HIRc-B cells), insulin (greater than or equal to 0.7 nM) stimulated the rapid accumulation of mRNAs for both genes. This response was blunted, but not lost, in cells expressing large numbers of human insulin receptors missing 43 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the beta-subunit. In contrast, the insulin response was completely absent in cells expressing large numbers of receptors that contained a mutation at the ATP-binding site that destroyed intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity (A/K 1018-B cells). This mutation also suppressed the modest transcriptional response to insulin that occurred in the parental Rat 1 cells. The transcriptional response to serum was normal in the A/K 1018-B cells, even after protein kinase C depletion; however, the response to insulin-like growth factor I was essentially lost. These studies suggest that overexpression of a kinase-deficient insulin receptor can suppress the transcriptional response to both insulin and insulin-like growth factor I that is ordinarily transduced through endogenous insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptors, respectively. Competition for shared substrates of these related receptor kinases is a potential mechanism for this effect."
https://openalex.org/W1802363831,"Treatment of human endothelial cells with thrombin, histamine, or dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), a synthetic diacylglycerol, resulted in the rapid and transient phosphorylation of a Mr = 29,000 protein (P29) in a dose-dependent manner. Various tumor promoters also promoted P29 phosphorylation while the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, did not. The level of phosphorylation with all three agonists was similar (2.5-4 fold), and analysis of P29 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed identical patterns in each case. Receptor specificity was demonstrated for the histamine-stimulated changes; pyrilamine (10(-6) M; H1) but not cimetidine (10(-4); H2) blocked the response. The thrombin effect was active site-dependent. Phosphorylation induced by thrombin and histamine occurred within 1 min, peaked between 5 and 10 min, and returned to control levels by 1 h. DiC8-induced phosphorylation occurred more slowly but was also reduced by 1 h while phorbol ester treatment prolonged phosphorylation for at least 4 h. Treatment of these cells with thrombin or histamine for 1 h desensitized P29 to further phosphorylation by the homologous agonist although secondary phosphorylation could occur with heterologous compounds. However, if the primary agonist was removed following the onset of a desensitized state, secondary phosphorylation of P29 could be stimulated by the same compound. These same results were observed with two other phosphoproteins Mr = 18,000 (P18) and 80,000 (P80) which became more highly phosphorylated in response to thrombin treatment and with histamine/thrombin-stimulated prostaglandin I2 production. In contrast, homologous down-regulation of P29 phosphorylation was not observed with DiC8-treated cells, and the decline in phosphorylated P29 was associated with the loss of functional DiC8. The protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H-7 blocked P18 and P80 phosphorylation by thrombin but had no effect on P29 phosphorylation by histamine, thrombin, or DiC8 suggesting distinct pathways leading to the phosphorylation of these different proteins. These data suggest that multiple and independent thrombin/histamine-induced events are susceptible to receptor occupancy-dependent homologous down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1547444060,"Administration of highly purified preparations of murine interferon (IFN)-alpha 1, -alpha 4, -alpha 6, or -beta to Friend leukemia cells induced to differentiate by dimethyl sulfoxide leads to a 100% increase of benzidine-positive (B+) cells. Different efficiencies for the two IFN species have been observed; a 10-fold higher dose of IFN-alpha is needed for stimulation of hemoglobin production and inhibition of cell growth as compared with IFN-beta. Both species of IFN induce a substantial increase in heme, hemoglobin, and transferrin receptor levels. In vitro run-on transcription assays indicate that IFN-beta moderately stimulates transcription of the alpha-globin gene but not the transferrin receptor gene. It is postulated that IFN induces the enhancing effect on differentiation via a marked increase of heme synthesis and number of transferrin receptors, which in turn leads to an enhancement of globin chain synthesis. In this regard, the negative feedback reported in a variety of other cell types for the regulation of transferrin receptor expression by heme does not seem to be operative in maturing Friend erythroleukemia cells, which present evidence for a positive mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1505563920,"Proteoglycan (PG)-1000 (formerly TAP-1) is a large (Mr = 10(6)) highly glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan found associated with Schwann cell and electrocyte basement membranes in elasmobranch electric fish. Previously, purified PG-1000 was visualized in the electron microscope as a bottlebrush structure about 345 nm long with about 20 side projections of 113 nm. This molecule was characterized with material purified from electric organ under denaturing and reducing conditions. Here we report that PG-1000, when purified under denaturing conditions without exposure to a reducing agent, exists as a complex of several proteins. In addition to PG-1000, this complex consists of a somewhat smaller, heavily glycosylated protein (beta component) and three smaller proteins with Mr values of 39,000, 21,000, and 18,000. The complex remains intact when exposed to denaturing and non-reducing conditions but falls apart in denaturing and reducing conditions. Presumably the complex is stabilized by disulfide bonds. The beta component of the PG-1000 complex is probably a proteoglycan. However, unlike PG-1000, the beta component does not contain chondroitin sulfate chains and lacks the epitope, T1, that is found on PG-1000. Both molecules share a protease-insensitive antigenic site, SV4, which is probably a modified keratan sulfate epitope. Evidence for the identity of this antigen is that it is found as a minor subfraction in commercial preparations of shark cartilage chondroitin and corneal keratan sulfates but not in other glycosaminoglycan preparations. These SV4 antigens are resistant to chondroitin ABC lyase digestion. However, the SV4 antigen in commercial keratan sulfate is cleaved by keratinase to a smaller antigenic fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1560748970,"In single liver cells, the D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3)-dependent agonists such as noradrenaline and angiotensin II evoke oscillations in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i resulting mostly from the periodic release and reuptake of calcium from intracellular stores. In the present work, we have reexamined the effects of these agonists and investigated whether the natural bile acid taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (TLC-S), which permeabilizes the endoplasmic reticulum, could initiate oscillations of [Ca2+]i. Oscillations of [Ca2+]i were monitored with the Ca2(+)-dependent K+ permeability in whole-cell voltage-clamped guinea pig liver cells. Our results confirm the presence of two types of oscillations induced by hormones. They could be distinguished by their frequency periods. The fast (type I) had periods ranging from 5 to 12 s and the slow (type II) from 60 to 240 s. They have been respectively attributed to second messenger- and receptor-controlled oscillations, respectively. Our results also show that TLC-S, as noradrenaline and angiotensin II, induced the activation of this Ca(+)-dependent K+ current and was able to reproduce both types of oscillations. The bile acid effect was not blocked by intracellular perfusion of heparin known to inhibit both InsP3 binding and InsP3-evoked Ca2+ release in several tissues. In these conditions, TLC-S only evoked type I oscillations, suggesting that these fluctuations could originate from a mechanism that is independent of InsP3 and is an intrinsic property of internal Ca2+ stores."

https://openalex.org/W1496786122,"As is the case with many other peptide hormones of the brain and intestine, the formation of biologically active gastrin from a glycine-extended processing intermediate occurs via the action of a peptidylglycyl alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). The observation that gastrin exists primarily as unamidated precursors in the pituitary but as amidated gastrin in the antrum prompted this study to examine whether the amidating enzymes in the two organs were different in their characteristics. Amidating activity was quantified by measuring the conversion of glycine-extended tridecagastrin (G13-Gly) to amidated tridecagastrin and glycine-extended hexapancreatic polypeptide (PP6-Gly) to amidated hexapancreatic polypeptide by radio-immunoassay. Two molecular forms of amidating activity were identified in both the porcine antrum and pituitary. The first, PAM-A, had an apparent Mr of 51,000 and a net negative charge at pH 7.0, whereas PAM-B was smaller (Mr approximately 30,000) and had a net positive charge at pH 7.0. Both molecular forms were similar in their cofactor requirements (copper, ascorbic acid, and catalase) and pH optima in the antrum and pituitary. The Km was significantly lower and the Vmax higher for PP6-Gly than for G13-Gly in the pituitary and antrum. These data suggest that although there is no difference between antral and pituitary PAM, the selective affinity of PAM for certain substrates may provide a mechanism for the differential amidation of different hormones within a given tissue or cell."
https://openalex.org/W1504949606,"Pro-Val pseudo dipeptides incorporating protio and halo enol lactones were tested for inhibitory activity against the serine proteases human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, and urokinase. The protio enol lactones 1a-c were found to be HLE substrates but were poor alternate substrate inhibitors. The bromo enol lactone trans isomer 2a was found to be a very effective inhibitor of HLE and chymotrypsin, as shown by the binding constants (KI), acylation rates (ka), inactivation rates, and partition ratios determined for each enzyme. This inhibitor shows better specificity toward its target enzyme HLE than monosubstituted halo enol lactones; we attribute this to a pseudo dipeptide acyl enzyme whose structure is similar to that adopted by good peptide substrates of HLE. Inactivation of chymotrypsin by the bromo enol lactone 2a is permanent, but inactivation of HLE is partially recoverable upon treatment with the nucleophile hydrazine, indicating that lactone 2a produces two species of inactivated HLE. The more stable of these species could be the result of alkylation of His-57 by the electrophilic bromomethyl ketone revealed in the acyl enzyme, and the less stable, hydrazine-reactivatable species could be the result of alkylation of Asp-102 or the hydrolysis of the bromomethyl ketone group in the initially formed acyl enzyme to form a new, more stable acyl enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1526044338,"Abstract Each actin molecule has one high affinity site which binds a divalent cation. It has been proposed that an isomerization of the actin molecule is involved in divalent cation exchange at this site (isomerization Frieden, C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2882-2886); we have maintained that exchange is by a simple competitive mechanism (Estes, J. E., Selden, L. A., and Gershman, L. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4952-4957). Here, using fluorescent-labeled actin, we measure the apparent rate constant for exchange (kapp) as a function of the ratio of free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations, ([Ca]/[Mg]), and show that both models are consistent with the data. The major parameter controlling this relationship in the simple competitive exchange model, the ratio of the association rate constants for Ca2+ and Mg2+ to actin (kCa/kMg), is found to have a value of about 90. We have verified this parameter by direct measurements of kCa and kMg, finding that kCa = 1.9 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and kMg = 2.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, consistent with the characteristics of the Ca2+ and Mg2+ aquo ions. The corresponding parameter derived from the isomerization model is not verifiable. We conclude that high affinity divalent cation exchange on actin proceeds by a simple competitive mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1614030908,"Abstract The active site of chicken gizzard myosin was labeled by direct photoaffinity labeling with [3H]UDP. [3H] UDP was stably trapped at the active site by addition of vanadate (Vi) and Co2+. The extraordinary stability of the myosin.Co2+.[3H]UDP.Vi complex (t1/2 greater than 5 days at 0 degrees C) allowed it to be purified free of extraneous [3H]UDP before irradiation began. Upon UV irradiation, greater than 60% of the trapped [3H]UDP was photoincorporated into the active site. Only the 200-kDa heavy chain was labeled, confirming earlier results (Maruta, H., and Korn, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 499-502) using [3H]UTP. Extensive tryptic digestion of photolabeled myosin subfragment 1 followed by high performance liquid chromatography separations and removal of nucleotide phosphates by treatment with alkaline phosphatase allowed two labeled peptides to be isolated. Sequencing of the labeled peptides and radioactive counting showed that Glu185 was the residue labeled. Since UDP is a zero-length cross-linker, Glu185 is located at the purine-binding pocket of the active site of smooth myosin and adjacent to the glycine-rich loop which binds the polyphosphate portion of ATP. This Glu residue is conserved in smooth and nonmuscle myosins and is the same residue identified previously by [3H]UTP photolabeling in Acanthamoeba myosin II (Atkinson, M. A., Robinson, E. A., Appella, E., and Korn, E. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1844-1848)."
https://openalex.org/W1515348434,"The synthetic peptide AKRRRLSSLRASTSKSESSQK (S6-21) which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids of human ribosomal protein S6 was synthesized and tested as a substrate for S6/H4 kinase purified from human placenta. The specific activity of the enzyme with the synthetic peptide and 40 S ribosomes was 45 and 23 nmol/min/mg, respectively. The S6/H4 kinase activity with S6-21 was greater than the enzyme activity with any other substrate tested, including histones, protamine, and casein and several other synthetic peptides. The phosphorylation of the peptide was not inhibited by inhibitors of several other proteins kinases. S6/H4 kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of three major sites in the synthetic peptide and the 40 S ribosomes. A fourth site in S6-21 was phosphorylated more slowly. The principal phosphorylation sites were serines in the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of the peptide. A serine (Ser-7 or -8) in the amino-terminal domain was phosphorylated at approximately 25% the rate of the carboxyl-terminal domain serines. The data suggest that multiple S6 kinases may be required to phosphorylate S6 at all five sites which are modified in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1625898144,"Operation of the phosphoglycerate transport protein (PgtP) of Salmonella typhimurium has been studied in proteoliposomes by using a technique in which membrane protein is solubilized and reconstituted directly from small volumes of cell cultures. When protein from induced cells was reconstituted into phosphate (Pi)-loaded proteoliposomes, it was possible to demonstrate a PgtP-mediated exchange of internal and external phosphate. For this homologous Pi:Pi antiport, kinetic analysis indicated a Michaelis constant (Kt) of 1 mM and a maximal velocity of 26 nmol/min mg of protein; arsenate inhibited with a Ki of 1.3 mM, suggesting that PgtP did not discriminate between these two inorganic substrates. Pi-loaded proteoliposomes also accumulated 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, establishing for each of them a concentration gradient (in/out) of about 100-fold; phosphoenolpyruvate (Ki = 70 microM) rather than 3-phosphoglycerate (Kt = 700, Ki = 900 microM) was the preferred substrate for these conditions. We also concluded that such heterologous exchange was a neutral event, since its rate and extent were unaffected by the presence of a protonophore and unresponsive to the imposition of a membrane potential (positive or negative inside). In quantitative work, we found a stoichiometry of 1:1 for the exchange of Pi and 3-phosphoglycerate, and given an electroneutral exchange, this finding is most easily understood as the overall exchange of divalent Pi against divalent phosphoglycerate. These experiments establish that PgtP functions as an anion exchange protein and that it shares important mechanistic features with the Pi-linked antiporters, GlpT and UhpT, responsible for transport of glycerol 3-phosphate and hexose 6-phosphates into Escherichia coli."
