https://openalex.org/W2117506145,"The contribution of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in mediating plasticity of cortical sensorimotor representations was examined in the context of normal learning. The effects of specific basal forebrain cholinergic lesions upon cortical reorganization associated with learning a skilled motor task were investigated, addressing, for the first time, the functional consequences of blocking cortical map plasticity. Results demonstrate that disrupting basal forebrain cholinergic function disrupts cortical map reorganization and impairs motor learning. Cholinergic lesions do not impair associative fear learning or overall sensorimotor function. These results support the hypothesis that the basal forebrain cholinergic system may be specifically implicated in forms of learning requiring plasticity of cortical representations."

This inactivation is strikingly decreased in cell-free patches. In whole cell and cell-free configuration, currents through TRPM4 deactivate rapidly at negative potentials. At positive potentials, currents are much larger and activate slowly. This voltage-dependent behavior induces a striking outward rectification of the steady state currents. The instantaneous current-voltage relationship, derived from the amplitude of tail currents following a prepulse to positive potentials, is linear. Currents show a Boltzmann type of activation; the fraction of open channels increases at positive potentials and is low at negative potentials. Voltage dependence is not due to block by divalent cations or to voltage-dependent binding of intracellular Ca2+ to an activator site, indicating that TRPM4 is a transient receptor potential channel with an intrinsic voltage-sensing mechanism. Voltage dependence of TRPM4 may be functionally important, especially in excitable tissues generating plateau-like or bursting action potentials.

More than 20 mammalian TRP members are known, which are classified into the TRPC (C for “canonical”), TRPV (V for “vanilloid”), and TRPM (M for “melastatin”) subfamilies (1Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu S. Zhu M.X. Mol.

However, the functional properties of most members of this novel and fast growing channel family are not yet analyzed in detail. The predicted transmembrane topology of TRPs is similar to that of voltage-gated and cyclic nucleotide gated channels; they consist of six transmembrane-spanning helices (TM1 to -6), cytoplasmic N and C termini, and a pore region between TM5 and TM6 (2Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 3Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Since the fourth transmembrane helix is not positively charged, TRP channels were considered as voltage-independent. The voltage-sensing features of some members of the TRPV subfamily could be attributed to voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by intra- or extracellular divalent cations (4Voets T.

Members of the TRPM subfamily are much less studied at the functional level than those of the TRPV and TRPC family. They are characterized by relatively long N and C termini, and some of them have entire enzyme domains linked to their C termini: an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase in TRPM2 (6Perraud A.L. Fleig A.

Surprisingly, TRPM4b, which is a Ca2+-impermeable monovalent cation channel of 25-picosiemens unitary conductance belonging to the TRPM subfamily, is in contrast to other TRP channels not inactivated but activated by intracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). A short form of TRPM4, TRPM4a, is characterized in less detail and displays completely different properties with regard to Ca2+ permeability and activation (13Xu X.Z. Moebius F. Gill D.L. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10692-10697Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this study, we report cloning of the human and mouse TRPM4 cDNAs. Transcripts of these genes are expressed in heart, kidney, and endothelial cells, indicating that this channel plays a role in the cardiovascular system. We demonstrate that TRPM4 is a Ca2+- and voltage-dependent channel. It could therefore modulate the electrical activity of cells that generate action potentials. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of voltage-dependent properties of a TRP channel, suggesting a special role for this channel in excitable cells. Cloning of Human and Mouse TRPM4 cDNAs—The human expressed sequence tag 885075 (GenBank™), homologous to the human TRPM1 cDNA, was identified and sequenced on both strands; it contained a ∼1500-bp DNA fragment, which represented part of the TRPM4 cDNA. Northern and dot blot analysis using this DNA fragment as a probe revealed TRPM4 transcript expression in a number of tissues including human prostate. TRPM4 full-length cDNA clones were isolated from four independent oligo(dT)-primed and specifically primed cDNA libraries constructed with poly(A+) RNA isolated from tissue samples taken from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Several cDNA clones (Fig. 1A) were identified and sequenced on both strands. The cDNAs obtained encoded two variants of the TRPM4 protein, a long variant of 1214 amino acids (calculated M r ∼134,000; GenBank™ accession number AX443227), identical to the TRPM4b sequence described by Launay et al. (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and the shorter variant TRPM4c but not the TRPM4a variant (13Xu X.Z. Moebius F. Gill D.L. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10692-10697Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The TRPM4c cDNA (accession number: AX443225) encodes 678 amino acid residues starting at Met537 of the TRPM4b variant. The TRPM4b cDNA was subcloned into the dicistronic pdi vector (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To identify the mouse TRPM4, we searched the mouse genome ENSEMBL data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ensembl.org) with the human sequence using the tblastN program. Two novel Ensembl genes of 5.27 and 9.06 kb (ENSMUSG00000038260 and ENSMUSG00000003866) were predicted. Analysis of these predicted gene loci and the surrounding genomic sequence by comparison of these genomic sequences with the human cDNA lead to the identification of exons corresponding to the exons in the human TRPM4 gene including the initiation and termination signals of translation. Primers M4_41 (5′-CTA GTC TAG AGG TGA GGA TAA GGC CAC CAG-3′) and M4_45 (5′-TGC TCT AGA GGC TGG AGG AAA TAC ACG G-3′) were derived from these exon sequences of the mouse TRPM4 gene (exon 1 and exon 25, respectively), which correspond to sequences in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of human TRPM4, and cDNA fragments were amplified from murine heart. The amplified DNAs were subcloned, and the DNAs of several clones were sequenced on both strands. The 1213-amino acid sequence of the derived mTRPM4 protein corresponds to the human TRPM4b sequence. In addition, two shorter variants represented by several independent clones including pM4–27 and pM4–28 (Fig. 1B) were identified, which might represent splice variants. The amino acid sequence encoded by clones pM4-27 and pM4-28 start at Met187. The subsequent sequence of pM4-27 is identical with the one of mTRPM4 (clone pM4-26) and covers 1027 amino acid residues. The clone pM4-28 contains an insertion, which results in a shift of the reading frame and a premature stop codon. Accordingly, transcripts made from pM4-28 encode a further shortened protein variant, which is predicted to have 592 amino acids (Fig. 1C). The mouse TRPM4 gene is localized on chromosome 7.B2 in a region that is syntenic to human chromosome 19.q13.33, where the human TRPM4 gene is localized. Northern Analysis—A human multiple-tissue RNA blot (Clontech) was hybridized in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C overnight. The probe was the 1361-bp Asp718/PstI fragment of the human TRPM4 cDNA. Filters were exposed to x-ray films for 20 days. For the analysis of expression of TRPM4 in mouse tissues, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from liver, stomach, intestine, placenta, esophagus, brain, mouse aortic endothelial cells, heart, kidney, pancreas, and embryonic stem cells (R1) as described (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mouse aortic endothelial cells were isolated from adult 129SvJ mice as described (15Suh S.H. Vennekens R. Manolopoulos V.G. Freichel M. Schweig U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two EcoRI-BamHI fragments of 743 and 637 bp in length corresponding to nucleotides 1328–2120 and 2325–3136 of the mTRPM4 cDNA, respectively, were used as probes. Filters were exposed to x-ray films for up to 13 days. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. Transient Expression of Human TRPM4 —We used the recombinant bicistronic expression plasmid pdiTRPM4b, which carries the entire protein-coding region for the human TRPM4b (accession numbers AX443227 and AF497623) and for the green fluorescent protein coupled by an internal ribosomal entry site sequence. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the pdiTRPM4b vector using previously described methods, and successfully transfected cells were visually identified by their green fluorescence in the patch clamp set-up (for details, see Ref. 16Nilius B.

Solutions—The extracellular solution for whole cell measurements and the pipette solution for inside-out patch clamp measurements contained 156 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The bath solution for inside-out patch clamp experiments or the pipette solution for whole cell/outside-out patch clamp experiments contained 156 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with CsOH. Ca2+ concentration at the inner side of the membrane was adjusted between 100 nm and 10 μm by adding appropriate amounts of CaCl2 to 10 mm EGTA calculated by the CaBuf program (available on the Internet at ftp://ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip). In some inside-out patch clamp experiments, we used 156 mm Na+ or K+ instead of Cs+. For Ca2+ concentrations between 100 μm and 5 mm, CaCl2 was added to an EGTA-free solution. Some experiments were done with Ca2+ buffered at 100 or 300 μm with 10 mm HEDTA which gave identical results as in EGTA-free solutions. All internal solutions were ATP-free. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Electrophysiology—Whole cell membrane currents were monitored with an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) using ruptured patches. Patch electrodes had a DC resistance between 2 and 4 megaohms. An Ag-AgCl wire was used as a reference electrode. Capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. Between 50 and 70% of the series resistance was compensated electronically to minimize voltage errors. Single channel data were obtained in the outside-out and inside-out patch clamp configuration. The sampling interval for single channel measurements was 400 μs, and filter setting was 1 kHz. Step protocols for single channel measurements were applied from holding potentials between –50 and +50 mV. Prestep protocols consisted of 100–2000-ms steps from –100 to +100 or 140 mV followed by a 250-ms test step to –100 mV. The interval between the pulses was 5 s. Tail current experiments were performed with a 400-ms prepulse to +10 mV followed by 250-ms test steps from +100 mV to –140 mV. Each trace consisted of 2048 data points. Ca2 + Measurements—TRPM4-expressing cells were loaded with Fura-II via the patch pipette (50 μm K+-Fura and 0.1 mm EGTA in the pipette) and excited alternately at wavelengths of 360 and 390 nm through a filter wheel rotating at 2 cycles/s. The fluorescence emitted at each excitation wavelength was measured at 510 nm using a photomultiplier. Autofluorescence measured from the cell-free background was subtracted. Apparent free [Ca2+] was calculated from the fluorescence ratio R by [Ca2+]i = K eff (R – R 0)/(R 1 – R), where K eff is the effective binding constant, R 0 is the fluorescence ratio at zero Ca2+, and R 1 is that at high Ca2+. These calibration constants were determined experimentally for the given set-up and the actual experimental conditions used. Data Analysis—Electrophysiological data were analyzed using the WinASCD software (G. Droogmans, Leuven). Pooled data are given as mean ± S.E. of n cells. Significance was tested using Student's paired t test (p < 0.05). The TRPM4 full-length cDNAs (human TRPM4b and murine TRPM4) were cloned using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human prostate tissue and mouse heart, respectively. The derived sequences of the human and mouse proteins (Fig. 1) comprise 86% sequence identity. TRPM4 transcripts are expressed in most human and mouse tissues examined (Fig. 2), including intestine, heart, placenta, pancreas, and kidney. In human poly(A)+ RNA, TRPM4 transcripts of ∼4.4 and ∼6.5 kb could be detected, which apparently represent the TRPM4 variants b and c isolated from the various cDNA libraries constructed from human prostate poly(A)+ RNA. Additional transcripts could be detected in pancreas (∼3 kb) and testes (∼2.4 kb). The mouse-specific probe recognized transcripts of ∼4.4 kb. All electrophysiological experiments were performed with human TRPM4. Its cDNA was expressed in HEK293 cells in which we could not detect endogenously expressed TRPM4 transcripts by Northern blot analysis. 2S. Philipp and V. Flockerzi, unpublished data. It has been shown in a recent report (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) that TRPM4 is activated by an elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and the activated current remains constant over minutes. In our experiments, activation of TRPM4b by increasing [Ca2+]i was, however, transient and followed by a time-dependent current decay, which made it difficult to analyze its biophysical properties. A similar current was not observed in nontransfected HEK cells or in transfected cells using a Ca2+-free pipette solution, indicating that its activation depends on intracellular Ca2+ (n > 20 cells). Fig. 3 shows an example of this transient current activated by loading the cell with 1 μm Ca2+ and the simultaneously measured changes in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3, A and B). Current-voltage relationships (I-V curves) measured at the peak of the activated current, clearly showed a strongly outwardly rectifying current (Fig. 3A, inset). Another typical feature of TRPM4 currents is shown in Fig. 3C. Loading the cell with 10 μm Ca2+ again activated a transient current (Fig. 3C). After complete inactivation of the current, switching to outside-out mode rapidly removed inactivation, and the remaining current became stable for several minutes (Fig. 3C). This recovery and maintained current response is not due to a change in [Ca2+]i because the pipette solution remains the same under both conditions. I-V curves at maximal activation in whole cell mode and in outside-out mode both showed strong outward rectification (Fig. 3, D and E). The steep increase of the current at large negative potentials is only observed if the voltage ramps are applied from –100 to +100 mV, but not if they are applied from +100 to –100 mV, and represents, as will be shown later, a rapid deactivation of the current active at the holding potential by stepping to negative potentials. Substitution of extracellular Na+ by NMDG+ completely abolished inward currents (Fig. 3, C and E). Omitting extracellular divalent cations (divalent cation-free solutions (DVF)) did not affect the current (Fig. 3C). Kinetic properties of currents through TRPM4 were further analyzed in selected cells with slow inactivation. Fig. 4A shows whole cell currents and currents in an outside-out patch from a cell loaded with 10 μm Ca2+. These relatively slow decays of the current occurred in less than 20% of the cells. With 10 μm [Ca2+]i, currents inactivated completely within the first 120 s (n = 17 from 21 cells). With 100 μm [Ca2+]i, all cells completely inactivated within 90 s (n = 52). Currents activated by voltage steps applied at times a and b in whole cell mode show the same kinetic hallmark as in cell-free mode applied at times c and d (i.e. a rapid deactivation at negative and slow activation at positive potentials) (Fig. 4B). Also note the different current scale bar in Fig. 4B, b, illustrating that at this time the current in whole cell mode was almost completely inactivated. The current was partially restored after switching to outside-out mode (diamond in Fig. 4A). It no longer inactivated and remained stable for several minutes, and its kinetic features were identical to those of the whole cell current (Fig. 4B, c and d). Current activity was also maintained for more than 10 min in inside-out patches exposed to 10 μm [Ca2+]i, as illustrated by the single channel traces in Fig. 5A recorded during repetitive voltage steps to –100 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. Similar channel events were never observed in nontransfected cells or in transfected cells in Ca2+-free solutions (data not shown, n > 20). The single channel current amplitude was 2.2 pA at –100 mV (Fig. 5A), corresponding to a single channel conductance of 23 ± 0.6 pS (from 44 cells), a value that is almost identical with previously published values (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This amplitude does not change by varying [Ca2+]i between 100 nm and 1 mm (data not shown). Fig. 5B shows that the ensemble-averaged currents at –100 mV, calculated from the corresponding single channel current traces, display the same voltage-dependent kinetics as the macroscopic current. The clustering of openings at the beginning of the hyperpolarizing step is consistent with a fast activation and deactivation of the channel (Fig. 4B). In Fig. 5, C and D compare the time courses of ensemble-averaged currents from inside-out patches in divalent free solutions in the pipette (extracellular side) and in solutions containing 1 mm Mg2+ and 5 mm Ca2+. Currents were measured in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+ for steps from 0 to +100 and –100 mV. Both inward and outward currents in inside-out patches very much resembled the currents measured in whole cell and outside-out mode, and DVF solution did not alter the kinetics of the currents. Surprisingly, increasing [Ca2+]i up to 300 μm still activated additional channels in inside-out and also in outside-out patches, indicating that currents through TRPM4 do not saturate at concentrations as low as 1 μm, as reported by Launay et al. (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We have checked Ca2+-dependent activation of TRPM4 in the range from 100 nm up to 5 mm. Current density still increased at 1 and 5 mm. Also, these features were identical in DVF solution (Fig. 5, E and F).Fig. 4Kinetic properties of TRPM4 currents in whole cell and cell-free modes. A, currents were activated in whole cell mode after breaking in with 10 μm [Ca2+]i. Because of the slow inactivation in this cell, we were able to study the kinetics of the current using step protocols applied at the bars labeled a and b. Note that during the measurement current inactivation proceeds (bars a–d indicate the current amplitude at the beginning of the step protocol shown in B). The diamond indicates the transition from the whole cell mode into the outside-out configuration. Note that the currents increase again after almost complete inactivation during the whole recording. B, currents recorded during voltage steps from –100 to +100 mV (holding potential 0 mV, increment 20 mV) at the times indicated in A by a–d. The duration of the test step is 100 and 2000 ms, respectively. Note that in all conditions, the kinetic pattern consists of a fast deactivation at negative potentials and a slow activation at positive potentials. All data are from the same cell. Note the different calibration, which indicates the inactivation in whole cell mode but the relatively constant current in the cell-free mode.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Activation of TRPM4 in inside-out patches.

Ensemble-averaged currents from the same patch at different Ca2+ concentrations are indicated at the right end of the sweeps. Note that the currents increase by increasing [Ca2+]i up to 300 μm and only decrease at higher concentrations (DVF pipette solution, steps to +100 and –100 mV). F, same experiment as in E from a single patch with a pipette solution containing 1 mm Mg2+ and 5 mm Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Time courses of current deactivation were fitted to a single exponential, giving time constants at –100 mV of 24.3 ± 5 ms (n = 4, whole cell measurements), 30.0 ± 6 ms (n = 12, inside out patches, ensemble-averaged currents), and 15.3 ± 2.9 ms (n = 18, outside-out patches). For steps from 0 to +100 mV, activation time constants were 155 ± 51 ms (n = 4, whole cell), 104 ± 21 ms (n = 12, inside out patches), and 101 ± 16 ms (n = 18, outside-out). These data indicate that the voltage-dependent kinetics is nearly identical for all different configurations. The kinetic features observed in all patch clamp configurations indicate that the gating of TRPM4b is a voltage-dependent process that will be further explored in the following experiments using outside-out patches (Fig. 6, [Ca2+]i = 100 μm), because the current is more sustained in this patch clamp configuration. Voltage steps applied from 0 mV to negative potentials induced small, rapidly deactivating inward currents, whereas much larger outward currents were activated during steps to positive potentials (Fig. 6A). Much larger current amplitudes were also observed if this voltage step protocol was applied from a holding potential of +50 mV (Fig. 6B), which is consistent with a larger fraction of channels being active at this positive potential. The instantaneous I-V curves, obtained by plotting the current amplitudes at the beginning of each step as a function of the step potential, are nearly linear, but current amplitudes at the 0-mV holding potential were much smaller than at +50 mV (Fig. 6C). To assess the dependence of current activation on the prepotential, we used a similar step protocol as in Fig. 6A and measured the current amplitude during a voltage step to –100 mV following the prestep. This step induces large inward currents, which rapidly deactivate (Fig. 6D). I-V curves from the currents at the end of the prepotential showed outward rectification (Fig. 6E). The amplitude of the current at the beginning of the step to –100 mV displayed a sigmoid dependence on prepotential (Fig. 6E). The fraction of open channels (F open) at the end of each prestep potential, shown in Fig. 6F, was calculated by normalizing these latter current amplitudes to the maximal current observed at positive potentials. It is obvious that channel availability strongly depends on membrane potential and can be described by a Boltzmann function, Fopen=Fconst+1-Fconst1+exp((VP-V0.5)/s)(Eq. 1) where F open represents the fraction of open channels at the prestep potential V P, V 0.5 is the potential of half-maximal activation, s is the slope parameter, and F const is the fraction of open channels at negative potentials (Fig. 6F). From the pooled data from eight cells at 100 μm [Ca2+]i using presteps of 1 and 2 s, we obtained a steady state fraction of noninactivated channels at negative potentials of 3 ± 0.3%, a potential for half-maximal activation of 28 ± 3 mV, and a slope factor of 10.1 ± 1.3 mV. To be certain that steady-state activation was reached at the end of the prepulses to 1 and 2 s, we measured the time course of activation using a protocol consisting of prepulses of varying duration followed by a step back to –100 mV (Fig. 6G). The time course of the peak inward current amplitudes at –100 mV could be fitted by a single exponential function with a time constant of 179 ± 32 ms (n = 8 cells), indicating that a steady state activation is reached at the end of a 1–2-s prepulse. Changes in [Ca2+]i had a large impact on the amplitude of the activated currents (Fig. 7, A and B) but did not significantly shift their availability curves (Fig. 7C). Fig. 7D shows data from different outside-out experiments for [Ca2+]i values of 10 μm (n = 10), 100 μm (n = 19), and 300 μm (n = 9). The pooled data for all concentrations were fitted by a Boltzmann function with the parameters 0.04 ± 0.01 for F const, 9.3 ± 0.7 mV for s, and 32.3 ± 2.4 mV for the potential of half-maximal activation. These findings suggest that the voltage-dependent changes of TRPM4b activation are not due to voltage-dependent binding of the activating intracellular Ca2+ ions. Extracellular divalent cations had no effect on the steady state availability curve, since it was not affected by omitting divalent cations or increasing [Ca2+]e from 1.5 to 10 (n = 6 for all three conditions; data not shown). The TRPM4b channel is uncommon in as much as it is activated rather than inactivated by intracellular Ca2+ and is impermeable for Ca2+ (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We show here that TRPM4b exhibits a striking voltage dependence, which has not been previously described for any TRP channel, indicating that TRPM4b is both a Ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent cation channel. The membrane potential strongly modulates the channel but does not activate it, the latter process being dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i. TRPM4b differs in this respect from other Ca2+-activated channels, such as BKCa, where strong depolarization can lead to channel activity in the absence of intracellular Ca2+. In our experiments, activation of TRPM4b requires higher Ca2+ concentrations than those previously reported (12Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). There is no obvious reason for this difference. In that report, the intracellular solution contained K+ or Na+, but substituting intracellular Cs+ in the pipette solution by K+ or Na+ did not significantly affect the Ca2+ sensitivity of TRPM4b. Surprisingly, we found in nearly all cells (81% at 10 μm [Ca2+]i, 100% at 100 and 300 μm [Ca2+]i), complete current inactivation within the first 120 s after breaking into the cells. The nature of this mechanism is so far unknown. The decay of the current is clearly faster at higher [Ca2+]i, suggesting a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. This mechanism seems to be absent or dysfunctional in cell-free patches, indicating that a small regulating molecule might be lost after patch excision. This decay is at variance with data published previously (6Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The reason for these differences is not clear. However, at Ca2+ concentrations in the 1 μm range, current decay is slow and may not be detectable in experiments lasting less than 120 s (6Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to speculate that, in analogy with the modulation of the ligand sensitivity of TRPV1, binding of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate might be involved (17Prescott E.D. Julius D. Science. 2003; 300: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Losing bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate could induce channel inactivation (e.g. by reducing the affinity of Ca2+ binding). Interestingly, pairwise alignment (Vector NTI) of TRPM4b and the modular phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate binding site in TRPV1 reveals a site between residues 1070 and 1110 in TRPM4 that has a 33.3% homology with the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate site in TRPV1. Steady state activation requires potential steps of 500 ms or longer, indicating that a slow process is involved. The striking deactivation/activation pattern defines TRPM4b as a time- and voltage-dependent channel. These features suggest that TRPM4b could provide a useful functional tool in the modulation of action potentials, since the large transient inward currents during repolarisation might favor the initiation of a subsequent depolarization. This mechanism might be useful for generation and modulation of spontaneous electrical activity or for modulation of electrical activity in excitable cells generating bursts of electrical activity (18Connors B.A. Nature. 2003; 420: 133-134Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Egorov A.V. Hamam B.N. Fransen E. Hasselmo M.E. Alonso A.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of TRPM4 transcripts both in human and mouse tissues (Fig. 2) is in support of such a functional role in excitable cells. Since the voltage and time dependence of TRPM4b is partly reminiscent of Ca2+-activated Cl– channels (CaCC), we have taken care to differentiate between these two currents in HEK293 cells. TRPM4b could be differentiated from CaCC in the following aspects: 1) inward currents through TRPM4b completely disappear when extracellular monovalent cations are substituted by NMDG+; 2) the current is insensitive to changes in the Cl– concentration; 3) the single channel conductance is completely different (∼23 picofarads for TRPM4b versus 1–7 picosiemens for CaCC (20Nilius B. Droogmans G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 177: 119-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)); and 4) rectification of TRPM4b is not affected by increasing [Ca2+]i (20Nilius B. Droogmans G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 177: 119-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Ca2+ sensitivity of TRPM4b seems to be identical at positive potential and negative potentials at concentrations between 10 μm and 1 mm Ca2+ (more than five cells for each concentration, data not shown). Moreover, the voltage dependence of channel availability was independent of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5, D–F). It is therefore unlikely that deactivation at negative and slow activation at positive potentials can be explained by a low Ca2+ affinity at negative and high affinity at positive potentials, as is the case for Ca2+-activated Cl– channels (20Nilius B. Droogmans G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 177: 119-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 21Kuruma A. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, we have not observed any change in the rectification behavior at different [Ca2+]i, which also argues against a voltage-dependent Ca2+ affinity of TRPM4b. At present, we can only speculate about the molecular mechanism of the voltage-dependent gating of TRPM4. Based on our present experiments, a block by intra- or extracellular divalent cations, as shown for TRPV6 (4Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans D. Nilius G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), can be excluded. Opening of voltage-gated K+,Na+,orCa2+ channels depends on the voltage-dependent movement of charged residues in the fourth transmembrane domain (S4), which, together with part of S3, forms a so-called “voltage sensor paddle.” Some charged residues are present in and around the putative fourth transmembrane domain of TRPM4, which could contribute to the channel's voltage dependence, but future mutagenesis studies are required to investigate this possibility. In conclusion, we show here for the first time a Ca2+- and voltage-dependent TRP channel. Its features might be functionally important in tissues that generate action potentials or otherwise modulate their membrane potential over a wider voltage range."
https://openalex.org/W1969073804,"GABAergic interneurons can phase the output of principal cells, giving rise to oscillatory activity in different frequency bands. Here we describe a new subtype of GABAergic interneuron, the multipolar bursting (MB) cell in the mouse neocortex. MB cells are parvalbumin positive but differ from fast-spiking multipolar (FS) cells in their morphological, neurochemical, and physiological properties. MB cells are reciprocally connected with layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and are coupled with each other by chemical and electrical synapses. MB cells innervate FS cells but not vice versa. MB to MB cell as well as MB to pyramidal cell synapses exhibit paired-pulse facilitation. Carbachol selectively induced synchronized theta frequency oscillations in MB cells. Synchrony required both gap junction coupling and GABAergic chemical transmission, but not excitatory glutamatergic input. Hence, MB cells form a distinct inhibitory network, which upon cholinergic drive can generate rhythmic and synchronous theta frequency activity, providing temporal coordination of pyramidal cell output."

Recent genetic mapping localized the AE gene to chromosome 8q24.3 (16Wang K. Pugh E.W. Griffen S. Doheny K.F. Mostafa W.Z. al Aboosi M.M. el Shanti H. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 1055-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and led to its identification as a member of the ZIP superfamily (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). That gene was named hZIP4 (the Human Genome Organization Nomenclature Committee named this gene SLC39A4). ZIP4 was found to be expressed in enterocytes and to reside in the plasma membrane. Mutations in hZIP4 were detected in AE patients (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that they cause this genetic disorder. The recently identified ZIP superfamily of metal ion uptake transporters (19Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) are found in all eukaryotes, and many of its members mediate zinc uptake. In yeast, ZRT1 encodes the high affinity zinc transporter, and ZRT2 encodes the low affinity zinc transport system. The Arabidopsis iron-regulated transporter gene (IRT1) encodes a metal transporter that has remarkable sequence similarity with the yeast ZRTs and with other Arabidopsis zinc transporters (19Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, the acronym ZIP was adopted to reflect ZRT/IRT-related proteins. Many members of the ZIP gene superfamily have now been detected based on sequence homology with yeast and Arabidopsis ZIP genes (22Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The ZIP proteins typically have eight membrane-spanning domains, and spanning domain four contains fully conserved histidyl and glycyl residues in an amphipathic α-helix. These proteins also often have a histidine-rich intracellular loop between spanners three and four. These structural motifs are hallmarks of the ZIP superfamily (22Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Computer searches of the complete human genome sequence revealed ∼12 ZIP genes (24Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Three of these ZIP proteins (hZIP1–3) fall into a subfamily that shares a conserved 12-residue signature sequence. hZIP1 and hZIP2 function as zinc transporters, and hZIP1 is the major zinc uptake protein in K562 cells (25Gaither L.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). ZIP4 and ZIP5 also comprise a ZIP subfamily (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), but their metal transport properties have not yet been determined. ZIP genes that encode zinc transporters can also be regulated by zinc. The yeast ZRT1 and ZRT2 genes are up-regulated in response to zinc deficiency (27Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Transcription of these genes is controlled by the transcription factor Zap1p (28Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and the activity of Zap1p is inhibited by zinc. In Arabidopsis, the ZIP1, ZIP3, and ZIP4 genes are zinc-regulated, consistent with a role in zinc uptake (e.g. in roots) (29Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In mammals, dietary zinc also regulates zinc transport activities and zinc transporter gene expression in the intestines (30Cousins R.J. Adv. Exp. Med.

For example, the mouse, rat, and human ZnT1 genes, which encode members of the cation diffusion facilitator family of proteins, are regulated by zinc (34Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R.

In support of the hypothesis that ZIP4 is the AE gene, the results presented herein demonstrate that mZIP4 encodes a zinc transporter, that this gene is expressed in intestine and embryonic visceral yolk sac, that ZIP4 protein localizes to the apical surface of enterocytes and visceral endoderm cells, and that the expression of this gene and its protein product is dynamically regulated by zinc. Animal Care and Use—All experiments involving mice were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. CD-1 mice (48–60 days old) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Mouse diets were purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI) and have been described in detail previously (37Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Zinc levels in the diets were as follows: zinc-deficient (ZnD), 1 ppm zinc; zinc-adequate (ZnA), 50 ppm zinc; and zinc-excess (ZnE), 50 ppm zinc plus 250 ppm zinc in the drinking water. These diets each contained ∼18 μg/g copper and are otherwise identical. To examine the tissue-specific expression of ZIP4, CD-1 female or male mice (6/group) maintained on ZnA feed were killed and the indicated tissues were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent extraction of RNA and Northern blot analysis. Pancreas RNA was extracted from fresh tissue. To examine the effects of zinc on ZIP4 expression, female mice were subjected to dietary zinc deficiency followed by either an injection of zinc or switching to ZnE conditions. Dietary zinc deficiency during pregnancy was induced as described previously (38Andrews G.K. Geiser J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CD-1 female mice were mated with CD-1 male mice and on day 1 (vaginal plug) of pregnancy mice were placed in pairs in cages with stainless steel false bottoms to reduce recycling of zinc (39Cook Mills J.M. Fraker P.J. Br. J. Nutr. 1993; 69: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mice were provided free access to the ZnA feed and deionized distilled water. Water bottles were washed in 4 m HCl and rinsed in deionized water to remove zinc (39Cook Mills J.M. Fraker P.J. Br. J. Nutr. 1993; 69: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On day 8, the diet was changed to the ZnD diet (or, where indicated, mice were maintained on the ZnA diet). The visceral yolk sac and maternal small intestine were harvested on day 11 to day 15 (6 mice/group) and either fixed for immunohistochemistry or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for Northern blotting. Where indicated, zinc-deficient day 14 pregnant mice were either injected intraperitoneally with ZnCl2 (100 μmol/kg body weight) or switched to ZnE conditions, and the embryonic visceral yolk sacs and maternal small intestines were collected at the indicated times after zinc treatment. The maternal intestine was isolated as an intact tissue (not a mucosal scrape) but was subdivided as follows. The first three centimeters was considered the duodenum, and the remainder of the small intestine was divided into equal parts, which were considered the proximal (nearest the duodenum) and distal small intestine. Previous studies have documented that little anorexia occurs under these experimental conditions, and results using pair-fed controls do not differ from those obtained using mice allowed free access to feed (37Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Andrews G.K. Geiser J. J.

Nonpregnant female CD-1 mice were fed ZnA or ZnD feed for 2 weeks and then injected intraperitoneally with zinc or switched to ZnE conditions, as described above. The duodenum and proximal small intestine were harvested at the indicated times after zinc treatment. Computer Analyses of Sequence Data—Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the Vector NTI Suite Program (Informax, Bethesda, MD). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Hybridization—Tissue RNAs were isolated as described in detail previously (36Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Total RNA (3 μg) was size-fractionated by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred, and cross-linked to nylon membranes (41Dalton T.P. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Northern blot membranes were hybridized and washed under stringent conditions as described (36Langmade S.J.

Hybrids were detected by autoradiography with intensifying screens at –70 °C. Although not shown, duplicate gels were stained with acridine orange or the same membrane was rehybridized with a β-actin probe to monitor RNA loading and integrity (36Langmade S.J. Ravindra R.

The mouse metallothionein-I (MT-I) and β-actin probes were as described (37Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mouse ZIP4 cDNA was identified as described under “Results” (GenBank™ accession number AK005535). The protein coding region of ZIP4 mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse intestinal RNA using Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega) and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for PCR. The sense primer was located at +86 and the antisense primer at +2155 in this cDNA. Each primer was 26 bp in length. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) product was cloned and the DNA sequence confirmed. Probes were labeled using the Random Primers DNA labeling system according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Probes had specific activities of ∼1–3 × 109 dpm/μg. RT-PCR Detection of ZIP4 Isoform mRNAs—RT-PCR was used to distinguish between mZIP4 mRNAs that encode the long versus the short isoforms of this protein. Total RNA (1 μg), isolated from the maternal small intestine or embryonic visceral yolk sac harvested from the zinc-deficient pregnant mice described above, was DNase I-treated according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). DNase I was inactivated by addition of EDTA to 2.5 mm, followed by a 10 min incubation at 65 °C. Reverse transcription was subsequently carried out using Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega). Samples were then amplified by PCR for 27, 30, or 33 cycles using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The long isoform transcript was amplified using the primers mZIP4EX1(s) (5′-AGAAGTCAGCACCTCTACAAGGAACGC-3′) and mZIP4EX2(as) (5′-AGTAGCTGGCTCAGACCCAGGGTC-3′), whereas the short isoform transcript was amplified using the primers mZIP4INT1(s) (5′-AACATGACATAAGATAGCTGATAGAATCCATGC-3′) and mZIP4EX2(as). The RT-PCR products of the long and short isoform transcripts were 475 and 329 bp, respectively. Immunohistochemistry—The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a mZIP4 peptide was described previously (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed using the Histostain-SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for rabbit primary antibody and AEC staining. Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections were deparaffinized, treated with 1% peroxide for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min, and then incubated for1hat room temperature with the mZIP4 antiserum at a 1:160 dilution. Where indicated, the mZIP4 antiserum was neutralized by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with 6 × 10–5m peptide before application to the tissue sections. Other controls included nonimmune serum and omission of primary antiserum. Expression Plasmid Construction—Mouse ZIP4 cDNA encoding the long isoform was cloned into an expression vector that was used for zinc uptake studies in transiently transfected cells. To subclone pCMV-mZIP4, total RNA from mouse intestine (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by amplification of the cDNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with primers mZIP4(S) (5′-CGGAATTCGAAGTCAGCACCTCTACAAGGAACGC-3′) and mZIP4(AS) (5′-GGACTAGTAGTCAACAGACAGGGACAAGGACTGG-3′). The amplification product was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and ligated into pCMVSport6 (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured under 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 24-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates and transfected with the pCMV-Sport6 vector or pCMV-Sport6 expressing the mouse mZIP4 cDNA (pCMV-mZIP4). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Transfection efficiencies were typically ∼60%. Between 36 and 48 h after transfection, the cells were used for zinc uptake assays. 65Zn Uptake Assays—Zinc uptake assays were performed essentially as described previously (25Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 26Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once in uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and then prewarmed uptake buffer containing the specified concentration of 65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The cells were then incubated in a shaking 37 °C water bath for 15 min unless indicated otherwise. Assays were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were collected on glass fiber filters (Type A/E, Gelman Sciences) and washed three times in stop buffer (∼10 ml of total wash volume). Parallel experiments were conducted at 0 °C to measure cell surface 65Zn binding, which was subtracted from the values at 37 °C to obtain net zinc uptake values. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter. Metal salts were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of the chloride salts of various metals (CoCl2, CuCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, and CdCl2) and AgNO3 were prepared at 100 mm concentration in distilled water. A ZnCl2 stock was prepared at 100 mm in 0.02 n HCl, and an FeCl3 stock solution was prepared at 50 mm in 0.1 n HCl. Sodium ascorbate (1 mm) was used to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Ascorbate treatment alone did not alter zinc uptake activity (data not shown). Cells grown in parallel to those used for uptake experiments were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer, resuspended in PBS buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100, for cell lysis, and then assayed for protein content using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Zinc accumulation and uptake rates were normalized to protein concentrations of these cell lysates. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined by nonlinear interpolation of the data using Prism (version 3.0a for Macintosh, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). GenBank™ Accession Numbers—GenBank™ accession numbers for the mouse ZIP4 ESTs were AK005535, AI314527, and BB848544 for long isoform, and BY147218 and BY136150 for short isoform. AC074152 was the accession number for mouse ZIP4 gene. Identification of the Mouse ZIP4 Gene and mRNA and Evolutionary Conservation of the Predicted ZIP4 Peptide—The predicted human ZIP4 protein sequence (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) was used to search the mouse translated non-redundant data base on the NBCI server, and a 2264-bp cDNA containing a 660-amino acid open reading frame homologous to the long isoform of hZIP4 was identified (Fig. 1). Two ESTs extended the 5′ end of this mZIP4 cDNA an additional 439 bp. However, the 5′ end of the vast majority of mZIP4 ESTs corresponded to the 2264-bp transcript (Fig. 1A). The mZIP4 gene was subsequently identified using this cDNA sequence to search the mouse high throughput genomic sequence data base on the NCBI server. Intron-exon structure was determined by comparing the cDNA and genomic sequences in conjunction with splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences (Fig. 1A). Like the human gene (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), mouse ZIP4 consists of 12 exons separated by 11 introns and is quite compact, spanning only ∼5 kb of DNA. The ZIP4 gene in humans is located on chromosome 8q24.3, whereas the mZIP4 gene is located in the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 15E1. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of the long isoform of mZIP4 and hZIP4 (17Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) revealed 76% amino acid similarity between these two proteins (Fig. 1B). The amino-terminal half of these proteins, which is predicted to be extracellular, is not as well conserved, although several conserved blocks of amino acids are present. The highest degree of similarity occurs in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, which contains the eight predicted membrane-spanning domains characteristic of ZIP proteins. The amino acid sequence within the predicted membrane-spanning regions is highly conserved; most of the amino acid differences between these proteins occur in the intervening loops. Interestingly, of the 11 amino acid changes found in various AE patients, 9 occur at residues that are also conserved in the mouse protein. These changes often convert an uncharged to a charged residue within the highly conserved transmembrane segments. In humans, two ZIP4 mRNAs have been detected which are predicted to encode either a long (647-residue) or short (622-residue) isoform of this protein (18Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These hZIP4 isoforms are identical in the carboxyl-terminal 583 residues, but the short form is predicted to have a 39-residue amino terminus encoded in intron 1 and to lack the 64 amino acids encoded in exon 1 (Fig. 1C). Similarly, two mZIP4 transcripts were identified in the mouse EST data base. The vast majority of mZIP4 ESTs correspond to the long isoform of this protein (Fig. 1B), and to date only two ESTs that correspond to a short form of mZIP4 have been entered into the EST data base. These mouse ESTs are predicted to encode a portion of a 613-residue protein with a unique 16-residue amino terminus (Fig. 1C). This amino terminus is encoded within intron 1, but the remaining 597 residues are identical between the long and short isoform of mZIP4. There is very little similarity between the amino-terminal amino acids of the short isoforms in human and mouse. The short form transcripts are predicted to originate from an alternate transcription start point within intron 1 (Fig. 1A), but are almost the same length as those that encode the long isoform. The functional significance of two isoforms of mZIP4 is unknown, but based on the relative abundance of these ESTs, the long isoform of mZIP4 is predicted to be far more abundant, and was therefore studied in more detail. Mouse ZIP4 Can Function as a Zinc Transporter—Because of its homology with the ZIP family of proteins and the presence of hZIP4 mutations in AE patients, mZIP4 is predicted to function as a zinc transporter. To assess the potential role of mZIP4 in zinc transport, the ZIP4 open reading frame encoding the more abundant long isoform was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCMV-Sport6, allowing high level expression from the CMV promoter. This plasmid (pCMV-mZIP4) and the vector alone were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and these transfected cells were then assayed for 65Zn uptake activity (Figs. 2 and 3). Consistent with an ability of mZIP4 to transport zinc, cells expressing mZIP4 from the CMV promoter accumulated ∼5-fold more 65Zn over a 60-min period than did the endogenous zinc transport activity assayed in cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 2A). Only low levels of zinc accumulation were detected when either of these transfected cell types were incubated with 65Zn at 0 °C. These results indicated that zinc accumulation by both the mZIP4-dependent activity and the endogenous system was temperature-dependent, and therefore likely to be transporter-mediated and not the result of zinc binding to the cell surface. Also consistent with zinc transport, mZIP4-dependent zinc accumulation was concentration-dependent and saturable. This activity showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 1.6 ± 0.1 μm and a V max of 13.1 ± 0.2 pmol of zinc/min/mg of protein (Fig. 2B). The endogenous system in HEK293 cells had a similar apparent Km (2.1 ± 0.2 μm) but a far lower V max (4.1 ± 0.1 pmol of zinc/min/mg of protein).Fig. 3Characterization of metal specificity of uptake in cultured cells transiently transfected with an mZIP4 expression v"

We show here that phosphorylation of all three sites blocks Raf-1 binding to Ras.GTP in vivo and that cAMP stimulates binding of 14-3-3 proteins to Ser233 and Ser259. We also show that Raf-1 and protein kinase A (PKA) form a complex in vivo that is disrupted by cAMP and that ablation of PKA by use of small interfering RNA blocks phosphorylation by cAMP. The ability of PKA to block Raf-1 activation is ablated by the PKA inhibitor H89. These studies suggest that Raf-1 and cAMP form a signaling complex in cells. Upon activation of PKA, Raf-1 is phosphorylated and 14-3-3 binds, blocking Raf-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and preventing its activation.

In mammalian cells, growth factors, mitogens and hormones stimulate the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AKAP, protein kinase A anchoring protein; RBD, Ras binding domain. The ERKs control cell growth, differentiation, and survival through the phosphorylation of multiple substrates (for review, see Ref. 1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). ERKs are activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, which are activated by the MEK kinases, Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf. Raf-1 activation is a complex process (for review, see Ref. 2Avruch J. Khokhlatchev A. Kyriakis J.M. Luo Z. Tzivion G. Vavvas D. Zhang X.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the first step of which is direct binding to active Ras (Ras.GTP), resulting in Raf-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of serine 338 and tyrosine 341 in the N-region and threonine 491 and serine 495 in the activation segment is essential for Raf-1 activation (3Mason C.S. Springer C. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 4Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

All of these phosphorylation events occur at the plasma membrane, so Ras-mediated recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane is essential for its activation. 14-3-3 proteins also play a key role in Raf-1 regulation. These small (∼30 kDa) acidic dimers bind to and regulate the activity of many proteins by binding to short phosphorylated peptide motifs (7Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Two 14-3-3 motifs are present in Raf-1, centered on Ser259 and serine 621 (Ser621) (2Avruch J. Khokhlatchev A. Kyriakis J.M. Luo Z. Tzivion G. Vavvas D. Zhang X.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Binding to Ser621 appears to be essential for Raf-1 activation, whereas binding to Ser259 appears to suppress activity. It was recently shown that binding of 14-3-3 to Ser259 antagonizes Raf-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and prevents its activation by the Ras related proteins TC21 and R-Ras (8Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Light Y. Paterson H. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4984-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is another negative regulator of Raf-1. When cellular cAMP levels increase, Raf-1 becomes phosphorylated on three sites (Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259). These sites work independently to suppress Raf-1 activity so all three must be mutated to prevent Raf-1 inactivation by cAMP in cells (8Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Sidovar M.F. Kozlowski P. Lee J.W. Collins M.A. He Y. Graves L.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). How these sites work is unclear. PKA phosphorylation of Ser43 prevents the isolated N terminus of Raf-1 from binding to Ras.GTP in vitro (12Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), but mutation of Ser43 to alanine does not overcome the effects of cAMP in vivo (8Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Sidovar M.F. Kozlowski P. Lee J.W. Collins M.A. He Y. Graves L.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although 14-3-3 is known to bind to phosphorylated Ser259, its role in cAMP mediated suppression of Raf-1 activity is not known and the mechanism of action of Ser233 is unknown. Finally, it has not been established that PKA mediates these cAMP effects in cells, because cAMP activates several effectors (13Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and in some cells, Ser259 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase B (14Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 15Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann s. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Here we re-examine Raf-1 regulation by cAMP. Our data suggest that Raf-1 and PKA form a signaling complex in cells. When PKA is activated, it phosphorylates Raf-1, and stimulates recruitment of 14-3-3, preventing Raf-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and subsequently blocking its activation. Expression Constructs—The expression vector for myc-tagged Raf-1 (pEF/mRaf-1) and Raf-1 immunoprecipitation kinase assays have been described previously (16Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alanine-substituted mRaf-1 constructs were generated by standard PCR techniques (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) and verified by automated dideoxy sequencing procedures. Cell Culture and Biochemical Techniques—COS and NIH3T3 cells were cultured and transfected with lipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen), and cell extracts were prepared as described previously (16Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and H89 (Calbiochem) were all dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). PDGF (Sigma) was dissolved in water. Endogenous Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody M40091.G (Anogen, Toronto, Canada); myc-tagged Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with 9E10, and HA-tagged 14-3-3ζ and K-Ras with 12CA5. Complexes between Raf-1 and Ras or Raf-1 and 14-3-3 were analyzed as before (9Light Y. Paterson H. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4984-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phospho-specific antibody to Ser259 was from New England Biolabs (94215) and antibodies to PKA Cα (sc-903), PKA Cβ (sc-904), and PKA RIIα (sc-909) were from Santa Cruz. RNA Interference—Synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) probes were from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The following sequences were used: PKA Cα, AAGTGGTTTGCCACGACTGAC; PKA Cβ, AAGAGTTTCTAGCCAAAGCCA; scrambled, AACCGTCGATTTCACCCGGG. Exponentially growing cells were transfected with 20 pmol of PKA Cα plus 20 pmol of PKA Cβ siRNA or 40 pmol of the scrambled control. Generation of p233-specific Antibodies—Synthetic peptide Raf-1pS233 (SQHRYpSTPHAF; single amino acid code, where pS is a phosphorylated serine) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (374817; Calbiochem) using gluteraldehyde (G5882; Sigma), and antibodies were raised in rats using standard protocols (18Harlow E. Lane E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). For competition experiments, antibodies were preincubated with synthetic peptides (10 μm) for 2 h at room temperature prior to use. Control peptides were: Raf-1S233 (SQHRYSTPHAF) and Raf-1pS43 (QRRApSDDGK). Phosphorylation on Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 Disrupts Raf-1 Binding to Ras.GTP—To study Raf-1 phosphorylation on Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259, endogenous Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells using antibody M40091.G and subjected to Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. M40091.G was raised to amino acids 1–240 of Raf-1, and we previously demonstrated that its binding to Raf-1 is not affected by Ser43, Ser233, or Ser259 phosphorylation (11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Ser259 phosphorylation was examined using a commercial phospho-specific antibody (p259), and we have recently described a phospho-specific antibody for Ser43 (p43; Ref. 11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have also generated a rat phospho-specific monoclonal antibody to Ser233 (p233). This antibody bound strongly to myc-epitope tagged Raf-1 (mRaf-1) that had been transiently expressed in COS cells treated with forskolin (25 μm) and IBMX (500 μm; Fig 1A). Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase, and IBMX inhibits phosphodiesterases, so these agents work in concert to increase intracellular cAMP levels. The antibody bound only weakly to Raf-1 from untreated cells (Fig. 1A), and binding was ablated when Ser233 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 1A). It was also blocked when the antibody was preincubated with the phosphorylated peptide immunogen (Raf-1pS233) but not by the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (Raf-1S233) or an unrelated phosphorylated peptide (Raf-1pS43) (Fig. 1A). Thus the antibody is specific for phosphorylated Ser233. Using these antibodies, we examined the kinetics of phosphorylation of Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 on endogenous Raf-1 in NIH3T3 cells. In serum-starved cells, Ser43 and Ser233, were very weakly phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). Both became strongly phosphorylated within 60 s of forskolin/IBMX treatment and remained phosphorylated for up to 60 min (Fig. 1B). By contrast, Ser259 was phosphorylated in untreated cells, but its phosphorylation still increased 2–3-fold following forskolin/IBMX treatment (Fig. 1B). We next examined how Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 phosphorylation affected Raf-1 binding to Ras.GTP in vivo. For these studies, mRaf-1 was transiently expressed in COS cells together with HA-epitope tagged K-Ras (HAK-Ras). HAK-Ras was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody 12CA5, and the complexes were probed for the associated mRaf-1 by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody 9E10. In serum-starved COS cells, mRaf-1 did not bind to HAK-Ras, but a complex formed rapidly following EGF treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, the association between these transfected proteins is dependent on Ras activation by growth factors. In agreement with our data for the endogenous proteins (11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this binding was completely blocked when the cells were pretreated with forskolin and IBMX for 10 min (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5), a time that stimulates efficient phosphorylation of Raf-1 on all three sites (Fig. 1B). When Ser43 was mutated to alanine (S34AmRaf-1), EGF still induced Raf-1 binding to Ras, but forskolin/IBMX could only partially inhibit the binding (Fig. 2, lane 9). Similarly, S259AmRaf-1 binding was still induced by EGF, and forskolin/IBMX suppression of this binding was blunted (Fig. 2, lanes 14–17). Finally, EGF also stimulated binding of S233AmRaf-1 to HAK-Ras, but forskolin/IBMX pretreatment was relatively effective at blocking this interaction (Fig. 2, lanes 10–13). When all three sites were mutated, the ability of forskolin/IBMX to block binding to EGF activated Ras was completely abolished (Fig. 2, lanes 18–21). Thus, in vivo phosphorylation of each site appears to block the interaction of Raf-1 with Ras.GTP independently of the other two sites. 14-3-3 Binds to Both Ser233 and Ser259—Next we examined whether 14-3-3 binding to Raf-1 in vivo was affected by elevated cAMP. For these studies, mRaf-1 was expressed in COS cells together with HA epitope-tagged 14-3-3ζ (HA14-3-3). HA14-3-3 was immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 and the immunoprecipitates examined for bound mRaf-1 by Western blotting for the myc epitope. As we have demonstrated (9Light Y. Paterson H. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4984-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), mRaf-1 binds to HA14-3-3 even in resting cells (Fig. 3, lane 5). When the cells were treated with forskolin/IBMX, there was a large increase in 14-3-3 binding to Raf-1 (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), which correlates with a simultaneous increase in Ser259 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). 14-3-3 binding to Raf-1 was strongly suppressed when Ser259 was mutated to alanine, although forskolin/IBMX still elevated the amount of binding (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). The above data show that Ser259 is the major cAMP-regulated 14-3-3 binding site on Raf-1 in vivo, but that another site(s) exists, so we tested whether 14-3-3 binds to Ser43 or Ser233. Mutation of Ser43 to alanine did not affect binding of 14-3-3 to Raf-1 (data not shown). However, 14-3-3 binding to S233AmRaf-1 was reduced compared with wild-type mRaf-1, both in untreated and in forskolin/IBMX treated cells (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9). Finally, HA14-3-3 binding to mRaf-1 was completely ablated when both Ser233 and Ser259 were mutated to alanine (Fig. 3, lanes 14 and 15). These data show that there are two cAMP regulated 14-3-3 binding sites in the N terminus of Raf-1, Ser233 and Ser259. Ser259 appears to be the major 14-3-3 binding site and Ser233 a minor site. PKA Mediates the Suppression of Raf-1 by cAMP—Finally, we tested whether the effects of cAMP were mediated by PKA. First, we examined whether Raf-1 and PKA form a complex under physiological conditions. Endogenous Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from untreated NIH3T3 using antibody M40091.G, and the immunocomplexes were examined for PKA by Western blotting for the PKA catalytic subunit, Cα. We found that Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from untreated cells contained PKA Cα, but the interaction between these proteins was disrupted when cells were treated with forskolin/IBMX (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the PKA regulatory subunit, RIIα, was also bound to Raf-1 in these cells, but unlike Cα, RIIα binding was not disrupted when the cells were treated with forskolin/IBMX (Fig. 4B). Next we examined the effects of PKA on Raf-1 kinase activity. Raf-1 activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay in which GST-MEK, GST-ERK, and myelin basic protein were used as sequential substrates (11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PDGF (50 ng/ml, 5 min) strongly activated Raf-1 in NIH3T3 cells, but this activation was blocked when cells were pretreated with forskolin/IBMX (Fig. 4C and see Ref. 11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, when the cells were pretreated with forskolin/IBMX in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89 (10 μm, 30-min pretreatment), Raf-1 activation by PDGF was no longer blocked by forskolin/IBMX pretreatment (Fig. 4C). Since H89 is not completely specific for PKA (19Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), we also used RNA interference to ablate the catalytic subunits of PKA in NIH3T3 cells. There are two catalytic subunits in mice, Cα and Cβ (20Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so we designed siRNA probes selective for each. Treatment of NIH3T3 with these probes resulted in ablation of expression of both subunits within 72 h, whereas the scrambled control probe did not affect expression of either (Fig. 4D). The Cα and Cβ probes did not affect expression of Raf-1 or the PKA regulatory subunit RII (Fig. 4D). Ablation of Cα and Cβ completely blocked cAMP stimulated phosphorylation of Raf-1 on Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 (Fig. 4D). Thus, we show for the first time that PKA is responsible for stimulating Raf-1 phosphorylation in response to cAMP in vivo. A number of studies have demonstrated that agents that stimulate cAMP production in cells block Raf-1 signaling to ERK (8Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Wu J. Dent P.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, since cAMP can activate at least three effectors (PKA, exchange factors for small G-proteins and ion exchange channels (13Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar)), it is possible that the cAMP effects are not mediated by PKA. Here we provide unequivocal proof of the involvement of PKA. We demonstrate that when the PKA catalytic subunits are ablated using siRNA, cAMP does not stimulate phosphorylation on Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259. Although this does not prove that PKA directly phosphorylates Raf-1 in cells, it demonstrates that it is necessary. Furthermore, PKA can phosphorylate synthetic peptides representing each site in vitro, demonstrating that these are bona fide PKA sites (Ref. 11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and data not shown). We also show here that endogenous Raf-1 and PKA form a complex that is disrupted when cAMP levels in cells are elevated, and, finally, the PKA inhibitor H89 rescues Raf-1 activation in the presence of forskolin/IBMX. Although this compound inhibits several kinases (19Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), taken together these data demonstrate that PKA is directly involved in mediating Raf-1 phosphorylation and thereby suppressing its activation. PKA is regulated by a diverse family of proteins called the protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs). These scaffolds bind to the PKA regulatory subunits and regulate the subcellular localization of the PKA holoenzymes. They also bind to PKA substrates, co-localizing kinase and substrate and thereby integrating diverse signaling pathways by coordinating phosphorylation of specific substrates (23Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). cAMP releases the catalytic subunits from this complex and it then phosphorylates local substrates. The discovery of a complex between Raf-1 and PKA is therefore particularly interesting, because it provides a molecular explanation for the integration of these two pathways. The data suggest that a specific AKAP keeps these two kinases co-localized so that when cAMP is elevated PKA can phosphorylate Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 on Raf-1 and block signaling to MEK. Consistent with this model is the observation that whereas PKA Cα binding to Raf-1 in cells is disrupted by cAMP, RIIα subunit binding was not, indicating that the putative AKAP remains bound to Raf-1 even when PKA is activated. We are currently attempting to identify this AKAP. Our data also show that PKA does not mediate basal phosphorylation of Ser43, Ser233, or Ser259, because PKA catalytic subunit ablation did not affect these events (Fig. 4D). We have previously demonstrated that Raf-1 only completely escapes the effects of cAMP when Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 are all mutated to alanine (11Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We show here that mutation of each also weakly restores binding of Raf-1 to Ras.GTP in vivo, although Ser233 was the least efficient in this respect. These data suggest that each site works independently to block binding to Ras, explaining why they work independently to block Raf-1 activation. The mechanism of action of Ser43 is unclear, but this site is just N-terminal to the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 (amino acids 53–112 (24Marais R. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Pawson T. Cell Signalling. Vol. 27. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 101-125Google Scholar)) and so may work by steric hindrance or by inducing a conformational change in the RBD. Ser233 and Ser259 appear to act primarily by recruiting 14-3-3 to the N terminus of Raf-1. Previous workers have proposed a model of Raf-1 regulation by 14-3-3. Since 14-3-3 binding to Ser621 is required for activation, and binding to Ser259 inhibits Raf-1 activity, and because 14-3-3 is a dimer, this model proposes that 14-3-3 binds to both sites simultaneously and folds Raf-1 into an inactive conformation (2Avruch J. Khokhlatchev A. Kyriakis J.M. Luo Z. Tzivion G. Vavvas D. Zhang X.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Ras.GTP would displace 14-3-3 from CR2, simultaneously unfolding Raf-1 and recruiting it to the plasma membrane for activation. However, we show here that cAMP stimulates Ser259 phosphorylation by 2–3-fold and 14-3-3 binding by about 3-fold in vivo. Thus, in untreated cells, only about 30% of Ser259 appears to be phosphorylated and bound to 14-3-3, so the majority of Raf-1 cannot be in this 14-3-3-maintained inactive conformation. It has also been suggested that cAMP stimulates Ser621 phosphorylation and thereby blocks Raf-1 activity through an unknown mechanism (25Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosh P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, we did not find such a role. Ser621 phosphorylation was not elevated in forskolin/IBMX-treated cells, and Ser621 seems to be a rather weak 14-3-3 binding site, because binding was only visible in the S233A,S259AmRaf-1 double mutant when the Western blot was strongly overexposed (data not shown). Based on our studies, we propose a different model for Raf-1 regulation by 14-3-3 in our cells. We and others recently demonstrated that 14-3-3 binding to Ser259 antagonises Raf-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane (8Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Light Y. Paterson H. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4984-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We propose that the majority of Raf-1 in resting cells is not phosphorylated on Ser259, and 14-3-3 is not bound to the N terminus of Raf-1, so this population can be recruited to the plasma membrane for activation. The remaining Ser259 phosphorylated population has 14-3-3 bound to its N terminus, so it cannot be recruited to the membrane or activated unless Ser259 is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (26Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Dhillon A.S. Meikle S. Yazici Z. Eulitz M. Kolch W.

We further propose that Raf-1 is in a complex with PKA that may be mediated by AKAPs and that cAMP releases the catalytic subunit, which then phosphorylates Raf-1 on Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259. Phosphorylated Ser43 blocks membrane recruitment by directly interfering with Raf-1 binding to Ras.GTP. Ser233 and Ser259 also block membrane recruitment, but by recruiting 14-3-3 to the Raf-1 N terminus, and 14-3-3 binds with high affinity due to the proximity of the Ser233 and Ser259 sites. Thus, the three sites work in unison to suppress Raf-1 activity when cAMP is elevated. These data fit the model recently proposed by Michael Yaffe about 14-3-3 binding (7Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). He observed that 14-3-3 often binds to two sites on the same protein, one of which is a dominant site or “gatekeeper.” The gatekeeper site is phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, the secondary site is not. Thus, each 14-3-3 dimer is only bound to its client through one of its two binding pockets. However, when the secondary site on the client protein becomes phosphorylated, the second 14-3-3 binding pocket engages onto that client rapidly due to the high local concentration induced by proximity. Since 14-3-3 is extraordinary rigid, it is thought to behave as a molecular anvil deforming its bound client protein while it undergoes only minimal structural alterations (7Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 29Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Ser259 is the gatekeeper site, while Ser233 is the secondary site, which is consistent with the fact that while Ser259 conforms to a strong 14-3-3 consensus (RSTpSTP; important residues are underlined) Ser233 conforms to a weak 14-3-3 consensus (231RYpSTP235) (30Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). When both are phosphorylated, according to the model, 14-3-3 would bind to the N terminus of Raf-1 with high affinity and induce a conformational change that would serve to completely block membrane recruitment, possibly because it also interfers with binding to Ras.GTP. Thus, although either site can block Raf-1 activation, together they provide a much stronger block, and the main effect of cAMP is to inhibit Raf-1 membrane recruitment rather than to specifically block its kinase activity. In our model, it is still unclear what role Ser621 binding plays in Raf-1 regulation and what the relationship between Ser621 and Ser259 binding is. However, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for how phosphorylation of Ser43, Ser233, and Ser259 block Raf-1 activity and support a model in which all three sites can work independently to block Raf-1 activation by cAMP in vivo. Our results directly implicate PKA in this event for the first time. We thank Michael Yaffe for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2035664648,"We studied how physiological properties of cerebellar climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses change during developmental transition from multiple to mono CF innervation onto each PC. From P3 to P6, differences in the strengths of multiple CFs became larger. Around P10, each PC was either monoinnervated by one strong CF (CF-mono) or multiply innervated by one strong CF (CF-multi-S) plus a few weaker CFs (CF-multi-W). We show that simultaneous release of multiple vesicles per site occurs normally from CF-multi-S, CF-mono, and mature CFs, but less frequently from CF-multi-W and neonatal CFs. We also present evidence suggesting that weaker CFs with lower probability of multivesicular release would be withdrawn preferentially. The results suggest that differentiation into strong and weak CFs with high and low probabilities of multivesicular release precedes developmental CF synapse elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2015989606,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), which generates the endogenous vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), is highly regulated by post-translational modifications and protein interactions. We recently used purified proteins to characterize the mechanisms by which heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) increases eNOS activity at low and high Ca2+ levels (Takahashi, S. and Mendelsohn, M. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 9339–9344). Here we extend these studies to explore interactions between HSP90, Akt, and eNOS. In studies with purified proteins, HSP90 increased the initial rate and maximal extent of Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation and activation at low Ca2+ levels. Akt was not observed in the eNOS complex in the absence of HSP90, but both active and inactive Akt associated with eNOS in the presence of HSP90. Direct binding of Akt to HSP90 was observed even in the absence of eNOS. HSP90 also facilitated CaM binding to eNOS irrespective of Akt presence. Geldanamycin (GA) disrupted HSP90-eNOS binding, reduced HSP90-stimulated CaM binding, and blocked both recruitment of Akt to the eNOS complex and phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179. Akt phosphorylated only CaM-bound eNOS, in an HSP90-independent manner. HSP90 and active Akt together increased eNOS activity synergistically, which was reversed by GA. In bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs), the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin on eNOS-HSP90-Akt complex formation and eNOS activation were compared. BAPTA-AM inhibited VEGF- but not insulin-induced eNOS-HSP90-Akt complex formation and eNOS phosphorylation. Insulin caused rapid, transient increase in eNOS activity correlated temporally with the formation of eNOS-HSP90-Akt complex. GA prevented insulin-induced association of HSP90, Akt and CaM with eNOS and inhibited eNOS activation in BAECs. Both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin induced activation of Akt in BAECs, but only insulin caused HSP90-Akt-eNOS association and eNOS phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that HSP90 and Akt synergistically activate eNOS and suggest that this synergy contributes to Ca2+-independent eNOS activation in response to insulin. Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), which generates the endogenous vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), is highly regulated by post-translational modifications and protein interactions.

Geldanamycin (GA) disrupted HSP90-eNOS binding, reduced HSP90-stimulated CaM binding, and blocked both recruitment of Akt to the eNOS complex and phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179.

It has been shown further that in endothelial cells activated by the above stimuli, inhibition of either HSP90 or Akt results in a marked reduction of NO production. Though the activation of eNOS is well characterized for HSP90 and Akt individually, only a few studies have addressed the potential interplay of these two proteins in eNOS activation. Brouet et al. (13Brouet A. Sonveaux P. Dessy C. Balligand J.-L. Feron O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) reported cooperative stimulation of eNOS by HSP90 and Akt in Ca2+-dependent VEGF-stimulated ECs. Their data supported that HSP90 association is a prerequisite for subsequent Akt-mediated stimulation of eNOS. In addition, in heterologous COS cell expression studies, it was suggested that synergistic enhancement of eNOS activation is induced by HSP90 and Akt. Recently, Fontana et al. (14Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) also suggested that HSP90 might function as a scaffold protein for eNOS and Akt, facilitating eNOS phosphorylation and activation in VEGF-stimulated ECs. However, the synergy between HSP90 and Akt in eNOS activation cannot be explained by only the scaffolding effect of HSP90. The present study examines potential interactions between eNOS, HSP90, and Akt in vitro using purified proteins. Our results provide evidence that HSP90 and Akt synergistically activate eNOS at physiological calcium levels, and show that this occurs for Ca2+-independent activation of eNOS by insulin in endothelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The enzymes, antibodies and reagents used in this study and their sources are as follows: active Akt1/PKBα, inactive Akt1/PKBα, crosstide, anti-CaM antibody, protein G-agarose beads, and LY294002 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), bovine brain HSP90, Triton X-100, Dowex AG50WX8, tetrahydrobiopterin, NADPH, FMN, FAD, l-NAME, l-arginine, sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, β-glycerophosphate, and polyethylene glycol 400 (Sigma), CHAPS, recombinant chicken CaM, staurosporin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), geldanamycin (GA), protease inhibitor mixture set III, and BAPTA-AM (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), anti-eNOS antibody and anti-HSP90 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-peNOS antibody (phospho-Ser-1177) and anti-Akt antibody, anti-pAkt antibody (phospho-Ser-473) and Phototope-HRP Western blot detection system (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B, CaM Sepharose 4B, HiTrap Q, and PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA), l-[2,3,4-3H]arginine (45–70 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). All other chemicals were of reagent grade.eNOS Purification—Recombinant bovine wild-type eNOS, expressed in Sf9 cells, was purified from the lysate by sequential chromatographies on 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose and CaM Sepharose columns according to the method of List et al. (15List B.M. Klosch B. Volker C. Gorren A.C. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The eNOS was further purified by HiTrap Q chromatography with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl (7Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9339-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The eNOS protein was stored at –80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EGTA. Protein concentration was determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard. CaM-bound eNOS was prepared as we previously reported (7Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9339-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt—eNOS (9.8 nm) and Akt (7.1 nm) were mixed with vehicle or HSP90 (45 nm) in the presence of CaM (300 nm) with 100 nm Ca2+ or 10 mm EGTA, and then left at room temperature for 10 min. In some experiments, HSP90 was pretreated with 1 μm GA. Phosphorylation of eNOS was initiated by addition of 50 μm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 in kinase reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time, the reaction was terminated by 10 μm staurosporine, which had no effect on eNOS activity, but completely inhibited Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation.In addition to eNOS phosphorylation, Akt activity was also evaluated by using the synthetic peptide substrate, crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG). Crosstide (50 μm) was preincubated with HSP90 in the same manner as above, and then was incubated with active Akt at 37 °C for 5 min in the kinase reaction buffer containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Akt-dependent incorporation of radioactivity to crosstide was measured with a liquid scintillation analyzer.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting of eNOS, HSP90, Akt, and CaM—eNOS complex was incubated with anti-eNOS antibody in the corresponding NOS reaction buffer at 4 °C for 2 h, and successively with protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight, unless otherwise stated. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight and then probed with the secondary antibody linked to peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized on x-ray film by an enhanced chemiluminescent method. Intensity of each band was measured by densitometry and then normalized to the corresponding control. Thereafter, relative intensity to the defined group as described in each figure legend was calculated.eNOS Activity Assay—NOS activity was measured as the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline, as described by Bredt and Snyder (16Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). Free calcium concentrations were calculated at pH 7.5 and 100 mm NaCl with K D (Ca2+-EGTA) of 27.9 nm at 37 °C, and the desired concentrations were achieved by mixing EGTA and Ca2+-EGTA (17Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). eNOS was mixed with the reaction buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NADPH, 20 μm FAD, 20 μm FMN, 20 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, and 300 nm CaM in the presence of 10 mm EGTA or 100 nm Ca2+. NOS reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μml-[3H]arginine, and incubation was done at 37 °C for 10 min, unless otherwise stated. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 5.5) buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mml-NAME. l-[3H]citrulline was separated through a Dowex AG50WX8 (Na+-form) column and then counted on a liquid scintillation analyzer. l-NAME-inhibitable activity was determined as specific eNOS activity.eNOS Activity and Complex Formation in Endothelial Cells—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were allowed to grow to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B and 10% fetal bovine serum. BAECs were starved in serum-free medium over night prior to experiments. The cells were pretreated with vehicle, 100 μm BAPTA-AM for 15 min or 10 μm GA for 1 h, and then stimulated with 1 nm VEGF, 200 nm insulin, or 200 nm PDGF for 10 min, unless otherwise stated. The cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, protease inhibitor mixture, and 5% PEG 400. The lysates were left on ice for 10 min and then were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were passed through a PD10 column to remove endogenous arginine. The void fractions were collected as cell extract and subjected to eNOS activity and immunoprecipitation studies.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical difference was evaluated by Student's t test. p value of < 0.05 was regarded as significant.RESULTSSynergistic Effect of HSP90 and Akt on eNOS Activation in Vitro—Recombinant bovine eNOS was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography as recently described (7Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9339-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 12–15 nmol/min/nmol protein in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ and 300 nm CaM. The eNOS preparation did not contain detectable HSP90, Akt, or CaM by immunoblotting.The time course of eNOS phosphorylation by Akt was examined for eNOS preincubated with active Akt, low Ca2+ (100 nm) and CaM in the presence or absence of HSP90 (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 was detectable at 2.5 min in the absence of HSP90 and proceeded linearly for 10 min, when it plateaued out. In contrast, in the presence of HSP90, eNOS phosphorylation was detectable by 1 min and increased dramatically in the first 5–10 min, after which a plateau level was reached. Both the initial rates and the final amount of Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation were significantly higher in the presence of HSP90 than in the absence of HSP90. Pretreatment of HSP90 with 10 μm GA inhibited the enhancement of Akt phosphorylation of eNOS by HSP90 almost completely (data not shown).The degree of Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 and the presence of potential eNOS-associated proteins were analyzed at physiological calcium levels in the absence or presence of HSP90 (Fig. 2A). When HSP90 was present in the reaction mixture, it was found associated with immunoprecipitated eNOS, and this association was not affected by the presence of inactive or active Akt. HSP90 increased CaM detected with eNOS whether or not Akt was present. As expected, eNOS at Ser-1179 was phosphorylated by active Akt, but not by inactive Akt. Active Akt was not detected with eNOS in the absence of HSP90, but both active and inactive Akt associated with eNOS in the presence of HSP90. The extent of eNOS phosphorylation by Akt was greater in the presence of HSP90 than in its absence (see Fig. 1). GA disrupted HSP90 binding to eNOS, and reduced the amount of CaM recovered with eNOS. GA also blocked the recruitment of Akt to the eNOS complex and eNOS Ser-1179 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2B, when eNOS, HSP90, and Akt were incubated, and HSP90 was then immunoprecipitated, both active and inactive Akt were present in the complex with HSP90 and eNOS. In addition, Akt was found associated with HSP90 in the absence of eNOS. Further studies were done to examine proteins remaining in the postimmunoprecipitation supernatant (data not shown). In these studies, eNOS (9.8 nm), HSP90 (45 nm), and Akt (7.1 nm) were mixed as in the studies shown in Fig. 2 and immunoprecipitated with either anti-eNOS or anti-HSP90 antibody using antibody concentrations chosen so that all detectable eNOS or HSP90 were precipitated, respectively. After immunoprecipitation of eNOS, HSP90 was easily detected in the residual supernatant, but only trace Akt was detected in the residual supernatant. After immunoprecipitation of HSP90, ∼10–15% of eNOS remained in the supernatant and Akt was not detected in the supernatant. These results indicate that virtually all Akt was bound tightly to HSP90 and incorporated into a ternary complex with eNOS. These data and those shown in Fig. 2 support that Akt is recovered in the eNOS complex only in the presence of HSP90, and that HSP90 is required for formation of the eNOS-HSP90-Akt ternary complex.Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of eNOS and associated proteins. A, eNOS and active or inactive Akt were incubated with vehicle, HSP90, or GA-treated HSP90 in the presence of 100 nm Ca2+ and 300 nm CaM. eNOS was then immunoprecipitated and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for eNOS, peNOS, HSP90, Akt, and CaM. B, HSP90 was incubated with eNOS and/or Akt, followed by immunoprecipitation of HSP90 and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for eNOS, HSP90, and Akt. Data are representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined whether the presence of HSP90 bound to eNOS alters the degree of eNOS phosphorylation by Akt (Fig. 3). Control experiments for these studies were performed first using the synthetic Akt substrate, crosstide, to assess the level of Akt activity in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA. Active Akt phosphorylated the crosstide peptide similarly in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA in both the absence and presence of HSP90 (EGTA without HSP90, 102.2 ± 3.7%; EGTA with HSP90, 103.4 ± 3.6%; Ca2+ without HSP90, 100 ± 5.0%; Ca2+ with HSP90, 99.3 ± 1%, n = 4). To exclude HSP90-mediated increases of CaM binding to eNOS, CaM was pre-bound to eNOS and then separated from residual free (unbound) CaM (7Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9339-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CaM-bound and -free eNOS were then mixed with active Akt in the presence or absence of HSP90. Akt phosphorylated only the CaM-bound form of eNOS, and CaM-bound eNOS was phosphorylated to a similar degree in the absence and presence of HSP90. Akt was unable to phosphorylate CaM-bound eNOS in the presence of EGTA or staurosporine (data not shown). Akt did not phosphorylate CaM-free eNOS even with HSP90 present, indicating that HSP90 binding to eNOS is not sufficient to support eNOS phosphorylation by Akt.Fig. 3Akt phosphorylation of CaM-free and CaM-bound eNOS in the absence or presence of HSP90. CaM-free or CaM-bound eNOS was prepared and preincubated with active Akt in the presence of vehicle (open bars) or HSP90 (filled bars), followed by incubation under kinase reaction conditions (37 °C, 10 min) in the presence of 10 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+, respectively. eNOS was then immunoprecipitated and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for eNOS, peNOS, HSP90, Akt, and CaM. eNOS phosphorylation is expressed as a percentage of basal phosphorylation for CaM-bound eNOS in the absence of HSP90. Data are mean ± S.E. for four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the same conditions as the previous experiments, eNOS activity next was assayed in the presence of HSP90, active Akt, or both and in the absence or presence of EGTA (Fig. 4). In all cases, eNOS activity was negligible in the presence of EGTA. eNOS activity was easily detectable in the presence of 100 nm Ca2+ and HSP90 increased the activity of eNOS in the presence of inactive Akt by 3.5-fold, similar to our recent study (7Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9339-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GA abolished the increase in eNOS activity observed with HSP90 and inactive Akt. Basal and HSP90-stimulated eNOS activity in the absence of any form of Akt were nearly identical to basal and HSP90-stimulated eNOS activity in the presence of inactive Akt, indicating that inactive Akt itself has virtually no effect on eNOS activity. Active Akt alone increased eNOS activity by 2-fold. The presence of both HSP90 and active Akt produced a synergistic (9-fold) increase in eNOS activity. GA also reversed the increase in eNOS activity observed in the presence of HSP90 and active Akt to the level of active Akt alone.Fig. 4Effects of HSP90 and Akt on eNOS activity. eNOS was incubated with vehicle or HSP90 and inactive or active Akt in the presence of 10 mm EGTA (open bars) or 100 nm Ca2+ (filled bars) for 10 min. In some cases, GA was included in the reaction mixture. eNOS activity is expressed as a percentage of basal activity, defined as the activity of eNOS in the presence of inactive Akt at 100 nm Ca2+. Data are mean ± S.E. for five determinations. * and #, p < 0.05 from eNOS with inactive Akt at 100 nm Ca2+, and the corresponding group without GA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of HSP90 in Insulin- and VEGF-induced eNOS Activation in Endothelial Cells—The in vitro studies above with purified proteins support that HSP90 facilitates Akt-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS, and that HSP90 and Akt coordinately promote eNOS activity at physiologic calcium concentrations. HSP90 has been shown to serve as a scaffold for Akt recruitment and to be required for activation of eNOS in VEGF-stimulated cells (14Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). VEGF activates eNOS in Ca2+-dependent manner (13Brouet A. Sonveaux P. Dessy C. Balligand J.-L. Feron O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast, insulin activation of eNOS, which is also mediated by Akt, is Ca2+-independent (18Montagnani M. Chen H. Barr V.A. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30392-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the effects of VEGF and insulin on eNOS activation and formation of an eNOS-HSP90-Akt ternary complex in intact BAECs. VEGF (1 nm) and insulin (200 nm) each caused a significant increase in eNOS activity (Fig. 5A). Consistent with previous reports (13Brouet A. Sonveaux P. Dessy C. Balligand J.-L. Feron O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Montagnani M. Chen H. Barr V.A. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30392-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA-AM completely inhibited VEGF-induced eNOS activation, but had no effect on insulin-induced eNOS activation. In response to both VEGF and insulin, HSP90, and Akt both were co-precipitated with phospho(Ser-1179)-eNOS (Fig. 5B). BAPTA-AM inhibited most eNOS-HSP90-Akt complex formation and eNOS phosphorylation induced by VEGF. However, BAPTA-AM did not decrease eNOS-HSP90-Akt complex formation and Ser-1179 phosphorylation by the Ca2+-independent agonist insulin. With both agonists, eNOS activation is therefore correlated directly with eNOS-HSP90-Akt complex formation and eNOS Ser-1179 phosphorylation. We next examined whether inhibition of HSP90 by GA abrogates the insulin-induced increase in eNOS activity in BAECs (Fig. 6A). Insulin caused eNOS Ser-1179 phosphorylation and an increase in both HSP90 and Akt associated with eNOS (Fig. 6B; see Fig. 5B). Akt in this complex was phosphorylated at Ser-473, its active form, as expected (pAkt, Fig. 6B). Interestingly, though insulin stimulation of eNOS was Ca2+-independent in these experiments, insulin also increased the bindin"

To investigate the processing mechanism in vivo, we isolated Arabidopsis mutants that accumulate detectable amounts of the precursors of the storage proteins, 12 S globulins and 2 S albumins, in their seeds. All six mutants isolated have a defect in the βVPE gene. VPE (vacuolar processing enzyme) is a cysteine proteinase with substrate specificity toward an asparagine residue. We further generated various mutants lacking different VPE isoforms: αVPE, βVPE, and/or γVPE. More than 90% of VPE activity is abolished in the βvpe-3 seeds, and no VPE activity is detected in the αvpe-1/βvpe-3/γvpe-1 seeds. The triple mutant seeds accumulate no properly processed mature storage proteins. Instead, large amounts of storage protein precursors are found in the seeds of this mutant. In contrast to βvpe-3 seeds, which accumulate both precursors and mature storage proteins, the other single (αvpe-1 and γvpe-1) and double (αvpe-1/γvpe-1) mutants accumulate no precursors in their seeds at all. Therefore, the vegetative VPEs, αVPE and γVPE, are not necessary for precursor processing in the presence of βVPE, but partly compensates for the deficiency in βVPE in βvpe-3 seeds. In the absence of functional VPEs, a proportion of pro2S albumin molecules are alternatively cleaved by aspartic proteinase. This cleavage by aspartic proteinase is promoted by the initial processing of pro2S albumins by VPE. Our overall results suggest that seed-type βVPE is most essential for the processing of storage proteins, and that the vegetative-type VPEs and aspartic proteinase complement βVPE activity in this processing.

Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 77-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During seed maturation, storage proteins are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum as proprotein precursors and are then transported into PSVs by a vesicle-mediated pathway (2Robinson D.G. Baumer M. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 659-667Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Upon arrival at the vacuoles, the proproteins are converted into their respective mature forms by limited proteolysis at specific sites. The conversion of each storage protein is known to occur at the C-terminal side of an asparagine residue in the proprotein, suggesting a single type of proteinase that has substrate specificity toward an asparagine residue is responsible for the processing of storage protein precursors (3Hara-Nishimura I.

Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we identified an enzyme responsible for the maturation of various storage proteins and designated it vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE). In vitro processing assays using purified VPE and seed protein precursors showed that VPE is capable of processing several seed proteins, including the 2 S albumins and 11 S globulins, of the pumpkin and castor bean (5Hara-Nishimura I.

VPEs exhibit substrate specificity toward an asparagine residue, the amino acid well conserved at the P1 position in the processing sites of storage protein precursors in many plant species. Therefore, we proposed that the VPE-mediated processing system plays a central role in the maturation of various seed proteins in PSVs (3Hara-Nishimura I. Shimada T. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 145: 632-640Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Hara-Nishimura I. Maeshima M. Robinson A.D.G. Rogers J.C. Vacuolar Compartments in Plants.

Parasitol. 1989; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Plant VPE homologs are separated into two subfamilies: one specific to seeds and the other specific to vegetative organs (9Hara-Nishimura I. Kinoshita T. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 668-674Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Muntz K. Shutovb A.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 340-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have identified three VPE genes in Arabidopsis, αVPE, βVPE, and γVPE (15Kinoshita T. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1555-1562PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kinoshita T. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis and histochemical analysis with β-glucuronidase reporter constructs showed that αVPE and γVPE are expressed in vegetative organs, whereas βVPE is expressed in seeds (17Kinoshita T. Yamada K. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1999; 19: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently, a fourth VPE, designated δVPE, was identified and shown to be expressed in maturing seed at an early stage (18Gruis D.F. Selinger D.A. Curran J.M. Jung R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2863-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They reported Arabidopsis mutants in which the βVPE or δVPE gene was disrupted by the insertion of a transposon. Surprisingly, most 12 S globulin and 2 S albumin proteins are processed normally in βvpe seeds, and only a small proportion of the storage proteins remain as unprocessed or partially processed forms. In the δvpe seeds, no detectable change was observed in the processing of storage proteins. On the basis of these results, Gruis et al. (18Gruis D.F. Selinger D.A. Curran J.M. Jung R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2863-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggested that other proteinases are also involved in the processing of storage proteins in Arabidopsis.Arabidopsis seeds contain two types of storage proteins, four 12 S globulins (also referred to as cruciferins) and five 2 S albumins (also called napins). Proglobulins are cleaved at an Asn-Gly site to produce α- and β-subunits, which are linked by a disulfide bond (19Pang P.P. Pruitt R.E. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 805-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This processing site is conserved among all four known 12 S globulins. The processing of the 2 S albumins is more complex than that of the 12 S globulins. Mature 2 S albumins are also composed of two subunits, small and large, which are linked by disulfide bonds (20Krebbers E. Herdies L. De Clercq A. Leemans J. Van Damme J. Segura M. Gheysen G. Van Montagu M. Vandekerckhove J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the maturation of the 2 S albumins, the pro2S albumins are cleaved at no less than four sites, resulting in the removal of three propeptide regions: the N-terminal processed fragment (ATPF), the internal processed fragment (IPF), and the C-terminal processed fragment.The mechanisms for processing storage proteins have been studied mainly with biochemical analyses in vitro. So far, to our knowledge, no forward genetic approach has been taken to identify factor(s) involved in the processing of seed storage proteins in PSVs. We undertook a genetic analysis of the genes responsible for this processing in Arabidopsis. Six mutants that abnormally accumulate storage protein precursors were isolated by screening about 28,000 lines. All six mutants had a defect in the βVPE gene, indicating that βVPE is involved in the processing of storage proteins. Unexpectedly, we found that the vegetative-type VPEs, αVPE and γVPE, function in this processing, together with βVPE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Materials and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0 and Col-6) and Wassilewskija-2 (Ws-2) were used as wild-type plants. Seeds of Arabidopsis were surface-sterilized and then sown on soil or onto 0.5% Gellan Gum (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) that contained 1% sucrose and Murasige-Skoog's medium and were grown at 22 °C under continuous light.Isolation of Arabidopsis Mutants That Accumulated Precursors of 12 S Globulins and 2 S Albumins—We screened Arabidopsis T-DNA tagged lines of three different populations. One contained 2,700 lines (Col-0) that we prepared with Ti plasmid pBI121 containing several different insertions. The other two were K. Feldmann's lines (CS6501, Ws-2, 6,500 lines) and T. Jack's lines (CS31087, Col-6, 11,300 lines). Dry seeds (1 mg) from the mixture of 1–20 lines were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then to immunoblot with anti-12 S globulin and anti-2 S albumin to detect the storage protein precursors. We isolated the following six mutants accumulating the precursors. βvpe-1 was isolated from our T-DNA lines. βvpe-2 (CS13124), βvpe-3 (CS13632), and βvpe-4 (CS12327) were isolated from Feldmann's lines. βvpe-5 (CS30066) and βvpe-6 (CS30359) were isolated from Jack's lines.Preparation of Antibodies—A cDNA encoding the region of βVPE (amino acids 76–213) was inserted into pET32 (Novagen, Madison, WI) and Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the plasmid. A cDNA encoding a preproprotein precursor of 2 S albumin (At2S2) of Arabidopsis was inserted into pET32 (Novagen) and E. coli BL-21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the plasmid. The His-tagged proteins were purified with a HiTrap chelating column. The purified proteins were used for production of specific antibodies against βVPE or 2 S albumin by the previously described method (21Shimada T. Watanabe E. Tamura K. Hayashi Y. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each of the purified proteins (1 mg) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Alternatively, dry seeds of Arabidopsis were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie blue staining. The protein bands corresponding to α-subunit and β-subunit of 12 S globulin were cut out from the gel and emulsed with complete Freund's adjuvant. Each emulsion was injected subcutaneously into a rabbit. After 3 weeks, two booster injections with incomplete adjuvant were given at 7-day intervals. One week after the booster injection, blood was drawn and the antiserum was prepared. The antibodies prepared against βVPE were purified using a Mab TrapTM G II column (Amersham Biosciences).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Dry seeds of wild-types or mutants were homogenized in a sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The homogenates were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter (0.22 μm; Nihon Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) in a semidry-electroblotting system. The blots were incubated with 3% (w/v) skim milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% (w/w) Tween 20, and then incubated with antibodies against each of 2 S albumin (diluted 10,000-fold), 12 S globulin (diluted 50,000-fold), and βVPE (diluted 5,000-fold) in the same buffer for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies against rabbit IgG (diluted 5,000-fold; Amersham Biosciences) were used as second antibodies. Signals were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).N-terminal Sequencing and Treatment with Pyroglutamate Aminopeptidase—Proteins that were separated on the blots with Coomassie blue staining were subjected to automatic Edman degradation on a gas-phase sequence analyzer (model 477; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In the case of the 51-kDa protein found in seeds of bvpe-3, the blot was treated with 0.1 μg pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) in 50 mm sodium-phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA for6hat70 °C. After washing with water, the blot was applied to the sequence analyzer.Determination of Mutation Sites of Each βVPE Mutant—The genomic DNAs were isolated from rosette leaves of wild-type and mutant plants. DNA fragments corresponding to the βVPE gene were amplified by PCR using a primer set: F4, 5′-CCAAGCTTAACTTAGTTTTAGAGGAAAC-3′ and scr3′UTR, 5′-CTGATGCTGACACACTTAGC-3′. Nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined with a DNA sequencer (model 310, Applied Biosystems) using specific primers for βVPE gene and Bigdye terminater kit (Applied Biosystems).Isolation of αVPE Mutants, βVPE Mutants, and γVPE Mutants by PCR-based Screening—We isolated T-DNA insertion mutants of each VPE from a large population of Arabidopsis plants provided by Arabidosis Knockout Facility (AKF) and Kazusa DNA Institute by PCR-based screening. For screening the AKF lines of A. thaliana (Ws-2), we used the following primers: αVPE-FW, 5′-AGCTTAGTCAACGGATTCTCGTGTTTCAA-3′; αVPE-RV, 5′-CGTAAACGCTATGACTCCTCTAAGCCTTA-3′; βVPE-FW, 5′-CGTCGACATCACAACCATTTTAATTCGTA-3′; βVPE-RV, 5′-CTGATGCTGACACACTTAGCTGATCACTA-3′; JL202, 5′-CATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3′ for T-DNA left border and XR2, 5′-TGGGAAAACCTGGCGTTACCCAACTTAAT-3′ for T-DNA right border. Two mutants of αVPE (αvpe-1 and αvpe-2) and two mutants of βVPE (βvpe-7 and βvpe-8) were isolated. αvpe-1 had a T-DNA insertion at the first exon. βvpe-7 had a T-DNA insertion at the first intron. αvpe-2 and βvpe-8 had a T-DNA insertion at the promoter region of each gene.For screening the lines of A. thaliana (Col-0) of Kazusa DNA Institute, we used the following primers: γVPE-yeF, 5′-CCGGATCCATGACACGTGTCTCCGTCGG-3′; γVPE-expR, 5′-CCCCCGGGTCTATGCACTGAATCCACGG-3′; P00LB, 5′-ATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC-3′ for T-DNA left border; and P00RB, 5′-CTAGATCCGAAACTATCAGTG-3′ for T-DNA right border. One mutant of γVPE (γvpe-1) was isolated. γvpe-1 had a T-DNA insertion at the third exon. To check the genotypes, we used specific primers: γVPE-FW, 5′-AGTGGGAAGGTTGTGGATAG-3′ and γVPE-RV, 5′-CTTTTCCCAAAAATGAACAAG-3′.Generation of Double and Triple Mutants of VPEs—To generate double and triple mutants of VPEs, we reciprocally crossed the VPE mutants as follows. A homozygous plant of αvpe-1 was crossed with a homozygous plant of γvpe-1. We isolated a homozygous plant of αvpe-1/γvpe-1 double mutant from F2 progeny by PCR-based genotyping. The homozygous plant of αvpe-1/γvpe-1 double mutant was crossed with a homozygous plant of βvpe-3. Homozygous plants of βvpe-3/γvpe-1 double mutant and αvpe-1/βvpe-3/γvpe-1 triple mutant were isolated from F2 or F3 progenies. These mutants had a mixed background of Columbia and Ws-2. To obtain a αvpe-1/βvpe-3 double mutant, we crossed a homozygous plant of αvpe-1 with a homozygous plant of βvpe-3. A homozygous plant of αvpe-1/βvpe-3 double mutant was isolated from F2 progeny. This double mutant had a Ws-2 background. To identify the βvpe-3 genotype, we used the dCAPS method. A DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with the genome DNA and the following primers: βVPE-scrF, 5′-TTCTCGCTGCCATGGCTAAG-3′, and β3-dCAPS, 5′-TAATCAATTCGTTGGACACTATGTGAAGCT-3′. The PCR product was digested with HindIII. The amplified DNA fragment from genome DNA containing βvpe-3 allele was sensitive to HindIII, whereas the amplified DNA fragment from genome DNA containing wild-type βVPE allele was resistant.Assay of VPE Activity—VPE activity was measured essentially as described previously (22Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We used a fluorescent VPE-specific substrate, Ac-AAN-MCA (acetyl-glutamyl-seryl-glutamyl-asparagine α-(4-metylcoumaryl-7-amide); Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan). The crude enzyme prepared from dry seeds was incubated with 100 μm Ac-AANMCA in an acidic buffer (100 mm sodium-acetate (pH 5.5), and 100 mm dithiothreitol) for2hat20 °C. The fluorescence intensity was measured using GENios (TECAN Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence was monitored under an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.Measurement of Aspartic Protease Activity by Capillary Electrophoresis—We chemically synthesized two peptides, PSLDDEFDLEDDIENPQGPQ for At2S2 and PSLDDEFDFEGPQ for At2S3, and used them as the substrates. These sequences were derived from the sequences around IPF of 2 S albumins. The reaction mixture contained 6.0 nmol of each peptide and the crude extract from dry seeds with or without 30 mm pepstatin A in 5 μl of 20 mm sodium-acetate (pH 3.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 9 h at 37 °C, and the products of the reaction were subjected to analytical capillary electrophoresis (HP3D, Hewlett-Packard GmbH, Germany) at 30 °C and 20 kV in 10 mm sodium-borate buffer (pH 9.0). Electrophoresis was monitored in terms of absorbance at 200 nm.Light Microscopic Analysis—Dry seeds from wild-type (WT; Ws-2) and the mutant (αvpe-1/βvpe-3/γvpe-1) plants were vacuum-infiltrated for 1 h with a fixative that consisted of 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.06 m sucrose in 0.05 m sodium-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). The tissues were then cut into slices of less than 1 mm in thickness with a razor blade and subjected to fixation, dehydration, and embedding by the previously described method (6Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thin sections were cut on a microtome and were stained with toluidine blue and were inspected with a light microscope (Axioplan 2 imaging, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired by a color charge-coupled device camera (DXM1200, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).RESULTSAbnormal Accumulation of Storage Protein Precursors Is Caused by a Defect in the βVPE Gene in Arabidopsis Seeds—We screened about 28,000 T-DNA-tagged lines of Arabidopsis to isolate mutants with a defect in the maturation of seed storage proteins. Dry seeds of these lines were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies directed against a major storage protein, either 2 S albumin or 12 S globulin. We selected six mutant lines that accumulated abnormal larger forms of storage proteins in the dry seeds.Previously (3Hara-Nishimura I. Shimada T. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 145: 632-640Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we reported that storage protein precursors are converted into the respective mature forms by the action of seed-type VPE. Therefore, the accumulation of larger forms of storage proteins might be caused by a defect in the maturation machinery, such as in βVPE. To clarify whether βVPE is present in the mutant seeds, we used immunoblot analysis with anti-βVPE antibodies. Two βVPE bands of 27 and 37 kDa were detected on a blot of proteins from the dry seeds of wild-type (Col-0 and Ws-2) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, neither of these bands was detected in the seeds of any isolated mutant, indicating that functional βVPE is lacking in these mutants (Fig. 1A).Four mutants have a mutation in the βVPE gene, as shown in Fig. 1B. A complementation test showed that all six mutants have a defect at the same locus. Therefore, they were designated βvpe-1 to βvpe-6. Interestingly, all the mutations appear in the region containing the first exon and the first intron of the βVPE gene. βvpe-2 has a nonsense mutation (AAG for Lys-3 to TAG stop codon). A GA insertion in the first exon causes a frameshift in βvpe-5. It appears that no functional βVPE polypeptide is produced in βvpe-2 or βvpe-5, consistent with the result of immunoblot analysis. The two mutants, βvpe-3 and βvpe-4, have the same transversion mutation, which causes an amino acid substitution (CAG for Gln-68 to AAG for Lys). βvpe-3 and βvpe-4 also lack the two βVPE bands of 27 and 37 kDa on immunoblotting. Gln-68 in βVPE is highly conserved in the VPE family, suggesting that this residue is important for the protein's stability. Using reversed genetics, we also isolated two T-DNA-tagged mutants, βvpe-7 and βvpe-8. βvpe-7 has a T-DNA insertion in the first intron, and βvpe-8 has an insertion in the promoter region. They also fail to produce the two βVPE bands on immunoblots (data not shown).Proper Processing of Storage Protein Precursors Is Partially Abolished in βvpe-3 Seeds— Fig. 2A shows a comparison of seed storage protein profiles of wild-type (Ws-2) and βvpe-3 seeds on an SDS gel with Coomassie blue staining. The wild-type seeds accumulated the α- and β-subunits of the 12 S globulins and the large and small subunits of the 2 S albumins (Fig. 2A, WT). In contrast, the βvpe-3 seeds abnormally accumulated 15-, 16-, 49-, 51-, and 54-kDa proteins in addition to the normal mature proteins (Fig. 2A, βvpe-3). The seeds of the other βvpe mutants also exhibited similar protein profiles (data not shown), although βvpe-2, βvpe-3, and βvpe-4 with Ws-2 background accumulated a larger amount of the abnormal forms than βvpe-1, βvpe-5, and βvpe-6 with Col background.Fig. 2Abnormal accumulation of storage protein precursors in the seeds of the βvpe-3 mutant. A, homogenates from dry seeds of wild-type (WT, Ws-2) and βvpe-3 plants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie blue staining. Wild-type seeds accumulated small subunits (S) and large subunits (L) of 2 S albumins (2S) and the α-subunits (α) and β-subunits (β) of 12 S globulins (G). The βvpe-3 seeds additionally and abnormally accumulated 15-, 16-, 49-, 51-, and 54-kDa proteins. B, the determined N-terminal amino acid sequences of the proteins that accumulate in the βvpe-3 seeds. The 15- and 16-kDa proteins are non-processed forms of the 2 S albumins, At2S3 and At2S4, and the 49-, 51-, and 54-kDa proteins are proglobulins. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 21- and 22-kDa β-subunits of 12 S globulins that accumulated in the βvpe-3 seeds were also determined. The designation of each 12 S globulin and 2 S albumin protein is indicated in parentheses. <Q, pyroglutamate. Molecular masses are indicated on the left in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the additional proteins accumulated in the βvpe-3 seeds were determined, as shown in Fig. 2B. The N-terminal sequences of the 15- and 16-kDa proteins show that they were derived from the 2 S albumins, At2S3 and At2S4, respectively. A typical proprotein precursor of 2 S albumin, pro2S albumin, is composed of an ATPF, a small subunit followed by an IPF, and a large subunit. One of the 16-kDa proteins was determined to be an abnormally processed precursor of At2S3. Processing occurred at the peptide bond between Phe and Glu, which is inconsistent with the substrate specificity of VPE (Fig. 2B). The 15-kDa protein was a precursor of At2S3 after the successful removal of the ATPF by cleavage of the peptide bond between Asn and Pro, which is consistent with the substrate specificity of VPE (Fig. 2B). Another 16-kDa protein was also a precursor of At2S4 after the successful removal of the ATPF by cleavage of the peptide bond between Asn and Pro (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the βvpe-3 seeds accumulate several 2 S albumin precursor forms with no ATPF. Another enzyme(s) with the same substrate specificity as βVPE might be involved in the removal of the ATPFs.The N-terminal sequences of the 49-, 51-, and 54-kDa proteins are consistent with the sequences immediately following the co-translational cleavage sites of the signal peptides of the 12 S globulins, At12S2, At12S4, and At12S, respectively (Fig. 2B). On the basis of their molecular masses, these proteins are the proprotein precursors of the 12 S globulins. This result indicates that the proper processing of the precursors of 12 S globulins is abolished in the βvpe-3 seeds.In contrast to the accumulation of some precursor forms of the 2 S albumins and 12 S globulins, large amounts of storage proteins accumulated as the mature forms in the βvpe-3 seeds. This raises the question of whether the mature forms of the 12 S globulins were produced by processing at the proper site between Asn and Gly in the βvpe-3 seeds. To answer this, we determined the N-terminal sequences of the 21- and 22-kDa β-subunits of the 12 S globulins of wild-type and βvpe-3 seeds. The sequences of the β-subunits of the βvpe-3 12 S globulins correspond to those of the normally processed β-subunits of the wild-type 12 S globulins (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that another enzyme(s) with the same substrate specificity as βVPE is involved in the processing of storage protein precursors.Vegetative-type VPEs, αVPE and γVPE, Are also Involved in the Processing of Seed Storage Protein Precursors—The above results imply that vegetative VPEs are cooperatively involved in the processing of storage protein precursors together with seed-type βVPE. To investigate this possibility, we isolated the αvpe and γvpe mutants from a large population of T-DNA-tagged lines of Arabidopsis. The αvpe-1 mutant has a single T-DNA insertion in the first exon of the αVPE gene on chromosome 2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The γvpe-1 mutant has tandem T-DNA insertions in the third exon of the γVPE gene on chromosome 4 (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3Arabidopsis mutants, αvpe-1 and γvpe-1, which have a T-DNA insertion in the αVPE and γVPE genes, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1987960919,"CD44 is an adhesion molecule that serves as a cell surface receptor for several extracellular matrix components, including hyaluronan (HA). The proteolytic cleavage of CD44 from the cell surface plays a critical role in the migration of tumor cells. Although this cleavage can be induced by certain stimuli such as phorbol ester and anti-CD44 antibodies in vitro, the physiological inducer of CD44 cleavage in vivo is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that HA oligosaccharides of a specific size range induce CD44 cleavage from tumor cells. Fragmented HA containing 6-mers to 14-mers enhanced CD44 cleavage dose-dependently by interacting with CD44, whereas a large polymer HA failed to enhance CD44 cleavage, although it bound to CD44. Examination using uniformly sized HA oligosaccharides revealed that HAs smaller than 36 kDa significantly enhanced CD44 cleavage. In particular, the 6.9-kDa HA (36-mers) not only enhanced CD44 cleavage but also promoted tumor cell motility, which was completely inhibited by an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody. These results raise the possibility that small HA oligosaccharides, which are known to occur in various tumor tissues, promote tumor invasion by enhancing the tumor cell motility that may be driven by CD44 cleavage.

The cell surface CD44 is proteolytically cleaved at the extracellular domain by membrane-bound metalloproteases such as MT1-MMP (3Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar); this cleavage has been suggested to play an important role in tumor cell migration along extracellular matrix components (4Okamoto I.

Indeed, enhanced CD44 cleavage has been reported in invasive tumors such as gliomas, breast carcinomas, non-small cell lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas, and ovarian carcinomas (6Okamoto I. Tsuiki H. Kenyon L.C. Godwin A.K. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Guha A. Matsumoto M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Wong A.J. Am. J.

Dennis K. Peschon J.J. Chandrasekaran R. Mikecz K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), can potently induce CD44 cleavage in vitro, the physiological inducer of CD44 cleavage in vivo remains uncharacterized.HA is a nonsulfated linear glycosaminoglycan that consists of repeating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (9Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that HA not only acts as an extracellular matrix component but also participates in a number of physiological events such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (10Toole B.P. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). HA also plays a role in pathological conditions, including cancer. An increased synthesis of HA has been reported in various malignant tumors (11Ropponen K. Tammi M. Parkkinen J. Eskelinen M. Tammi R. Lipponen P. Ågren U. Alhava E. Kosma V.M.

Ishiguro N. Machida K. Kurata H. Thant A.A. Senga T. Matsuda S. Kimata K. Iwata H. Hamaguchi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HA forms a protective barrier around tumor cells, which may help the tumor cells to evade immune surveillance (15Toole B.P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 37R-42RCrossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although HA usually exists as a high molecular mass polymer (in excess of 1000 kDa) as a component of the extracellular matrix under physiological conditions (9Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar), HA of a much lower molecular mass is detected in association with certain pathological conditions, such as inflammation (16Balazs E.A. Watson D. Duff I.F. Roseman S. Arthritis Rheum. 1967; 10: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and tumors (17Dahl I.M. Laurent T.C.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the low molecular mass HA fragments can induce a variety of biological events, such as chemokine gene expression (21McKee C.M. Penno M.B. Cowman M.

High levels of angiogenic HA fragments are detected in several human tumors, such as bladder cancers (19Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 773-777PubMed Google Scholar), prostate cancers (20Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1988; 62: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and interestingly, high levels of hyaluronidase activity are also found in bladder and prostate cancer (20Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that the autoregulatory degradation of HA in tumor tissues may enhance tumor invasion and metastasis.These reports have led us to speculate that HA and/or its degradation products may be involved in the CD44 cleavage that enhances tumor motility. We herein demonstrate that small HA oligosaccharides but not large HA polymers efficiently induce CD44 cleavage and also promote tumor cell migration in a CD44-dependent fashion. Our results suggest that HA fragments may serve as a physiological inducer of CD44 cleavage in vivo and reinforce the notion that HA degradation products play an important role in tumor invasion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—A rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb), anti-CD44cyto pAb, which is directed against the cytoplasmic domain of CD44, was raised as described previously (4Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). An anti-human CD44 mAb, BRIC235, was purchased from the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (Bristol, UK). An anti-β-tubulin mAb was purchased from Calbiochem (Cambridge, MA). A mouse IgG was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from American Qualex (San Clemente, CA). HA oligosaccharides (HA-2, HA-4, HA-6, HA-8, HA-10, HA-12, 6.9-kDa HA, and 36-kDa HA) and fluorescein-conjugated HA (FL-HA) were generously provided by Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan) (31Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Human umbilical cord HA that mainly consists of 200-kDa HA and human umbilical cord HA that mainly consists of 1000-kDa HA were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA) and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Sheep testicular hyaluronidase and hyaluronidase from Streptococcus dysgalactiae (hyaluronidase SD) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Seikagaku Kogyo Co., respectively. Carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) was from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), and PMA was from Sigma-Aldrich.Cell Culture—The human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) 100× nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Fluorescein Isothiocyanate Conjugation to BRIC235—The BRIC235 mAb solution was first dialyzed against a 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.2. A 400-μl aliquot of 1.4 mg/ml BRIC235 was incubated with 28 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 4 h at room temperature. The solution was applied to a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide. The eluates were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm.BRIC235 Fab Generation and Purification—BRIC235 Fab fragments were generated and purified using the ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the BRIC235 antibody solution was extensively dialyzed against a 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm EDTA buffer at pH 7.0. After concentration to ∼20 mg/ml, the antibody was digested by incubation with immobilized papain for 5 h at 37 °C. The Fab fragments were then separated using a protein A column and dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C.Preparation of HA Fragments—The 200-kDa HA (200 mg) was digested with 3,600 units of sheep testicular hyaluronidase at 37 °C for 19 h, and the mixture of HA fragments was separated on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.5 cm × 100 cm; Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated with 1 m NaCl containing 10% ethanol. The column fractions were applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (1 cm × 50 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with distilled water for desalting, and the eluates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC analysis was performed with the GULLIVER system (Nippon Bunko Engineering, Tokyo, Japan) on a YMC-Pack PA-03 column (YMC, Wilmington, NC; 4.6 mm × 250 mm) using a programmed linear gradient elution from 16 mm to 1 m NaH2PO4 over 70 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The eluates were monitored by absorbance at 210 nm. The HA fragments (10 mg) ranging from HA 6-mers to 14-mers were digested with 0.1 unit of hyaluronidase SD at 37 °C for 3 h and then applied to the Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with distilled water for desalting. The eluates were analyzed by HPLC as described above. In some experiments, hyaluronidase SD was heat-inactivated by boiling before use.CD44 Cleavage Assay—MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well, cultured overnight at 37 °C, and then incubated with 10 μm MG132 for 30 min at 37 °C to inhibit the secondary cleavage of the CD44 intracellular domain (32Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with HA for 1 h or with 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm MG132, and the culture supernatants were collected for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cells were lysed with SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Samples extracted from equal numbers of cells were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. The filter was blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA and then incubated with anti-CD44cyto pAb or with anti-β-tubulin mAb. The filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to detect the anti-CD44cyto pAb or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect the anti-β-tubulin mAb. The secondary Abs were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The densitometric analysis of the bands was performed on an image analysis program (NIH Image; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For ELISA, the culture supernatants from the stimulated cells were filtered using a 0.22-μm Millipore filter (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) before analysis. Soluble human CD44 in the samples was quantified using a soluble CD44H ELISA kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Flow Cytometry—The binding of FL-HA to the cell surface was determined as reported previously using an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL) (33Ishiwatari-Hayasaka H. Fujimoto T. Osawa T. Hirama T. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1258-1264PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of FL-HA to CD44 was verified by its inhibition with the anti-CD44 mAb BRIC235. The binding of the HAs to the cell surface was analyzed by observing the inhibition of FL-HA binding upon the addition of the HAs as follows. One million cells were incubated with serial dilutions of the HAs for 20 min at 4 °C, then 1.0 μg/ml of FL-HA was added, and the cells were incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C, followed by two washes with cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/well on 1000-kDa HA-coated cover glasses placed in 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The medium was changed to serum-free RPMI medium containing the same supplements as above, and then the cells were incubated with or without 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min or 6.9-kDa HA for 1 h. In this assay, the cells were not pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor MG132. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min followed by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with the anti-CD44cyto pAb for 1 h at room temperature and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the samples were mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and visualized with an LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Migration Assay—Cell migration was analyzed using 24-well Costar Transwell chambers (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) containing polycarbonate filters with an 8-μm pore size. Both sides of the filter were coated with 100 μg/ml of 1000-kDa HA. The lower compartment of the chamber was filled with 600 μl of RPMI medium containing 0.1% BSA, and the filters were placed into the chamber. MIA PaCa-2 cells at a logarithmic phase of growth were detached by brief exposure to trypsin-EDTA and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI medium containing 0.1% BSA. A 100-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was added to the upper compartment. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h so that the cells become attached to the filter, the cells were incubated with or without 10 μg/ml BRIC235 or mouse IgG in RPMI medium containing 0.1% BSA 20 min prior to and during the migration assay. Finally, HAs or PBS were added to the upper compartment of the wells at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The chambers were subsequently incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. As in the immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were not treated with MG132. After the cells on the upper side of the filters were gently wiped off, the filters were fixed in methanol, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted on glass slides. The cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filters were counted under a light microscope. The number of cells in five defined high power fields (×200) was counted, and the average was determined. Each assay was performed five times.RESULTSHA Fragments Induce CD44 Cleavage in a Human Pancreatic Carcinoma Cell Line, MIA PaCa-2—The degradation products of HA have been shown to have a variety of biological activities in CD44-expressing cells (21McKee C.M.

We therefore examined their ability to induce CD44 cleavage using a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, MIA PaCa-2, which has been reported to show substantial CD44 cleavage (3Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, MIA PaCa-2 cells expressed CD44 abundantly (Fig. 1A) and bound FL-HA; this binding was completely blocked by an anti-CD44 mAb, BRIC235, indicating that these cells require CD44 for HA binding. In agreement with previous reports (4Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H.

The enhancement of CD44 cleavage upon stimulation with PMA was confirmed by ELISA (Fig. 1C).When MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with HA fragments that mainly consisted of 6–14-mers (frHA) (Fig. 2A), they showed enhanced CD44 cleavage in an HA concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when the cells were treated with the undigested 200-kDa HA, which mainly consisted of polymers of 1000-mers or larger, no increase in CD44 cleavage was observed (Fig. 2C). Basically identical results were obtained using the human glioblastoma cell line U251MG and the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line Panc-1 (data not shown), indicating that small HA fragments, but not large HA polymers, have the ability to enhance CD44 cleavage in various tumor cell types.Fig. 2CD44 cleavage is enhanced by fragmented HA but not by 200-kDa HA. A, HPLC profile of frHA. 200-kDa HA was digested with sheep testicular hyaluronidase. The degraded HA fragments were then analyzed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of monosaccharide units in each oligosaccharide peak is indicated above each peak. B, MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured overnight as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and then treated with MG132, followed by incubation with (lane 1) or without (lane 2) 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min, or with frHA at the indicated concentration for 1 h (lanes 3–7). The cells were lysed, and the samples were subjected to immunoblotting as described in Fig. 1.

This was also the case with the HA fragment-induced CD44 cleavage, as shown in Fig. 3. When completely digested to disaccharides by hyaluronidase derived from S. dysgalactiae (Fig. 3A), the HA fragments up-regulated CD44 cleavage only marginally, if at all (Fig. 3C), whereas the HA preparation that had been treated with heat-inactivated hyaluronidase and hence still contained undigested HA fragments (Fig. 3B) up-regulated the CD44 cleavage to a level comparable with that induced by untreated HA fragments (Fig. 3C). These results clearly indicate that CD44 cleavage is induced by HA fragments but not by HA disaccharides and also exclude the possibility that non-HA molecules that might have been present in the frHA sample induced the CD44 cleavage.Fig. 3Fragmented HA loses its ability to induce CD44 cleavage upon digestion with intact hyaluronidase but not with boiled hyaluronidase. A and B, HPLC profiles of hyaluronidase-treated HA preparations. The frHA was treated with intact hyaluronidase SD (A) or boiled hyaluronidase SD (B). The resulting HA fragments, frHA-HAase and frHA-HAase/boiled, were analyzed by HPLC. Note that frHA was completely digested to disaccharides by intact hyaluronidase but remained undigested with heat-inactivated hyaluronidase.

As shown in Fig. 4 (A and C), HA 2- and 4-mers had only marginal CD44 cleavage up-regulating activity, whereas HA 6-mers and larger fragments induced CD44 cleavage in a manner that was apparently dependent on the size of the fragment. In contrast, HA preparations of much larger sizes, i.e. 36, 200, and 1000 kDa, uniformly failed to up-regulate the CD44 cleavage (Fig. 4, B and C). These results show that only HA fragments of a certain size range can up-regulate the CD44 cleavage.Fig. 4CD44 cleavage is induced by uniformly sized small HA saccharides but not by large polymers.

The sequence encodes a 960-amino acid protein with significant homology to placental leucine aminopeptidase and adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase. The predicted L-RAP contains the HEXXH(X)18E zinc-binding motif, which is characteristic of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that L-RAP forms a distinct subfamily with placental leucine aminopeptidase and adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase in the M1 family. Immunocytochemical analysis indicates that L-RAP is located in the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Among various synthetic substrates tested, L-RAP revealed a preference for arginine, establishing that the enzyme is a novel arginine aminopeptidase with restricted substrate specificity. In addition to natural hormones such as angiotensin III and kallidin, L-RAP cleaved various N-terminal extended precursors to major histocompatibility complex class I-presented antigenic peptides. Like other proteins involved in antigen presentation, L-RAP is induced by interferon-γ. These results indicate that L-RAP is a novel aminopeptidase that can trim the N-terminal extended precursors to antigenic peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Aminopeptidases hydrolyze N-terminal amino acids of proteins or peptide substrates. They are distributed widely in animal and plant tissues, as well as in bacteria and fungi, suggesting that they play important roles in various biological processes. They are essential for protein maturation, the activation, modulation, and degradation of bioactive peptides, and the determination of protein stability (1Taylor A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition, several aminopeptidases are known as differentiation antigens and control cell proliferation and differentiation (2Look A.T. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Peiper S.C. J. Clin.

Subsequently we cloned a cDNA encoding adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP), which is also designated as puromycin-insensitive leucine-specific aminopeptidase or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-aminopeptidase (ERAP)-1, as a highly homologous protein to P-LAP (7Hattori A.

Recent evidence facilitates new insights into the biological significance of the M1 family of aminopeptidases. It was reported that aminopeptidase A plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure by regulating the renin-angiotensin system in the brain (21Reaux A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. David C. Zini S. Roques B. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13415-13420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). P-LAP/oxytocinase, which is also designated as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, was shown to be the angiotensin IV receptor and may play a role in the memory retention and retrieval (22Albiston A.L. McDowall S.G. Matsacos D. Sim P. Clune E. Mustafa T. Lee J. Mendelsohn F.A.O. Simpson R.J. Connolly L.M. Chai S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48623-48626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others reported that A-LAP/ERAP1 is a final processing enzyme of the precursors of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-presented antigenic peptides (9Saric T. Chang S.-C. Hattori A. York I.A. Markant S. Rock K.L. Tsujimoto M. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 16Serwold T. Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This enzyme was also shown to play roles in blood pressure regulation and angiogenesis (23Miyashita H. Yamazaki T. Akada T. Niizeki O. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Sato Y. Blood. 2002; 99: 3241-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto N. Nakayama J. Yamakawa-Kobayashi K. Hamaguchi H. Miyazaki R. Arinami T. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was also reported that PSA gene-deficient mice show dwarfism and display increased anxiety and analgesia (25Osada T. Ikegami S. Takiguchi-Hayashi K. Yamazaki Y. Katoh-Fukui Y. Higashinakagawa T. Sakaki Y. Takeuchi T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6068-6078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Osada et al. (26Osada T. Watanabe G. Kondo S. Toyoda M. Sakaki Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Endcrinol. 2001; 15: 960-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Osada T. Watanabe G. Sakaki Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Endcrinol. 2001; 15: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported the roles of PSA in reproduction process. These results indicate that the mammalian aminopeptidases belonging to the M1 family of metallopeptidases play roles in the regulation of important biological processes. Precursors to MHC class I-presented peptides with extra N-terminal residues are trimmed to mature epitopes in the ER. The peptides are first cleaved from endogenously synthesized proteins by proteasome or tripeptidyl peptidase II in the cytoplasm, transported into ER lumen, and then trimmed by aminopeptidase (28Goldberg A.L. Cascio P. Saric T. Rock K.L. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 29Kessler B.M. Glas R. Ploegh H.L. Mol.

Although A-LAP/ERAP1 was shown to be the trimming aminopeptidase in the ER, another enzyme is expected, because there remains trimming activity after removal of A-LAP/ERAP1 from ER lumenal protein fraction (9Saric T. Chang S.-C. Hattori A. York I.A. Markant S. Rock K.L. Tsujimoto M. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the biological significance of the M1 family of aminopeptidases further, we have cloned in this study a novel member of this family, termed leukocyte-derived arginine (R) aminopeptidase (L-RAP) by searching a data base for homologous protein to P-LAP and A-LAP. Enzymatic analyses using synthetic substrates indicate that the enzyme has unique substrate specificity and preferentially cleaves N-terminal basic amino acids. Moreover, our results indicate that like A-LAP/ERAP1, L-RAP is an aminopeptidase normally retained in the ER and trims certain precursors to MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides. Cloning and Sequencing of the Human L-RAP cDNA—The partial nucleotide sequences of cDNA encoding peptides with homology to P-LAP and A-LAP were found in the EST data base of GenBank™ by use of the TBLASTN program. The 337-base pair fragment from the EST clone (GenBank™ accession number AA361076) was used as a probe to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library (Invitrogen). The library were plated at a density of ∼5 × 103 colony-forming units/100-mm plate. They were transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne B; Pall, East Hills, NY) and then hybridized using 32P-labeled probe as described. DNA sequence was determined using a Taq dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer. Expression of L-RAP in HeLa S3 Cells—The SalI-NotI fragment of the L-RAP-HA or L-RAP(s)-HA cDNA was inserted into the pSport-1 vector (Invitrogen). For transfection experiments, HeLa S3 cells plated in 24-well plates were grown to subconfluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Then the cells were transfected with either pSport-1/L-RAP-HA or pSport-1/L-RAP(s)-HA employing LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Production of Recombinant L-RAP—The cDNA encoding the signal sequence of bombyxin (i.e. MKILLATALMLSTVMWVSTA) followed by the open reading frame of L-RAP starting at Ala56 was ligated into the EcoRI sites of pFastbac1 vector. Recombinant baculovirus producing L-RAP was prepared using Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Then High Five cells (Invitrogen) infected with the virus were cultured for 72 h in 3 liters of ExpressFive serum-free medium (Invitrogen) using a Cellmaster 1700 large scale culture system (Wakenyaku, Kyoto, Japan) supplied with 8 ppm of oxygen. Culture medium was collected by centrifugation. Preparation of Antibody against L-RAP—Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of L-RAP including cysteine linker (i.e. LC12, CLPTLRTWLMVNT) and C-terminal 19 amino acids of L-RAP(s) (i.e. SC19, CHSDPKMTSNMVRIKRVTE) were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin according to the method described previously and injected into rabbits for antibody production following standard procedures. Namely, the conjugates mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant were injected intraperitoneally (500 μg of peptide), followed by an injection every 7 days over a 3-week period of the conjugate (250 μg of peptide) with Freund's complete adjuvant. Western Blot Analysis—Test samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% separating gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall). The membranes were blocked with Tris/HCl-buffered saline (NaCl/Tris) (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (NaCl/Tris/Tween), 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated in NaCl/Tris/Tween, 5% skimmed milk, and 2.5 μg/ml rabbit anti-L-RAP antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The filter was washed three times with NaCl/Tris/Tween and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega, Madison, WI), diluted to 1/20,000 in NaCl/Tris/Tween containing 5% skimmed milk. After washing the filter three times with NaCl/Tris/Tween, the blots were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence method using an ECL plus Western blotting kit obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The results were visualized by fluorography using RX-U Fuji medical x-ray film. Immunocytochemical Analysis—HeLa S3 cells grown on a cover glass were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized in PBS solution containing either 0.2% Triton X-100 or 25 μg/ml digitonin for 2 min. Coverslips were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with 5 μg/ml of affinity-purified rat anti-HA antibody and 5 μg/ml of mouse anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody in blocking buffer. The cells were then washed six times with PBS and incubated with 0.4 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rat IgG antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h. After washing with PBS six times, cells were mounted in a drop of PermaFluor aqueous mounting medium (Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA) and viewed with a Leica TCS NT laser scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Isolation of Lumenal Contents—To obtain cell-free extracts, Jurkat-T cells were suspended in SET buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysed at 4 °C in a Potter-Elvehjem glass Teflon-type tissue grinder and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to remove nuclei and cell debris. The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to separate microsomal fraction from cytosolic fraction. The microsomal lumenal contents were separated by the method described previously with slight modification (9Saric T. Chang S.-C. Hattori A. York I.A. Markant S. Rock K.L. Tsujimoto M. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In brief, the lumenal contents were released with 1 mg/ml of digitonin in SET buffer (pH 7.4) and then separated from the microsomal membranes by ultracentrifugation (400,000 × g,4 °C for 1 h). Membrane fraction was then resuspended in SDS sample buffer to obtain the membrane proteins. Measurement of Aminopeptidase Activity—Aminopeptidase activity was determined with various fluorogenic substrates, aminoacyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (aminoacyl-MCAs). The reaction mixture containing 50 μm aminoacyl-MCA and enzyme preparation in 0.2 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) containing 0.1 m sodium monochloroacetate. The released 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was measured by spectrofluorophotometry (F-2000; Hitachi) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Error bars indicate S.E. values from four individual experiments. Cleavage of Peptides by L-RAP—Peptide (25 μm) were incubated with 2 μg/ml of L-RAP at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5% (v/v) formic acid. Generated peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a DO-COSIL B (1 × 100 mm) column (Senshu, Tokyo, Japan) using a Hewlett-Packard HP 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Peptides were loaded onto the column equilibrated in 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Elution of peptides were performed with a linear gradient of 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 48% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.081% trifluoroacetic acid in 30 min at flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. The molecular masses of the peptides were determined by an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Materials—S-Benzyl-Cys-, -Asp-, -Gln-, -Glu-, and -Gly-MCAs were purchased from BACHEM AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Arg-, Lys-, Ala-, Leu-, Phe-, and Met-MCAs were from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant human interferon (IFN)-γ was obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Glycosidases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Protease inhibitors were all obtained from Sigma. Peptide hormones were all obtained from Peptide Institute. Antigenic peptides were synthesized and kindly provided by the RIKEN Brain Science Institute. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. The monoclonal antibodies against ER retention signal KDEL of BiP and calnexin were purchased from StressGen Bioreagents (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and BD Biosciences, respectively. Molecular Cloning of cDNA for L-RAP—To identify sequences similar to the human P-LAP/oxytocinase gene, we searched public data bases of ESTs. Two EST clones (AA361076 and AA356078) derived from human T cell lymphoma were shown to encode novel peptides with significant amino acid homology to P-LAP. A full-length clone was then isolated from a human leukocyte cDNA library. Because the protein encoded by the cDNA was cloned from leukocyte cDNA library, we termed it L-RAP. We also cloned a cDNA encoding a truncated form of L-RAP and designated as L-RAP(s). It should be noted that a sequence in which eight nucleotides and one amino acid are different from L-RAP was submitted to the data bank as mouse- and human-specific aminopeptidase (GenBank™ accession number AF191545). The cloned L-RAP cDNA is ∼3.3 kb long. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA. The cDNA contains a full-length open reading frame, ending with a TAA stop codon at nucleotides 2881–2883. The first ATG triplet (starting at nucleotide 1) was putatively considered to be the initiation codon of the protein translation, because the 5′-untranslated region preceding this codon contains an in-frame stop codon. Taken together, the cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2880 bp flanked by a 150-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 303-bp 3′-untranslated region. The predicted translation product of the L-RAP cDNA encodes a protein of 960 amino acids (including the initiator methionine) with a calculated molecular mass of 122,933 Da and contains nine potential N-glycosylation sites. Hydropathy analysis using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (31Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) showed that as in the case of P-LAP and A-LAP, the enzyme carries a significantly hydrophobic region near the N terminus that could function as an internal signal peptide and a membrane-spanning domain. The deduced amino acid sequence contains typical consensus motifs of the zinc metallopeptidase family. There is an essential zinc-binding site (HEXXH) at amino acid residues 370–374 with a second glutamic acid separated by 18 amino acids. The sequence contains another sequence motif, GAMEN, at amino acid residues 334–338. These two motifs are found in several aminopeptidases and allow the classification of the L-RAP in the M1 family of metallopeptidases (17Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Laustsen P.G. Vang S. Kristensen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sequence Comparison and Phylogenetic Relationship—A computer search revealed that the amino acid sequence of L-RAP has apparent homology to P-LAP and A-LAP (Fig. 2A). Overall sequence identities of L-RAP to P-LAP and A-LAP were 43 and 49%, respectively, whereas other members of the M1 family of aminopeptidases show less (20–30%) homology to L-RAP. The identity between these three enzymes extends over their entire primary structures. Especially sequences around two conserved motifs (HEXXH(X)18E and GAMEN) show high degrees of homology. As for amino acid residues critical for the enzyme activity, all but one in L-RAP (i.e. His is replaced by Arg434) are conserved. To gain better insights into the relationships among the M1 family of aminopeptidases, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the method of Higgins and Sharp (32Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene. 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar) based on the nucleotide sequence identities (Fig. 2B). According to this tree, it is apparent that L-RAP, P-LAP, and A-LAP belong to one distinctive group. Tissue and Subcellular Localization of L-RAP—The tissue distribution of L-RAP was determined by Northern blot analysis using the full-length cDNA as a probe (Fig. 3). Expression of mRNA with size of 6.7 kb was observed in every tissue tested, suggesting its ubiquitous distribution. It is notable here that relatively high expression of L-RAP mRNA was observed in spleen and leukocytes. To examine subcellular localization of L-RAP, L-RAP tagged with Influenza virus HA epitope at the C-terminal end (L-RAP-HA) was expressed in HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 4A). HeLa S3 cells transfected with constructs encoding L-RAP-HA were subjected to immunocytochemical analysis in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100, which permeabilizes all cellular membranes non-selectively. A reticular, perinuclear staining pattern characteristic of the ER was observed. In addition, co-localization of L-RAP-HA with the ER retention signal sequence KDEL was clearly observed when merged. On the other hand, when the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of digitonin to permeabilize plasma membrane selectively (33Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neither L-RAP-HA nor KDEL immunoreactivity was detected. For comparison, we examined the localization of IκB, a cytosolic marker protein, and its immunoreactivity was detected after treatment with either Triton X-100 or digitonin (data not shown). Nearly the same results were obtained when the subcellular localization of L-RAP(s)-HA was examined in HeLa S3 cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that both L-RAP and L-RAP(s) are localized in the ER, and their C-terminal ends are located in the lumenal side. We next examined the ER localization of endogenous L-RAP in Jurkat-T cells to determine whether the enzyme is a soluble or membrane-bound lumenal ER protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, both L-RAP and L-RAP(s) are fractionated mainly into the soluble fraction of lumenal contents. As expected, whereas BiP, which contains the KDEL sequence, was also obtained in the soluble fraction of lumenal contents, calnexin, ER membrane-bound protein, was detected in the microsomal membrane fraction. These results suggest that L-RAP and L-RAP(s) are soluble proteins located in the lumenal side of the ER. When examined the localization in HEK 293 cells, L-RAP is detected in the lumenal side of the ER (data not shown). As expected, L-RAP endogenously expressed in Jurkat-T cells are sensitive to endoglycosidase H and peptide:N-glycosidase F (Fig. 4C), indicating that the proteins contain high mannose-type sugar chains. Characterization of Aminopeptidase Activity of L-RAP—To detect the aminopeptidase activity of L-RAP and L-RAP(s), HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with either L-RAP or L-RAP(s) expression vector controlled under cytomegalovirus promoter. As in the case of A-LAP, both proteins were secreted into culture medium in this condition. As shown in Fig. 5A, aminopeptidase activity against Arg-MCA was clearly detected in the medium of L-RAP-expressing cells. Although a considerable amount of L-RAP(s) was detected in the medium of L-RAP(s)-expressing cells by Western blot analysis, little Arg-MCA degrading activity was detected. These results suggest that whereas L-RAP shows aminopeptidase activity, L-RAP(s) has little (if any) activity. To further characterize the enzymatic properties of L-RAP, we established a large scale production system of the recombinant protein using a baculovirus system (Fig. 5B). L-RAP was purified to a single band of 115 kDa on SDS-PAGE from the culture medium. We then measured the relative hydrolytic activity of the enzyme toward various aminoacyl-MCAs. As shown in Fig. 5C, Arg-MCA was hydrolyzed most efficiently, followed by Lys-MCA. The calculated K m, k cat, and k cat /K m values from a Lineweaver-Burk plot of L-RAP activity toward Arg-MCA were 3.18 μm, 2.30/s, and 7.25 × 105/m–1s–1, respectively. To other synthetic substrates tested, L-RAP had little activity. These results indicate that L-RAP preferentially hydrolyzes basic N-terminal amino acids. The effects of various known inhibitors of aminopeptidases on the hydrolytic activity of L-RAP toward Arg-MCA are shown in Fig. 5D. Although amastatin was a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, bestatin was less active. Puromycin, a specific inhibitor of PSA, had little activity toward the enzyme. Of the chelating agents tested, 1,10-phenanthroline effectively inhibited the enzyme activity, but EDTA had no effect up to 1 mm. It is noteworthy here that the inhibitor profile of L-RAP is consistent with those of putative ER resident aminopeptidases, which trim the MHC class I-presented antigenic precursor peptides (34Serwold T. Gaw S. Shastri N. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Next, we searched for L-RAP-mediated degradation of natural hormones to estimate the physiological role of the enzyme. Among hormones tested, the enzyme cleaved kallidin and angiotensin III (Fig. 6). No hydrolytic activity was observed toward oxytocin, vasopressin, and angiotensin II. These results indicate that the enzyme indeed exerts the aminopeptidase activity toward certain naturally occurring peptides, and its substrate specificity is different from P-LAP and A-LAP. Trimming of Precursors of Antigenic Peptides by L-RAP— Because L-RAP is a lumenal ER protein, we next examined whether L-RAP is a trimming enzyme of antigenic precursor peptides. For this purpose, we first examined the effects of IFN-γ on the expression of L-RAP proteins. It is well known that IFN-γ induces many components of the MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation pathway (28Goldberg A.L. Cascio P. Saric T. Rock K.L. Mol.

Because hyperphosphorylated tau is a consistent component of neurofibrillary tangles, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated the signaling molecules involved in Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation. We show that Aβ42 elicited rapid and reversible tau protein phosphorylation on three proline-directed sites (Ser-202, Thr-181, and Thr-231) in systems enriched in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR) including serum-deprived human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal synaptosomes. Although α7nAChR agonists induced similar phosphorylation, pretreatment with antisense-α7nAChR oligonucleotides (in cells) or α7nAChR antagonists (in cells and synaptosomes) attenuated Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation. Western analyses showed that the mitogen-activated kinase cascade proteins, ERKs and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-1), were concomitantly activated by Aβ42, and their respective kinase inhibitors suppressed Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation. More importantly, recombinant-activated ERKs and JNK-1 could differentially phosphorylate tau protein in vitro. Thus, the α7nAChR may mediate Aβ-induced tau protein phosphorylation via ERKs and JNK-1. The Alzheimer's disease pathogenic peptide, β-amyloid42 (Aβ42), induces tau protein phosphorylation.

Anderton B.H. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1994; 20: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that direct injection of Aβ42 fibrils into the brains of P301L mutant tau transgenic mice (2Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M.

Hutton M. McGowan E. Science. 2001; 293: 1487-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles development may be related (4Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1446-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Aβ-tau relationship is further supported by the fact that primary hippocampal neurons of tau-deficient mice, in contrast to that of the wild type mice, did not show any signs of degeneration upon fibrillar Aβ treatments (5Rapoport M. Dawson H.N. Binder L.I. Vitek M.P. Ferreira A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6364-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Because neurofibrillary tangles are largely composed of paired helical filaments that contained hyperphosphorylated tau protein and treatment of primary neurons with Aβ42 may result in tau phosphorylation, it is pertinent to understand the molecular signaling entities involved in Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation. Several studies have demonstrated the interaction between Aβ42 and the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR) (6Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J.

Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may have major implications for Alzheimer's disease pathology because mitogen-activated kinase cascade protein has been shown to be a tau protein kinase (10Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Jakes R.

Together with the facts that (a) the Aβ42-α7nAChR interaction modulates neuronal physiological functions that are relevant to memory processes (6Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H.

In this study, we investigated the downstream signaling events of the Aβ42-α7nAChR interaction. We tracked the tau phosphorylation events in response to Aβ42 stimulation using experimental systems that contain α7nAChR including human neuroblastoma cells and brain synaptosomes. Our results suggest that α7nAChR is a key mediator of Aβ42-induced tau protein phosphorylation. Antisense Oligonucleotides—Orthothioate antisense oligonucleotides for human α7nAChR (AS1, 5′-CCACATAGCTCCCGCCAAGT-3′, and AS2, 5′-GAAGATGTCCATGTCAGGGTTCAAG-3′), human neurokinin receptor 1 (5′-CCACTAACACCTCGGAACCCAATCA-3′), and a scramble control oligonucleotide (5′-ATACACCTGCACACCGTCCG-3′) were prepared by BioSource International Inc. (Camarillo, CA). 10–30 μm of each antisense oligonucleotide were added to the SK-N-MC cells and cultured for 4 days with one medium change before analyses. Cellular toxicity was closely monitored by trypan blue exclusion, and consistently >85% of the cells survived in each of the antisense oligonucleotide treatments. Peptides and Peptide Preparations—Aβ peptides, galanin, and neuropeptide Y were obtained from Palomar Research Inc (Encinitas, CA). For each experiment, Aβ peptide solutions were freshly prepared in 50 mm HEPES, pH 9.0, to minimize autoaggregation. These Aβ solutions were thoroughly characterized to be devoid of high molecular aggregates (17Lee D.H.S. Wang H.-Y. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 25: 25-30Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the Aβ peptides used in this study are mainly present in monomeric, dimeric, and small oligomeric forms. p-Tau Western Blot Analyses—Hippocampal synaptosomes were prepared according to those described earlier (18Wang H.-Y Wild K.D. Shank R.P. Lee D.H.S. Neuropeptides. 1999; 33: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and treated with Aβ42 or control peptides. At time intervals, an aliquot of the sample was mixed with loading buffer containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and boiled for 5 min before subjecting to denaturing PAGE and the appropriate Western analyses using specific p-tau antibodies (Innogenetics, Temse, Belgium, and BioSource) as described previously (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In Vitro Tau Kinase Assay—Recombinant tau (1 μg, PanVera, Madison, WI) was incubated with 10 units of recombinant activated ERK1 or 0.1 unit of recombinant activated ERK2 (Upstate Biotech. Inc, Lake Placid, NY) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm ATP, 2 mm Ca2+, 2 mm Mg2+, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 100 μl for various time intervals. At the end of the incubation, aliquots were removed and subjected to denaturing gradient PAGE and Western analyses as described above. Among the many phosphorylation sites on tau, at least three proline-directed sites (Ser-202, Thr-181, and Thr-231) are phosphorylated in paired helical filaments isolated from AD brains (19Maas T. Eidenmuller J. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15733-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Specifically, Thr-231 has been shown to directly affect tau binding to microtubules (20Sengupta A. Kabat J. Novak M. Wu Q. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whereas Ser-202 and Thr-181 modulate the kinetics of tau binding to microtubules (21Xie H. Litersky J.M. Hartigan J.A. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Brain Res. 1998; 798: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, we verified the ability of Aβ42 to induce the phosphorylation of these three proline-directed sites using three different anti-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) antibodies that recognized p-Ser-202, p-Thr-181, and p-Thr-231, respectively. We treated serum-deprived human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells that expressed α7nAChR (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) with Aβ42 and analyzed the tau proteins that were immunoprecipitated from the solubilized cell lysates. Western blot analyses showed that Aβ42 dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of all of the three sites tested, whereas maximal phosphorylation was obtained with 100 nm Aβ42 (Fig. 1a). The kinetics for the Ser-202 phosphorylation appeared to be the fastest and saturated in 15 min while the Thr-181 and Thr-231 phosphorylations were slowly saturated within 1–2 h (Fig. 1b). The Aβ42-induced p-Thr-181 and p-Thr-231 remained for at least 4 h and up to 16 h for p-Ser-202 before returning to ground state, implying the presence of an endogenous dephosphorylation system (Fig. 1b). Similar Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation was detected using frontal cortical and hippocampal synaptosomes enriched in α7nAChR (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 17Lee D.H.S. Wang H.-Y. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 25: 25-30Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) prepared, respectively, from rat or neurologically normal human (data not shown), although the kinetics observed were slightly different. In both rat and human brain synaptosomal preparations, the Aβ42-induced p-Ser-202, p-Thr-181, and p-Thr-231 saturated within 15 min but sustained only for ∼1 h (rat) or ∼0.5 h (human), respectively, suggesting the presence of a vigorous and tightly regulated dephosphorylation system for p-tau in vivo. This tau protein phosphorylation event was not induced by Aβ40-1 or Aβ42-1 (Fig. 1c) but effectively suppressed by the α7nAChR antagonist, α-bungarotoxin (Fig. 1, a and b). Furthermore, human Bowes melanoma cells and rat striatum synaptosomes that contain undetectable or low levels of α7nAChR (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) failed to generate significant amounts of p-tau upon Aβ42 treatment under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 1d).Fig. 1a, Aβ42 dose-dependently stimulated tau phosphorylation. SK-N-MC cells were maintained in a 12-well culture plate culture in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 4 h at 37 °C and then treated with various concentrations (1 pm–1 μm) of Aβ42 for 20 min at 25 °C. At the end of the incubation, cells were lysed with SDS and 50 μg of protein as determined by protein reagent (Bio-Rad) was subjected to denaturing 8–16% gradient PAGE and Western blotting. The blot was analyzed by three different anti-p-tau antibodies that recognized three distinct phosphorylation sites on tau: p-Ser-202-tau, p-Thr-231-tau, and p-Thr-181-tau. Optical densitometric scans of the p-tau bands are shown on the right. Mean data from at least three different experiments are presented, and error bars indicate mean ± S.E. Molecular masses in kDa are indicated on the left. Total tau content in each sample is represented by tau 5 (BioSource) staining as shown in the top panel.

Serum-deprived SK-N-MC cells were treated with the α7nAChR antagonist, methyllycaconitine or α-bungarotoxin, before the addition of Aβ42. Analyses of the immunoprecipitated tau showed that methyllycaconitine and α-bungarotoxin attenuated p-tau, whereas the α1nAChR antagonist (α-conotoxin MI), the non-selective nicotinic channel blocker (mecamylamine), and the muscarinic receptor antagonist (atropine) had no effect (Fig. 2a). In addition, among a panel of Aβ peptide fragments tested, only Aβ12–28, the Aβ fragment that may contain a binding epitope for α7nAChR (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), attenuated Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation (Fig. 2b). On the other hand, only α7nAChR agonists such as nicotine (Fig. 2c) and epibatidine but not the α4β2nAChR agonist, cytosine (data not shown), stimulated weak and transient tau phosphorylation. Finally, SK-N-MC cells cultured in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of two different antisense-α7nAChR oligonucleotides, AS1 and AS2, were used to test the role of the α7nAChR in mediating tau phosphorylation. The AS1 and AS2 treatments effectively reduced α7nAChR protein levels as verified by Western analysis (Fig. 3a) and significantly diminished Aβ42-induced p-tau in serum-deprived SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 3b). Although AS1 appeared to be more potent than AS2 at high concentrations in suppressing pThr-231, probably indicating some extraneous activities other than reducing α7nAChR levels, the cumulative results suggest that α7nAChR participate in the Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation process.Fig. 3SK-N-MC cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 or 30 μm of two separate orthothioate antisense oligonucleotides, AS1 and AS2, against α7nAChR for 4 days. Controls include an antisense oligonucleotide NK1 that is directed against the human neurokinin receptor 1 and a scramble oligonucleotide. At the end of the incubation, the cells were serum-deprived by incubating in culture medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum for 4 h and then either lysed and analyzed simultaneously for α7nAChR and β-actin (a) or treated with 100 nm of Aβ42 and then subjected to similar PAGE and Western analyses as described in Fig. 1(b).

To determine the specific kinase(s) involved in the Aβ42-α7nAChR-mediated tau phosphorylation, Western analyses were performed on serum-deprived SK-N-MC cells treated with Aβ42 using a panel of specific antibodies that recognized the respective active form of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, P38 kinase, and ERKs. While we consistently failed to detect the Aβ42-mediated activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, P38 kinase, Cdk5, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase within the time period that correlated tau phosphorylation kinetics in the brain synaptosomes or serum-deprived SK-N-MC cells (data not shown), activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was noted. The respective activation kinetics of ERKs was strikingly similar to that of tau phosphorylation, both ERKs were fully activated within 10 min (Fig 4a), and the activated ERKs remained detectable up to 4 h (data not shown). This is of particular interest because ERKs have been demonstrated to phosphorylate tau and that neuronal ERKs have been implicated in long term potentiation and memory processes (13Blum S.

In another Western analysis system using anti-p-tau antibodies, recombinant tau incubated with recombinant activated ERKs in the presence of ATP showed that both ERK1 and ERK2 specifically phosphorylated Ser-202 and Thr-181 but not Thr-231 and that the phosphorylation kinetics was very similar to that observed in the cellular or synaptosome systems (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, when serum-deprived SK-N-MC cells were separately treated with a panel of specific kinase inhibitors (H-89, chelerythrine, PD169316, PD98059, 5-iodotubercidin, roscovitine, U0126, and SP600125) before exposure to Aβ42, only the ERK inhibitors (5-iodotubercidin and roscovitine) and inhibitors of the ERK regulator MEK (PD98059 and U0126) were effective at non-toxic concentrations in suppressing Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation, whereas inhibitors for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, P38, Cdk1, Cdk2, and Cdk5 were ineffective (data not shown). These results further support the involvement of ERKs in the tau protein phosphorylation event. We have shown that the Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation is mediated by the pentameric cation ion channel α7nAChR. Although Aβ42 behaves as an α7nAChR ion channel antagonist that inhibits calcium mobilization and ACh release (17Lee D.H.S. Wang H.-Y. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 25: 25-30Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it activates kinase(s) including ERKs and behaves as an α7nAChR agonist in mediating the tau protein phosphorylation event. Nonetheless, ERKs can only account for the phosphorylation activities on two of the three p-tau sites studied here, because Aβ42-induced p-Thr-231 is clearly independent of ERK activities. It is likely that other tau kinases activated by the Aβ42-α7nAChR interaction may account for the Thr-231 phosphorylation that is critically required for maximal inhibition of tau binding to microtubules (21Xie H. Litersky J.M. Hartigan J.A. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Brain Res. 1998; 798: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies indicate that a specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, SP600125, significantly reduced p-Thr-231, p-Ser-202, and p-Thr-181. Further analyses specifically identified JNK-1 but not JNK-2 to be activated within 10 min by Aβ42 (Fig. 5a), and activated JNK-1 remained detectable for up to 4 h (data not shown) in our α7nAChR experimental system. The activated JNK-1 efficiently phosphorylates Thr-231 but is relatively less effective in phosphorylating Ser-202 and Thr-181 (Fig. 5b). Finally, treatment of the SK-N-MC cells with antisense-α7nAChR oligonucleotides, AS1 and AS2, impaired the ability for Aβ42 to activate both JNK-1 and ERKs (Fig. 6). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that JNK-1 and ERKs are the candidate kinases responsible for the Aβ42-induced, α7nAChR-dependent tau phosphorylation recorded in this study.Fig. 6Aβ42 activation of ERKs and JNK-1 involves α7nAChR. SK-N-MC cells were treated with or without non-toxic concentrations of antisense α7nAChR oligonucleotides, AS1 and AS2, and serum-starved before stimulation with Aβ42 as described. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK1, anti-ERK2, or anti-JNK-1 and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting. The blots were analyzed for the presence of the activated form of the respective kinase using anti-pERK and anti-pJNK antibodies.

Neuropeptides. 1999; 33: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Aβ42 effectively induces tau phosphorylation. This Aβ42-mediated tau phosphorylation can be appropriately attenuated by α7nAChR antagonist or antisense-α7nAChR, suggesting a critical role of the α7nAChR. We further illustrate that ERKs and JNK-1 are concomitantly activated by Aβ42 in a α7nAChR-dependent manner and that these enzymes differentially phosphorylate the three proline-directed serine or threonine residues on tau. Thus, this study attributes α7nAChR as a key mediator for Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation. The α7nAChR-mediated Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation event described here is fully reversible, reflecting a normal cellular response to Aβ. Under steady state condition in the brain, the net effect of tau phosphorylation induced by Aβ might be minimal and apparently cannot be responsible for the tau hyperphosphorylation observed in AD brains. Three explanations may account for this discrepancy. First, an inefficient dephosphorylation system (28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Brandt R. Kamibayashi C. Kuret J. White III, C.L. Mumby M.C. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25490-25498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) that fails to remove p-tau in AD brain may contribute significantly to the p-tau accumulation. Second, chronic presence of Aβ42 as a result of excess Aβ42 production and/or deficient Aβ42 clearance in AD brains may provide a sustained stimulation to generate p-tau. The large amounts of p-tau formed may have exceeded the capacity of the endogenous dephosphorylation system, thereby resulting in net tau hyperphosphorylation. Third, that in addition to soluble Aβ42, Aβ fibrils formed as a result of chronic extracellular deposition of Aβ42 may also contribute to p-tau formation. These Aβ fibrils could directly induce p-tau formation as soluble Aβ by interacting with the same α7nAChR or with other unknown surface receptors. Alternately, because Aβ has been demonstrated to accumulate intracellularly in neurons (16D'Andrea M.R. Nagele R.G. Wang H.-Y. Peterson P.A. Lee D.H.S. Histopathol. 2001; 38: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Nagele R.G. D'Andrea M.R. Anderson W.J. Wang H.-Y. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 30Gouras K.G. Tsai J. Naslund J. Vincent B. Edgar M. Checler F. Greenfield J.P. Haroutunian V. Buxbaum J.D. Xu H. Greengard P. Relkin N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), Aβ fibrils formed inside these neurons may impact on the dephosphorylation pathways, hence indirectly affecting the concentrations of steady state p-tau. Although the interaction of soluble Aβ (monomers, dimers, and oligomers) with α7nAChR may reflect early events in AD, the involvement of Aβ fibrils is equally relevant to AD pathogenesis because the concentrations of soluble Aβ in the cerebrospinal fluid actually decline with AD and the presence of Aβ fibrils in AD brains clearly explains this clinical observation. Thus, soluble Aβ and Aβ fibrils together may adequately account for the chronic accumulation of p-tau in AD brains. Nevertheless, these three potential mechanisms, either alone or more likely in concert and perhaps also in conjunction with additional pathological factors such as oxidative stress, may contribute to the abundant and persistent p-tau present in AD brains. The role of oxidative stress is particularly noteworthy because in our cellular experimental system, Aβ42 failed to induce any detectable tau phosphorylation unless the cells were serum-deprived prior to the Aβ treatment. Since serum deprivation is known to induce stress to cultured cells involving free radicals, these may exacerbate the effects of Aβ, leading to the subsequent cascade of signaling events and cellular responses. Alternately, the reduced amount of interfering Aβ42-binding proteins in a low serum environment in our experimental system may allow efficient interaction of the exogenous Aβ42 with the α7nAChR resulting in detectable p-tau. The transient albeit weak effects of α7nAChR agonist such as nicotine in stimulating tau phosphorylation further confirm the role of this neuronal ion channel in Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation. The differential efficiencies between Aβ42 and nicotine in stimulating tau phosphorylation could be attributed to their respective binding affinities as well as the molecular recognition epitopes on α7nAChR. For example, the affinity of Aβ for α7nAChR could be higher than that of nicotine (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 31Wang H.-Y Lee D.H.S. Davies C. Shank R.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and that the recognition epitope on α7nAChR for Aβ42 is expected to be more complex than that of a smaller molecule, nicotine. The fact that Aβ12–28 could attenuate the Aβ42-induced tau phosphorylation is consistent with the initial findings that this peptide fragment inhibited the Aβ42-α7nAChR interaction, both in immunoprecipitation experiment (8Wang H.-Y. Lee D.H.S. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and in electrophysiology studies (9Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar, 32Dineley K.T. Bell K.A. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25056-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although it implies that the Aβ12–28 may contain a necessary contact epitope within Aβ42 to interact with α7nAChR, this interaction is apparently insufficient to activate α7nAChR to induce tau phosphorylation. Key contributions from the other sequence components on Aβ42 in activating α7nAChR cannot be excluded. Our results also cannot rule out the possibility, albeit remote, that Aβ12–28 may negatively regulate the signaling pathway studied in this report via unidentified receptors or mechanisms. The α7nAChR have been shown to interact with the AD pathogenic peptide, Aβ42 (6Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J.

Wang H.-Y. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This could be one of the mechanisms contributing to the intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 observed in AD neurons (16D'Andrea M.R. Nagele R.G. Wang H.-Y. Peterson P.A. Lee D.H.S.

LeBlanc A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Here we further demonstrate that the Aβ42-α7nAChR interaction activates mitogen-activated kinase cascade proteins leading to tau protein phosphorylation. Thus, in addition to its physiological roles in memory (34Auld D.S. Kar S. Quirion K. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 43-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), its anatomical distribution (15Fabian-Fine R. Skehel P. Errington M.L. Davies H.A. Sher E. Stewart M.G. Fine A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7993-8003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in brain regions associated with memory functions and the possible participation in the development of dense-core amyloid plaques (16D'Andrea M.R. Nagele R.G. Wang H.-Y. Peterson P.A. Lee D.H.S. Histopathol. 2001; 38: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), the α7nAChR may be the molecular mediator linking Aβ42 to tau phosphorylation. In light of the fact that the Aβ42-α7nAChR interaction modulates several neurochemical processes such as calcium homeostasis, ACh release, and tau phosphorylation that contributed to memory physiology, this may explain why neurons that express α7nAChR, such as pyramidal neurons, are vulnerable to Aβ42 in AD brains. An initial aberrant α7nAChR physiology followed by the subsequent “α7nAChR-expressing” cell loss may be responsible for the memory and cognition impairment observed in earlier stages of AD. A recent hypothesis that synaptic failure caused by diffusible oligomeric Aβ42 (35Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar) might be a causal factor in AD pathogenesis is especially relevant here because the α7nAChRs are located in both the presynaptic and post-synaptic cholinergic and cholinoceptive terminals. In this series of biochemical, cellular, and pharmacological experiments, we have demonstrated that the α7nAChR is a critical linker molecule through which Aβ induces tau phosphorylation by activating ERKs and JNK-1, two candidate tau kinases. Our results are in agreement with the literature that reported similar activation of ERKs and JNK by Aβ42, because the cell lines e.g. SH-SY5Y, IMR32, and PC12, and primary cortical and hippocampal neurons employed in those studies all expressed α7nAChR as illustrated by Western analyses (8Wang H.-Y.

Clearly, the present study does not preclude the participation of other Aβ receptors that may operate via different signaling mechanisms/pathways, leading to tau phosphorylation. Further explorations using Aβ fibrils and α7nAChR-deficient mice will provide more answers to the detailed underlying mechanisms. We thank Drs. Sangram Sisodia and Leona Ling for helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1989244218,"The rapid motility of axonal filopodia and dendritic spines is prevalent throughout the developing CNS, although the function of this motility remains controversial. Using two-photon microscopy, we imaged hippocampal mossy fiber axons in slice cultures and discovered that filopodial extensions are highly motile. Axonal filopodial motility is actin based and is downregulated with development, although it remains in mature cultures. This motility is correlated with free extracellular space yet is inversely correlated with contact with postsynaptic targets, indicating a potential role in synaptogenesis. Filopodial motility is differentially regulated by kainate receptors: synaptic stimulation of kainate receptors enhances motility in younger slices, but it inhibits it in mature slices. We propose that neuronal activity controls filopodial motility in a developmentally regulated manner, in order to establish synaptic contacts in a two-step process. A two-step model of synaptogenesis can also explain the opposite effects of neuronal activity on the motility of dendritic protrusions."
https://openalex.org/W2120478339,"Using fMRI, we sought to determine whether the posterior, superior portion of Broca's area performs operations on phoneme segments specifically or implements processes general to sequencing discrete units. Twelve healthy volunteers performed two sequence manipulation tasks and one matching task, using strings of syllables and hummed notes. The posterior portion of Broca's area responded specifically to the sequence manipulation tasks, independent of whether the stimuli were composed of phonemes or hummed notes. In contrast, the left supramarginal gyrus was somewhat more specific to sequencing phoneme segments. These results suggest a functional dissociation of the canonical left hemisphere language regions encompassing the “phonological loop,” with the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus responding not to the sound structure of language but rather to sequential operations that may underlie the ability to form words out of dissociable elements."

Moreover, recent genetic studies suggest that sperm binding to the zona pellucida is predicated on the three-dimensional structure of the zona pellucida matrix rather than a specific carbohydrate side chain. Cleavage of ZP2 by a protease released during cortical granule exocytosis that occurs upon fertilization may be sufficient to modify the supramolecular structure of the zona matrix and render it non-permissive to sperm binding (20Rankin T.L.

Many of these controversies stem from the paucity of biological material that makes robust biochemical analysis difficult and has prompted reliance on recombinant zona proteins expressed in heterologous systems where processing and modifications may differ from those in mouse oocytes.

Reduction with dithiothreitol (5 mm final concentration) and subsequent alkylation with IAA (80 mm final concentration) were performed in the same buffer at 37 °C for 1 h each. To this reaction mixture was added 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. The excess reagents including urea, dithiothreitol, and IAA were removed by buffer exchange (3×) using an YM-10 Amicon centrifugation filter device with a MW cutoff of 10 kDa (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The proteins were re-dissolved in 50 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8 and deglycosylated using a Prozyme Glycopro Deglycosylation Kit. N-glycans were removed using 1 μl of PNGase F (5000 units/ml) for 26 h at 37 °C. After N-deglycosylation, the sample was divided into two fractions and lyophilized. Half of the material was reconstituted in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 6.1, prior to O-glycan removal. O-Deglycosylation was performed using 1 μl of the following exoglycosidases: sialidase A (5 units/ml), β-(1–4)-galactosidase (3 units/ml), and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (45 units/ml) ± 1 μl of endo-O-glycosidase (1.25 units/ml) at 37 °C for 36 h. The pH of this sample was raised to 6.5 in the middle of the reaction. The O-deglycosylated samples were subsequently lyophilized, and re-dissolved in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, to give ∼10 pmol/μl final concentration of ZP3 in the ZP mix. 1 μl of ZP mix (containing 10 pmol of ZP3) was digested in a 10-μl volume consisting of 1 μl of acetonitrile, 7 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, and either 1 μl of trypsin (1 pmol) for 18 h, Asp-N (0.5 pmol) for 18 h, or trypsin (1 pmol) for 48 h followed by Asp-N (0.5 pmol) for an additional 18 h. Trypsin cleaves C-terminal to lysine and arginine; Asp-N cleaves N-terminal to aspartic acid, although infrequent cleavage N-terminal to glutamic acid also has been reported (22Lopaticki S. Morrow C.J. Gorman J.J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 950-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide Linkage Mapping—A non-reduced zona protein mixture (20 μg) was denatured in 8 m urea, pH 7.2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Free thiols of cysteine residues were blocked with 1 m (final concentration) of 4-VP in a 25-μl reaction mixture prepared in an ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.2 containing 10% methanol (23Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The excess reagents were removed as described above, and the pH of the solution was brought to 7.5 prior to N-deglycosylation with PNGase F and proteolytic digestions. Throughout the entire experiment, the reaction pH was carefully controlled in the range of 7.2–7.5 to preserve native disulfide linkages. Disulfide bonds were determined by analyzing the proteolytic fragments using LC-MS. To confirm these linkages, TCEP (0.5–1 mm final concentration) was added to reduce the pre-existing disulfide-bonded peptides at 37 °C for 1 h. LC-MS Analysis of Protein Digests—Trypsin, Asp-N, and trypsin/Asp-N double digests of ZP mix were analyzed on a Micromass QTOF Ultima Global (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in electrospray mode interfaced with an Agilent HP1100 CapLC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) prior to the mass spectrometer. 2 μl (∼2 pmol) of each digest was loaded onto a Vydec C18 MS column (100 × 0.15 mm; Grace Vydec, Hesperia, CA) and chromatographic separation was performed at 1 μl/min using the following gradient: 0–10% B over 5 min; gradient from 10–40% B over 60 min; 40–95% B over 5 min; 95% B held over 5 min (solvent A: 0.2% formic acid in water; solvent B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile). A data-dependent analysis (DDA) method collected CID data for the three most abundant peptide ions observed in the preceding survey scan (m/z 300–1990) above a threshold of 10 counts/sec. Collision energy for CID experiments was optimized using peptide standards with a wide mass range (m/z 400–1600) and charge state (+1 to +4) and was typically between 20–65 eV. Data was processed using the MassLynx software package (version 3.5) to generate peak list files before submitting them to in-house licensed Mascot search (24Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar) (biospec.nih.gov (MatrixScience Ltd., London, UK)). Error tolerant searches were performed to consider irregular cleavages and post-translational modifications. In addition, manual data analysis in search of specific ions of interest was carried out. All MS/MS fragment ions were within 50 ppm of their theoretical values determined by the BioLynx Protein/Peptide Editor and most were within 10 ppm. Gel Electrophoresis and Western blotting—Zona proteins were solubilized in 2× denaturing and reducing Laemmli sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% NOVEX Trisglycine gel at 120 V. The proteins were then electroblotted onto a NitroPure-supported nitrocellulose membrane (45-μm pore diameter; OSMONICS INC., Westborough, MA) at 25 V for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% nonfat dried milk for1hat room temperature. Proteins were immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C in the same blocking solution containing one of the following rat monoclonal antibodies specific to: ZP1 (m1.4, 1:100 hybridoma supernatant) (26Rankin T.L. Tong Z.-B. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Nelson L.M. Dean J. Development. 1998; 125: 2415-2424PubMed Google Scholar), ZP2 (IE3, 1:100 hybridoma supernatant) (27East I.J. Dean J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and ZP3 (IE10, 1:1000 IgG fraction isolated from hybridoma supernatant) (28East I.J. Gulyas B.J. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 109: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The blots were washed three times (15 min each) with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20, and then incubated in an anti-rat secondary IgG-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblotted bands were washed again and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Preliminary Analysis of the Zona Pellucida—Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on native zonae pellucidae isolated from 500 NIH Swiss mice and purified by density gradient centrifugation. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize peptide epitopes detected mouse ZP1 (average molecular mass, 132 kDa), ZP2 (120 kDa) and ZP3 (79 kDa) on immunoblots after samples had been reduced and alkylated (data not shown). Following treatment with PNGase F to remove N-linked glycans, there was a dramatic shift in the apparent molecular mass of ZP1 (132 kDa → 105 kDa), ZP2 (120 kDa → 68 kDa) and ZP3 (79 kDa → 44 kDa), similar to those reported earlier for ZP2 and ZP3 (29Nagdas S.K. Araki Y. Chayko C.A. Orgebin-Crist M.-C. Tulsiani D.R.P. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additional treatment with a mixture of exo- and endo-O-glycosidase resulted in a less diffuse band for ZP1 and ZP3 and a further shift in average molecular masses to 63 and 39 kDa, respectively. However, there was no apparent shift in the molecular mass of ZP2, confirming previous observations (29Nagdas S.K. Araki Y. Chayko C.A. Orgebin-Crist M.-C. Tulsiani D.R.P. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although glycoproteins run anomalously on SDS-PAGE (30Leach B.S. Collawn Jr., J.F. Fish W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5734-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), these results suggest that ZP1 is more heavily O- than N-glycosylated, ZP2 is predominantly N-glycosylated with little or no O-glycosylation, and ZP3 is predominantly N-glycosylated with relatively little O-glycosylation. Each sample analyzed by mass spectrometry was a mixture of zona proteins with ZP2 and ZP3 present in approximately equal amounts and ZP1 much less abundant (31Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Using a combination of proteolytic enzymes before and after enzymatic deglycosylation, 56% of the polypeptide chain of mature ZP1 (see Supplemental Table IA), 96% of mature ZP2 (see Supplemental Table IB) and 100% of mature ZP3 (see Supplemental Table IC) was identified by mass spectrometry. Although looked for, two or more ions ascribable to other known proteins were not observed in the zona preparation with the exception of clusterin/apolipoprotein J/sulfated glycoprotein 2 from Mus musculus (32French L.E. Chonn A. Ducrest D. Baumann B. Belin D. Wohlwend A. Kiss J.Z. Sappino A.P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This protein, implicated in cell-cell adhesions of epithelia tissues including the early embryo, was identified by CID spectra of two peptides 385VSTVTTHSSDSEVPSR400 and 401VTEVVVK407. Whether clusterin participates in the zona pellucida matrix or its presence reflects a minor contamination of the zona preparation remains to be determined. Determination of the N Termini of ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3— Virtually all extracellular proteins have N-terminal signal peptides that direct them into secretory pathways and are removed in the endoplasmic reticulum by signal peptidases. A predictive algorithm (33Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar) predicts cleavage of ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 immediately upstream of Gln21, Val35, and Gln23, respectively. Edman degradation sequence confirmed the N terminus of ZP2 (6Liang L.-F. Chamow S.M. Dean J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but was either imprecise for ZP1 (7Epifano O. Liang L.-F. Familari M. Moos Jr., M.C. Dean J. Development. 1995; 121: 1947-1956PubMed Google Scholar) or uninformative for ZP3 (5Ringuette M.J. Chamberlin M.E. Baur A.W. Sobieski D.A. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping of ZP1 from Asp-N digestion followed by LC-MS indicated that the N terminus starts at Gln21, which had been converted to pyroglutamate. The CID spectrum (Fig. 1A) of the precursor ion at m/z 811.372+ (inset, calc. 811.392+) corresponding to the mass of the N-terminal peptide 21qRLHLEPGFEYSY33 (q = pyroglutamate) indicated the presence of both y and b ion series including y1–2, y2-H2O, y7, b2–6, b8–10, b2-NH3, b4-NH3, b6-NH3. In addition, an ion series a5–6, a9, and a11 as well as immonium ions of tyrosine and phenylalanine were observed. MS data from the combined trypsin/Asp-N digestion revealed the presence of the [M+2H]2+ ion at m/z 915.45 (inset, calc. 915.462+) corresponding to the N-terminal carbamidomethylated peptide 35VSLPQSENPAFPGTLIC51 of ZP2 (Fig. 1B). The CID spectrum of this ion generated many internal fragment ions (PG, PQ, PGT, PGTLI, PQSENPAF, etc.) near proline residues and, together with sequence ions y1, y2, y6, and a4, b2-H2O, b7-NH3, b11, confirmed its identity. For mouse ZP3, tryptic digestion revealed [M+3H]3+ and [M+4H]4+ at m/z 702.42 and 527.06 that match the N-terminal peptide 23qTLWLLPGGTPTPVGSSSPVK43, again with a pyroglutamate in place of a glutamine (Fig. 1C). Unfortunately, the low abundance of these multiply charged ions prevented them from being selected for fragmentation (CID). Furthermore, the highly charged state of this peptide is unusual since there is only one basic lysine residue. However, gas phase basicity can promote proton trapping by proline, tryptophan, and glutamine (34Smith R.D. Loo R.A. Loo R.R. Busman M. Udseth H.R. Mass. Spec. Rev. 1991; 10: 359-451Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 35Schnier P.D. Gross D.S. Williams E.R. J. Am. Soc. Chem. 1995; 117: 6747-6757Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and may account for these observations. Determination of the C Termini of ZP1, ZP2, ZP3—A potential proprotein convertase (furin) cleavage site (RX(R/K)R↓) that lies 35–40 amino acids N-terminal of the transmembrane domain is conserved among the mouse zona proteins and has been implicated in the release of the mature zona ectodomain (13Yurewicz E.C. Hibler D. Fontenot G.K. Sacco A.G. Harris J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because trypsin cuts within the furin site and could have provided ambiguous results, samples were digested with Asp-N. MS data was obtained from both N-deglycosylated and N/O-deglycosylated zonae pellucidae. For mouse ZP1, we observed a peptide of MH+ 774.42 Da corresponding to the sequence of 540DSGIARR546 both as a +1 (calc. 774.421+) and +2 charged ion at m/z 387.72 (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the C terminus of mouse ZP1 (Arg546) lies two amino acids upstream of the furin cleavage site. Due to the low abundance of these ions, CID data were not obtained. For ZP2, Asp-N digestion and LC-MS data revealed the presence of a precursor ion of MH+ 1649.76 representing the C-terminal peptide 619DSPLCSVTCPASLRS633 where Cys623 and Cys627 were both carbamidomethylated (calc. MH+ 1649.76). The CID spectrum of the +2 charged ion of this peptide at m/z 825.38 confirmed the identity of the peptide through the b ion series of peptide fragments (b2, b3-H2O, b4, b4-H2O), as well as the y ion series (y6-y12, y6-NH3, y9-NH3, y10-H2O) (Fig. 2B). Hence, the C terminus of ZP2 (Ser633) also lies two amino acids upstream of the furin cleavage site. ZP3, in which there was no convenient aspartate residue, was digested with PNGase F, which released protein-bound N-glycans and converted Asn330 to aspartic acid. Subsequent Asp-N digestion and LC-MS revealed the presence of the C-terminal peptide 330DSSSSQFQIHGPRQWSKLVSRN351 (Fig. 2C), and its identity was confirmed by CID (y3-y6, y122+ y132+, y152+, y162+ as well as a2, b2, b2-H2O, b3-H2O, b4-H2O). Thus, the C terminus of ZP3 lies at Asn351. Taken together, these mass spectrometric data indicated that the primary cleavage site of native ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 lies N-terminal to a dibasic motif that is part of, but distinct from, the proprotein convertase (furin) cleavage site. Disulfide Linkage Mapping—Blocking with 4-VP at pH 7.2 revealed no S-pyridylethylated cysteine-containing peptides in the mixture, suggesting that all cysteines (at least those detected in the digest) participate in disulfide bonding. In the following discussion, the two disulfide bonded peptide chains have been arbitrarily designated as P1 and P2, priming fragmentations that arise from the latter, e.g. y′. Because the disulfide bridge is sometimes “reductively” cleaved either between or on each side of sulfur, peptide fragment ions will appear carrying either an SH or SSH at the cysteine site, and these are referred to as yr (or y′r) and yd (or y′d), respectively. ZP1 forms a homodimer in the native zona pellucida. It has 21 cysteine residues and the potential to form 10 intramolecular disulfide bonds with the remaining cysteine residue available for intermolecular ZP1-ZP1 linkage. However, due to the low abundance of ZP1 in the zona protein mixture only one disulfide-bonded peptide was detected. The low abundances of the +3 and +4 charged ions at m/z 1351.05 and 1013.50 observed after trypsin digestion arose from 438TDPSLVLLLHQCWATPTTSPFEQPQWPILSDGCPFK473 intramolecularly disulfide-bonded between Cys449 and Cys470 (Fig. 3A and Table I). No CID spectra were obtained, and as expected, both ions disappeared after treatment with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) for 1 h. Unfortunately, the reduced ion 2 Da higher was not available to corroborate the reduction.Table IDisulfide bond linkage mapping of native mouse zona proteinsTable IDisulfide bond linkage mapping of native mouse zona proteins ZP2 has 20 cysteine residues capable of 10 disulfide bonds. Within the zona domain (containing ten cysteines, eight of which are conserved) four out of five possible disulfide bonds were identified (Table I). These linkages were confirmed by observing the disappearance of disulfide-bridged ions described below upon TCEP treatment and/or by sequence obtained from CID. Cys365/Cys457 formed a disulfide pair as observed by ions at m/z 696.832+ (calc. 696.802+) and 464.883+ (calc. 464.873+) derived from the trypsin/Asp-N digest (data not shown). The calculated MH+ of the S-S linked peptides 362DELCAQ367 (P1) and 457CYYIR462 (P2) is 1392.59 Da, which is in good agreement with our experimental values. The CID spectrum of 464.883+ generated partial sequence ions of y1–2 and b2 from P1, as well as y1′ and immonium ion of tyrosine residues from P2 (data not shown). The Cys396/Cys417 disulfide pair in ZP2 was observed by a very low abundance +4 charged ion at m/z 836.41 (MH+ 3342.72). This ion derived from trypsin digestion corresponds to the peptides 382PALNLDTLLVGNSSCQPIFK401 (Asn to Asp conversion at position 393 after PNGase F treatment) joined with 410FHIPLNGCGTR420 via a S-S bond (combined masses of two peptides minus 2 Da). Although the CID spectrum of this ion was unavailable, 836.414+ disappeared after TCEP reduction. Furthermore, two ions showed up at m/z 1066.052+ and 607.812+ that correspond to 382PALNLNTLLVGNSSCQPIFK401 (Asn393 → Asp393) and 410FHIPLNGCGTR420 in their reduced state. This observation adds confidence in the assignment of this disulfide linkage even without CID data. Two more disulfide links in ZP2 provided +3 and +4 charged ions at m/z 1198.59 and 899.19 (MH+ 3593.73), which correspond to the intramolecularly disulfide-bonded peptide 599GLSSLIYFHCSALICNQVSLDSPLCSVTCPASLR632 formed between the four cysteines within the same tryptic peptide (2 disulfide bonds with a loss of 4 Da). The CID spectrum of 1198.933+ did not generate many sequence ions as expected from its size and the two internal cystine linkages. Thus, the actual disulfide pairing among these four cysteines was indeterminate from trypsin digestion alone. However, this problem was resolved when additional Asp-N cleavage revealed the presence of the peptide 619DSPLCSVTCPASLR632 linked via Cys623/Cys627, as detected by ions at m/z 723.872+ and traces of 482.923+. This linkage was corroborated by the disappearance of the ion at m/z 723.872+ after TCEP reduction, and the appearance of an ion at m/z 724.812+ corresponding to the above peptide with its free sulfhydryl groups. Thus, the second disulfide linkage must join Cys608 and Cys613. A disulfide bond between Cys84 and Cys102, near the N terminus of ZP2, outside the zona domain was also identified. The +3, +4, and +5 charged ions at m/z 1269.95, 952.71, and 762.35 (MH+ 3807.87) with strong ion intensities correspond to the accurate mass of the S-S-linked peptides 69WNPSVVDTLGSEILNCTYALDLER92 (P1; Asn83 → Asp83 conversion) and 97F"
https://openalex.org/W1999842111,"The mechanisms by which long-term potentiation (LTP) is expressed are controversial, with evidence for both presynaptic and postsynaptic involvement. We have used confocal microscopy and Ca(2+)-sensitive dyes to study LTP at individual visualized synapses. Synaptically evoked Ca(2+) transients were imaged in distal dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in cultured hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. At most synapses, from as early as 10 min to at least 60 min after induction, LTP was associated with an increase in the probability of a single stimulus evoking a postsynaptic Ca(2+) response. These observations provide compelling evidence of a presynaptic component to the expression of early LTP at Schaffer-associational synapses. In most cases, the store-dependent evoked Ca(2+) transient in the spine was also increased after induction, a novel postsynaptic aspect of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2054087588,"One form of Niemann-Pick disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzymatic activity of acid sphingomyelinase. During efforts to develop an enzyme replacement therapy based on a recombinant form of human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM), purified preparations of the recombinant enzyme were found to have substantially increased specific activity if cell harvest media were stored for several weeks at –20 °C prior to purification. This increase in activity was found to correlate with the loss of the single free thiol on rhASM, suggesting the involvement of a cysteine residue. It was demonstrated that a variety of chemical modifications of the free cysteine on rhASM all result in substantial activation of the enzyme, and the modified cysteine responsible for this activation was shown to be the C-terminal residue (Cys629). Activation was also achieved by copper-promoted dimerization of rhASM (via cysteine) and by C-terminal truncation using carboxypeptidase Y. The role of the C-terminal cysteine in activation was confirmed by creating mutant forms of rhASM in which this residue was either deleted or replaced by a serine, with both forms having substantially higher specific activity than wild-type rhASM. These results indicate that purified rhASM can be activated in vitro by loss of the free thiol on the C-terminal cysteine via chemical modification, dimerization, or deletion of this amino acid residue. This method of activation is similar to the cysteine switch mechanism described previously for matrix metalloproteinases and could represent a means of posttranslational regulation of ASM activity in vivo.

J. 1994; 301: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicate a stepwise processing of a 75-kDa pre-proprotein to an intermediate 72-kDa form inside the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus. The 72-kDa form is further processed to the 70-kDa mature lysosomal enzyme. Smaller forms were also detected in the Golgi and lysosomes. ASM is a glycoprotein with six potential N-glycosylation sites encoded by the amino acid sequence (6Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that at least five of the six sites are utilized (12Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This study also found that elimination of the four sites nearest the N terminus does not disrupt lysosomal targeting, processing, or enzymatic activity. It was shown, however, that removal of the two C-terminal N-glycosylation sites results in either rapid degradation of the primary translation product or the formation of an inactive ASM precursor (12Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ASM has been described in terms of a secretory form and an intracellular, lysosomal form, both derived from the same gene (13Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The secretory form, either from fetal bovine serum (14Spence M.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. Cook H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5358-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from various cultured cells (15Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), displays increased activity in the presence of zinc. Bartelsen et al. (9Bartelsen O. Lansmann S. Nettersheim M. Lemm T. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 63: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) also observed copper-dependent activation for recombinant ASM secreted from insect Sf21 cells. The lysosomal form of ASM, on the other hand, does not require exogenously added zinc for activation and had been referred to as “cation-independent” (15Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Levade T. Salvayre R. Douste-Blazy L. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1986; 24: 205-220PubMed Google Scholar). Schissel et al. (13Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) later found that both the lysosomal and secretory forms can be inactivated by the zinc-specific chelator 1,10-phenanthroline and thus concluded that both forms require zinc for their enzymatic activity. This suggested that zinc is already tightly associated with the cation-independent lysosomal form, making exogenous zinc unnecessary for maximal activity. The secretory and lysosomal forms of ASM have been shown to have differences in their glycosylation as well as differences in N termini (13Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). With regard to post-translational modifications of these two forms, the lysosomal form of ASM has high mannose-type oligosaccharides, required for phosphorylation and lysosomal targeting, whereas the secretory form contains complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides. The difference in trafficking pathways for the two forms has been proposed as the reason for their different exposure to cellular zinc and thus their difference in zinc sensitivity (13Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The N termini of the two forms was shown to be different because of proteolytic processing of the lysosomal form. Whether differences exist in the C termini of the two forms has not yet been determined; however, C-terminal processing has been reported for several other lysosomal enzymes including acid α-glucosidase (17Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2223-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cathepsin D (18Yonezawa S. Takahashi T. Wang X.J. Wong R.N. Hartsuck J.A. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16504-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lloyd J.B. Mason R.W. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. Vol. 27. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Google Scholar). It has been proposed that histidine and glutamate residues may participate in metal-binding sites within ASM, and comparison of the ASM primary sequence with known zinc metalloproteins suggests as many as seven potential zinc-binding sites (13Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The actual stoichiometry of zinc binding and the specific amino acids responsible for coordination of metal ion within ASM remain to be determined. There are 17 cysteines in the ASM sequence. Recently, Lansmann et al. (20Lansmann S. Schuette C.G. Bartelsen O. Hoernschemeyer J. Linke T. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1076-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) assigned the disulfide bond pattern of rhASM purified from a baculovirus expression system. Based on a process of elimination, their work shows that the C-terminal cysteine (Cys629) is the unbridged free cysteine. It has been shown that dithiothreitol (DTT), but not reduced glutathione, inhibits the enzymatic activity of ASM in a concentration-dependent manner (21Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this inactivation is not as yet understood. The inactivation may not be simply due to disulfide reduction, as effects of DTT on protein activity unrelated to disulfide reduction have been reported (22Alliegro M.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that ASM can be activated in terms of its enzymatic activity, such as by lysosomal lipids and the sphingolipid activator protein SAP-C (23Linke T. Wilkening G. Lansmann S. Moczall H. Bartelsen O. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Enzyme replacement therapy has been proven to be an effective means of treating lysosomal storage diseases (24Amalfitano A. Bengur A.R. Morse R.P. Majure J.M. Case L.E. Veerling D.L. Mackey J. Kishnani P. Smith W. McVie-Wylie A. Sullivan J.A. Hoganson G.E. Phillips III, J.A. Schaefer G.B. Charrow J. Ware R.E. Bossen E.H. Chen Y.T. Genet.

With respect to ASM, it has been shown that a recombinant form of the enzyme, expressed in CHO cells, has characteristics consistent with the non-recombinant forms including acid pH optimum, sensitivity to sulfhydryl reducing reagents, and inhibition by a zinc-specific chelator (8He X. Miranda S.R. Xiong X. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In an effort to produce recombinant human ASM (rhASM) as a treatment for Niemann-Pick disease, we have initiated large scale production of a recombinant form of the protein in a CHO cell line engineered to overexpress and secrete rhASM. During the biochemical characterization of the purified protein, it was found that the activity of recombinant, CHO cell-derived rhASM increased when the cell harvests were stored frozen at –20 °C for several weeks prior to purification. This paper describes an investigation of this unexpected activation. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents and supplies were obtained from sources as indicated under “Methods.” rhASM Production—Recombinant human ASM protein (rhASM) was produced using CHO cells transfected with a vector containing a full-length human ASM cDNA, obtained from the IMAGE Consortium (GenBank™ accession number AI587087). In the case of the mutant forms of rhASM, the open reading frame was amplified by PCR utilizing reverse primers in which the terminal cysteine codon, TGC, was either deleted or mutated to TCC (serine). PCR products were cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing a dihydrofolate reductase-selectable marker. Plasmids were sequenced through the entire open reading frame to ensure fidelity of the intended sequence. Dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO-DXB11 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and selection was carried out in nucleotide-deficient media supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.2 μm methotrexate (Calbiochem). rhASM expression levels were further boosted by subjecting the uncloned pools to incremental increases in methotrexate concentration. This process generated several uncloned pools that maintained high level rhASM expression upon the withdrawal of methotrexate. The protein was purified from the CHO-conditioned media by conventional orthogonal chromatographic procedures, including hydrophobic interaction and ion exchange steps. The purified rhASM protein was shown to start with His-Pro-Leu-Ser-Proat the N terminus, corresponding to a 570-amino acid mature protein with signal peptide cleaved between Ala59 and His60 of the published human ASM sequence (6Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This N-terminal sequence is the same as that of the recombinant form of ASM protein produced from insect Sf21 cells (9Bartelsen O. Lansmann S. Nettersheim M. Lemm T. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 63: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and CHO cells (12Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Standard in Vitro Activity Assay—Samples containing rhASM were incubated at 37 °C with the small molecular weight synthetic substrate 2-(N-hexadecanoylamino)-4-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (Calbiochem) at 12.5 mm in 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, and 0.15% Tween 20. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, 0.2 m glycine-NaOH containing 50% ethanol was added to stop the reaction. Activity was determined by calculating the amount of 2-(N-hexadecanoylamino)-4-nitrophenolate produced during the reaction (ϵ415 = 15.0 mm–1 cm–1) and expressed in units/mg protein, where 1 unit is 1 μmol of product formed per min at 37 °C. In the activity assays designed to determine metal ion dependence, rhASM was diluted in the same buffer but with no metal ions present. Various amounts of divalent metal ions were then added to the samples for a 30-min preincubation at 37 °C prior to the addition of 2-(N-hexadecanoylamino)-4-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine substrate, which was prepared in the same buffer as described above but containing no metal ions. Natural Substrate in Vitro Activity Assay—An Amplex Red sphingomyelinase assay (Molecular Probes) was used to determine activity with respect to cleavage of the natural sphingomyelinase substrate sphingomyelin. The assay was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. A coupled reaction involving two additional enzymatic steps is used to measure the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. Briefly, ASM hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphorylcholine, which is then hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase to phosphate and choline. Choline, in turn, is oxidized by choline oxidase to betaine and H2O2. H2O2 then reacts with the Amplex Red reagent to produce highly fluorescent resorufin, which is detected by fluorescence emission at 590 nm. The resulting fluorescence is compared with a resorufin standard cure. ASM activity is expressed in units/mg protein, where 1 unit is defined as the amount of rhASM that generates 1 μmol of resorufin product per min at 37 °C. ASM Incubation in Conditioned and Feed Media—ASM-producing CHO cells were cultured in media containing no serum or other sources of additional protein (proprietary commercial media from Invitrogen). The conditioned media containing secreted ASM protein was collected and stored for up to 160 days at 4, –20, and –80 °C. Samples were taken out at various time points and diluted into activity assay dilution buffer from the in vitro activity assay. In separate experiments, rhASM was purified to homogeneity and then spiked into feed media (no serum or protein) to a final concentration of 0.16 mg/ml. These samples were stored at 4, –20, and –80 °C for up to 4 weeks. The same preparation of purified rhASM was also diluted in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 6.5, as a buffer control. The incubated samples were removed at various time points and subjected to the standard in vitro activity assay. Kinetic Analysis—Activities were determined at 415 nm using varying concentrations of substrate, 2-(N-hexadecanoylamino)-4-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine, in 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, and 0.15% Tween 20. Kinetic parameters were determined from Eadie-Hofstee plots of the resulting data. DTNB Assay—rhASM samples were first concentrated in 20 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. Free thiol content was assessed at 412 nm using 0.8–1.2 mg of rhASM and 0.5 mm DTNB in native and denaturing buffers and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before reading absorbance values. Results were compared with a cysteine standard curve. Copper-promoted Dimer Formation—rhASM protein was dialyzed and diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. CuSO4 (0.1 mm unless specified otherwise) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. The samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% pre-cast Tris-glycine gel (NOVEX) with Coomassie Blue stain. In experiments designed to study disruption of the dimer, DTT or EDTA was added to a final concentration of 100 and 20 mm, respectively, just prior to loading the samples on the gel. Chemical Modification and Fluorescent Labeling—Methyl methane thiosulfonate (MMTS) and Oregon Green® 488 maleimide (OGM, from Molecular Probes) were used to label the free cysteine residue of rhASM. The protein was first diluted in assay dilution buffer to +1.5–3.0 μg/ml, and various amounts of MMTS (50 nm to 50 mm) or OGM (0.2 pm to 20 μm) were added to the protein. The modification was carried out at room temperature for 60 min and then was analyzed for ASM activity. Preparative scale OGM modification was carried out by mixing 350 μl of 1.6 mg/ml rhASM with a 100-fold excess OGM, followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. The excess OGM dye was removed by dialysis. Peptide Mapping and Mass Spectrometry—rhASM was labeled via thiol-specific maleimide chemistry using OGM (from Molecular Probes). The labeled protein was denatured in 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, reduced with 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, alkylated using a slight excess of 4-vinylpyridine (Sigma), and digested overnight with trypsin using an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:20. The digested peptides were fractionated on a C4 Vydac reverse-phase HPLC column using a HP-1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies). Absorbance at 215 and 280 nm was used to monitor the peptide peaks, and absorbance at 495 nm was used to monitor the elution of the OGM-labeled peptide. The labeled peptide was collected, and its molecular weight was analyzed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker BIFLEX). Carboxypeptidase Y Treatment—Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY, obtained from Roche Applied Science) was used to cleave amino acids from the C terminus of the rhASM protein. Various ratios of CPY to rhASM (1:1 to 1:260,000) were combined in 20 mm citrate, 200 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, buffer and incubated on ice for 8 h. The samples were then subjected to activity assay and fluorescent labeling by OGM to measure the remaining free cysteine. Labeled rhASM was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (NOVEX) and visualized on a fluorescence reader (FACE imager from Glyko) to quantify the intensity of the bands. The CPY reaction was also carried out using immobilized CPY beads (Pierce) to confirm the results from the solution digest. Briefly, aliquots of 1 mg/ml rhASM (0.1 ml) were mixed with 10 μl of the CPY beads on top of a 0.45 μm spin filter (Ultrafree-MC from Millipore). The digested protein was spun through the filter to remove the immobilized CPY at various time points, and the filtrate was then assayed for ASM activity. Increased rhASM Activity with Storage of Cell Harvests at –20 °C—rhASM was expressed in a stably transfected recombinant CHO cell line. After harvest of the secreted protein, it was observed that the rhASM activity in the conditioned media increased under certain conditions of storage. A systematic study was carried out to monitor the activity change by incubation at three storage temperatures (Fig. 1A). It was found that rhASM activity is stable if the harvest media is stored at –80 °C, with no change seen over a 160-day period. However, a large increase in ASM activity was seen upon storage of the harvest media at –20 °C (+10-fold by 160 days). There was only a slight increase in activity when the media were stored at 4 °C. To determine whether the increase in activity at –20 °C was due to a change in the specific activity of rhASM itself or whether it might be due to interaction with other molecules (e.g. association with an activator or loss of an inhibitor), rhASM was purified to homogeneity from harvest media. One preparation was made from fresh harvest media (designated the “low activity form” of rhASM in this study) and a second preparation was made from media that had been stored at –20 °C for 3 months (designated the “high activity form” of rhASM in this study). Activity measurements of the purified rhASM from these two preparations indicated a substantial difference in specific activity for the two as follows: 17.3 units/mg for the preparation from fresh harvest versus 80.2 units/mg for the preparation from harvest stored at –20 °C. Thus, purified enzyme from harvests stored at –20 °C has +5-fold higher specific activity than enzyme purified from fresh harvests. Neither purified preparation contained significant breakdown products, indicating that activation was not a result of degradation during storage (see Fig. 2). A kinetic analysis of the two forms of rhASM was performed using varying concentrations of a synthetic substrate, 2-(N-hexadecanoylamino)-4-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine. Kinetic parameters were determined from Eadie-Hofstee plots of the resulting data (Table I). The two enzyme preparations bind the substrate with comparable Km values; however, the overall reaction turnover (V max) is increased about 4–5-fold for the higher activity lot. This suggests that the activity difference is due to differences in their catalytic effectiveness. It should be noted that the Km values reported here for the synthetic substrate 2-(N-hexadecanoylamino)-4-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (1.7 and 1.9 mm) are substantially higher than those obtained with the natural substrate, sphingomyelin, as reported previously (32 μm for recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (26Zhang Y. Mattjus P. Schmid P.C. Dong Z. Zhong S. Ma W.Y. Brown R.E. Bode A.M. Schmid H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11775-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). This is probably caused by less effective binding of the synthetic substrate.Table IKinetic analysis of high and low activity ASM proteinsrhASM proteinKmVmaxmmunits/mgLow activity form1.721.1High activity form1.992.8 Open table in a new tab The purified high and low activity forms were further analyzed in a number of different biochemical and biophysical assays including SDS-PAGE, reverse-phase HPLC purity, circular dichroism (far-UV), and oligosaccharide profiling. No significant differences between the two forms were observed (data not shown). Both forms were inhibited by DTT (+50% inhibition at 1 mm DTT), consistent with prior reports of the effect of DTT on ASM activity (21Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These results indicated no major structural or obvious biochemical differences between the two forms of rhASM protein. Because the harvest media present during the –20 °C activation contained not only media components but also secreted proteins and other compounds from the CHO cells, an experiment was performed to determine whether cellular factors are required for the activation. Samples of the purified low activity form of rhASM were incubated with fresh feed media at 4, –20, and –80 °C, and the activity was monitored over a period of several weeks (Fig. 1B). The results of this incubation were similar to what was found for the incubation of the cell harvest. Again, rhASM was substantially activated upon incubation at –20 °C but not at 4 or –80 °C. The activation was not observed in the incubation in Hepes buffer control for all three temperatures. Because there was no protein or serum present in this feed media, it is clear that one or more of the small molecular weight components in the media cause rhASM activation via a process that is most favored at –20 °C. Free Thiol Content of the Two Forms of rhASM—The free thiol content in the two forms of rhASM protein was assessed with a DTNB assay. Approximately 0.96 mol of thiol/mol of protein was measured in the low activity form of rhASM, when the assay was carried out in 4 m guanidine HCl, whereas the high activity form had 0.02 mol of thiol/mol of protein. It appears that the single free thiol group in the low activity form of rhASM is lost during the –20 °C incubation and thus is undetectable in the high activity form. Free cysteine could also be detected in the low activity form in the absence of guanidine HCl but with a lower number during the standard 10-min DTNB incubation time (0.4 mol of thiol/mol of protein). Increasing the incubation time with DTNB from 10 to 60 min resulted in an increased thiol number (1.0 mol of thiol/mol). This suggests that the cysteine is only partially solvent-accessible or that it is constrained and some conformational perturbation is necessary for its reactivity with DTNB. This result also suggests that the rhASM protein is highly structured, as would be expected because 16 of the 17 cysteines in rhASM are paired (20Lansmann S. Schuette C.G. Bartelsen O.

H. perforatum leaves are widely used as an herbal remedy in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. Hypericin, a photosensitive and red-colored naphthodianthrone, has been reported as the bioactive compound responsible for reversing the depression symptoms. In this study a novel red-color-based colony screening method for examining a cDNA library (λ-TriplEX2) derived from H. perforatum cell cultures revealed the gene responsible for hypericin biosynthesis after the administration of emodin, a precursor of hypericin. The selected clones were expressed in Escherichia coli (BM 25.8 line) and were further screened for biosynthesis of emodin to hypericin, which resulted in an 84.6% conversion.

Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed high levels of Hyp-1 transcripts in dark-grown cell cultures compared with the levels in light-grown cell cultures and leaves. Southern blot analysis showed the presence of a single Hyp-1 gene in H. perforatum. Furthermore, Hyp-1 was expressed with a His6 affinity tag linked to its N terminal region using the expression vector pET-28a, and the recombinant Hyp-1 protein was able to convert HyH from emodin under in vitro conditions.

Plants have been estimated to collectively synthesize more than 100,000 different secondary metabolites, many of which have applications as medicinal compounds (1Dixon R.A.

Beyer D. J. Affect. Disord. 1998; 51: 245-251Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Standardized extracts of St. John's wort containing 3% HyH have been successfully tested in numerous studies for the treatment of mild to moderate depression (2Deltito J. Beyer D. J. Affect.

The majority of commercially available St. John's wort formulations are crude extracts containing minor proportions of HyH combined with flavonoids, phenols, tannins, and volatile oils, which may account for some of the reported side effects of the extracts (5Vogel G.

Studies have shown that St. John's wort formulations may activate the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) pathway, accelerating the breakdown of other drugs (5Vogel G. Science. 2001; 291: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Bray B.J. Brennan N.J. Perry N. Menkes D.B. Rosengren R.J. Life Sci. 2002; 70: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For instance, the blood concentrations of the anti-clotting drug warfarin were dramatically reduced when taken together with St. John's wort extracts (5Vogel G. Science. 2001; 291: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Schulz V. Phytomedicine. 2001; 8: 152-160PubMed Google Scholar). Similar drug dilution cases were observed with birth control pills and coronary transplant anti-rejection medications (5Vogel G. Science. 2001; 291: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate some metabolites other than HyH as the cause of these unwanted drug interactions in St. John's wort extracts (5Vogel G. Science. 2001; 291: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Kientsch U. Burgi S. Ruedeberg C. Pharmacopsychiatry. 2001; 34: 56-60Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the purification and bioprocessing of HyH, the antidepressant compound in St. John's wort, may be of medical importance in the treatment of depression, and in avoiding the side effects associated with this herbal remedy. Little is known about the biosynthesis of hypericin other than that it lies on the polyketide pathway, presumably through emodin (Fig. 1) (10Mazur, Y., Bock, H., and Lavie, D. (1992) United States Patent 0432496.Google Scholar), and with protohypericin as the penultimate precursor (11Leistner A.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1971; 27: 347-349Google Scholar). Synthetically, it is readily prepared by treating emodin dianthrone with ferrous sulfate and pyridine-N-oxide in pyridine, followed by light irradiation of the formed protohypericin (10Mazur, Y., Bock, H., and Lavie, D. (1992) United States Patent 0432496.Google Scholar, 11Leistner A.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1971; 27: 347-349Google Scholar). This synthesis could be in part a biomimetic one. However, nothing is known about the sequence of steps in H. perforatum or other plants that lead to protohypericin and finally to HyH, and no enzymes or genes in this pathway have been purified or cloned. We developed an approach to identify the gene(s) responsible for the biosynthesis of HyH using a cDNA library constructed from H. perforatum cell cultures, supplemented with emodin (a possible precursor for HyH) and using a novel color-based screening methodology. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein revealed saturation kinetics for different concentrations of emodin. Other physiological factors such as the effect of divalent ions, ATP, temperature, and pH were also analyzed for their influence on enzyme activity. Our results also show variable product inhibition patterns by different structure analogues of emodin. Our studies show that the gene involved in HyH biosynthesis from emodin has a close homology to Bet.v.1 class allergens and that its enzymatic activity may involve a condensation followed by dehydration and two oxidative coupling reactions. Seeds of H. perforatum L. (S5195) were obtained from Richters, Ontario, Canada. Plant growth regulators were obtained from Sigma Co. (St. Louis, MO). Emodin structure analogues, rhein and rhein methyl ester were from the Stermitz laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, and DNA3-55-1 was obtained from Dr. Juanne Romagni, University of St. Thomas, Texas. All other chemicals were of analytical and HPLC grade and were obtained from Sigma Co. unless specified. Callus cultures were initiated using leaves from a 10-day-old H. perforatum plant grown in vitro as previously described by Bais et al. (12Bais H.P. Walker T.S. McGrew J.J. Vivanco J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Plant. 2002; 38: 58-65Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell suspension cultures were established from the callus cultures and were maintained in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 ml of nutrient MS (13Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (0.90 μm), kinetin (0.11 μm), and sucrose (30 g liter–1) by biweekly sub-culturing on a rotary shaker at 90 rpm maintained at 25 ± 2 °C. Cell cultures of 1-month-old H. perforatum plants were collected and the total soluble proteins from the roots were extracted as described before by Vivanco et al. (14Vivanco J.M. Savary B.J. Flores H.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of total proteins (0.5–30 μg ml–1) and emodin (0.5–30 μg ml–1) were incubated with a buffer comprised of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 167 mm KCl, and 100 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2 for 24 h at 4 °C under dark conditions. The incubation mixture was extracted with hexane overnight, and the hexane solutions were concentrated to dryness under N2. The dried powder obtained after incubation of emodin with the total cell culture proteins was further extracted using 5 ml of absolute ethanol (Fisher Co.) and was sonicated (Branson Co., ∼60 Hz) for 10 min. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was further concentrated by freeze-drying (Model 25LL, Virtis, Genesis), and the powder was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol (Fisher). The samples were prepared for LC analysis after filtration through a 0.2-μm filter (Gelman Sciences). Samples were chromatographed by gradient elution on a reverse-phase, 5-μm, C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, Supelco). The chromatographic system consisted of P580 pumps (Dionex) connected to an ASI-100 Automated Sample Injector (Dionex). The visible absorbance at 590 nm was measured by a PDA-100 photodiode array variable UV-visible detector (Dionex). Mobile phase solution A consisted of a 70% solution of 1% ammonium phosphate (adjusted to 7.0 pH with NaOH) and 30% acetonitrile (Fisher); solution B was 70% acetonitrile and 30% water. A multistep gradient was set up for HyH estimation as described by Bais et al. (12Bais H.P. Walker T.S. McGrew J.J. Vivanco J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Plant. 2002; 38: 58-65Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with an initial injection volume of 15 μl and a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. HyH was quantified at 590 nm. Authentic HyH was purchased from Sigma Co., and samples were compared with the HyH standard on the basis of retention time and peak area. Chromelon software (Dionex) was used for peak integration analyses. The LC eluant was injected into an API-2000 mass spectrometer (Dionex) at a flow rate of 0.25-ml min–1. The MS parameters were optimized using HyH as the reference standard compound. Subsequent high gas temperature (200 °C) and gas flow (50 p.s.i.) were applied to the LC-MS parameters. HyH [(M–H)– 504.5)] (minus one proton after proton-proton splitting) was used for negative mode monitoring to produce a negatively charged molecule. Scan ranges of 100–750 atomic mass units (milliabsorbance units) were used for negative ions. A step size of 1 atomic mass unit and a dwell time of 1 ms was used during the analysis. Our earlier studies indicate that cells of H. perforatum grown in dark conditions result in efficient production of HyH as compared with cells grown under light conditions (12Bais H.P. Walker T.S. McGrew J.J. Vivanco J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Plant. 2002; 38: 58-65Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Walker T.S. Bais H.P. Vivanco J.M. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); hence for the present study dark-grown cells of H. perforatum were used for cDNA library construction. RNA was extracted from 21-day-old cell suspension cultures of H. perforatum. Dark-grown H. perforatum cells were powdered in liquid nitrogen, and the total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 1 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase (RT) (Clontech, Powerscript™ RT). The cDNA was amplified by 20 cycles of long distance PCR. The amplified DNA was phenol-extracted, digested with SfiI, and ligated into a λ-TriplEX2 vector using the SMART™ cDNA construction kit (Clontech, PTR30001). The λ-TriplEX2 vector was packed into an SBET phage using the Packgene® Lamda DNA packaging system (Promega). A λ-TriplEX2 vector containing the H. perforatum cDNA library was plated with Escherichia coli (XL-1 blue cell line) for screening. The percentage of recombinant clones was determined by blue/white screening in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Primary screening of the λ-TriplEX2 library for genes involved in the biosynthesis of HyH was performed after 16-h incubation at 37 °C under dark conditions by spreading emodin (20 μg ml–1) on the bacterial lawns and selecting the phage plaques that turned pale yellow emodin into red-colored HyH. Twelve positive plaques were selected and re-screened after amplification. Secondary screening of amplified plaques was performed identically to the primary screening by addition of 20 μg ml–1 emodin to the overnight grown plaque lawn. Colonies, which turned red instantly, were picked with a micro-tip and then converted to pTriplEx2 in Escherichia coli (BM 25.8) by in vivo excision and circularization into a complete plasmid from the recombinant phage. For the large scale conversion of emodin to HyH, selected E. coli clones were cultured overnight under dark conditions in LB (16Luria S.E. Bertini J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 461-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) broth media (50 ml in a 150-ml Erlenmeyer flask). Subsequently, emodin was added (20 μg ml–1) to visualize and quantify the bioconverted HyH using LC-MS as described previously. Interconverted bacterial cells (BM 25.8) and selected plaques from secondary and tertiary screening were picked using a micropipette tip. The pTriplEX2 sequencing primers provided with the SMART™ cDNA construction kit (Clontech, PTR30001) were used to perform PCR for the determination of insert sizes. The bacterial cells, cell-free media filtrate, and plaques, obtained from secondary and tertiary screening, were extracted as per the methodology described earlier and analyzed by HPLC-MS for HyH identification. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and used for sequencing (Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis, CA). The sequence was analyzed, followed by amino acid alignment to compare homologous proteins using VectorNTI Suite software (Informax, Bethesda, MD). The template for the probe was obtained by PCR with gene-specific primers deduced from a full-length sequence from the interconverted BM 25.8 bacterial clones. The PCR product was separated on agarose and extracted from the gel using a Quantum Prep Gel Slice kit (Bio-Rad). The DNA was then labeled with [32P]ATP using random primers from the DECAprime II Random Priming DNA labeling kit (Ambion). This labeled sequence was then used as a probe for Northern analysis. Total genomic DNA was extracted from in vitro grown plants using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of total genomic DNA was digested over-night using three different restriction enzymes (RE): EcoRI, HindIII, and BamH1. The digests were separated on 1% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes (Biodyne, Pall Gelman Laboratory), and probed with a 32P-labeled sequence obtained by PCR. Using an RNeasy® Plant Mini kit (Qiagen), we extracted the total RNA from leaves, roots, and shoots grown in vitro, and from light- and dark-grown cell suspension cultures. 500 ng of RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using a SMART™ cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, PTR30001). Reverse transcription was performed according to the instructions for the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Clontech, PTR30001) using a set of primers specific to the internal control gene, Hyp-1 (5′-ATGGCGGCGTACACTATTGTTAAGGAGG-3′; 5′-GGATTAGCAGCAAGGTATTCTTCCAC-3′), and a set of primers specific to the housekeeping gene for β-tubulin in the different reaction mixture, because they had the same size constraint (∼500 bp). An aliquot (5 μl) of each PCR reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis through an agarose-ethidium bromide gel. Ethidium bromide intensities in each band were quantified using an Alpha Imager 1220 digital imaging system (Alpha Inotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Recombinant Hyp-1 protein was expressed with His6 affinity tag linked to its N terminus region using the expression vector pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). pET-Hyp-1, carrying the full-length Hyp-1 gene, was constructed by PCR amplification using the primers: F5′-TTCATATGGCGGCGTACACTATTGTTAAGG incorporating a NdeI site and R5′-TTGGATCCGGATTAGCAGCAAGGTATTCTTCCAC incorporating a BamHI site. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega), and the plasmid was isolated using a plasmid mini-prep from a single colony. The Hyp-1 sequence was cleaved from the pGEM®-T Easy plasmid with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pET-28a digested with the same enzymes. The pET-Hyp plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) for protein expression studies. Freshly grown BL21(DE3)pLysS-containing pET-Hyp-1 was induced for gene expression with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and the bacterial proteins were subsequently extracted by sonication. The recombinant Hyp-1 protein was purified using Ni2+-chelate chromatography using an His-Trap kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The bacterial extract was applied to the column dissolved in 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole buffer (pH 7.5) and washed with the same buffer to remove unbound proteins. The column was then washed with 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole to remove proteins that were bound nonspecifically. Finally, the recombinant Hyp-1 protein was eluted from the column with 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. The purity of the recombinant Hyp-1 protein was analyzed by silver staining of the eluted fraction separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The recombinant Hyp-1 protein was incubated with emodin using the methodology described earlier, and HyH biosynthesis was analyzed by HPLC-MS for HyH identification. Precursor Concentration—Activity for HyH formation was checked in 100 μl of 0.05 m of phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing different concentrations of precursor (emodin, 0.55–22.2 μm) at 25 °C. The enzymatic activity was measured after the addition of 10 μg ml–1 of recombinant Hyp-1 protein over an assay time of 10 min. The substrate conversion to HyH was quantified by a spectrophotometric detection (Bio-Rad SmartSpec-3000™) at 588 nm. The specific activity was expressed in micrograms per milliliter of HyH produced per minute (μg ml–1 min–1). Enzymatic activity measurements were conducted in triplicate. The K m and V max values for the HyH were determined under the conditions described above. All K m and V max values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis and represented in Lineweaver-Burk plot. Metal Elicitation and ATP Dependence Studies—The effect of divalent metal ions for spiking HyH formation at varying concentrations of precursor emodin was studied by supplementing 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with CaCl2 (10–200 μm), MgCl2 (10–60 mm), and MnSO4 (10–60 μm) to the incubation mixture. For ATP dependence studies 100–600 μm ATP was included in the incubation mixture and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Enzyme Stability Assays—The thermal stability profile of recombinant Hyp-1 enzyme was obtained by measuring the enzymatic activity in 100 μl of 0.05 m of phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing different concentrations of precursor (emodin, 0.55–22.2 μm) with varying temperature conditions (25–60 °C). Standard measurements were carried out as described above. The pH stability profile of the recombinant enzyme was obtained by measuring the enzymatic activity in 100 μl of 0.05 m of phosphate buffer, containing different concentrations of emodin (0.55–22.2 μm) with varying pH conditions (5.0–9.0). Product estimation was carried as described previously. Product Inhibition Assay—Structure analogues for emodin, DNA3-55-1, rhein, and rhein methyl ester were prepared at stock concentrations of 0.92–36 μm in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The inhibitory effect of the analogues was studied at fixed concentrations of emodin (0.42 μm) by including increasing concentrations of the analogues. All assays with DNA3-55-1, rhein, and rhein methyl ester were conducted with 10 μg ml–1 of recombinant Hyp-1 protein, with an assay time of 10 min. The product formation was quantified as described previously. Hypothetical Pathway for HyH Production in Cell Cultures of H. perforatum—The initial steps in the biosynthesis of HyH are derived from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA conversions (10Mazur, Y., Bock, H., and Lavie, D. (1992) United States Patent 0432496.Google Scholar). These steps are followed by cyclization steps leading to the formation of an anthrone derivative, which may further bifurcate to form emodin and emodin anthrone (Fig. 1). Early laboratory syntheses involved many steps and low yields, but HyH could be prepared with a 63% yield from emodin dianthrone, which is available synthetically from commercially available emodin (10Mazur, Y., Bock, H., and Lavie, D. (1992) United States Patent 0432496.Google Scholar). We hypothesized that in H. perforatum conversion of emodin to HyH may be due to an enzymatic dimerization reaction. In support of this hypothesis, we found traces of emodin in H. perforatum cell cultures (data not shown). Incubation of Emodin with Cell-free Total Proteins Isolated from Cell Cultures of H. perforatum—We conducted in vitro feeding experiments with emodin and total proteins from dark-grown cell cultures of H. perforatum. Emodin (17.5 μg ml–1) incubated with 12.5 μg ml–1 of total protein extracts resulted in its maximum bioconversion to HyH (Fig. 2, A and B). We varied the amount of precursors and total protein extracts, with the time of incubation remaining constant. Fig. 2B shows the results of feeding emodin (0.5–30 μg ml–1) to the total protein extracts (0.5–30 μg ml–1) from cell cultures. Emodin (15 μg ml–1) incubated overnight with 15 μg ml–1 of total protein extracts resulted in the maximum bioconversion to HyH (Fig. 2B). The presence of biosynthesized HyH was further confirmed by MS analysis (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed the presence of enzymatic activity in the protein extracts, which catalyzed HyH biosynthesis from emodin under dark conditions. cDNA Cloning and Precursor-based Screening of λ-Phage—A cDNA library was constructed by isolating RNA from dark-grown cell suspension cultures of H. perforatum using the λ-TriplEX2 vector. Primary screening of a cDNA library was performed from the unamplified library using E. coli (XL-1 blue cell line). After a 16-h incubation at 37 °C, positive plaques were selected by white/blue color screening to obtain stable transfectants and selected white clones turned red post-emodin administration. The plaques were amplified and used for interconversion in E. coli (BM 25.8) cell lines. Functional Analysis of Positive Clones and Conversion to HyH—The interconverted BM 25.8 cell lines formed unique red-colored colonies instantly upon emodin (20 μgml–1) administration under dark conditions (Fig. 2D). The red colonies were isolated and checked for insert size using the pTriplEX2 primers. Most of the positive clones showed a fragment of ∼1 kb upon PCR analysis (data not shown), and all positive clones in BM 25.8 were tested for bioconversion efficacy using HPLC-MS analysis. It was observed that three clones showed an efficient conversion from emodin to HyH compared with the control BM 25.8 cell line without the insert (Fig. 3, A and B). Clone 3 showed the maximum HyH conversion (84.6%) efficiency compared with the other positive clones (Fig. 3B). Additionally, it was observed that the interconverted clone 3 resulted in the conversion of emodin (20 μg ml–1) to HyH at large scale levels under dark conditions (Fig. 3C). E. coli (BM 25.8) cells without the insert and basal LB medium did not convert to HyH post-emodin (20 μg ml–1) administration (Fig. 3D). The plasmid DNA containing cDNA inserts was prepared using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and was used for dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Sequence Analysis and Homology to Bet.v.1 Class Allergen— The cDNA of Hyp-1 sequence has 725 bp with an open reading frame of 480 nucleotides (including stop codons), thus coding for a protein of 159 amino acid residues (Fig. 4, A and B). All positive clones analyzed contained a 3′ non-coding region of 188 nucleotides between the stop codon and a poly(A) tail. Because the cloned gene is considered responsible for biosynthesis of HyH, it was termed Hyp-1. A BLAST search using the deduced amino acid sequence of Hyp-1 produced significant alignments with the Bet.v.1/PR-10 family of proteins found in a wide variety of species (Fig. 4B). Protein sequence comparisons revealed significant homology between Hyp-1 and a major apple allergen (Mal d1) with a 45.1% homology, followed by Cor-a-1.04, a major hazelnut pollen allergen (17Luttkopf D. Muller U. Skov P.S. Ballmer-Weber B.K. Wuthrich B. Skamstrup Hansen K. Poulsen L.K. Kastner M. Huastein D. Veiths S. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with 43.4% identity in amino acid sequence to Hyp-1 (Fig. 4B). Additionally, Hyp-1 showed significant homology with various other classes of allergens, including Pru-a-1, a major cherry allergen (43.1%) (18Scheurer S. Metzner K. Haustein D. Veiths S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Bet.v.1 (41.5%) from hornbeam (19Hoffmann-Sommerberger K. Krebitz M.A. Rauder C. Wen J. Ferreira F. Scheiner O. Breitender H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a Fagus salvatica allergen (44.3%) (20Calvo A.P. Lorenzo O. Nicolas C. Rodreguez D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). The amino acid sequence analysis indicates that Hyp-1 has a molecular mass of 17.8 kDa with a pI of 5.54. The motif scan for the sequence of Hyp-1 shows similarity with the Bet.v.1 family (pathogenesis-related proteins) signature motif. The signature G-X 2-[LIVMF]-X 4-E-X 2-[CSTAEN]-X 8,9-[GND]-G-[GS]-[CS]-X 2-K-X 4-[FY], which is a characteristic of Bet.v.1, is positioned at 89–120 amino acid residues in Hyp-1. Expression of Hyp-1 Gene in H. perforatum—RT-PCR analysis of the total RNA from different parts of H. perforatum, including roots, stems, leaves, and cell cultures, indicates that this gene is present throughout the tissues with elevated transcript levels in dark-grown cell cultures of H. perforatum (Fig. 5A). The recombinant E. coli line also showed the higher titers of transcripts for Hyp-1 (Fig. 5A). As observed previously, Hyp-1 gene expression was higher in cells cultured under dark conditions compared with light-grown cells and in vitro grown leaves (Fig. 5A) (12Bais H.P. Walker T.S. McGrew J.J. Vivanco J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Plant. 2002; 38: 58-65Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Walker T.S. Bais H.P. Vivanco J.M. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Southern Analysis—To study the number of genes homologous to Hyp-1 in H. perforatum, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI, resolved on agarose gel, and blotted. None of the enzymes used for digestion cut the Hyp-1 cDNA sequence. The blot was probed with 32P labeled Hyp-1 sequence. A single band appeared in all these digestions. All the lanes show one band with stronger hybridization, suggesting the thick band could be due to hybridization with the Hyp-1 sequence. The southern hybridizatio"

Stimulation of FAAH occurred through up-regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and translational level and was specific. Indeed, neither the activity of the anandamide-synthesizing N-acyltransferase and phospholipase D, nor the activity of the anandamide transporter, nor the binding to cannabinoid receptors were affected by progesterone under the same experimental conditions. The activation of FAAH by progesterone was paralleled by a decrease (down to 60%) of the cellular levels of anandamide and involved increased nuclear levels of the transcription factor Ikaros. Analysis of the FAAH promoter showed an Ikaros binding site, and mutation of this site prevented FAAH activation by progesterone in transient expression assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays further corroborated the promoter activity data. Furthermore, the effect of progesterone on FAAH promoter was additive to that of physiological amounts of leptin, which binds to a cAMP response element-like site in the promoter region. Taken together, these results suggest that progesterone and leptin, by up-regulating the FAAH promoter at different sites, enhance FAAH expression, thus tuning the immunomodulatory effects of anandamide. These findings might also have critical implications for human fertility.

Massi P. Rubino T. Monti E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 319-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) has attracted growing interest. These biological actions of AEA are terminated by cellular uptake through an AEA membrane transporter (AMT) (5Fowler C.J. Jacobsson S.O.P. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), followed by degradation to ethanolamine and arachidonic acid by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (6Deutsch D.G. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Human lymphocytes have functional CBR, AMT, and FAAH, and the latter enzyme has been shown to play a critical role in regulating human pregnancy (7Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1326-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Progesterone (P) is a hormone essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and is also known to modulate immune function (8Correale J. Arias M. Gilmore W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3365-3374PubMed Google Scholar) and to elicit an immunological response critical for normal gestation (9Szekeres-Bartho J. Faust Zs. Varga P. Szereday L. Kelemen K. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1996; 35: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Indeed, P has been shown to favor the development of human T lymphocytes producing type 2 T-helper (Th2) cytokines (interleukins 4 and 10), which inhibit Th1-type cytokines (interleukin-12 and interferon-γ), thus allowing the survival of fetal allograft and therefore a successful pregnancy (10Piccinni M.P. Giudizi M.G. Biagiotti R. Beloni L. Giannarini L. Sampognaro S. Parronchi P. Manetti R. Annunziato F. Livi C. Romagnani S. Maggi E. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 128-133PubMed Google Scholar, 11Piccinni M.P. Beloni L. Livi C. Maggi E. Scarselli G. Romagnani S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In this context, the activity of FAAH in maternal peripheral lymphocytes is under control of progesterone, which binds to its intracellular receptor and activates FAAH expression (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the release of cytokines critical for fertility, such as the leukemia inhibitory factor, is favored (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, lymphocyte FAAH has been shown to control the levels of blood AEA in pregnant women, where low FAAH activity implies high AEA levels, leading to spontaneous abortion (7Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1326-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Maccarrone M. Bisogno T. Valensise H. Lazzarin N. Fezza F. Manna C. Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agrò A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data have suggested a cross-talk between steroid hormones, cytokines, and the peripheral endocannabinoid system in lymphocytes, which is implicated in regulating immunity and fertility in humans (14Maccarrone M. Falciglia K. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also leptin (L), the 16-kDa non-glycosylated product of the obese gene, serves systemic functions, which include regulation of fertility (15Cunningham M.J. Clifton D.K. Steiner R.A. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and modulation of immune response (16Matarese G. La Cava A. Sanna V. Lord G.M. Lechler R.I. Fontana S. Zappacosta S. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, L has been shown to reduce the levels of AEA in the hypotalamus of ob/ob mice, suggesting that this compound partakes of the neural circuitry regulated by L (17Di Marzo V. Goparaju S.K. Wang L. Liu J. Batkai S. Jarai Z. Fezza F. Miura G.I. Palmiter R.D. Sugiura T. Kunos G. Nature. 2001; 410: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). In addition, L enhances FAAH expression by activating a CRE (cAMP response element)-like site in the promoter region (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on this background, we sought to investigate whether P might regulate AEA metabolism in human T lymphocytes. In fact, we show an enhancement of FAAH activity and expression by P, triggered through overexpression of the Ikaros (Ik) transcription factor (19Wargnier A. Lafaurie C. Legros-Maida S. Bourge J.-F. Sigaux F. Sasportes M. Pauli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35326-35331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Sun L. Heerema N. Crotty L. Wu X. Navara C. Vassilev A. Sensel M. Reaman G.H. Uckun F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and subsequent Ik-dependent up-regulation of promoter activity. We also show that the effect of P is synergistic with that of L. Materials—Chemicals were of the purest analytical grade. AEA, P, mifepristone (RU486), L (human recombinant), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-N-palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Sigma. [3H]AEA (223 Ci/mmol) and [3H]CP55.940 (5-(1,1′-dimethyheptyl)-2-[1R,5R-hydroxy-2R-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]phenol; 126 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-phosphatidyl[2-14C]ethanolamine (55 mCi/mmol) and 1,2-di[1-14C]palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (111 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies were elicited in rabbits against the conserved FAAH sequence VGYYETDNYTMPSPAMR (21Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2238-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) conjugated to ovalbumin and were prepared by Primm S.r.l. (Milan, Italy). Rabbit anti-Ik antiserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (GAR-AP) were from Bio-Rad. Isolation and Treatment of T Lymphocytes—Blood samples (20 ml per donor) were drawn from the antecubital vein of healthy donors (age range 28–35 years), who gave informed consent to the study, and were collected into heparinized sterile tubes. Clearance of the local Ethics Committee was obtained to sue the human cells. Peripheral lymphocytes were purified by gradient centrifugation, using the density separation medium Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway), and then T-cells were isolated from the whole lymphocyte population by means of the Dynal CD2 CELLection kit (Dynal, Olso, Norway), as reported previously (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Purified T lymphocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in ventilated 25-ml flasks (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Incubation of T lymphocytes with P, alone or in the presence of different compounds, was performed at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, at the indicated concentrations and for the indicated periods of time. Cells were treated for 1 h in serum-free medium, and then heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was added at a final concentration of 10% (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Controls were incubated with vehicles alone. Cell viability after each treatment was tested by trypan blue dye exclusion and was found to be higher than 90% in all cases. FAAH Activity and Expression—FAAH (arachidonoylethanolamide amidase; EC 3.5.1.4) activity was assayed at pH 9.0 with 10 μm [3H]AEA as substrate, by the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography method described previously (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FAAH activity was expressed as pmol of arachidonate released per min per mg of protein. Cell homogenates (20 μg/lane) were prepared as described previously (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), to quantify FAAH protein. Wells were coated with human T-cell homogenates (20 μg/well), which were then reacted with anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:300), as first antibody, and with GAR-AP, diluted 1:2000, as second antibody (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In a previous study, the anti-FAAH antibodies have been shown to recognize a single band in human lymphocytes by Western blot analysis (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Color development of the alkaline phosphatase reaction was measured at 405 nm, using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The A 405 values could not be converted into FAAH concentrations, because the purified enzyme is not available to make calibration curves. However, the ELISA test was linear in the range 0–50 μg/well of cell homogenate, and its specificity for FAAH was validated by antigen competition experiments (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using total RNA isolated from human T lymphocytes (10 × 106 cells) by means of the S.N.A.P.™ total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), as described previously (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). RT-PCR amplification of FAAH was performed using 100 ng of total RNA, and the EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as reported previously (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The amplification parameters were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C. Linear amplification was observed after 20 cycles. The primers for FAAH were as follows: (+), 5′-TGGAAGTCCTCCAAAAGCCCAG; (–), 5′-TGTCCATAGACACAGCCCTTCAG. Five μl of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the RT-PCR products were excised from the gel and counted in a LKB1214 Rackbeta scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences) (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Products were validated by size determination and sequencing, as described previously (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Analysis of N-Acyltransferase, Phospholipase D, Anandamide Uptake, and Cannabinoid Receptors—N-Acyltransferase (NAT) assay was performed as described previously (22Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 1,2-di[1-14C]palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1 × 106 dpm/test) as substrate and measuring the formation of N-[14C]palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamines by high performance thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates (Sigma). 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine was used as standard, and NAT activity was expressed as pmol of N-palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine formed per min per mg of protein (22Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of phospholipase D (PLD; EC 3.1.4.4) was assayed in T-cell homogenates by measuring the release of [14C]ethanolamine from 1,2-dioleoyl-3-phosphatidyl-[2-14C]ethanolamine (10 μm), as described previously (23Moesgaard B. Petersen G. Jaroszewski J.W. Hansen H.S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 985-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD activity was expressed as pmol of ethanolamine released per min per mg of protein. The uptake of 200 nm [3H]AEA by intact T lymphocytes (2 × 106/test) through AMT was studied as described previously (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and was expressed as pmol of AEA taken up per min per mg of protein. For CBR studies, membrane fractions prepared from T lymphocytes (10 × 106) as reported previously (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for no longer than 1 week. These membrane fractions were used in rapid filtration assays with the synthetic cannabinoid [3H]CP55.940 (used at 400 pm), as reported previously (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm “cold” agonist (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Receptor binding was expressed as fmol of ligand bound per mg of protein. Analysis of the Endogenous Levels of AEA and 2-Arachidonoyglycerol (2-AG)—The endogenous levels of AEA and 2-AG in human T lymphocytes (50 × 106/test) were assayed at NIAAA/National Institutes of Health by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, using an Agilent 1100 series LC-MSD equipped with a thermostated autosampler and column compartment, as reported previously (24Wang L. Liu J. Harvey-White J. Zimmer A. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis was also corroborated by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry, performed in Rome as described previously (25Gubellini P. Picconi B. Bari M. Battista N. Calabresi P. Centone D. Bernardi G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Maccarrone M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of Nuclear Levels of Ikaros—For the determination of Ik isoforms in T lymphocytes, nuclear extracts were prepared from T-cell suspensions (19Wargnier A. Lafaurie C. Legros-Maida S. Bourge J.-F. Sigaux F. Sasportes M. Pauli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35326-35331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and aliquots (50 μg protein) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad), as described previously (19Wargnier A. Lafaurie C. Legros-Maida S. Bourge J.-F. Sigaux F. Sasportes M. Pauli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35326-35331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, anti-Ik antiserum was diluted 1:1000, and the second antibody (GAR-AP) was diluted 1:2000 (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protein content was normalized before loading onto the gel (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and equal loading of extracts was verified by Ponceau staining (19Wargnier A. Lafaurie C. Legros-Maida S. Bourge J.-F. Sigaux F. Sasportes M. Pauli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35326-35331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rainbow molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) were bovine serum albumin (66.0 kDa) and ovalbumin (46.0 kDa). Nuclear levels of total Ik isoforms were further quantified by ELISA, performed by coating each well with 25 μg protein/sample, as described above for FAAH, and then reacted with anti-Ik antiserum (1:1000) and GAR-AP (1:2000). Construction of Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Expression Vectors and Transient Transfection—Sequence information for the upstream regulatory region of FAAH gene was downloaded from GeneBank™ (region: gi/11423254:644582-754250, International Human Genome Project), and the proximal promoter region of base pairs from +1 to –107 (+1 being the first nucleotide of the FAAH mRNA) was assembled using synthetic oligonucleotides (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA was gel-purified and subcloned into the PstI/XbaI sites of pCAT3-Basic vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The same strategy was used to introduce mutations in the recombinant plasmids bearing the promoter region. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing with a Sequenase kit 2.0 (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). Human T-cells (1 × 106 per test) were transfected in triplicate using TransFast™ transfection reagent (Promega Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium, and then they were mixed with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium containing 2 μg of total DNA and the TransFast™ transfection reagent, at a charge ratio of 1:1 with respect to DNA. Transfection efficiency was monitored by use of 0.5 μg of thymidine kinase β-galactosidase construct (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). After transfection, the medium was replaced with complete growth medium, and cells were harvested 48 h later. For chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity assays, cellular extracts were prepared as described above for FAAH, and different aliquots were used for CAT assays, for β-galactosidase activity determination, a marker of transfection efficiency, and for protein quantitation. CAT activity was determined using the Quan-T-CAT assay system (Amersham Biosciences), whereas the activity of β-galactosidase was assayed using the β-galactosidase enzyme system (Promega Corp.). The values of CAT activity were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and to the protein content (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nuclear Extracts, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift, and Supershift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (26Schreiber E. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) with the modifications reported by Lee et al. (27Lee J.-H. Jang S.-I. Markova N.G. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4561-4568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments were performed as described previously (27Lee J.-H. Jang S.-I. Markova N.G. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4561-4568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), using the Ikaros oligonucleotide –76 5′-AGGCGGGCGTGGGATCCCGGCTG-3′–54 (site in bold), whereas the oligonucleotides used for the cold competitions were 5′-CTCGCAGCCTGGGAAGATAAGTGG-3′ (Ikaros site derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor-1 promoter), and –76 5′-AGGCGGGCGTTTTTTCCCGGCTG-3′–54, which is the mutated site used for the transfection experiments (the mutated nucleotides are underlined) (28Dorsam G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13488-13493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In all oligonucleotides, the numbers refer to positions in the FAAH promoter. The complexes were resolved on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer (0.45 m Tris borate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 14 V/cm and were autoradiographed overnight. For gel supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were preincubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of rabbit anti-Ik antiserum, before addition of 32P-labeled oligoucleotide (26Schreiber E. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Dye was omitted from the loading buffer, and the gel was run at 4 °C in 0.2 x TBE buffer at 5 V/cm. The autoradiographic films were subjected to densitometric analysis by means of a Floor-S MultiImager equipped with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), as reported previously (18Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Rossi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13318-13324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data reported in this paper are the mean (±S.D.) of at least three independent determinations, each in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, elaborating experimental data by means of the InStat 3 program (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Progesterone Stimulates FAAH Activity and Expression in Human T Lymphocytes—In vitro treatment of human T-cells with P for 24 h enhanced FAAH activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). FAAH activation reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) at 250 nm P and a maximum at 1 μm. Therefore, the last concentration was chosen to further investigate the effect of P on FAAH. Activation of FAAH by 1 μm P was fully reverted by the synthetic antiprogestinic compound RU486 (29Lebeau M.C. Baulieu E.E. Human Reprod. 1994; 9: S11Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), used at 10 μm (Fig. 1A). Time course experiments showed that P-induced activation of FAAH was significant (p < 0.05) 12 h after T lymphocytes treatment and reached a maximum at 24 h (Fig. 1B). Anti-FAAH antibodies were used to quantify FAAH content in T-cells by ELISA and showed that P increased FAAH protein in human T lymphocytes in parallel to the increase of enzymic activity (Fig. 1, A and B). RT-PCR amplification of cDNA of human T lymphocytes, followed by liquid scintillation counting of RT-PCR products, showed that P increased dose- and time-dependently also FAAH mRNA in human T lymphocytes, in a way parallel to that of enzymic activity and protein content (Fig. 1, A and B). Remarkably, treatment of T-cells with 10 μm RU486 fully prevented the increase in FAAH protein and mRNA levels induced by 1 μm P (Fig. 1, A and B). These data closely resemble our previous report on the effect of P on the whole population of peripheral lymphocytes and are in keeping with the observation that FAAH activity in T-cells accounts for 85% of the activity measured in the whole cell population (12Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanini C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of T lymphocytes with 1 μm P for 24 h significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the endogenous levels of AEA in these cells to 60% of the controls (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2049344329,"The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a multifunctional protein, acting on different targets (e.g. transcription factors, cytoplasmic kinases, and mitochondrial proteins) and exerting cellular effects as diverse as stimulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In its biological effects, the modulation of cellular Ca2+ signals has been proposed to be involved, but the direct assessment of Ca2+ homeostasis in HBx-transfected cells has not been carried out yet. In this work, we have employed for this purpose aequorin-based recombinant probes specifically targeted to intracellular organelles and microdomains. Using these probes, we observed that overexpression of HBx enhanced agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ signals in HepG2 and HeLa cells, without affecting either the steady state of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentration or the kinetics of Ca2+ release. Rather, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase could be demonstrated, and larger rises were detected in the cytoplasmic rim beneath the plasma membrane. In mitochondria, major morphological (fragmentation and swelling) and functional (reduced Ca2+ uptake) alterations were detected in HBx-expressing cells. As to the cellular consequences, we observed that HBx-induced apoptosis was markedly reduced when the alterations in Ca2+ signaling (e.g. by loading a Ca2+ chelator or preventing PMCA cleavage) or the downstream effects (e.g. by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition) were prevented. Overall, these results indicate that HBx perturbs intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, acting on the extrusion mechanisms, and that this effect plays an important role in the control of HBx-related apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053405152,"We previously found that a covalent complex of SHAPs (serum-derived hyaluronan-associated proteins), the heavy chains of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor family molecules, with hyaluronan (HA) is accumulated in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the complex is circulated in patient plasma at high concentrations. How the SHAP-HA complex participates in this disease is unknown. To address this question, it is essential to clarify the structural features of this macromolecule. The SHAP-HA complex purified from synovial fluid of the patients by three sequential CsCl isopycnic centrifugations was heterogeneous in density, and the fractions with different densities had distinct SHAP-to-HA ratios. Agarose gel electrophoresis and column chromatography revealed that there was no apparent difference in the size distribution of HA to which SHAPs were bound between the fractions with different densities. The SHAP-HA complex in the higher density fraction had fewer SHAP molecules per HA chain. Therefore, the difference between the fractions with different densities was due to a heterogeneous population of the SHAP-HA complex, namely the different number of SHAP molecules bound to an HA chain. Based on the SHAP and HA contents of the purified preparations, we estimated that an HA chain with a molecular weight of 2 × 106 has as many as five covalently bound SHAPs, which could give a proteinaceous multivalency to HA. Furthermore, we also found that the SHAP-HA complex tends to form aggregates, judging from the migration and elution profiles in agarose gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, respectively. The multivalent feature of the SHAP-HA complex was also confirmed by the negative staining electron micrographic images of the purified fractions. Taken together, those structural characteristics may underlie the aggregate-forming and extracellular matrix-stabilizing ability of the SHAP-HA complex.

The association with various hyaluronan-binding proteins (HABPs) including proteoglycans makes HA tremendously divergent in physiological function. For example, link proteins and aggrecan, major HABPs in cartilage, are implicated in the characteristic functions of this tissue such as elasticity by forming large macromolecular aggregates with HA in the extracellular matrix. Such extracellular matrices containing HA as a major component, which, hereafter, we call HA-rich matrices, play important roles in regulating cellular behavior in a variety of physiological and pathological processes via cell surface HA receptors, such as CD44 and RHAMM (4Toole B.P.

Among a variety of HABPs that have been reported to date, SHAPs are the first and so far the only proteins covalently bound to HA (9Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The SHAP-HA complex was originally discovered from the HA-rich matrix of cultured mouse dermal fibroblasts, and SHAP was found to be derived from the serum supplemented to the culture media (the serum-derived hyaluronan-associated protein) (9Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHAPs correspond to the heavy chains of plasma inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (ITI) family molecules and are bound to HA via a unique ester bond (10Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ITI family molecules are synthesized by hepatocytes and secreted into blood at high concentrations (0.15–0.5 mg/ml plasma) (12Mizon C. Balduyck M. Albani D. Michalski C. Burnouf T. Mizon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The heavy chains (HC1, HC2, and HC3) of these molecules are derived from three different genes, and either one or two of them are covalently bound to the light chain, bikunin, to form the ITI family members such as ITI, pre-α-trypsin inhibitor (PαI), and inter-α-trypsin-like inhibitor (13Salier J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Bikunin carries at the serine residue at position 10 an O-glycosidically linked chondroitin sulfate chain, to which the heavy chains are linked via ester bonds of exactly the same type as that in a SHAP-HA complex (10Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

During the formation of the SHAP-HA complex, HA is substituted for the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin, accompanied by the release of bikunin. Plasma also includes an enzymatic activity catalyzing the transfer of the heavy chains from the chondroitin sulfate to HA (11Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, one can assume that the SHAP-HA complex is formed wherever and whenever plasma encounters HA. The SHAP-HA complex has been found in the HA-rich matrix of expanded cumulus oophorus (15Chen L. Mao S.J.T. McLean L.R. Powers R.W. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the sera and synovial fluids of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (10Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9698-9701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) suggested that the ITI family molecules, ITI and PαI, stabilized the HA-rich matrix of cultured cells and cumulus oophorus. Recently, the in vivo implications of the SHAP-HA complex in the extracellular matrix have become evident from our study on bikunin-knockout mice that are unable to form the complex (18Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W. Yoshida N. Kitagawa Y. Kawamura K. Suzuki T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7693-7696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the mice, the cumulus oophorus, an investing structure unique to the oocyte of higher mammals, had a defect in forming the extracellular HA-rich matrix, and the ovulated oocyte was unfertilized, leading to severe female infertility (18Zhuo L.

However, it is yet unclear how the SHAP-HA complex contributes to the stabilization of an HA-rich matrix. Details on its molecular structure, particularly the number of SHAP molecules bound to an HA chain, would help us to understand the molecular interactions in the HA-rich matrix, not only between the SHAP-HA complexes but also between the SHAP-HA complex and other matrix components such as TSG-6 (19Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here for the first time, we have characterized a structural feature of the SHAP-HA complex isolated from pathological synovial fluid, and we provide evidence for the multiple binding of SHAPs to an HA chain. Materials—Aminocaproic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and CsCl were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. Protease-free Streptomyces hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, the HA-binding protein (HABP) derived from the N-terminal region of bovine aggrecan, the biotinylated HABP, mouse anti-human PG-M/versican monoclonal antibody, 2B1, and mouse anti-human decorin monoclonal antibody, 6B6, were from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Rabbit anti-human ITI antibody (purified immunoglobulins) was from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (affinity-purified immunoglobulins) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA.

The 3,3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution and TMB stop solution were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Micro-BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit was from Pierce. Western blot chemiluminescence reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hyperfilm ECL film and Sephacryl S-1000 were from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit anti-human bikunin antibody (purified immunoglobulins) was prepared in this laboratory (18Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W. Yoshida N. Kitagawa Y. Kawamura K. Suzuki T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7693-7696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Purification of the SHAP-HA Complex from Pathological Synovial Fluid—The SHAP-HA complex was purified by a series of CsCl isopycnic centrifugations with increasing initial densities. Synovial fluid (70 ml) from knee joints of three rheumatoid arthritis patients with no record of previous treatment with intraarticular hyaluronan injection, which had been stored immediately after the collection at –80 °C, was mixed with the same volume of extraction buffer containing 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm aminocaproic acid, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm PMSF. After stirring overnight at 4 °C, the solution was brought to a density of 1.35 g/ml with solid CsCl. Then a density gradient was established by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm at 10 °C for 48 h (Hitachi 70P-72, rotor RP 70T-403) (the first centrifugation). The gradient was partitioned into 15 fractions (2 ml/fraction) from the bottom, and the fractions were subjected to uronate and protein content analysis by the carbazole reaction (9Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and micro-BCA assay, respectively. The fractions (fractions 1–6 with densities of 1.35–1.46 g/ml) that contained most of the total HA were pooled and subjected to a second centrifugation with an initial density of 1.40 g/ml and subsequent assay for uronate and protein content for each fraction after being partitioned into 15 fractions (2 ml/fraction) from the bottom. Fractions 3–9 that had the high concentrations of HA were pooled and subjected to a third centrifugation with an initial density of 1.42 g/ml. The third gradient was partitioned into 27 fractions (1 ml/fraction), and the contents of HA, total glycosaminoglycan, and protein were measured by periodate/thiobarbituric acid reaction (20Yoneda M. Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carbazole reaction, and micro-BCA assay, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Immunostaining—The amount of SHAP in each fraction was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CB) staining and by immunostaining with anti-ITI antibody. The fraction samples containing 20 or 3 μg of HA for CB staining and immunostaining, respectively, were mixed with 3 volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.5 turbidity reducing units of protease-free Streptomyces hyaluronidase, then incubated at 60 °C for 2 h or dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC, and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The samples were concentrated in vacuo and mixed with the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1% dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol), before being incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Electrophoresis was carried out in a 7.5% gel under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the proteins on the gel were stained with CB or transferred to a Hybond extra C membrane for immunostaining. The membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T) at 40 °C for 2 h, and then incubated with rabbit anti-human ITI antibody (1:2000 in PBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h. After several washes with PBS-T, the membrane was further incubated with HRP-conjugated protein A (1:4000 in PBS-T). The immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence assay and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL. Quantification of SHAP in the SHAP-HA Complex—Nunc Maxisorp microtiter plates were coated with HABP (2 μg/ml in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 8.25)) at 4 °C for 15 h. The wells were washed twice with 200 μl of PBS-T, followed by blocking with 200 μl of 3% BSA in PBS-T at room temperature for 2 h. After three washes with 200 μl of PBS-T, 50 μl each of sample (500 ng HA/ml) in 1% BSA/PBS-T was added to the well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After a wash, 25 μl of rabbit anti-human ITI antibody (diluted 1:2000 with 1% BSA/PBS-T) and 25 μl of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins antibody (diluted 1:1500 with 1% BSA/PBS-T) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were washed 3 times and then incubated with 50 μl each of TMB solution at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 m HCl, and the absorbance at 450/620 nm (A at 450 nm minus A at 620 nm) was measured on an immunoMini NI-2300 spectrophotometer. The assay was performed in triplicate. Quantification of HA in the SHAP-HA Complex—Nunc Maxisorp microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl each of rabbit anti-human ITI antibody (22 μg/ml in 20 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.5)) at 4 °C for 15 h and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS-T for 60 min at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS-T, 50 μl each of sample (300 ng HA/ml) in 1% BSA/PBS-T was applied to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The wells were washed and incubated with 50 μl each of biotinylated-HABP (diluted 1:2000 with 1% BSA/PBS-T) at 37 °C for 60 min. After a wash with PBS-T, 50 μl of HRP-streptavidin (1:500) was added to each well, and the plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Color development was achieved by incubating with 50 μl of TMB solution at 37 °C for 5 min and then stopped with 50 μl of 1 m HCl. The absorbance at 450/620 nm (A at 450 nm minus A at 620 nm) was measured. The assay was performed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation of the SHAP-HA Complex—Anti-ITI antibody (110 μg) in 1.5 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) was mixed with an equal volume of PBS-equilibrated cellulofine-protein A beads and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with gentle mixing. The beads were collected by centrifugation followed by five washes with 3 volumes each of PBS. The samples (1.5 ml) including 7.5 μg of HA in PBS with 2 mm PMSF were mixed with the anti-ITI antibody-coated beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 5 times with 3 volumes each of PBS. The supernatant and the first washing solution were pooled for the measurement of unbound free HA. The SHAP-HA complex bound on the beads was treated with 50 mm NaOH with 2 mm PMSF at room temperature for 4 h to release HA (10Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The beads were washed once with 50 mm NaOH, and the two NaOH solutions were pooled. The amounts of unbound HA (free HA) and bound HA (in the form of the SHAP-HA complex) were measured by the carbazole reaction. After concentration in vacuo, HA was precipitated with ethanol, dried briefly, dissolved in 30 μl of TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) buffer, and then subjected to 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis as described below. Agarose Electrophoresis and Western Blotting of the SHAP-HA Complex and HA—The SHAP-HA complex preparation (containing 30 μg of HA) was precipitated with ethanol, briefly dried, and then dissolved in 30 μl of TAE. If necessary, the precipitate of the preparation was dissolved in 30 μlof0.2 m NaOH and incubated at room temperature for 4 h to completely break down the ester bond between SHAP and HA. The released HA was precipitated again with ethanol, dissolved in 30 μl of TAE buffer, and then subjected to 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (21Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in a freshly prepared solution (176 mg of l-ascorbic acid and 13.9 mg of FeSO4 in 500 ml of TAE buffer) for 30 min to degrade the HA into low molecular weight HA. After two washes with TAE buffer for 20 min, the HA in the gel was blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane by capillary action. HA was directly visualized by staining with 0.5% Alcian blue in 2% acetic acid for 15 min, followed by destaining with 2% acetic acid. Otherwise, the membrane was blocked with 20% skim milk in PBS-T overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking and incubated with biotinylated HABP (1 μg/ml) in PBS with 1% BSA at room temperature for 2 h and then with HPR-streptavidin (1:1000) in PBS with 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. The HA was finally visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence assay and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL. Gel Filtration of the SHAP-HA Complexes—The SHAP-HA complex preparation was dialyzed against distilled water. An aliquot of the dialyzed preparation was treated with 0.2 m NaOH for 2 h at room temperature, followed by neutralization with HCl and subsequent addition of 10× PBS buffer to give the conventional PBS solution. For control, all additives were mixed first, and finally the aliquot was added. The sample was applied on to an analytical Sephacryl S-1000 column (0.7 × 30 cm). The column was eluted with the conventional PBS solution at a flow rate of 12–15 ml/h, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. 4 and 10 μl of each fraction were diluted with the PBS solution to make a total volume of 50 μl and then subjected to quantification of HA and SHAP, respectively. Quantification of HA by Inhibitory ELISA—The inhibitory ELISA kit for HA was provided by Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Briefly, the microtiter plates were coated with HA-conjugated BSA and then blocked with BSA. To each well, the samples or various concentrations of HA (HA standards) were added, together with a biotinylated HABP solution. After incubation, the plate was washed and further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Finally, a color was developed, and the absorbance was measured as described above. Electron Microscopic Observation of the SHAP-HA Complex—Negative staining of the SHAP-hyaluronan complex for electron micrographs and evaluation of the data were carried out as described previously (22Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For negative staining, sample preparations (typical concentrations of about 10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline) were adsorbed to 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, washed briefly with water, and stained on two drops of freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at an 80-kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Molecular masses of globular protein domains from negatively stained images were estimated as described previously (22Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Purification of the SHAP-HA Complex from Pathological Synovial Fluid—The synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients was highly viscous and contained a variety of proteins at high concentrations. The SHAP-HA complex was isolated under dissociative conditions with 4 m guanidine HCl by three sequential CsCl isopycnic centrifugations with initial densities of 1.35, 1.40, and 1.42 g/ml, respectively (Fig. 1A). After each centrifugation and subsequent fractionation, the density and uronate, HA, and protein contents of each fraction were measured. Fractions were numbered from the bottom to the top. After the first centrifugation, most of the proteins were recovered in the lower density fractions (ρ <1.35 g/ml) (Fig. 1A). The higher density fractions (fractions 1–6) that contained less protein and more uronate were pooled and subjected to a second centrifugation. After the second centrifugation, we noticed that the relative content of protein to uronate in each fraction was not constant but tended to increase along with the decline in density (Fig. 1B). The fractions 3–9 of the second gradient were pooled and further purified by a third centrifugation. The fractions 5–15 of the third gradient that had densities between 1.5 and 1.37 g/ml contained most of the total HA, but the protein-to-HA ratio still showed an increasing tendency, from 0.084 for fraction 5 to 0.148 for fraction 15 (Fig. 1C). Two-thirds each of the fractions 5–15 were pooled as the purified SHAP-HA complex. Comparing uronate and protein contents of the pooled fractions among the three centrifugations, we found that the relative amounts of protein to uronate decreased significantly between the first and second centrifugations but only a little between the second and third centrifugations (Table I). There was no further decrease when we performed the fourth centrifugation and compared the values with those for the third centrifugation (data not shown). Judging from these values and the distribution patterns of protein, uronate, and HA after each centrifugation, we concluded that the SHAP-HA complex in the starting synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients was mostly recovered in fractions 5–15 of the third gradient with the least contamination by other components. In this experiment, the final SHAP-HA complex preparation with 70 ml of synovial fluid (obtained from three rheumatoid arthritis patients) as starting material contained 3.08 mg of protein and 56 mg of HA.Table IThe protein, uronate, and HA contents of the pooled fractions after the three CsCl isopycnic centrifugationsCentrifugationProteinUronateHAProtein/uronateProtein/HAmg/mlmg/mlmg/ml10.6161.7120.36020.1971.1720.16830.1400.6951.2960.2010.108 Open table in a new tab Characterization of the Isolated SHAP-HA Complex—The purity of the SHAP-HA complex preparations was examined by CB staining and immunostaining after SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The pooled fraction after the second centrifugation without Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion only gave the protein bands migrating faster than the SHAP bands (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The appearance of those bands such as the major one having molecular mass of 50 kDa was not altered by Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion, and therefore, those protein bands were likely contaminants. The Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion of the fraction gave two new bands having molecular masses of 75 and 85 kDa, which were stained with CB strongly and weakly, respectively (Fig. 2A, lane 2). They appeared to correspond to the SHAPs derived from HC1 and HC2 of ITI, respectively, according to the sensitivity to hyaluronidase digestion and the reported molecular sizes for human HC1 and HC2 (12Mizon C. Balduyck M. Albani D. Michalski C. Burnouf T. Mizon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Rouet P. Daveau M. Salier J.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fractions 5–14 on the third gradient, the representative fractions, did not give the protein bands migrating faster than the SHAP bands with or without the hyaluronidase digestion (Fig. 2B), which suggested that the third centrifugation was essential to purify the SHAP-HA complex from those contaminants. After Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion, the fractions only gave the two bands having molecular masses of 75 and 85 kDa upon CB staining (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3). Both of them were stained with the anti-human ITI antibody, confirming that they corresponded to ITI HCs (Fig. 2C). The results are consistent with our previous study showing that the SHAP-HA complex in human pathological synovial fluids was composed of both the HC1 and HC2 of the ITI (11Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CB staining pattern indicated that the synovial SHAP-HA complex involves more HC1 than HC2. Chondroitinase ABC digestion (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4) did not yield any further bands except for the own enzyme bands (Fig. 2B, lane 6), which almost but not completely eliminated the possibility of contamination with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). This was also confirmed by no immunoreactivity on the membranes of chondroitinase ABC digested fraction 5 and 14 samples with antibodies against human PG-M/versican, human decorin, and human bikunin (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2097955271,"A natural isolate of Lactococcus lactis was shown to produce two narrow spectrum class II bacteriocins, designated LsbA and LsbB. The cognate genes are located on a 5.6-kb plasmid within a gene cluster specifying LmrB, an ATP-binding cassette-type multidrug resistance transporter protein. LsbA is a hydrophobic peptide that is initially synthesized with an N-terminal extension. The housekeeping surface proteinase HtrA was shown to be responsible for the cleavage of precursor peptide to yield the active bacteriocin. LsbB is a relatively hydrophilic protein synthesized without an N-terminal leader sequence or signal peptide. The secretion of both polypeptides was shown to be mediated by LmrB. An L. lactis strain lacking plasmid-encoded LmrB and the chromosomally encoded LmrA is unable to secrete either of the two bacteriocins. Complementation of the strain with an active LmrB protein resulted in restored export of the two polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane. When expressed in an L. lactis strain that is sensitive to LsbA and LsbB, LmrB was shown to confer resistance toward both bacteriocins. It does so, most likely, by removing the two polypeptides from the cytoplasmic membrane. This is the first report in which a multidrug transporter protein is shown to be involved in both secretion and immunity of antimicrobial peptides.

This is the first report in which a multidrug transporter protein is shown to be involved in both secretion and immunity of antimicrobial peptides. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by a large variety of bacteria (1Tagg J.R. Dajani A.S. Wannamaker L.W. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 722-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Klaenhammer T.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This group of antibacterial compounds is also found in plants (e.g. thionins (3Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R. Cammue B.P. Osborn R.W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar)) and animals (e.g. defensins, magainins, and cecropins (4Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6655) Google Scholar)). The eukaryotic antimicrobials share a number of structural similarities with bacterial bacteriocins such as a very small size and considerable amphiphilicity.Most bacteriocins produced by the Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 1The abbreviations used are: LAB, lactic acid bacteria; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; MDR, multidrug resistance; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAA, polyacrylamide; RT, reverse-transcribed; ORF, open reading frame.1The abbreviations used are: LAB, lactic acid bacteria; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; MDR, multidrug resistance; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAA, polyacrylamide; RT, reverse-transcribed; ORF, open reading frame. characterized to date are small (less than 6 kDa), cationic, and amphiphatic membrane permeabilizing peptides (2Klaenhammer T.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). They can be classified into three main groups (5Nissen-Meyer J. Nes I.F. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Group I comprises the lantibiotics that contain post-translationally modified amino acids, such as lanthionine and β-methyllanthionine and the dehydrated residues dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine (6Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1051-1192Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 7Sahl H.G. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Group II, consisting of the unmodified heat-stable peptide bacteriocins (the non-lantibiotics), can be further divided into Group IIa, the pediocin-like bacteriocins (8Stoddard G.W. Petzel J.P. van Belkum M.J. Kok J. McKay L.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 1952-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cintas L.M. Casaus P. Havarstein L.S. Hernandez P.E. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Group IIb, the two-peptide bacteriocins, which require the complementary action of two peptides for full antimicrobial activity (10van Belkum M.J. Hayema B.J. Jeeninga R.E. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 492-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Diep D.B. Havarstein L.S. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4472-4483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Group IIc, other unmodified bacteriocins. Group III contains larger and heat-labile bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are mainly synthesized as precursor peptides with an N-terminal leader sequence (12Nes I.F. Diep D.B. Havarstein L.S. Brurberg M.B. Eijsink V. Holo H. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 70: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The primary translation product of most non-lantibiotics and some lantibiotics contains a leader peptide of the double glycine-type (Gly–2-Gly–1), which is cleaved off during export across the cytoplasmic membrane by dedicated ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and their accessory proteins (13Franke C.M. Leenhouts K.J. Haandrikman A.J. Kok J. Venema G. Venema K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Havarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Some bacteriocins, e.g. divergicin A, enterocin P, and listeriocin 743A (9Cintas L.M. Casaus P. Havarstein L.S. Hernandez P.E. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kalmokoff M.L. Banerjee S.K. Cyr T. Hefford M.A. Gleeson T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4041-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by the general secretory pathway (16Worobo R.W. van Belkum M.J. Sailer M. Roy K.L. Vederas J.C. Stiles M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). They contain canonical sec signal peptides consisting of a positively charged N terminus, a hydrophobic core, and a defined cleavage site that is removed by a specific signal peptidase during translocation. Some bacteriocins produced by Enterococcus faecium, e.g. enterocin L50A and L50B, and enterocin Q have been shown recently (17Cintas L.M. Casaus P. Holo H. Hernandez P.E. Nes I.F. Havarstein L.S. J.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6806-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to be synthesized without an N-terminal leader sequence or signal peptide.All bacteriocin producers are insensitive to the bacteriocin(s) they produce. The genetic determinants proposed or confirmed to confer immunity are frequently found downstream of the bacteriocin structural gene(s) in the bacteriocin operon (2Klaenhammer T.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Nes I.F. Diep D.B. Havarstein L.S. Brurberg M.B. Eijsink V. Holo H. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 70: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). These immunity proteins usually have a high pI, and those that are associated with one-peptide bacteriocins are generally small in size (51 to 113 amino acids) and contain no or only a few (one to two) potential transmembrane helices (10van Belkum M.J. Hayema B.J. Jeeninga R.E. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 492-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nes I.F. Diep D.B. Havarstein L.S. Brurberg M.B. Eijsink V. Holo H.

The cognate genes were cloned and sequenced, and their transcription was analyzed. Also, the processing mechanism of LsbA, the secretion of both bacteriocins, and the resistance mechanism against both peptides were studied. Both secretion and immunity were found to rely on the activity of a single multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and MediaBacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.

Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Expand™ High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) were used according to the instructions of the supplier. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. The High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to purify PCR products. For nucleotide sequence analysis the dideoxy chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52360) Google Scholar) was used with [α-35S]dATP and the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). L. lactis was transformed by electroporation using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) as described by Leenhouts and Venema (23Leenhouts K.J. Venema G. Hardy K.G. Plasmids, A Practical Aproach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 65-94Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the pMN5 was deposited in GenBank™ under the accession number AF056207.Plasmid ConstructionThe lmrB gene was amplified from pMN5 by PCR with oligonucleotides LMRB1 (5′-TCTAGACCACCATGGGGCATCACCATCACCATCACGATGACGATGACAAAGCCGAAAGAGG), introducing the underlined NcoI restriction enzyme site upstream of the His6 tag (italic), and LMRB2 (5′-ATATCTAGAGTTAATTGATTCTGAAC), introducing the underlined XbaI restriction enzyme site downstream of the stop codon (italic) of lmrB. The purified 1764-bp PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding sites in pNZ8048, resulting in pNHlmrB. The lsbB gene was amplified with oligonucleotides LSBB-1 (5′-CCGGTCATGAAAACAATCCTACG) and LSBB-2 (5′-CTGGTCTAGATTAAGCTTTTCCACG) by using pMN5 as a template. An RcaI and XbaI (underlined) digested PCR product was ligated into the NcoI and XbaI sites of pNZ8048, resulting in pNZlsbB. Oligonucleotides LSBA-1 (5′-CCGGTCATGATAATTGTAGGAATTATATTTTTG) and LSBA-2 (5′-CTGGTCTAGATTATGCATATCTTGGTAC) were used to amplify lsbA gene from plasmid pMN5. The PCR product was digested with RcaI and XbaI (underlined) and ligated into the NcoI and XbaI sites of pNZ8048, resulting in pNZlsbA. To make an lmrB-lsbB operon, lmrB was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides LMRB3 (5′-CCGGAGCTCTAAAAAGGAAGTGATAAATTTATG) and LMRB2. SacI and XbaI (underlined) digested PCR product was ligated into the corresponding sites in pNZlsbB, resulting in pNZlsbB-lmrB. To construct an in-frame N-terminal fusion with the green fluorescent protein (GFP), lmrB was amplified by PCR using LMRB4 (5′-CCGGAATTCATATGAAATTTTTGAAAGACAAATC) and LMRB2 as oligonucleotides. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI (underlined) and ligated into the corresponding restriction enzymes sites of pGFP-mut1, containing gfp-mut1 downstream of the nisA promoter (PnisA), resulting in pNZgfp-lmrB. All plasmids were introduced in L. lactis NZ9000 to enable nisin induction. Nisin induction of PnisA in the pNZ8048 derivatives was performed as described by de Ruyter et al. (24de Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate the transcription of lsbB and lmrB the DNA fragment containing the expression signals of the divergently transcribed lsbB and lmrB genes was amplified from pMN5 by PCR using oligonucleotides P1 (5′-CTCGTGATCATAGGTTTACTTCCTTTC) and P2 (5′-CAGGTGATCATAAATTTATCACTTCC) containing BclI restriction sites (underlined) that overlap the lsbB and lmrB initiation codons. BclI digested PCR product was ligated into the BamHI site of pGKH10, resulting in pGKH1 and pGKH2. In plasmid pGKH1, the lacZ gene is under the control of the LsbB promoter, whereas the lmrB promoter directs the transcription of the α-galactosidase gene. The promoter fragment is present in the reverse orientation in pGKH2.Construction of an lmrA Deletion StrainThe non-autonomously replicating vector pORI280 (25Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) was used to construct an lmrA replacement plasmid. The 1561-bp EcoRV fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of LmrA was deleted from pAPL2. 2K. Venema, unpublished data. The resulting plasmid pAPL3 was digested with ScaI and BamHI yielding a 3.234-kb fragment with the lmrA deletion and its flanking regions. This fragment was ligated into corresponding sites in pORI280. The resulting plasmid, pORILmr, was used to transform L. lactis LL108, which carries the repA gene on the chromosome, thereby allowing the pORI280 derivative to replicate. pORILmr isolated from this strain was introduced, together with pVE6007, into L. lactis NZ9000. As this strain does not contain the repA gene, selection for growth in the presence of erythromycin and increased temperature (37 °C) forces pORILmr to integrate into the chromosome by homologous recombination. A number of integrants were subsequently grown for about 30 generations under non-selective conditions allowing a second recombination event to occur, which results in either the deletion or the wild-type gene lmrA. The ΔlmrA mutation was confirmed by PCR, as well as Southern hybridization experiments.Assay of β-Galactosidase ActivityThe activity of β-galactosidase was measured during growth of L. lactis in a 96-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One B.V., Alphen, The Netherlands) using the GENios microtiterplate reader and Magelan software (Tecan, Grödig, Austria). β-Galactosidase activity was measured by conversion of T657 substrate (trifluoromethylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Molecular Probes) into T659 fluorescent product. Fluorescence was followed using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 535 nm, respectively. Culture optical densities were measured at 595 nm. Specific β-galactosidase activity was calculated as arbitrary fluorescence units divided per time and optical absorbance (AFU × min–1 × A 595–1).Bacteriocin Activity AssaysBacteriocin activity was detected using an agar-well diffusion assay (1Tagg J.R. Dajani A.S. Wannamaker L.W. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 722-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, wells made in the lawn of soft agar with an indicator strain (106 cells/ml), which was poured onto agar plates, were filled with 50-μl aliquots of supernatant. To detect bacteriocin activity on SDS-polyacrylamide (PAA) gels, an overlay assay was used (26Bhunia A.K. Johnson M C. Ilse D. Acta Chem. Scand. 1987; 2: 319-322Google Scholar). The supernatant of a nisin-induced culture of a bacteriocin producer (2 ml) was concentrated 20-fold by phenol/ether extraction (27Sauyé D.M. Ho D.T. Roberge M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), after which 15 μl was loaded onto an SDS-20% (w/v) PAA gel. After electrophoresis the gel was treated twice for 30 min with a mixture of isopropanol (20%) and acetic acid (10%), washed with several changes of demineralized water, and overlaid with soft agar containing 106 cells/ml of an indicator strain, followed by overnight incubation at 30 °C.Bacteriocin Purification and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence DeterminationLsbA and LsbB were purified from 50 ml of nisin-induced cultures of L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZlsbA or pNZlsbB, respectively. Cells were removed by centrifugation, after which the supernatant was concentrated 20-fold by phenol/ether extraction (27Sauyé D.M. Ho D.T. Roberge M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The supernatant was dialyzed against several changes of demineralized water at 4 °C, using cellulose ester membranes with a molecular mass cut-off of 1 kDa (SpectraPor® CE; Spectrum Laboratories). Quantification of protein was done by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified sample was subjected to SDS 20% (w/v)-PAA gel electrophoresis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) using the Rainbow pre-stained low range molecular weight protein marker (Amersham Biosciences) as a size reference. The protein band corresponding to active bacteriocin was excised from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAA gel and destained for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The purified protein was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Eurosequence, Groningen, The Netherlands) by means of Edman degradation on an automated sequenator (model 477A; Applied Biosystems) using protocols, chemicals, and materials from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).RNA AnalysisPrimer Extension Analysis—RNA was isolated from exponentially growing L. lactis cells as described by van Asseldonk et al. (29van Asseldonk M. Simons A. Visser H. de Vos W.M. Simons G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of cDNA was performed using SUPERSCRIPT transcriptase (Invitrogen). mRNA (3.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using 25 ng of synthetic oligonucleotide REP1 (5′-AATTAAGATAGCCTAACTCC), which anneals at the 5′ of the repA, or LSBA (5′-GTACAAAATAATGCTATAGC), which anneals at the 5′ of lsbA, and dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-P32]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 42 °C, after which an excess in cold dCTP was added, and incubation was continued for another 10 min at 42 °C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide urea gel and analyzed by autoradiography.RT-PCR—First strand cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase was carried out with the first strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR from Roche Applied Science. mRNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with 50 ng of synthetic oligonucleotide LMRB (5′-CTATATTGATACCTTGAC). The cDNA thus obtained was subsequently amplified by PCR using REP2 (5′-GAAATTGGCAACAACG) in combination with REP3 (5′-CCCAATTCCAAATCGC) or LSBA-3 (5′-GTACAAAATAATGCTATAGC). The size of the obtained PCR products was checked on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.Northern Hybridization—RNA for Northern blot analysis was fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA size marker (0.5–9 kb) was from Ambion (Austin, TX). Purified PCR products obtained with the oligonucleotides LMRA1 (5′-TGATTGGGATTGTGGCTGG) and LMRA2 (5′-CAAAACCAATTTGACTCCGCC), containing the 5′ end of lmrA, or LMRP1 (5′-CAATGATTTTTGGAAGTGGGC) and LMRP2 (5′-CTCATCAACTTTGACTGTGG), containing the 5′ end of lmrP, were used as probes. Labeling of probes and transcript detection were performed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSSequence Analysis of the Locus Responsible for Bacteriocin Production in L. lactis BGMN1–5—L. lactis sp. lactis BGMN1–5 has been shown previously (30Gajic O. Kojic M. Banina A. Topisirovic L. Arch. Biol. Sci. Belgrade. 1999; 51: 69-78Google Scholar) to produce two class II bacteriocins, Bac513 and Bac501. By means of plasmid curing, derivatives of L. lactis BGMN1–5 have been obtained that lack one or more of the five resident plasmids. Bac513 has been shown to be only produced when a 5.65-kb plasmid (pMN5) was present. The genetic information for the production of Bac501 is located on a 80-kb plasmid (30Gajic O. Kojic M. Banina A. Topisirovic L. Arch. Biol. Sci. Belgrade. 1999; 51: 69-78Google Scholar) and will not be discussed further. Subcloning of the two EcoRI fragments of pMN5 revealed that the genetic information for the production of and immunity toward Bac513 is located on the 3.28-kb EcoRI fragment of pMN5 (Fig. 1A). Three open reading frames (ORFs) could be discerned in the nucleotide sequence of this region (Fig. 1C). The first ORF could encode a peptide of 67 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 7.8 kDa. The ATG start codon is preceded by a potential ribosome binding site (GAGGA), but no obvious –35 and –10 consensus promoter regions were present. Two 12-bp inverted repeats separated by four nucleotides are present immediately downstream of this ORF, which could form a stable stem-loop structure with an estimated ΔG° of –15.2 kcal/mol (–63.6 kJ/mol) and could serve as a bidirectional rho-independent transcription terminator (31Platt T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 339-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The divergently oriented ORF could specify a 30-amino acid peptide with a calculated molecular mass of 3.4 kDa. The gene is preceded by a strong potential ribosome binding site (AGAAAGGAAG). The third ORF could encode a protein of 567 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 63.8 kDa. This ORF is preceded by a potential ribosome binding site (AAAGGAAG) and is located immediately downstream of the oppositely oriented second ORF. A 96-bp intergenic region separates both genes.The deduced amino acid sequences of the two small ORFs do not share mutual similarity nor do they show homology with any entry in the protein databases. The product of the large ORF shares 34% sequence identity with the multidrug transporter protein LmrA of L. lactis MG1363 (32van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and, like LmrA, is a half-size version of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (33Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Based on this homology the gene was labeled lmrB. LmrB is homologous to many pro- and eukaryotic ABC transporters and to the hop resistance protein HorA of the beer-spoilage bacterium Lactobacillus brevis (34Sakamoto K. Margolles A. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5371-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Strain L. lactis BGMN1–5 contains neither lmrA nor lmrB on its chromosome.Bac513 Activity Is a Mixture of Two Bacteriocins—The L. lactis BGMN1–5 plasmid pMN5 has been shown to specify bacteriocin activity, which has been named Bac513 (30Gajic O. Kojic M. Banina A. Topisirovic L. Arch. Biol. Sci. Belgrade. 1999; 51: 69-78Google Scholar). To investigate which of the two small ORFs carried by the 3.28-kb EcoRI fragment of pMN5 encodes Bac513 activity, the ORFs were cloned separately in a lactococcal expression vector, downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter PnisA (35Kuipers O.P. De Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The two plasmids pNZlsbA and pNZlsbB, carrying the 67- and the 30-codon ORFs, respectively, were introduced in the naturally resistant L. lactis strain NZ9000. This L. lactis MG1363 d"

A recently demonstrated interaction between β-catenin and the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding domain has suggested that AR may be a Tcf-independent Wnt/β-catenin effector. This study demonstrates that there is a direct interaction between the AR DNA binding domain (DBD) and Tcf4. Tcf4 bound specifically to a glutathione S-transferase-ARDBD fusion protein and could be coimmunoprecipitated with β-catenin and transfected AR or endogenous AR in prostate cancer cells. Transfected Tcf4 repressed the transcriptional activity of full-length AR and a VP16-ARDBD fusion protein, and this repression was only partially reversed by transfected β-catenin. AR activation by cyproterone acetate, a partial agonist that did not support β-catenin binding to the AR, was also repressed by Tcf4, further indicating that repression was not due to β-catenin sequestration. Tcf4 could recruit β-catenin to the AR DBD in vitro and to the cyproterone acetate-liganded AR in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in LNCaP prostate cancer cells showed that endogenous AR was bound to a Tcf4-responsive element in the c-myc promoter. These findings indicate that AR and Tcf4 can interact directly and that this interaction may occur on the promoters or enhancers of particular genes. The direct AR-Tcf4 interaction, in conjunction AR- and Tcf4-β-catenin binding, provides a mechanism for cooperative and selective gene regulation by AR and the Wnt/β-catenin-Tcf pathway that may contribute to normal and neoplastic prostate growth.

It contains a highly conserved central DNA binding domain (DBD), a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), and a large N-terminal transactivation domain. AR activation by androgen binding causes a conformational change that enhances nuclear localization, homodimerization, and binding to specific sequences (androgen-responsive elements, AREs) located in androgen-regulated genes. The androgen-induced conformational change in the AR LBD also generates a binding site for a short hydrophobic motif (Leu-X-X-Leu-Leu or LXXLL) found in many transcriptional coactivator proteins, although the AR N terminus contains an LXXLL-like sequence that binds strongly to the liganded LBD and may compete for binding with other LXXLL-containing coactivators (3He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Similarly to other steroid hormone and nuclear receptors, protein-protein interactions involving one or more domains of the AR mediate the recruitment of multiple transcription factors, with subsequent chromatin remodeling and transcription of androgen regulated genes (4McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). The binding of AR and other steroid hormone receptors to DNA can be enhanced by HMG-1 and HMG-2, related nonsequence-specific DNA binding proteins characterized by a high mobility group (HMG) box DBD (5Onate S.A.

HMG box-containing proteins have an architectural function based on the ability of the HMG box to bind to the minor groove of the DNA helix and induce a sharp bend. This change in local DNA structure appears to be the major factor responsible for HMG-1 and -2 stabilization of steroid hormone receptor binding to DNA, although weak protein-protein interactions may also play a role. We recently demonstrated an interaction between the AR and the sequence-specific HMG box transcription factor SRY, the Y-chromosome encoded protein required for male sex determination and founding member of the SOX family of HMG proteins (11Yuan X. Lu M.L. Li T. Balk S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46647-46654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The AR-SRY interaction was direct and mediated by the AR DBD and the HMG domain of SRY. Based on this finding, we have investigated whether the AR can interact directly with other HMG proteins. This study demonstrates such an interaction between the AR and T cell factor 4 (Tcf4), a member of the Tcf/Lef (T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) family that is expressed in multiple tissues, including colon, breast, and prostate (12Korinek V.

These findings have suggested that AR and other nuclear receptors may be Tcf-independent effectors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and may indirectly antagonize Tcf activity by competing for nuclear β-catenin. This study demonstrates a direct (β-catenin-independent) interaction between Tcf4 and the AR mediated by the AR DBD, indicating a role for Tcf4 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling through the AR. A cooperative binding interaction between AR and Tcf4 on the regulatory elements of particular genes is a mechanism by which Wnt/β-catenin signals may selectively stimulate expression of a subset of AR-regulated genes during male development and in prostate cancer.

VP16-ARDBD-(501–660) generated in the pACT vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and the ARE-regulated firefly luciferase reporter genes (ARE4-Luc, PSA7kb-Luc, and MMTV-Luc) generated in the pGL3 vector were described previously (11Yuan X.

An estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression vector (pcDNA3.1-ERα) and estrogen-responsive element (ERE)-regulated luciferase reporter (ERE2-Luc) were from M. Brown (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). A human Tcf4 expression vector (pCMV-Tcf4, 597 amino acids) was from S. Sokol (Beth Israel Deaconess, Boston, MA) (22Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar), and β-catenin was from H. Clevers (University Medical Center, Utrecht). Vectors encoding Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV) and βgalactosidase (pSV-β-galactosidase) were from Promega. GST-ARDBD-(556–628) and GST-AR-(634–668) were generated by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment of AR in pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). The corresponding GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse anti-Tcf4 monoclonal antibodies (clone 6H5-3 specific for Tcf4 and clone 6F12-3 recognizing Tcf3 and -4) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and were used in combination for immunoblotting. Rabbit anti-AR antibodies generated against an N-terminal peptide (N-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Upstate Biotechnology (immunoaffinity-purified PG-21). The mouse anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (clone 14) was from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Hormones were from Sigma and were diluted from 1000× stocks in ethanol. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—CV1 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in DMEM with 5% FCS (HyClone, Logan, UT) to ∼80% confluence. Plasmid DNA and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were combined in a final volume of 100 μl of OPTI-MEM for 30 min at room temperature, then mixed with 0.5 ml of DMEM with 10% steroid hormone-depleted FCS (charcoal-dextran-stripped FCS, CS-FCS) (HyClone), and added to each culture well. After 24 h the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM/10% CS-FCS, with or without hormones as indicated. After another 24 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed with 100 μl of passive lysis buffer, and assayed for luciferase activities using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega). The firefly luciferase results were divided by the control Renilla luciferase to give relative light units, and the results reflect the mean and standard deviation from triplicate samples. GST Fusion Protein Binding Assays—Equivalent amounts (5 μg) of GST or GST fusion proteins and 35S-labeled proteins generated by in vitro transcription/translation (TnT T7 or SP6 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega) were mixed in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in binding buffer, once in PBS, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Coimmunoprecipitations—CV1 or 293T cells grown in 10-cm plates to 80–90% confluence were transfected with 6 μg each of AR and Tcf4 plasmids. DNA in 0.75 ml of OPTI-MEM was mixed with 40 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in 0.75 ml of OPTI-MEM as above, and the 1.5 ml of mix was added to cells in 10 ml of DMEM/10% FCS with no antibiotics. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM/10% FCS or CS-FCS with added hormones as indicated. After another 24 h, cells from each plate were washed with cold PBS, scraped into 1.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, .05% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and briefly sonicated, and debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g. Lysates were precleared for 15 min using 2 μl of normal rabbit serum that was pre-absorbed to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Lysates were then split, mixed with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 1 μg of anti-AR (Santa Cruz N-20) or control normal rabbit serum (1 μg of IgG), and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, washed once in PBS, eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. LNCaP cells (obtained from the ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and 10 nm DHT. The LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line (kindly provided by C. Sawyers, University of California at Los Angeles, CA) (48Klein K.A. Reiter R.E. Redula J. Moradi H. Zhu X.L. Brothman A.R. Lamb D.J. Marcelli M. Belldegrun A. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) was grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% FCS and 10 nm DHT. Coimmunoprecipitations were carried out under the same conditions as above, or in an alternative buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and no glycerol where indicated. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (1:1000 dilutions incubated overnight at 4 °C), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit Ig secondaries (Promega) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Plates (10 cm) containing LNCaP cells were cultured for 2 days in RPMI 1640/10% FCS and then 2 days in RPMI-1640/10% CS-FCS, followed by pulsing with DHT (10 nm). Plates were then rinsed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. After chromatin extraction, shearing, and preclearing steps as described previously (49Masiello D. Cheng S. Bubley G.J. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26321-26326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), samples were split and immunoprecipitated with 500 ng of affinity-purified rabbit anti-AR or control (rabbit anti-PDGF receptor) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). The conditions for immunoprecipitations, cross-link reversal, DNA purification, and PCR amplification (using 10% of the sample for each reaction) were as described previously (49Masiello D. Cheng S.

Primers flanking Tcf4 binding element 1 in the c-myc promoter (CCTTTGATT at –1001 from the initiation ATG) (50He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B.

Primers flanking the major PSA gene enhancer were TGAGAAACCTGAGATTAGGA and ATCTCTCTCAGATCCAGGCT, and control primers were in the CD1d gene (49Masiello D. Cheng S. Bubley G.J. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26321-26326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were carried out for 30 cycles, and input reflected 5% of the chromatin samples used for the immunoprecipitations. AR Binds Directly to Tcf4 —Previous data demonstrating a protein-protein interaction between AR and SRY that was mediated by their respective zinc finger and HMG box DNA binding domains suggested that AR might interact directly with other HMG box proteins (11Yuan X. Lu M.L. Li T. Balk S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46647-46654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was tested initially in glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pull-down experiments using a GST-ARDBD fusion protein and HMG proteins that were 35S-labeled by in vitro transcription/translation. One HMG protein examined was T cell factor 4 (Tcf4), a member of the Tcf/Lef family of sequence-specific HMG box proteins that is expressed in multiple epithelial tissues, including prostate (16Chesire D.R. Ewing C.M. Gage W.R. Isaacs W.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2679-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similarly to SRY, 35S-labeled Tcf4 bound specifically to a fusion protein containing the AR DBD, GST-ARDBD-(556–628), and not to GST or an AR hinge region fusion protein, GST-AR-(634–668) (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that the in vitro transcribed/translated Tcf4 migrated as two bands with the upper band being ∼68 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of the unmodified protein. The lower band, which also bound to the GST-ARDBD-(556–628) protein, may be a proteolytic product or internally initiated protein. Significantly, GST-ARDBD-(556–628) did not bind to β-catenin, consistent with previous reports showing that β-catenin binds to the AR LBD (39Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Sasaki C.Y. Longo D.L. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This result indicated that the Tcf4 binding was direct and not mediated by β-catenin. Another control protein, β-galactosidase, similarly failed to bind any of the GST proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments then addressed whether there was a detectable interaction between intact AR and Tcf4 in vivo. CV1 cells (which do not express endogenous AR) were transiently transfected with AR and Tcf4 expression vectors and treated for 24 h with or without androgen (5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)), and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-AR or control antibodies. Interestingly, anti-Tcf4 immunoblotting of the input lanes showed primarily a band at ∼86 kDa and a much weaker band at the expected size of 68 kDa (Fig. 1B). The same major 86-kDa band was detected by two different anti-Tcf4 antibodies and was not found in the nontransfected cells (data not shown). A larger Tcf4 isoform of ∼86 kDa has also been found in prostate cancer cell lines and may be due to attachment of SUMO as has been described for Tcf2/Lef1 (16Chesire D.R. Ewing C.M. Gage W.R. Isaacs W.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2679-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 51Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In any case, both Tcf4 isoforms were coprecipitated by the anti-AR antibody in the lysate from AR- and Tcf4-cotransfected cells treated with DHT (Fig. 1B). In contrast, minimal Tcf4 was found in the control nonimmune antibody precipitates or in the anti-AR precipitate from cells that were transfected only with Tcf4. The Tcf4 coimmunoprecipitation was also markedly diminished in the absence of DHT, further indicating that it was mediated by the AR. It should be noted that this latter result does not imply a strict androgen dependence for Tcf4 binding but may reflect stabilization of AR-Tcf4 binding by β-catenin (see below). Tcf4 Represses AR Transcriptional Activity in Transient Transfections—Transient transfections with AR, Tcf4, and an AR-regulated reporter gene were carried out to determine whether there were functional interactions between intact AR and Tcf4. CV1 cells cotransfected with an AR expression vector and an AR-regulated firefly luciferase reporter gene (ARE4-Luc) showed strong DHT-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection with a Tcf4 expression vector resulted in a marked and dose-dependent decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the repression was somewhat less at the highest levels of Tcf4 (100–200 ng), possibly reflecting sequestration of a corepressor. The repression was specific, because activity of a cotransfected Renilla luciferase reporter gene regulated by a CMV promoter was not decreased (Fig. 2B). Anti-AR immunoblots of the same lysates used for the luciferase assays further indicated that repression, which was >50% at 5 ng of Tcf4 plasmid, was not due to decreased AR expression (Fig. 2C). These findings were consistent with recent reports that also found Tcf4 inhibition of AR in transient transfections (43Chesire D.R. Isaacs W.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8453-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 44Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additional AR-regulated reporter genes were analyzed to determine whether the Tcf4 repression was general versus enhancer-specific. Tcf4 markedly repressed AR transcriptional activity on a reporter gene regulated by an androgen-dependent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter/enhancer (PSA7kb-Luc), containing 7 kb upstream of the PSA coding region with multiple AREs (Fig. 3A). Tcf4 similarly repressed AR activity on an MMTV-LTR reporter (MMTV-Luc), containing two AREs (Fig. 3B). Repression of the ARE4-Luc reporter by Tcf4 was also observed in another cell line, human 293T cells (data not shown). These re"

We are able to reduce steady state levels for mRNA for each enzyme by >85%, and protein amounts by 88–94% in cells. Selective inactivation of BACE1 by RNA interference results in decreased β-cleaved secreted APP and Aβ peptide secretion from cells, as expected. Selective inactivation of BACE2 by RNAi results in increased β-cleaved secreted APP and Aβ peptide secretion from cells. Simultaneous targeting of both enzymes by RNA interference does not have any net effect on Aβ released from cells.

This second cleavage site for BACE1 is between Aβ residues 10 and 11 and between Aβ residues 19 and 20 for BACE2. Cleavage of APP by BACE1 at either site is amyloidogenic, whereas the second cleavage site for BACE2 on APP precludes formation of Aβ. Overexpression of BACE2 in transfected cells produces intracellular carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs), as well as release of β-cleaved secreted APP (sAPPβ) from cells, consistent with cleavage of APP at the β-site by this enzyme (14Hussain I.

Hence, the reduction in secreted Aβ occurs in spite of the concomitant increased secretion of sAPPβ from cells overexpressing BACE2. The decrease in Aβ production from BACE2 transfected cells has been attributed to the second cleavage site for BACE2 on APP (14Hussain I. Powell D.J. Howlett D.R. Chapman G.A. Gilmour L. Murdock P.R.

The observations on the cleavage specificity of BACE2 on APP substrate are derived from transfected cells that overexpress the enzyme. The role of BACE2 in Aβ production in cells expressing endogenous levels of the enzyme remains an unanswered question. Many tissues (including brain) and cell types co-express BACE1 and BACE2 mRNA (8Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The therapeutic relevance of inhibiting one, the other, or both enzymes for Aβ production in cells/tissues that co-express the two enzymes also remains an unanswered question. RNA interference (RNAi) is the process whereby double-stranded RNA mediates the sequence specific destruction of its cognate mRNA (20Hannon G.J.

Biol. 2001; 8: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). RNAi is triggered by 21–23-nucleotide synthetic double-stranded RNAs termed small interfering RNA (siRNAs, we use “oligonucleotide” synonymously with siRNA in this report for convenience) in mammalian cells (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8105) Google Scholar, 24Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We report here the selective knock-down of endogenous BACE1 or BACE2 message as well as protein by RNAi in HEK293 cell lines stably overexpressing APP695wt (wild type allele) or APPsw, the familial Alzheimer's disease allele of APP (the K595M,N596L Swedish double mutant). The selective knock-down of either enzyme leads to complementary alterations in APP metabolites and Aβ peptide secreted from cells. Our studies suggest that BACE2 inhibition elevates secretion of Aβ in cells co-expressing BACE1 and BACE2 and are of significance for amyloid-based therapeutics targeting these enzymes. Quantitative PCR—For RNA analysis, total RNA was prepared from cells at various time points post-transfection using Qiagen RNAeasy total RNA extraction kits. Total RNA was treated with DNase and quantitated by absorbance before quantitative PCR assay. Absence of contaminating DNA in the final RNA preparations was confirmed by a PCR assay with input RNA as template, omitting the reverse transcriptase. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 Sequence Detector. All of the samples were assayed in triplicate. BACE1 primers, 5′-CCCGAAAACGAATTGGCTTT and 3′-GCTGCCGTCCTGAACTCATC, and probe, CTGTCAGCGCTTGCCATGTGCA; and BACE2 primers, 5′-CGTTTTCTCCATGCAGATGTGT and 3′-CCTCCGTTGGTCCCAGATC, and probe, AGCCGGCTTGCCCGTTGCT. Standard curves for BACE1 and 2 in HEK293 cells treated with siRNAs, as well as in primary brain cultures, were obtained using serial dilution of total RNA from untreated HEK293 cells. BACE message values per ng of input RNA were normalized to GAPDH message per ng of input RNA for each sample. BACE1 and 2 mRNA levels in cell lines were determined with standard curves using an in vitro synthesized RNA transcript as the standard. RNAi-mediated Knock-down of BACE1 and BACE2 in HEK293 Cells—The synthetic siRNAs to BACE1 used in this study are: B1 sense, CAGGAUCUGAAAAUGGACUGtt; B1 anti-sense, CAGUCCAUUUUCAGAUCCUGtt; B2 sense, UCUACGUUGUCUUUGAUCGGtt; B2 antisense, CCGAUCAAAGACAACGUAGAtt; B3 sense, CAGACGCUCAACAUCCUGGUtt; and B3 antisense, ACCAGGAUGUUGAGCGUCUGtt.

These siRNA were synthesized and used essentially as described (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8105) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild type APP695 (Amy5) (26Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G.

The Cells were transfected overnight with 200 ng of double-stranded RNA/well using Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative analysis of APP metabolites and Aβ production in cells, all of the transfections were performed in triplicate, and the samples were assayed independently. For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, transfections with a combination of BACE1 and BACE2 oligonucleotides were conducted with 100 ng of each oligonucleotide, for a total of 200 ng of oligonucleotide/transfection (standard conditions) or 20 ng of total oligonucleotide (0.1× condition). No additional carrier nucleic acid was added for the 0.1× transfections. BACE1 and 2 protein knock-down was confirmed by co-transfecting siRNAs with 0.8-μg plasmid expression vectors encoding BACE1 or BACE2-Fc. Western Blot Analysis and Aβ Measurement in Transfected Cells— For protein knock-down studies, the cell lysates and conditioned media were collected at 48 h post-transfection. The cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and analyzed by Western blot with the antibodies as noted below. Protein concentration in lysates was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Fresh conditioned medium was collected from cells for 4 h at 2 days post-transfection by replacing transfection medium, and 10–20 μl/lane (normalized for protein concentration of the cognate lysate) were loaded onto gels for Western blot analysis. APP metabolites were detected with the antibodies previously described. Briefly, we used 8E5 for total sAPP (27Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. Guido T. Hagopian S. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Lee M. Leibowitz P. Lieberburg I. Little S. Masliah E. McConlogue L. Montoya-Zavala M. Mucke L. Paganini L. Penniman E. Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar), anti-6 for intracellular mature APP, as well as intracellular CTFs (28Oltersdorf T. Ward P.J. Henriksson T. Beattie E.C. Neve R.L. Lieberburg I. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4492-4497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 192wt and 192sw for sAPPβ species produced from APPwt and APPsw, respectively (29Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal 7A6, preferentially recognizing the sAPPα neoepitope, was produced using peptide CEVHHQK (residues 607–612 from APP695/Aβ residues 11–16), coupled via the amino-terminal cysteine residue to sheep anti-mouse IgG as immunogen. Hybridomas from mice immunized with this peptide were screened for reactivity to peptide sequence CGGYEVHHQK (Aβ residues 10–16). Hybridoma clone 7A6 showed stronger reactivity toward the Aβ10–16 peptide than to a peptide spanning the α-secretase cleavage site (Aβ residues 1–28). A quantitation of the difference in reactivity of 7A6 toward the two peptides, presented in the supplemental figure, shows that 7A6 reactivity toward sAPP in conditioned medium is competed 100% by the immunizing peptide at 100 μg/ml but only partially by the overlapping peptide at 100 μg/ml. Competition by 10 μg/ml Aβ 11–16 is approximately equal to the level of competition seen with 100 μg/ml Aβ 1–28. The result presented in the supplemental figure indicates that 7A6 binds with ∼10 times greater preference to the sAPPα neo-epitope (ending at Aβ residue 16) than it does to a peptide which spans this site. Hence, although 7A6 is not expected to detect the sAPP species from BACE2 cleavage at Aβ residues 19 and 20 by virtue of the immunogen against which it was raised, it can potentially detect sAPP species extending beyond Aβ residue 16 because of a 10-fold weaker reactivity for residues between Aβ11 and Aβ16. Further characterization of monoclonal 7A6 included the ability to capture iodinated Aβ10–16 peptide. Total Aβ was quantitated by sandwich ELISA using monoclonal antibody 266-coated microtiter plates followed by biotinylated 3D6 as secondary reporter (30Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. Usa. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This assay measures all Aβ species starting at position 1 and extending beyond position 28 (i.e. Aβ 1–x). Statistical analysis of Aβ values was performed using StatView software package (SAS, Cary, NC). All of the samples were analyzed by analysis of variance, followed by post-hoc analysis using Fischer's protected least significant difference test to determine p values, comparing the means of the normalized Aβ values of each treatment group to the mean of the normalized Aβ value from the no treatment control group and also to the mean of the normalized Aβ value from the lamin and GFP control groups. BACE1 protein expression was detected by rabbit polyclonal antisera 264 (immunized with a peptide corresponding to BACE1 residues 48–66 of the nascent polypeptide). BACE2 protein was detected as a chimeric Fc construct (residues 1–465 of BACE2 extracellular domain fused to H-CH2-CH3 domains of human Cγ1) followed by an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) to detect and quantify suppression of transfected BACE2. Parallel blots from equivalently loaded gels were probed with antibody to β-tubulin (Sigma) to confirm specificity of siRNAs for the targeted protein, as well as equal sample loading. BACE1 and BACE2 mRNA Are Co-expressed in Cells—A quantitative RT-PCR survey of different cell types reveals the co-expression of mRNA for BACE1 and BACE2 enzymes in a variety of cell lines (Fig. 1A). Of the brain cell types surveyed, we observed co-expression of the mRNA for both enzymes in astrocytes, whereas BACE1 was exclusively expressed in neurons and microglia (Fig. 1B). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (purified from rat optic nerve) do not express detectable levels of either message (not shown). Although a discrepancy has been noted with regard to message and activity distribution of BACE1 (5Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar), we note that mRNA degradation is directly linked with protein expression, as well as with APP metabolite production, in our experiments using RNAi (see below) in HEK293 cells. siRNAs to BACE1 and BACE2 Reduce Expression of the Cognate Protein and mRNA in a Sequence-specific Manner—A detailed comparison of residue specificity between 8 substrate subsites spanning P4–P4′ revealed a very high degree of similarity between BACE1 and 2 (31Turner 3rd, R.T.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), underscoring the challenge in obtaining selective small molecule inhibitors. Hence, we addressed the role of BACE1 and BACE2 in Aβ production in HEK293 cells (a cell type that expresses message for both enzymes, labeled as A293 in Fig. 1A) by selective degradation of mRNA for each enzyme using RNAi. Synthetic siRNAs to BACE1 and BACE2 (“Experimental Procedures”) were tested for activity in an overexpression paradigm by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with the double-stranded RNAs along with BACE1 or BACE2-Fc expression vectors. Expression of BACE1 and BACE2-Fc in lysates from transfected cells was assessed by Western blot analysis. The results, shown in Fig. 2, indicate that BACE1 expression is reduced specifically by oligonucleotide B3, and BACE2-Fc expression is reduced specifically by oligonucleotide C3. Expression of BACE1 is not affected by an irrelevant lamin A/C oligonucleotide (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8105) Google Scholar) nor any of the BACE2 oligonucleotides tested. Likewise, BACE2 expression is not affected by any of the BACE1 oligonucleotides tested nor by irrelevant oligonucleotides targeting lamin A/C or GFP. We further characterized the specificity as well as the kinetics of the active siRNAs B3 (anti-BACE1) and C3 (anti-BACE2) for degradation of the cognate mRNA in 293sw cells. Total RNA was isolated from 293sw cells (expressing endogenous levels of BACE1 and BACE2) at varying time points following transfection with oligonucleotides B3, C3, or B3+C3, and mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Lamin siRNA was used as a specificity control. The results from this experiment, shown in Fig. 3, confirm the specificity and reveal the kinetics of message degradation mediated by the siRNAs. The lamin A/C oligonucleotide does not affect BACE1 message over the 72-h time course surveyed (Fig. 3A). BACE2 message is likewise unaffected by the lamin oligonucleotide up to 48 h (Fig. 3B). Although BACE2 mRNA is reduced 50% at 72 h post-transfection by the lamin oligonucleotide, we note that our experiments assayed the effect of RNAi against BACE2 at 48 h post-transfection. BACE1 message is not affected by the active C3 oligonucleotide targeting BACE2 (Fig. 3A), nor is BACE2 message affected by the active BACE1 oligonucleotide B3 (Fig. 3D). Degradation of both transcripts by the respective oligonucleotides is evident within 6 h post-transfection (Fig. 3, B and C). BACE2 mRNA is suppressed 90% by 12 h post-transfection and remains suppressed for at least 72 h (3B, 3D). BACE1 message suppression appears less robust (∼60% suppression at 12 h) and more transient in comparison (return to base line by 72 h; Fig. 3C). In cells transfected simultaneously with both oligonucleotides, suppression of BACE1 mRNA at time points earlier than 48 h is attenuated when compared with BACE2 mRNA suppression (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, the overall potency of the RNAi response to each target appeared to be attenuated when cells were treated with both oligonucleotides (see legend to Fig. 3). Extracts from cells transiently transfected with B3 siRNA plus BACE1 expression plasmid or C3 siRNA plus BACE2-Fc expression plasmid were analyzed by quantitative Western blots to determine the magnitude of protein suppression in an overexpression paradigm. Our results, shown in Fig. 4, indicate that BACE1 expression is reduced at least 8–16-fold (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas BACE2 is suppressed at least 16-fold (Fig. 4C). In summary, RNAi mediated suppression of BACE1 by oligonucleotide B3 and that of BACE2 by oligonucleotide C3 are highly sequence-specific. In addition, mRNA degradation correlates with a suppression of the cognate overexpressed protein. BACE1 and BACE2 Knock-down Alters APP Metabolites Released from Cells—The consequence of knocking down endogenous BACE2 or BACE1 on APP metabolism and Aβ production was studied in stably transfected cells overexpressing APPsw (293sw cells; Fig. 5) or APP695wt (Amy5 cells; Fig. 6). The high level of APP expression in these cells facilitates detection of metabolites produced by the two enzym"

Does stimulus-transcription coupling occur in vivo? And does catestatin antagonize secretion and transcription in vivo? To answer these questions, we employed a novel mouse strain harboring a chromogranin A promoter/firefly luciferase reporter transgene. Tissue-specific expression of the reporter was established by both luminescence and reverse transcription-PCR. Secretion and transcription in vivo were triggered by either direct nicotinic stimulation or vesicular transmitter depletion. Nicotinic blockade in vivo was attempted with either the classical antagonist chlorisondamine or the novel antagonist catestatin. Luciferase reporter expression was exquisitely sensitive over a large dynamic range, was specific for the transgenic animals, and paralleled typical neuroendocrine distribution of endogenous chromogranin A. Adrenal ontogeny revealed a rise of embryonic transgene expression until embryonal day 18, with an abrupt postnatal decline. Direct nicotinic stimulation of chromaffin cells caused catecholamine release and transgene transcription, each of which was nearly completely blocked by chlorisondamine. Similar adrenal results were obtained during vesicular catecholamine depletion. Both secretion and transcription were substantially blocked in the adrenal gland by catestatin. In brain and sympathetic nerve, stimulation of transcription was more modest, and reserpine responses were only incompletely blocked by chlorisondamine or catestatin, perhaps because of limited blood-brain barrier penetration by these cationic antagonists. Thus, nicotinic cholinergic stimulus-transcription coupling occurs in vivo and can be provoked either directly or indirectly (by vesicular transmitter depletion). Such coupling triggers the biosynthesis of chromogranin A, the precursor of catestatin. Catestatin itself blocks stimulation of both secretion and transcription in vivo. Thus, chromogranin A and its catestatin fragment may lie at the nexus of nicotinic cholinergic signaling in vivo.

We therefore set out to explore whether chromaffin cell stimulus-transcription coupling (specifically nicotinic cholinergic transcriptional stimulation of chromogranin A) occurs in vivo. To test this possibility, we employed a transgenic strain in which a mouse chromogranin A 4.8-kbp proximal promoter drives the expression of firefly luciferase, an extraordinarily sensitive reporter of gene expression (10Contag C.H.

In the in vivo experiments reported here, we used nicotine (mimicking the autonomic ganglionic transmitter acetylcholine) and reserpine (indirect stimulation by vesicular depletion) to evoke catecholamine release and expression of the transgene in the adrenal gland, sympathetic nerve, and brain. At the same time, we wished to test whether the catecholamine release-inhibitory fragment catestatin (1Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 377-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby acting as an autocrine, negative feedback inhibitor of catecholamine release (1Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether catestatin inhibits catecholamine release in vivo (i.e. in an intact organism). Our in vivo findings confirm in vitro studies of nicotinic signaling to both catecholamine secretion and gene transcription, documenting the role of catestatin in both processes. The studies also provide a novel in vivo photoprobe to investigate stimulus-transcription coupling in experimental cardiovascular disease states. Transgenic Promoter/Reporter Construction—The mouse chromogranin A promoter (–4.8 kbp to +42 bp) was identified by cDNA hybridization, restriction-mapped, excised from a genomic cosmid clone as an XhoI/HindIII fragment, and subcloned into the polylinker of the firefly luciferase reporter vector pXP1, as described previously (18Wu H.J. Rozansky D.J. Parmer R.J. Gill B.M. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wu H. Rozansky D.J. Webster N.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 118-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter's cap (transcription initiation) site was established by primer extension, as described (18Wu H.J. Rozansky D.J. Parmer R.J. Gill B.M. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wu H. Rozansky D.J. Webster N.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 118-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter position numbering is according to bases upstream (–) or downstream (+) of the cap site. The translational start codon (ATG) in mouse chromogranin A begins 258 bases downstream of the cap site (18Wu H.J. Rozansky D.J. Parmer R.J. Gill B.M. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wu H. Rozansky D.J. Webster N.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 118-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the promoter fragment used in these experiments is entirely upstream of the amino acid-encoding region of the chromogranin A gene, and the first ATG downstream of the cap site encodes the initial Met of firefly luciferase. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The mouse chromogranin A promoter/firefly luciferase reporter transgenic mouse was created by first digesting the above pXP1 mouse chromogranin A 4.8-kbp promoter/firefly luciferase reporter construct with PvuI and BamHI, to linearize and excise the promoter/reporter transgene from the vector, and then purifying the linear transgene for microinjection using Sepharose gel separation, CsCl density gradient centrifugation, and dialysis against microinjection buffer (20Hocker M. Cramer T. O'Connor D.T. Rosewicz S. Wiedenmann B. Wang T.C. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The transgene also contains an SV40 polyadenylation signal and SV40 3′-untranslated sequence, containing an SV40 small T intron (splice donor and acceptor sites) (Fig. 1A). The male pronucleus of fertilized eggs from the FVB inbred strain (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) was used for microinjection of the transgene. The presence of the transgene was evaluated by either Southern blot or polymerase chain reaction. The transgenic animals were then inbred to homozygosity. mRNA Abundance by RT 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RLU, relative light unit(s); En, embryonic day n; Pn, postnatal day n; Fn, fetal day n.-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from freshly dissected mouse tissues with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) treatment (to eliminate any residual genomic DNA). Integrity of the RNA was confirmed by the appearance of 28 s and 18 S rRNA bands on ethidium bromide-stained gels. RT-PCR was performed using PTC-200 DNA Engine thermal cyclers (MJ Research, Watertown, MA), employing a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit and the following primer pairs (NCBI accession numbers): mouse chromogranin A mRNA (NM_007693), forward chromogranin A 256–278 (5′-AAGTGCGTCCTGGAAGTCATCTC-3′) and reverse chromogranin A 859–840 (5′-GCTTGGCTTTTCTGGCTTGC-3′); firefly luciferase mRNA (M15077), forward firefly 603–626 (5′-TACTGGGTTACCTAAGGGTGTGGC-3′) and reverse firefly 1002–982 (5′-TGGAAGATGGAAGCGTTTTGC-3′); mouse cyclophilin mRNA (X52803), forward cyclophilin 232–255 (5′-GTGGTGACTTTACACGCCATAATG-3′) and reverse cyclophilin 488–467 (5′-ATTCCTGGACCCAAAACGCTCC-3′). First strand cDNA was prepared from 500 ng of total RNA template by reverse transcription (using Omniscript™ and Sensiscript™ reverse transcriptases) at 54 °C for 30 min, followed by PCR. The PCR protocol began with a 95 °C/15-min step (for simultaneous inactivation of the reverse transcriptases and activation of the HotstarTaq™ DNA polymerase), followed by a three-step amplification profile (94 °C denaturing step for 30 s, 55 °C annealing step for 30 s, and 72 °C extension step for 1 min) for 25 cycles, 72 °C for 10 min, and finally holding at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was composed of 10 μl of 5× RT-PCR buffer, 2 μl of dNTP mix (each at 10 mm), 2 μl each of forward and reverse primers (each at 10 μm), 2 μl of RT-PCR enzyme mix, 0.2 μl of RNasin® ribonuclease inhibitor (at 40 units/μl; Promega), and 5–15 μl (depending on the concentration) of the template RNA and RNase-free water to achieve the final desired total volume (50 μl/amplification). After PCR, the products were visualized/photographed on 1.5% agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining/310-nm UV fluorescence. PCR products were then purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and amplification of the correct targets was verified by DNA sequencing. As a negative control, when RNA was pretreated with RNase A (Qiagen), no product in the RT-PCR assay was detected after gel electrophoresis. As a second negative control, no PCR product was obtained when water was included instead of RNA samples in the reaction mixture. Drug Treatments and Tissue Harvesting—The drugs used were nicotine (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally; Sigma), the vesicular monoamine transporter inhibitor reserpine (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally; Sigma), the neuronal nicotinic cholinergic antagonist chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally; Tocris-Cookson), the novel nicotinic antagonist catestatin (20 nmol/25-g mouse intraperitoneally), or vehicle. Catestatin (bovine chromogranin A344–358; RSMRLSFRARGYGFR) was synthesized and then purified to >95% homogeneity by RP-HPLC; the identity and purity of the final product were verified by re-HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The catestatin dose (20 nmol/25-g mouse) was calculated so as to achieve a concentration of ∼4 μm in the extracellular space (estimated as 20% of body weight). In some studies, stimulation of sympathetic outflow was undertaken (directly by nicotine; indirectly by reserpine or vehicle). In dose- and time-dependent studies, reserpine at several doses (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) versus mock was injected for 4 and 18 h. In other studies, animals were first pretreated with either a nicotinic cholinergic antagonist (chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or catestatin (20 nmol/25 g intraperitoneally)) or vehicle. 30 min later, the sympathetic stimulant was administered: nicotine (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally), reserpine (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally), or vehicle. For studies of the effects of the stimulants on plasma catecholamines, mice were treated with drugs (versus vehicle) as noted above, and 30 min later they were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a rodent anesthesia mixture (ketamine (60 mg/kg of body weight); xylazine (6.4 mg/kg of body weight); acepromazine (1.2 mg/kg of body weight)). After anesthesia was achieved (1–2 min), blood was then collected from the left ventricle into Eppendorf tubes containing acid/citrate/dextrose as anticoagulant. Blood was kept on ice and centrifuged, and the plasma stored at –70 °C until the assay. Plasma catecholamines were assayed by a sensitive radioenzymatic method (21Kennedy B. Ziegler M.G. Life Sci. 1990; 47: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In studies of transcriptional activation of the chromogranin A/luciferase transgene, tissues were obtained from control or drug-treated mice after sacrifice by cervical dislocation, typically 16 h after administration of the drug (nicotine, reserpine, or vehicle) perturbing chromogranin A biosynthesis. Quantitative Assay of the Chromogranin A/Luciferase Transgene Enzymatic Activity—Freshly dissected tissue samples were collected in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and briefly (15–30 s, depending on the volume of the tissue) homogenized by a Tissuemizer homogenizer with a TR-10 power control device (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH) set at 50% power output. Typical buffer homogenization volumes were 0.25 ml/adrenal gland, and 1.0 ml/brain. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, collecting the supernatant in a fresh microcentrifuge tube after the first spin. 100 μl of the clear lysates were then placed in clear plastic polystyrene 12 × 47-mm tubes in an ultrasensitive, low noise luminometer with a 12-watt Peltier-cooled (8 °C) photomultiplier tube, a dark count rate of <100 counts/s (even at 20 °C), spectral sensitivity of 390–620 nm, 20-ns resolution, and quantum efficiency of 24% (AutoLumat LB 953, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) with AutoLumat-PC-Control software in a personal computer running DOS on an Intel Celeron RAM chip. 100 μl of the luciferase assay buffer (final concentrations: 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm luciferin substrate, 3 mm ATP cofactor) were injected to each tube, and flash luminescence was recorded for 10 s and saved in a Kaleidagraph spreadsheet in a personal computer. 3–10 μl (depending on the tissue type) of the tissue lysates were used for total protein measurement (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), by a Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye binding assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activities in the various tissues were normalized to protein concentration and expressed as mean relative light units (RLU) ± S.E. One RLU represents 10 pulses released by light quanta from the photon counter. Assay blanks were obtained by measuring luciferase activity in buffer alone (without tissue homogenate). Data Analysis and Statistics—Data are reported as the mean value ± one S.E. When only two conditions (e.g. control and experimental) were compared, the data were evaluated by unpaired t tests. When multiple conditions were compared, we used one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Dunnett multiple comparison post hoc test, if appropriate. Statistical significance was concluded at p < 0.05. Statistics were computed with the programs InStat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Chicago, IL), or Kaleidagraph (Synergy/Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA). The chromogranin A promoter/luciferase reporter transgene (Fig. 1A) was an extraordinarily sensitive probe of promoter activity (Fig. 1B); the dynamic range of the system extended over 5 log10 orders of magnitude, and tissue samples could be diluted over 105-fold (down to nanogram quantities of tissue protein) without reaching the lower limit of detection (Fig. 1B). Assay of chromogranin A/luciferase in the adrenal gland of transgenic mice showed luciferase expression more than ∼1000 times background (nonspecific) luminescence in control adrenal glands (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the typical cell type-specific pattern of expression of the endogenous chromogranin A gene (23O'Connor D.T. Regul. Pept. 1983; 6: 263-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we found that the chromogranin A-luciferase transgene was expressed in endocrine (adrenal » pituitary > testis > ovary > pancreas) and neuronal tissues (brain stem, hippocampus, frontal cortex, thalamus, olfactory bulb > striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum) but not in control tissues (liver, spleen) (Fig. 2B). To directly compare expression of the two forms of the chromogranin A promoter (endogenous gene versus transgenic), we employed RT-PCR in the same tissues (Fig. 3). Consistent with the luminescence data (Fig. 2B), both the endogenous chromogranin A gene (chromogranin A mRNA) and the chromogranin A/luciferase transgene (luciferase mRNA) were expressed in endocrine (adrenal > gut > pituitary > testis, ovary) and neuronal tissues (brain > vas deferens). The endogenous and transgenic mRNAs displayed similar rank orders of expression in these neuroendocrine sites. There was no detectable expression of either endogenous or transgenic mRNAs in control tissues (skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, heart). Comparability of mRNA load per lane was confirmed by RT-PCR of a “housekeeping” transcript, cyclophilin. Previous in situ hybridization studies on the ontogeny (day E16 to P9) of chromogranin A mRNA in rat brain revealed expression in the intermediate cortical layer and dentate gyrus by day E16 (24Mahata M. Mahata S.K. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 76: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, we detected expression of the chromogranin A/luciferase transgene as early as day E6 (Fig. 4A). A steady increase in expression of the transgene in brain was seen up to day E18, with a subsequent abrupt decline after birth (day P1) and then a further slow decline up to day P30, after which expression stabilized up to day P360 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression of the transgene in the adrenal gland displayed a substantial increment from day E18 to P1 but was followed thereafter by only ∼20% fluctuations up to day P360 (Fig. 4B). Acute Transmitter Release—Direct activation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors by nicotine caused acute (30 min) ∼2.7-fold release of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) from storage vesicles into the bloodstream (Fig. 5). When animals were pretreated with the classical neuronal nicotinic antagonist chlorisondamine, the catecholamine increment was blunted by >80%, confirming specific mediation of the response by nicotinic receptors. Stimulus-Transcription Coupling—Chromogranin A (25Takiyyuddin M.A. Cervenka J.H. Sullivan P.A. Pandian M.R. Parmer R.J. Barbosa J.A. O'Connor D.T.

Treatment with nicotine resulted in a ∼2-fold increment in expression of the chromogranin A/luciferase transgene, confirming the phenomenon in vivo, and the increment was >80% inhibited by the classical nicotinic cholinergic antagonist chlorisondamine (Fig. 6A). Catestatin in Vivo—The chromogranin A fragment catestatin (1Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin.

O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, catestatin also blocked the transcriptional response to nicotine by >90% (Fig. 6A), establishing an entirely new role for the peptide on gene expression in vivo. Besides stimulation of neurotransmitter release, nicotine triggers expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis such as tyrosine hydroxylase (26Mitchell S.N. Smith K.M. Joseph M.H. Gray J.A. Neuroscience. 1993; 56: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), neurotransmitter transporters such as the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (27Prendergast M.A. Buccafusco J.J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1385-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (28Li M.D. Kane J.K. Parker S.L. McAllen K. Matta S.G. Sharp B.M. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and transcription factors such as c-Fos and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (29Hiremagalur B. Sabban E.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nicotinic stimulation elevated brain expression of the chromogranin A transgene by ∼26% (Fig. 6B). This increment was blocked ∼70% by the classical nicotinic antagonist chlorisondamine and ∼80% by the novel nicotinic antagonist catestatin. Initial Transmitter Release and Catestatin—Vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) inhibition by reserpine causes an initial release of stored catecholamines in vitro (30Mahata M. Mahata S.K. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in vivo (31Takiyyuddin M.A. Brown M.R. Dinh T.Q. Cervenka J.H. Braun S.D. Parmer R.J.

Chem. 276, 45380–45386), we described the NFκB status for two murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines, LY-as (apoptosis-sensitive) and LY-ar (apoptosis-refractory) and provided evidence that NFκB1 (p50) homodimers contribute to the expression of Bcl-2 in the LY-ar line. In the present study, we investigated the upstream signals leading to p50 homodimer activation and Bcl-2 expression. We found that in LY-ar cells, ERK1 and ERK2 were constitutively phosphorylated, whereas LY-as cells had no detectable ERK1 or ERK2 phosphorylation. Treatment of LY-ar cells with the MEK inhibitors PD 98059, U0126, and PD 184352 led to a loss of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2, a reversal of nuclear p50 homodimer DNA binding, and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression. Similarly, activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in LY-as cells by phorbol ester led to Bcl-2 expression that could be blocked by PD 98059. Furthermore, treatment of LY-ar cells with tumor necrosis factor-α, an IκB kinase activator, did not alter the suppressive effect of PD 98059 on p50 homodimer activity, suggesting an IκB kinase-independent pathway for p50 homodimer activation. Lastly, all three MEK inhibitors sensitized LY-ar cells to radiation-induced apoptosis. We conclude that the MEK/ERK pathway acts upstream of p50 homodimer activity and Bcl-2 expression in this B-cell lymphoma cell system and suggest that the use of MEK inhibitors could be useful clinically in combination with ionizing radiation to treat lymphoid malignancies.

Nuclear factor κ B (NFκB) is traditionally described as a family of transcription factors that are activated during immune and inflammation responses, regulating the genes encoding cytokines such as IL-2, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ar, apoptosis-refractory; as, apoptosis-sensitive; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; M3K, MAP kinase kinase kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; BIG, Bcl-2 IRES (internal ribosome entry site) GFP; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

NFκB has since been dubbed a central mediator of the human immune response and has been shown to control hundreds of genes in addition to those for cytokines, including cell adhesion molecule and immunoreceptor genes (2Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). In the last few years, NFκB has additionally been recognized as a key regulator of anti-apoptotic genes, including the genes coding for the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and members of the Bcl-2 family (3Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 4Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar). This control of anti-apoptotic genes has implicated aberrant NFκB activity as a cell survival signal for many cancer cell types. Cancers classified as having aberrant NFκB activity include Hodgkin's disease, chronic myelogenous leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, melanoma, and solid tumors such as breast, colon, ovarian, pancreatic, thyroid, bladder, and prostate carcinomas (5Schwartz S.A. Hernandez A. Mark Evers B. Surg. Oncol. 1999; 8: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Often, chromosomal rearrangement or overexpression of Rel family members leads to aberrant NFκB activity, particularly in hematopoietic tumors (6Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). However, not all aberrant NFκB activity in cancer cells is a result of Rel family member overexpression, and it has been recognized that NFκB activity may also arise by the activation of signaling kinases that converge on the activation of I κ B kinase (IKK). IKK, in turn, phosphorylates IκB, initiating the degradation of IκB through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. This results in the release of bound NFκB subunits that then translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription (7Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). NFκB-inducing kinase, a mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase kinase (M3K) that is constitutively activated in melanoma cells (8Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), exemplifies a signaling kinase that leads to aberrant NFκB activity in tumor cells upstream of IKK. There are a number of other kinases known to act upstream of IKK. These include members of the M3K family such as MEKK-1, MEKK-2, MEKK-3, and Tpl-2/COT (9Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V.

Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MEKK-1 activity has been associated with pancreatic cancer (14Hirano T. Shino Y. Saito T. Komoda F. Okutomi Y. Takeda A. Ishihara T. Yamaguchi T. Saisho H. Shirasawa H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5923-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), MEKK-3 with hepatocellular carcinoma (15Tsou A.P. Wu K.M. Tsen T.Y. Chi C.W. Chiu J.H. Lui W.Y. Hu C.P. Chang C. Chou C.K. Tsai S.F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and Tpl-2 with breast, colon, and gastric cancers (16Sourvinos G. Tsatsanis C. Spandidos D.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Ohara R. Hirota S. Onoue H. Nomura S. Kitamura Y. Toyoshima K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 97-103PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Tpl-2 has also been found in malignancies associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, where it acts as a mediator of latent membrane protein-1-induced NFκB activation (18Eliopoulos A.G. Davies C. Blake S.S. Murray P. Najafipour S. Tsichlis P.N. Young L.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4567-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, cancers that have aberrant kinase activity upstream of IKK would be expected to have constitutively nuclear NFκB; this activity could, in turn, contribute to the expression of genes important to the survival of those cancers. As mentioned above, several M3K family members have been found to act upstream of IKK. These kinases additionally activate members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, leading to the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and/or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) (19Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In melanoma cells, the NFκB activity downstream of NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) appears to be dependent not only on the activation of IKK but also on NIK-regulated activation of the MEK/ERK cascade (8Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Other reports implicating downstream MAPK signaling kinases in the activation of NFκB include the demonstration that ERK5 and ERK2 cooperatively regulate NFκB activity in NIH 3T3 cells and the suggestion that persistent activation of NFκB by IL-1 is mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway (20Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Jiang B. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The activation of JNK may also contribute to NFκB activity through the induction of β-transducin repeat-containing protein, which mediates ubiquitination of phosphorylated IκB (22Spiegelman V.S. Stavropoulos P. Latres E. Pagano M. Ronai Z. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27152-27158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, several different MAPK proteins may be capable of activating NFκB independently of IKK. It is possible, in terms of cell survival, that this parallel pathway plays an important and redundant role to IKK-induced NFκB activity. We previously described the NFκB status in two murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines, LY-as and LY-ar. The parent line, LY-as, was found to be lacking in NFκB activity, whereas the derived line, LY-ar, had constitutively nuclear NFκB1 (p50) homodimers that apparently contribute to the expression of the bcl-2 gene (23Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used MEK inhibitors to establish a role for the MEK/ERK pathway upstream of p50 homodimer activity and Bcl-2 expression and demonstrate that MEK inhibitors sensitize normally radioresistant LY-ar cells to radiation-induced apoptosis. This study provides evidence that the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway could be an important step in the progression of lymphoma from an apoptosis-sensitive to an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. These data may therefore have clinical implications for the treatment of advanced cancers with therapeutic agents that induce apoptosis. Cell Culture and Treatments—LY-ar and LY-as murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) 200 mm l-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) 10,000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were treated with MEK inhibitors at final concentrations of 50 μm PD 98059 (Calbiochem), 10 μm U0126 (Calbiochem), or 1 μm PD 184352 (a gift from Dr. Michael Andreeff, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Treatment times for MEK inhibitors varied from 1 to 120 h. For experiments requiring 96 and 120 h treatment times, cells were spun down and resuspended in fresh medium at 72 h, at which time fresh MEK inhibitors were added. In some experiments, either TPA (Sigma) in 100% ethanol or recombinant murine TNFα (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at final concentrations of 50 ng/ml or 15 ng/ml, respectively. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Sorting and Analysis to Establish Stable LY-as Cell Lines Expressing a bcl-2 Construct—A retroviral infection strategy was adopted to deliver both human bcl-2 and the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) on a single construct containing an internal ribosomal entry site. Target LY-as cells were infected with retrovirus produced by PHOENIX-Ampho cells using standard polybrene-enhanced retroviral infection. Virus-treated LY-as cells were grown for 2–3 days and bulk-sorted to enrich for GFP expression. After several growth and sorting cycles, GFP-expressing cells were cloned through single-cell sorting by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Stable clones that expressed both GFP and Bcl-2 (as detected by Western blot) were chosen for future experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar), and 15 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with 32P-labeled NFκB oligonucleotide as described by the manufacturer (Promega) except that .07 pmol of radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotide probe per reaction was used rather than .035 pmol. Bound probe was resolved from free probe using 4% native gels run at 180 V at 4 °C for ∼2.5 h. Gels were visualized by phosphorimaging. Western Blots—Whole-cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% v/v protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1% v/v phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), 1% v/v phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma), and 10% glycerol. 25 μgof protein per lane was loaded on 5% stacking/10% resolving polyacrylamide gels and run for ∼1 h at 20 mA. Protein bands were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 100 V for1hat 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and probed with primary antibody overnight. Membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 to remove excess primary antibody and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Syrian hamster (Jackson Laboratories), anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibody for roughly 2–3 h. Blots were developed with ECL+ and visualized by fluorescence scanning and ImageQuant™ analysis software. Mouse Bcl-2 antibody (BD PharMingen) dilution was 1:2000 and secondary antibody dilution was 1:3000. Human Bcl-2 antibody (Dako) dilution was 1:1000, and secondary antibody dilution was 1:1000. Phospho-p44/p42 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) dilution was 1:1000, and secondary antibody dilution was 1:2000. Total p44/p42 antibody (Cell Signaling) dilution was 1:2000, and secondary antibody dilution was 1:2000. Actin antibody (Chemicon) dilution was 1:4000, and secondary antibody dilution was 1:4000. DNA Fragmentation—Enzymatically induced DNA fragmentation as a result of apoptosis was quantified as described previously (25Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were prelabeled with 10 nCi/ml of [14C]thymidine and then incubated for 72 or 96 h in the presence of the MEK inhibitors described above. The cells were then exposed to 5 Gy of γ irradiation from a high dose-rate 137Cs unit (4–5 Gy/min) at room temperature. Cells were collected 4 h later, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by incubation in 0.5 ml of lytic buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 20 min on ice. Insoluble chromatin was separated from soluble DNA fragments by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Soluble and insoluble fractions were transferred to scintillation vials containing 1 ml of Soluene 350 (Packard) and incubated overnight at 60 °C. Ten milliliters of Hionic Fluor (Packard) was added, and samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. DNA fragmentation was quantified as the percentage of the total radioactivity that appeared in the soluble fraction. LY-ar Cells Have Constitutively Phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (p44 and p42), whereas LY-as Cells Lack Phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 Proteins—Two murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines, isolated from a mouse lymphoma (LY-TH) and grown in vitro, were used for these studies. LY-as and LY-ar cells have been described previously for their differences in radiationinduced apoptotic response (25Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the MEK1/MEK2 pathway was activated in these cell lines, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-p44 and -p42 antibodies. The two cell lines had equal expression of total p44 and p42 proteins, but only the LY-ar line possessed constitutively phosphorylated p44 and p42 (Fig. 1). These data indicate that LY-ar cells have a constitutively active MAPK pathway. Treatment of LY-ar Cells with MEK Inhibitors PD 98059, U0126, or PD 184352 Leads to Inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 Phosphorylation—To reverse ERK1/ERK2 activation, LY-ar cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059, which has been shown along with the inhibitors U0126 and PD 184352 to be highly specific for MEK kinases based on its inability to inhibit over 30 other kinases as part of a specificity screen (26Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar). Treatment with PD 98059 for 24 and 48 h led to decreases in phospho-p44 and -p42 as detected by Western blot (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when LY-ar cells were treated with U0126 or PD 184352 for 48 h (Fig. 2B). To determine how rapidly p44 and p42 phosphorylation was diminished with MEK inhibitor treatment, we also treated LY-ar cells with PD 184352 for 1 h. This treatment also led to decreased p44 and p42 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that the MEK inhibitors PD 98059 and U0126 additionally have been reported to inhibit ERK5 phosphorylation by inhibiting MEK5 activity (27Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar); however, Western blot demonstrated that whole-cell lysates from LY-as and LY-ar cells do not differ in their amounts of phosphorylated ERK5. Moreover, treatment of LY-ar cells with PD 184352, which has been shown to be more specific for inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 than ERK5 (28Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), did not result in a loss of ERK5 phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, the ERK1/ERK2 pathway that is activated in LY-ar cells is more likely to contribute to their radioresistant phenotype than the ERK5 pathway. Taken together, the data in Fig. 2 demonstrate that MEK inhibitors very rapidly reverse the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in LY-ar cells and maintain MEK inhibition for long periods of time. Treatment of LY-ar Cells with MEK Inhibitors Leads to Reversal of Nuclear p50 Homodimer DNA Binding Activity— Based on reports suggesting that the MEK/ERK pathway acts upstream of NFκB activation (8Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Jiang B. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we performed an EMSA on nuclear lysates prepared from PD 98059-treated LY-ar cells to determine whether MEK inhibition would lead to a loss of nuclear p50 homodimer activity. DNA binding was lost by 24 h of treatment with PD 98059, and binding remained inhibited at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained using nuclear lysates prepared from LY-ar cells treated for 24 h with U0126 or PD 184352 (Fig. 3B). Because ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation was lost very rapidly when LY-ar cells were treated with PD 184352 (Fig. 2C), we also performed EMSA to determine whether the loss of p50/p50 binding correlated directly with the loss of ERK1/ERK2 activity. Indeed, DNA binding was diminished at both 1 and 3 h of treatment with PD 184352 with losses in p50/p50 DNA binding intensity of 20 and 40%, respectively (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the MEK/ERK pathway acts upstream of p50 homodimer activation in LY-ar cells. Treatment of LY-ar Cells with MEK Inhibitors Leads to Decreases in Bcl-2 Protein Expression—Because our previous data suggested that p50 homodimer activity in LY-ar cells contributed to the expression of the bcl-2 gene (23Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the reversal of nuclear p50 homodimer DNA binding by MEK inhibitors correlated with a loss in Bcl-2 protein expression. Because of the long half-life of Bcl-2 protein, Western blot was performed on whole-cell lysates prepared from LY-ar cells treated with PD 98059 for up to 120 h. Treatment of LY-ar cells with PD 98059 led to decreases in Bcl-2 protein expression with roughly 2- and 4-fold decreases in expression at 48 and 120 h, respectively (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained when Western blot was performed on LY-ar cells treated for 72 h with U0126 or PD 184352, with roughly 2-fold decreases for each (Fig. 4B). Treatment of LY-as Cells with TPA Induces ERK1 and ERK2 Phosphorylation as well as Bcl-2 Protein Expression That Can Be Blocked by PD 98059 —We previously demonstrated that the treatment of LY-as cells with the phorbol ester TPA led to an increase in Bcl-2 protein expression (23Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether TPA treatment would also lead to an activation of ERK1/ERK2, whole-cell lysates were prepared from TPA-treated LY-as cells and analyzed by Western blot for phosphop44 and -p42. Treatment of LY-as cells with TPA led to phosphorylation of ERK proteins, and this activation was blocked by simultaneous treatment with PD 98059 (Fig. 5A). TPA-induced Bcl-2 protein expression was also blocked by simultaneous treatment with PD 98059 as detected by Western blot (Fig. 5B). LY-as Cells Retrovirally Infected with Human bcl-2 Lack Phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 and Nuclear NFκB but Are Resistant to Radiation-induced Apoptosis—To directly test the role of Bcl-2 expression in blocking radiation-induced apoptosis, LY-as cells were infected with retroviral vectors containing human bcl-2 cDNA. Virally infected cells were selected and cloned into stable cell populations by detection of GFP expression downstream of the bcl-2 open reading frame and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). These cells are referred to as the BIG cell line (Bcl-2-IRES-GFP). As a control, LY-as cells were also infected with a retroviral vector expressing GFP alone. These cells are referred to simply as the GFP cell line. To determine whether Bcl-2 expression in LY-as cells caused activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, Western blot for phosphop44 and p42 was performed using whole-cell lysates from GFP and BIG cells. Neither GFP nor BIG cells possessed phosphorylated p44 and p42 proteins (Fig. 6A). In contrast to reports by ourselves and others (23Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Catz S.D. Johnson J.L.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3898-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) suggesting NFκB family members directly regulate transcription of the bcl-2 gene, some researchers have suggested that Bcl-2 can act upstream of NFκB, providing evidence that bcl-2 transfection causes NFκB activation (31de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32de Moissac D. Zheng H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38676-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bcl-2 expression in LY-as cells led to NFκB activation, EMSA was performed using nuclear lysates from GFP and BIG cells. Both cell types were treated with TPA as a positive control for NFκB binding. Like their parent cell type LY-as, neither GFP nor BIG cells had constitutively nuclear NFκB DNA binding; however, NFκB activation by TPA remained intact in both cell lines (Fig. 6B). Although Bcl-2 expression did not lead to the activation of ERK1/ERK2 or NFκB in the LY-as cell background, we performed DNA fragmentation assays on irradiated BIG cells to determine the effect of Bcl-2 expression on apoptosis. As expected, the BIG cell line was resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C). These data are consistent with a model in which activation of the MEK/ERK and NFκB1 pathways is upstream of Bcl-2 expression in LY-ar cells and that Bcl-2 expression is sufficient for resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in this B-cell lymphoma cell system. Treatment of LY-ar Cells with TNFα in the Presence of PD 98059 Suggests That the MEK/ERK Pathway, Not IKK, Is Sufficient for p50 Homodimer Activity—We previously demonstrated that TNFα treatment led to the nuclear translocation of the p50/p65 NFκB dimer in LY-ar cells (23Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this case, TNFα did not affect the level of constitutive p50 homodimers, suggesting that TNFα activated p50/p65 via a separate pathway from that responsible for p50 homodimer activation. TNFα is the prototypal agent for inflammatory cytokine-induced activation of NFκB through activation of IKK (7Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Because p50 homodimers were sensitive to MEK inhibitors (Fig. 3, A–C) and unaffected by a known IKK activator, TNFα, p50 homodimer activity in LY-ar cells appears IKK-independent. To further test this possibility, LY-ar cells were maintained in the presence of PD 98059 for 24 h, treated for an additional 1 h with TNFα while in the presence of PD 98059, and prepared for EMSA. PD 98059 inhibited p50 homodimer DNA binding in both PD 98059-treated LY-ar cells and TNFα/PD 98059-treated LY-ar cells (Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained in TNFα/PD 184352-treated LY-ar and TPA/PD 98059-treated LY-as cells (data not shown). These data indicate that MEK inhibition blocks p50 homodimer activity, even in the presence of a presumably activated IKK signal, suggesting that p50 homodimer activity in LY-ar cells is IKK-independent. It should be noted that TNFα-induced p50/p65 heterodimer activity was partially abrogated by PD 98059 (Fig. 7), suggesting that, in addition to its control of p50 homodimers, the MEK/ERK pathway contributes to the activation of p50/p65 downstream of IKK in LY-ar cells. MEK Inhibitors Sensitize LY-ar Cells to Radiation-induced Apoptosis—Because of the known changes to cell survival pathways caused by such treatments, we investigated whether MEK inhibitors could sensitize LY-ar cells to radiation-induced apoptosis. LY-ar cells were pretreated for 72 or 96 h with the MEK inhibitor PD 980589, U0126, or PD 184352, irradiated with 5 Gy ionizing radiation, and analyzed for apoptosis on the basis of DNA fragmentation 4 h later. It should be noted that within the 4 h time frame that apoptosis is induced, phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 and Bcl-2 protein levels are not elevated by irradiation (data not shown). All three inhibitors sensitized normally apoptosis-resistant LY-ar cells to radiation-induced apoptosis by 72 h of treatment, reaching DNA fragmentation levels that were similar to those observed for the parent cell type, LY-as, by 96 h (Fig. 8). These results provide evidence that MEK inhibitors radiosensitize LY-ar cells by restoring apoptosis propensity. In this study, we examined the role of the MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway in the activation of NFκB1 (p50) homodimers and expression of Bcl-2 in two murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Using highly specific MEK inhibitors, we obtained evidence that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is associated with p50 homodimer activity and Bcl-2 protein expression in LY-as and LY-ar cells. Further evidence suggested that the MEK/ERK pathway and not IKK mediates p50 homodimer activation. Lastly, we demonstrated that MEK inhibitors sensitize LY-ar cells to radiation-induced apoptosis. Our finding that the MEK/ERK pathway affects p50 homodimer DNA binding is, to our knowledge, the first indication of this activity. Although the MEK/ERK pathway has been implicated in the activation of other NFκB dimer forms (8Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the constitutive activity of p50 homodimers is considered to be the result of a rearrangement of p50-p105 heterodimers into p50 homodimers by the IκB family member Bcl-3 (34Watanabe N. Iwamura T. Shinoda T. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). IL-9- and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor-induced Bcl-3 protein expressions have been linked to enhanced p50 homodimer activity by a similar mechanism (35Richard M. Louahed J. Demoulin J.B. Renauld J.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 4318-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Bcl-3 to interact with and control p50 DNA-binding activity appears to be phosphorylation-dependent (37Nolan G.P. Fujita T. Bhatia K. Huppi C. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Caamano J.H. Perez P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have found no difference in the amount of Bcl-3 protein expression between LY-as and LY-ar cells by Western blot (data not shown), but it is possible that the MEK/ERK pathway controls Bcl-3 phosphorylation, thereby affecting p50 homodimer formation and/or DNA binding in LY-ar cells. An alternative mechanism by which p50 homodimers become activated is through IKK activation. The p50 precursor, p105, has been shown to be a target for IKK phosphorylation during cytokine-induced responses that lead to the activation of both p50/p65 and p50/50 dimer forms (39Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By a similar mechanism, the constitutive p50 homodimer signal in LY-ar cells may not be a result of MEK/ERK-induced Bcl-3 activity but rather a result of increased p105 processing directly or indirectly controlled by activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. LY-as cells and LY-ar cells are characterized by profound differences in their apoptotic responses. Changes in NFκB signaling and Bcl-2 expression are apparently responsible for those differences. Indeed, Bcl-2 expression alone can render LY-as cells resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C). The data presented here establish a role for the MEK/ERK pathway upstream of both NFκB and Bcl-2 cell survival pathways, implicating the MEK/ERK pathway as a key mediator of apoptosis propensity for these lymphoma cells. These data therefore suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway may be an excellent marker of disease progression, and our data demonstrating that MEK inhibitors sensitize LY-ar cells to radiation-induced apoptosis may be relevant to other advanced cancers displaying aberrant MEK/ERK activity. MEK inhibitors have been used by other groups to successfully sensitize cells to anti-cancer therapies. For example, PD 98059 and PD 184352 have been used to impair growth, abrogate clonogenicity, and sensitize acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (40Milella M. Kornblau S.M. Estrov Z. Carter B.Z. Lapillonne H. Harris D. Konopleva M. Zhao S. Estey E. Andreeff M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 41Milella M.

Blood. 2002; 99: 3461-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similar to our observations, decreases in the expression of members of the Bcl-2 family were observed. In addition to AML, the MEK/ERK pathway has also been implicated in Bcl-2 family member expression and survival in pancreatic and breast cancer cells (42Boucher M.J. Morisset J. Vachon P.H. Reed J.C.

Therefore, small molecule approaches to inhibiting MEK activity may be useful clinically in the treatment of a variety of tumor types. In fact, PD 184352, also known as CI-1040 (45Herrera R. Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S27-S31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is currently in clinical trials for patients with advanced cancer. Although previous studies have suggested that MEK inhibitors suppress the growth of various cancers and enhance the effectiveness of certain treatment modalities, some researchers have suggested that MEK inhibitors are not useful for sensitizing carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (46Gupta A.K.

(49Vrana J.A. Grant S. Dent P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 151: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have used PD 98059 in combination with ionizing radiation to treat HL-60 cells, which resulted in a large increase in apoptosis and a large decrease in clonogenicity when compared with either treatment alone. That study, in combination with the work presented here and recent findings from Shonai et al. (50Shonai T. Adachi M. Sakata K. Takekawa M. Endo T. Imai K. Hareyama M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) implicating the MEK/ERK pathway in radioresistance of lymphocytic leukemia cells, suggests that MEK inhibitors may be primarily useful for radiosensitizing hematopoietic cancers. Our study defines a novel upstream signal to NFκB1 activation, i.e. the MEK/ERK pathway; however, the upstream signals leading to MEK/ERK activation in LY-ar cells remain to be elucidated. We have performed a Western blot analysis to demonstrate that the M3K Tpl-2 is overexpressed in LY-ar cells as compared with LY-as cells (data not shown). Tpl-2 directly interacts with p105, and its overexpression leads to increased turnover of p105 into p50 subunits (51Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, p50 homodimer activity appeared to be strictly under control of the MEK/ERK pathway. In addition to its interaction with p105, Tpl-2 has been shown to activate MEK (52Salmeron A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D. Narsimhan R.P. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tpl-2 is a good candidate for the upstream signal leading to the sole activation of p50 homodimers in LY-ar cells. It would be interesting to identify a distal upstream signal in LY-ar cells. In T-cells, Tpl-2 has been implicated in NFκB signaling derived from cell surface interactions such as CD28 stimulation (13Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Tpl-2 has a similar function in LY-ar cells, and the identification of a receptor on LY-ar cells that may be engaged upstream of the observed changes in the MEK/ERK and NFκB signaling pathways is an aim we are actively pursuing. In summary, the MEK/ERK pathway is a subject receiving a lot of attention at the basic science level as well as in the clinic. The identification of signaling pathways associated with its activity will undoubtedly shed light on its role in cancer and will hopefully lead to novel strategies that reverse its effects.

Here, we use maspin/ovalbumin chimeric proteins and the maspin reactive site loop (RSL) peptide to characterize the role of the RSL in maspin-mediated functions. Replacement of the RSL plus the C-terminal region or the RSL alone of maspin with that of ovalbumin resulted in the loss of the stimulatory effect on adhesion of corneal stromal cells to type I collagen, fibronectin, and laminin and of mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells to fibronectin. Maspin with ovalbumin as the C-terminal region retained activity, suggesting the maspin C-terminal polypeptide is not required. An R340Q mutant retained full maspin activity; however, an R340A mutant lost activity. This indicates the arginine side chain at the putative P1 site forms a hydrogen bond and not an ionic bond. The RSL peptide (P10–P5′, amino acids 330–345) alone induced cell-matrix adhesion of mammary carcinoma cells and corneal stromal cells and inhibited invasion of the carcinoma cells. Substitution of the RSL of ovalbumin with that of maspin converted inactive ovalbumin into a fully active molecule. Maspin bound specifically to the surface of the mammary carcinoma cells with a k d of 367 ± 67 nm and 32.0 ± 2.2 × 106 binding sites/cell. The maspin RSL peptide inhibited binding, suggesting the RSL is involved in maspin binding to cells. Sufficiency of the maspin RSL for activity suggests the mechanism by which maspin regulates cell-matrix adhesion and tumor cell invasion does not involve the serpin mechanism of protease inhibition.

Sufficiency of the maspin RSL for activity suggests the mechanism by which maspin regulates cell-matrix adhesion and tumor cell invasion does not involve the serpin mechanism of protease inhibition. Maspin is a 42-kDa protein synthesized by normal epithelial cells of a variety of mammalian organs such as mammary gland, prostate, skin, and cornea (1Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J.

Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of maspin has also been identified in the non-epithelioid cells of the corneal stroma, both in situ and in cell culture (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of maspin, however, is lost after the second passage of cultured stromal cells. These later passage cells mimic the wound-activated stromal fibroblasts, which are much more mobile than stromal cells in the normal corneas. Expression of maspin is also lost or down-regulated in many invasive carcinoma cells (3Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R.

Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both the later passage corneal stromal cells and the invasive carcinoma cells respond to exogenously added maspin (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Several biological activities of maspin have been characterized, which suggest a role for maspin as a tumor suppressor and an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Addition of recombinant maspin or transfection of the maspin gene into carcinoma cells inhibits cell migration and invasion in vitro and reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (3Zou Z.

Maspin also inhibits the in vitro migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and blocks basic fibroblast growth factor-induced neovascularization in the rat corneal pocket model (9Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To date, the underlying mechanisms of maspin action on inhibition of tumor invasion and angiogenesis are not well established. Nonetheless, maspin can regulate adhesion of cultured corneal stromal cells and carcinoma cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; aa, amino acid(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Masp/Masp-RSL/OV-C, maspin mutant containing the C-terminal domain of ovalbumin; Masp/OV-RSL/OV-C, maspin mutant containing the RSL and the C-terminal domain of ovalbumin; Masp/OV-RSL/Masp-C, maspin mutant containing only the RSL of ovalbumin; OV/Masp-RSL/OV-C, ovalbumin mutant containing the RSL of maspin; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PEDF, pigment epithelial-derived factor; rHIS/FLAG, recombinant histidine/FLAG tag; R340Q, maspin Arg to Glu P1 mutant; RSL, reactive site loop; RT, reverse transcriptase; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; SCCA, squamous cell carcinoma antigen; TBG, thyroxine binding globulin; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator.1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; aa, amino acid(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Masp/Masp-RSL/OV-C, maspin mutant containing the C-terminal domain of ovalbumin; Masp/OV-RSL/OV-C, maspin mutant containing the RSL and the C-terminal domain of ovalbumin; Masp/OV-RSL/Masp-C, maspin mutant containing only the RSL of ovalbumin; OV/Masp-RSL/OV-C, ovalbumin mutant containing the RSL of maspin; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PEDF, pigment epithelial-derived factor; rHIS/FLAG, recombinant histidine/FLAG tag; R340Q, maspin Arg to Glu P1 mutant; RSL, reactive site loop; RT, reverse transcriptase; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; SCCA, squamous cell carcinoma antigen; TBG, thyroxine binding globulin; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. molecules (2Ngamkitidechakul C.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment with recombinant maspin increases adhesion of cultured corneal stromal cells to several ECM molecules, including type I and type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it induces adhesion of carcinoma cells only to fibronectin and not to gelatin, laminin, type I, and type IV collagens or fibrinogen (10Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of cell-ECM adhesion by maspin likely involves a mechanism by which maspin up-regulates expression of integrins, because the level of α5 integrin (the α component of the fibronectin receptor) on the cell surface is induced in carcinoma cells pretreated with recombinant maspin (10Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Maspin shares sequence homology with the serpins (serine protease inhibitors) of the ovalbumin-type subfamily, which includes ovalbumin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), and bomapin (PI10) (11Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G.W. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Most serpins are inhibitors of specific proteases that react with an exposed reactive site loop (RSL) at the top of the molecule (see Fig. 1). Whether maspin is a protease inhibitor is still controversial. Early in vitro studies showed that maspin does not inhibit a number of representative proteases (12Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One recent study demonstrated maspin can inhibit prostate carcinoma cell surface-associated plasminogen activation by urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) (13Biliran Jr., H. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8676-8682PubMed Google Scholar), however, another study, using uPA bound to its receptor on tumor cells and tPA bound to vascular smooth muscle cells, fibrin or the prion protein, reported maspin does not inhibit either of these two plasminogen activators (14Bass R. Fernandex A.-M.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46845-46848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although an intact RSL of maspin is required for inhibition of migration and invasion of mammary gland and prostate carcinoma cells (8Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), nothing is known about which region of the maspin molecule is required for induction of increased cell-ECM adhesion. Preincubation with blocking antibodies to the RSL of maspin (8Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), deletion from the P7′ residue of the RSL to the C-terminal end (15Zhang M. Sheng S. Maass N. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 49-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cleavage of maspin at the putative P1 site Arg within the RSL (16Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) destroyed the ability of maspin to regulate the migration and invasion of carcinoma cells. We hypothesized that stimulation of cell-ECM adhesion by maspin also utilizes the RSL. We investigated the structure-function relationship of maspin using maspin/ovalbumin chimeras rather than using maspin deletion mutants as previously studied, due to a concern about proper folding of the mutant molecules. A tertiary structure model of maspin based on the crystal structure of ovalbumin (Protein Data Bank: 1OVA) suggests maspin adopts a common serpin structure in which the C-terminal region (Strands B4 and B5) lies inside the molecule (Fig. 1). Deletion of this region could disrupt the overall serpin conformation resulting in an inactive molecule, whereas swapping equivalent regions between maspin and a homologous serpin would potentially preserve the overall structure. Expression of yeast recombinant maspin/ovalbumin chimeras as secreted proteins increases the probability the proteins are properly folded. Ovalbumin was chosen for swapping domains with maspin, because the physical properties of both molecules are similar. Maspin and ovalbumin are similar in size and share about 30% amino acid sequence identity. Neither molecule undergoes a urea-induced unfolding transition from a stressed (S) form to a heat-stable relaxed (R) form (12Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Stein P.E. Tewkesbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hinge region (P8 to P12) of ovalbumin and maspin differs from that of inhibitory serpins in which a multiple alanine stretch is conserved (18Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J. Science. 1994; 265: 1893-1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, unlike maspin, ovalbumin does not induce cell-ECM adhesion (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the function of the RSL domain of maspin on cell-ECM adhesion and tumor invasion using a region swapping approach between maspin and ovalbumin to preserve the serpin structure. The studies reported here document that 1) the maspin RSL domain, but not the C-terminal region, is required, 2) the RSL peptide is sufficient for induction of increased cell-ECM adhesion of corneal stromal cells and carcinoma cells and inhibition of carcinoma cell invasion, 3) replacement of the RSL of ovalbumin with that of maspin can convert ovalbumin to a maspin-like molecule, and 4) the RSL can compete for specific binding of maspin to carcinoma cells.

The MDA-MB-231 human mammary carcinoma cells and immortalized corneal stromal cells do not synthesize maspin in contrast to normal mammary epithelial and corneal epithelial cells as determined by RT-PCR and Western blots using previously reported conditions for these assays (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Maspin/Ovalbumin Swap Mutants—The human maspin gene was previously obtained from human corneal epithelium by RT-PCR as described by Ngamkitidechakul et al. (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from the T lymphocyte cell line containing the ovalbumin gene was extracted using TRI reagent. The full-length ovalbumin gene was specifically amplified by RT-PCR using the ProSTAR™ Ultra HF RT-PCR system according to the manufacturer's procedure (Stratagene) in the Mastercycler® personal thermocycler (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). In the RT step, a specific ovalbumin antisense primer (Table I) was used to generate ovalbumin cDNA. PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed using two primers in which the EcoRI site was incorporated into the 5′-end of the sense primer and BglII into the 5′-end of the antisense primer. The annealing temperature for the PCR was 65 °C. The gel-purified 1.2-kb PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BglII, and ligated into the YEpHF expression vector (20Ngamkitidechakul C. Twining S.S. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing at the MCW Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility confirmed the nucleotide sequences of both human maspin and chicken ovalbumin cDNA. Three ovalbumin (OV)/maspin-RSL swap mutants and one chimeric maspin/OV-RSL swap mutant were constructed by the overlap extension PCR method of Ho et al. (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar) using the primers listed in Table I. For each mutant construction, two sets of primers were utilized to amplify two separate overlapping PCR products that contain the mutation (or insertion) together with either upstream or downstream sequences. These PCR products were amplified using PfuTurbo® Hotstart DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions using the optimal annealing temperature at 60 °C. Two PCR fragments were joined together through overlapping sequences and PCR using primers from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the appropriate gene. An annealing temperature of 55 °C was used. The full-length PCR products were cut with EcoRI and BglII and cloned directly into the yeast expression vector YEpHF. The MCW Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility confirmed the reading frame and sequences of all mutants.Table IPrimers for construction of recombinant maspin and recombinant maspin mutantsTypeNameSequenceWild-typeaRestriction sites EcoRI or BglII (italic letters) at 5′ overhang of sense or antisense, respectively, of both ovalbumin and maspin (bold letters).EcoRI-Maspin-N (sense)5′-GTCGAATTCATGGATGCCCTGCAACTAG-3′Bgl II-Maspin (antisense)5′-GGCAGATCT TTAAGGAGAACAGAATTTG-3′EcoRI-OV (sense)5′-TAGAATTC ATGGGCTCCATCGGTGCA-3′Bgl II-OV (antisense)5′-GCAGATCTTTAAGGGGAAACACATCT-3′Maspin mutants bSequences in bold letters complementary to ovalbumin or maspin (bold letters) with 5′ overhang containing ovalbumin or maspin sequences (nonbold) for overlap PCR extension.OV-RSL/Masp-C (sense)5′-GCAAGCGTCTCTGATGAATTGAATGCTGACC-3′OV-RSL/Masp-C (antisense)5′-GGTCAGCATTCAATTCATCAGAGACGCTTGC-3′Masp/OV-RSL (sense)5′-GAAATAACTGAAGATGGTAGAGAGGTGGTAGGGTCA-3′Masp/OV-RSL (antisense)5′-GACCCTACCACCTCTCTACCATCTTCAGTTATTTC-3′Ovalbumin mutants bSequences in bold letters complementary to ovalbumin or maspin (bold letters) with 5′ overhang containing ovalbumin or maspin sequences (nonbold) for overlap PCR extension.OV/Masp-RSL (sense)5′-AATGAAGCAGGCGGGGATTCCATAGAGGTG-3′OV/Masp-RSL (antisense)5′-TATGGAATCCCCGCCTGCTTCATTGATTTC-3′Masp-RSL/OV-C (sense)5′-CTGCAGCACAAGGAAGAATTTAGGGCTGAC-3′Masp-RSL/OV-C (antisense)5′-CCTAAATTCTTCCTTGTGCTGCAGGATCCGTG-3′Maspin RQ mutant cSite-directed mutation (bold and underlined letters).Maspin RQ (sense)5′-GTGCCAGGAGCACAGATCCTGCAGCAC-3′Maspin RQ (antisense)5′-GTGCTGCAGGATCTGTGCTCCTGGCAC-3′Maspin RA mutant cSite-directed mutation (bold and underlined letters).Maspin RA (sense)5′-GTGCCAGGAGCAGCG ATCCTGCAGCAC-3′Maspin RA (antisense)5′-GTGCTGCAGGATCGC TGCTCCTGGCAC-3′a Restriction sites EcoRI or BglII (italic letters) at 5′ overhang of sense or antisense, respectively, of both ovalbumin and maspin (bold letters).b Sequences in bold letters complementary to ovalbumin or maspin (bold letters) with 5′ overhang containing ovalbumin or maspin sequences (nonbold) for overlap PCR extension.c Site-directed mutation (bold and underlined letters). Open table in a new tab To construct a site-specific P1 R to Q and R to A maspin mutants, the YEpHF-Maspin template vector was directly amplified by the method of Weiner et al. (22Weimer M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) using two primers containing the mutation sequences (Table I) and PfuTurbo® Hotstart DNA polymerase. After 18 cycles of PCR amplification (55 °C annealing), the PCR reaction was treated with DpnI (1 unit) at 37 °Cfor1hto remove the parental template. The purified PCR products were transformed into JM 109 E. coli cells. A colony containing the plasmid with the desired mutation was chosen, and the mutated sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Expression and Purification of Yeast Recombinant HIS/FLAG-tagged Proteins—All recombinant proteins were produced as N-terminal HIS/FLAG tag fusion proteins in a yeast system. The yeast expression vector YEpHF was modified from the original vector YEp-FLAG-1 by adding a six-histidine tag upstream of the FLAG peptide tag (20Ngamkitidechakul C. Twining S.S. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of an α-factor leader peptide sequence, the recombinant proteins were expressed and secreted outside the S. cerevisiae yeast BJ3505 into the buffered expression medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 1% glucose, and 100 mm K2HPO4, pH 6.4). After growing at 30 °C for 72 h, 1 liter of the culture medium was collected and concentrated to 200 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon) under nitrogen gas at 60 p.s.i. The concentrate was pH-adjusted to 8.0. The yeast rHIS/FLAG-tagged protein was purified by mixing the concentrated yeast conditioned medium with 10 ml of Ni-NTA™-agarose resin overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. Subsequently, the recombinant protein was eluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was concentrated using an Ultrafree spin concentrator (Millipore), and dialyzed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, to remove the imidazole. Identical results were obtained in the presence and absence of the N-terminal His tag and the FLAG sequence for the maspin functions measured here. Arginine-specific Proteolysis of Recombinant Maspin and the R340Q and R340A Mutants—Endoproteinase-Arg-C (clostripain) was incubated with the yeast recombinant wild-type maspin the R340Q and R340A mutants to confirm the mutagenesis. The enzyme was preactivated at room temperature for 2 h in 1 mm calcium acetate containing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. The recombinant proteins (50 μg) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.2 mm calcium acetate, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol were incubated with the enzyme (50:1 molar ratio) at 37 °C. At various time points, aliquots were removed and E-64 (10 μm) was added to stop the enzymatic reaction. For zero time points, 5 μg of the proteins was mixed with E-64 at 10 μm final concentration and then the enzyme was added. SDS sample buffer was added to the reaction samples and then boiled. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. After 2 min of incubation with the protease, the wild-type maspin was cleaved with the appearance of a band corresponding to the size expected for a cleavage at Arg-340, however, the maspin R340Q and R340A mutants were not cleaved over the first 60 min (data not shown). However, with time additional identical smaller products were noted in all samples. Cell-ECM Adhesion Assay—MDA-MB-231 cells or corneal stromal cells were incubated with serum-free medium containing either 0.5 μm (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 1.0 μm (corneal stromal cells) of maspin, the maspin/ovalbumin chimeras or the RSL peptide for 18 h prior to cell adhesion assay performed according to the protocol previously used by us and others (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar, 10Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). The maspin RSL peptide was used at 1 μm final concentration in both cell types. The adhesion assay was performed using CytoMatrix adhesion strips as previously described (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after preincubation with maspin, the cells were harvested using 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Both cell types were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1× MITO+. The MDA-MB-231 cells and the corneal stromal cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C on fibronectin-coated wells for the carcinoma cells and on type I collagen-, fibronectin-, or laminin-coated wells for the corneal stromal cells. Fibronectin was used for the MDA-MB-231 cells, because maspin stimulates adhesion only to this ECM molecule (10Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen type I was used for the corneal stromal cell studies, because it is the major extracellular molecule present in the corneal stroma (2Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin and laminin, ECM molecules found at lower amounts, also were used for selected experiments. Following washing with PBS, the adherent cells were stained with crystal violet and quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The experiments were repeated four or five times with three to five replicates per experiment. In Vitro Tumor Cell Invasion Assay—The invasion assay was performed using the standard Matrigel method of Sternlicht et al. (23Sternlicht M.D. Kedeshian P. Shao Z.M. Safarians S. Barsky S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1949-1958PubMed Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, polycarbonate (8-μm) Transwell inserts were precoated with 2 mg/ml Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 104) were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.5 μm rHIS/FLAG maspin, ovalbumin, the maspin/ovalbumin chimeras, the R340Q and R340A maspin mutants or the RSL peptide in Leibovitz's l-15 medium containing 1% FBS, 1× MITO+, and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified incubator without CO2, the cells in the bottom well were labeled with the fluorogenic vital dye calcein AM (5 μm final concentration). Fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor™ fluorescence microplate reader (Millipore) with excitation of 480-nm and emission of 530-nm filters. Cells in duplicate"

Efficient switches have been measured in vitro on hairpin-containing RNA templates by a two-step mechanism. Pausing of the reverse transcriptase (RT) at the hairpin base allowed enhanced cleavage of the initial donor RNA template, exposing regions of the cDNA and allowing the acceptor to base pair with the cDNA. This defines the first or docking step. The primer continued synthesis on the donor, transferring or locking in a second step. Here we determine the enzyme-dependent factors that influence template switching by comparing the RTs from human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). HIV-1 RT promoted transfers with higher efficiency than EIAV RT. We found that both RTs paused strongly at the base of the hairpin. While stalled, HIV-1 RT made closely spaced cuts, whereas EIAV RT made only a single cut. Docking occurred efficiently at the multiply cut but not at the singly cut site. HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) protein stimulated strand transfers. It improved RNase H activity of both RTs. It allowed the EIAV RT to make a distribution of cuts, greatly stimulating docking at the base of the hairpin. Most likely, it also promoted strand exchange, allowing transfers to be initiated from sites throughout the hairpin. Minor pause sites beyond the base of the hairpin correlated with the locking sites. The strand exchange properties of NC likely promote this step. We present a model that explains the roles of RNase H specificity, template structure, and properties of NC in the two-step transfer reaction.

For a simple retrovirus such as spleen necrosis virus, recombination happens once every three replication cycles (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It allows viruses to repair genomic errors (8Schwartzberg P. Colicelli J. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Colicelli J. Goff S.P.

Synthesis of the integration-competent double-stranded viral DNA involves two obligatory strand transfers from the ends of the genome (17Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to these end transfers, template switching can also occur within internal sequences of the genome (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Strand transfer or template switching results when a primer being extended on one copy of the template (donor) is transferred to a homologous site on a second copy of the template (acceptor). Although it has been proposed to occur during plus (31Skalka A.M. Boone L. Junghans R. Luk D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 19: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and minus strand synthesis (32Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), most template switching occurs during RNA-templated synthesis (7Yu H. Jetzt A.E. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol.

As a result, most mechanistic studies have focused on recombination from RNA templates. Intra-molecular transfers within the same molecule lead to deletions (17Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Pathak V.K. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6024-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Hu W.S. Bowman E.H. Delviks K.A. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because retroviruses package two complete copies of their RNA genome, template switching can also take place inter-molecularly. When two nonidentical (heterogeneous) genomes are co-packaged, such inter-molecular transfers lead to recombinant progeny (4Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).Pausing of RT during synthesis was found to correlate with the locations of template switching (36DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G.

Because RT has DNA polymerase and RNase H activities within the same molecule (39Baltimore D. Nature. 1970; 226: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 40Temin H.M. Mizutani S. Nature. 1970; 226: 1211-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), it was suggested that pausing would temporarily inhibit nucleotide addition, but it would not affect the nuclease function. This would result in degradation of the RNA donor template in the region of pausing and subsequent exposure of the cDNA. Base pairing between a homologous acceptor molecule and the cDNA would then result in a transfer event (36DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wu T.

In support of this model, RNase H activity has been found to be necessary for strand transfers. Reducing or deleting the RNase H activity of RT leads to a significant reduction in its ability to switch between RNA templates in vitro (37DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, kissing interactions promoted between the TAR loop sequences of the cDNA intermediate and acceptor RNA are proposed to facilitate the minus strand transfer (47Berkhout B. Vastenhouw N.L.

Pausing increased RNase H activity at the base of the hairpin, allowing the acceptor to “dock” to the cDNA. This initial step was followed by continued synthesis through the structure of the hairpin on the donor. The transfer event is not finished or “locked” until the cDNA primer terminus had annealed to the acceptor beyond the pause site. These results presented clear evidence for a previously suggested two-step transfer mechanism (27Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Hwang C.K. Pathak V.K. J.

More recently, transfers taking place in the 5′ end of the HIV-1 genome have also been shown to take place through such a “dock and lock” process (55Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

NC is packaged within the virion, is processed from the Gag precursor poly-protein, and it has RNA chaperone activity, as well as a modulating activity on RT (60Darlix J.L.

We have done so by carrying out assays with the RTs from human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV-1), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) on hairpin containing RNA substrates. EIAV and HIV-1 belong to the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses. Both replicate in cells of the immune system and have high mutation rates (72Montelaro R. Ball J.M. Rushlow K. Levy J.A. Viruses.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 88-89Google Scholar). The RTs share 40% of amino acid homology, are heterodimers of a catalytically active p66 subunit and an inactive p51 subunit, and appear to be structurally similar (74Stephens R.M. Casey J.W.

The present study demonstrates that despite such similarities in their overall properties, HIV-1 RT was more efficient in carrying out strand transfers from hairpin structures than EIAV RT. An important contributor to this were differences in the RNase H cleavages carried out when the RTs are paused at the base of the hairpin. We have found that although both RTs paused at the base of the hairpin, HIV-1 RT degraded the template into smaller fragments that could easily dissociate from the cDNA and could therefore allow more efficient docking. HIV-1 NC, but not EIAV NC, caused a robust increase in transfers with both RTs. We believe this enhancement to be a result of HIV-1 NC's enhancement of RNase H activity, and by making previously inaccessible regions of the acceptor more amenable to the invasion or docking step.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsExpression plasmids, pKK-p66(6his) and pKK-p51(6his) (81Lee R.

DH5α-competent cells, XbaI, and EcoRI were from Invitrogen. Radiolabeled compounds were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Micro Bio-Spin columns were from Bio-Rad. Plasmid purification kits were from Qiagen. All DNA primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. All other products were purchased from Roche Applied Science.MethodsHIV-1 RT Purification—Overexpression and purification of the RT heterodimer was done as described previously (83Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Briefly, JM109 cells harboring the expression plasmids were grown in 2× YT media containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cell pellets of the p66 and p51 clones were mixed together at the appropriate ratio (84Le Grice S.F. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O.

The supernatant was diluted to achieve 0.5 m NaCl, treated with streptomycin sulfate at a final concentration of 4%, and centrifuged again at 28,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel affinity column (Amersham Biosciences), and the heterodimer was purified as described earlier (83Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Eluted factions containing equal amounts of p66 and p51, as judged from SDS-PAGE, were pooled together and dialyzed. Purified protein was more than 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained gels and was stored at –20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad assay.Generation of EIAV-derived Donor and Acceptor Templates—The donor construct pEIAV-Donor and the acceptor construct pEIAV-A2 have been described previously (54Roda R.H.

RNA templates were generated by run-off transcription in vitro from linearized plasmids using T7 RNA polymerase, as per the manufacturer's protocol. The pEIAV-Donor was linearized with NotI to generate DI donor templates, and pEIAV-A2 was linearized with HindIII and HaeIII to generate the AI-2 and AS acceptor templates, respectively. RNA substrates were gel-purified and tested for integrity.Labeling and Annealing of Substrates—DNA primers or RNA templates (RNA templates first calf intestine phosphatase-treated) were labeled at the 5′ end as described previously (54Roda R.H.

For annealing, donor RNA and DNA primer at a ratio of 1:2 were heated for 2 min at 95 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA.RT Assays—Donor DI was primed for reverse transcription with the DNA oligonucleotide SP6 (5′-TACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′). Donor extension and strand transfer assays were carried out in a final volume of 12 μl. Two units of HIV-1 or EIAV reverse transcriptase (50 ng) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 25:50 fmol (donor/primer) of hybridized substrate. For reactions with NC, the protein was added to the reactions prior to the addition of RT and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. By assuming that each NC molecule would cover 7 nucleotides of RNA, the amount of NC required for 200% coating was determined based on the length and amount of the primers and RNA templates in the reaction. Reactions were started with the addition of dNTPs and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 50 μm and 6 mm, respectively, incubated at 37 °C, and stopped at the appropriate time by adding 1 volume of termination buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). Strand transfer reactions were carried out under the same conditions as extension assays, except that acceptor was included in the annealing reactions. For blocking oligonucleotide (EIAV-3, 5′-CAGACCATACCTGAAGCTTAC-P-3′) experiments the oligomer was added"
https://openalex.org/W2071306432,"Transglutaminase (TG)-catalyzed cross-linking of both intracellular and extracellular proteins is an important biochemical event. However, increased concentrations of cross-linked proteins have been observed in many disorders. Moreover, TG-catalyzed modification of proteins might generate new self-antigens responsible for the autoimmune response, as in celiac disease. The identification of available substrates may offer an understanding of how the TG-catalyzed post-translational modification has an impact on physiology and disease. We used a proteomic approach to identify TG-modified protein targets in human intestinal epithelial cells to determine the extent to which transglutaminase specifically contributes to celiac disease. Two probes were used for endogenous TG activity: 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine, which represents the acyl-acceptor, and a biotinylated glutamine-containing peptide, which represents the acyl-donor. This approach identified >25 proteins, which range from 30,000 to 300,000 Daltons and can serve as acyl-acceptor and/or acyl-donor for transglutaminase. Some of them were known transglutaminase substrates, whereas others had not been previously identified. These targets include proteins involved in cytoskeletal network organization, folding of proteins, transport processes, and miscellaneous metabolic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2072348189,"The interactions of platelets with fibrinogen mediate a variety of responses including adhesion, platelet aggregation, and fibrin clot retraction. Whereas it was assumed that interactions of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 with the AGDV sequence in the γC-domain of fibrinogen and/or RGD sites in the Aα chains are involved in clot retraction and adhesion, recent data demonstrated that fibrinogen lacking these sites still supported clot retraction. These findings suggested that an unknown site in fibrinogen and/or other integrins participate in clot retraction. Here we have identified a sequence within γC that mediates binding of fibrinogen to platelets. Synthetic peptide duplicating the 365–383 sequence in γC, designated P3, efficiently inhibited clot retraction in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, P3 supported platelet adhesion and was an effective inhibitor of platelet adhesion to fibrinogen fragments. Analysis of overlapping peptides spanning P3 and mutant recombinant γC-domains demonstrated that the P3 activity is contained primarily within γ370–383. Integrins αIIbβ3 and α5β1 were implicated in recognition of P3, since platelet adhesion to the peptide was blocked by function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against these receptors. Direct evidence that αIIbβ3 and α5β1 bind P3 was obtained by selective capture of these integrins from platelet lysates using a P3 affinity matrix. Thus, these data suggest that the P3 sequence in the γC-domain of fibrinogen defines a previously unknown recognition specificity of αIIbβ3 and α5β1 and may function as a binding site for these integrins.

The process of thrombus formation upon vascular injury is a complex series of events that involves platelets and plasma proteins, including fibrinogen (Fg). 1The abbreviations used are: Fg, human fibrinogen; γC, globular COOH-terminal domain of the γ-chain of Fg; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin. Adhesive reactions of platelets with Fg are required for platelet aggregation, which triggers subsequent formation of a blood clot composed of insoluble fibrin and captured platelets. The interactions of platelets with fibrin within platelet-rich thrombi result in clot retraction, which is visually manifested in a dramatic reduction in fibrin gel volume. The mechanism and physiological significance of platelet-mediated fibrin clot retraction remain poorly understood, but it has been suggested that contraction of fibrin clots may be required for clearance of the thrombus and also may facilitate wound healing. The primary interactions of platelets with Fg and fibrin are mediated by the platelet-specific receptor αIIbβ3 (glycoprotein IIbIIIa), a member of the integrin family of receptors. αIIbβ3 is the most abundant integrin on the platelet surface and is expressed at ∼80,000 copies/cell (1Peerschke E.I.B. Lopez J.A. Loscalzo J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 229-260Google Scholar). Numerous studies using synthetic peptides and function-blocking antibodies have demonstrated that three sites in Fg can potentially interact with αIIbβ3 upon platelet adhesion and aggregation (1Peerschke E.I.B. Lopez J.A. Loscalzo J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 229-260Google Scholar). Because Fg consists of two identical disulfide-bonded subunits, each of which is formed by three polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ, and γ), two copies of αIIbβ3-binding sites may reside in each subunit. They are the RGDX sequences at 95–97 and 572–575 in the Aα-chains and AGDV in the carboxyl-terminal ends of the γ-chains, γ408–411. The RGDF sequence at Aα 95–97 is cryptic and, therefore, apparently not involved in the initial binding of soluble Fg to platelets (2Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21080-21087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct observation of the complex between Fg and purified αIIbβ3 by electron microscopy indicated that two globular γC-domains that are formed by the carboxyl-terminal parts of the γ-chains of Fg and that contain AGDV are the primary sites for interactions with the receptor (3Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion has also been supported by experiments with recombinant Fg in which mutation of AGDV in γC resulted in the loss of platelet aggregation, whereas mutations of both RGD sites in the Aα chain had no effect (4Farrell D.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several previous reports have demonstrated that αIIbβ3 plays an important role in platelet-mediated clot retraction. Platelets isolated from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder in which αIIbβ3 is dysfunctional or absent, were defective in clot retraction (6Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 82: 468-480Google Scholar). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies directed against αIIbβ3 and Fg recognition peptides, which inhibit Fg binding to platelets and platelet aggregation, blocked clot retraction (7Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. J. Biol.

Rosa J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6703-6710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to platelet aggregation, the AGDV sequence in the γC-domain is not absolutely required for clot retraction. Recombinant human Fg, which lacks AGDV sequences, did not support platelet aggregation but still supported normal clot retraction that was indistinguishable from retraction mediated by normal recombinant or plasma Fg (11Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, mice in which the γ-chain gene was targeted to eliminate the C terminus of the γ-chain of Fg manifested bleeding associated with impaired platelet aggregation, but clot retraction was normal (12Holmback K. Danton M.J. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the sites in Fg that are required for platelet aggregation differ from the sites that are required for clot retraction. Therefore, it was proposed that RGD sites in the Aα-chains can mediate clot retraction (13Rooney M.M. Farrell D.H. Van Hemel B.M. de Groot P.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1998; 92: 2374-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when this hypothesis was tested directly, using recombinant Fg in which RGDs were mutated, this mutant Fg exhibited normal clot retraction (13Rooney M.M. Farrell D.H. Van Hemel B.M. de Groot P.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1998; 92: 2374-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that when two RGD sites and AGDV in the γC-domain were all mutated, only the rate of clot retraction mediated by Fg containing a triple mutation was delayed, whereas the final extent of clot retraction was similar to that produced by wild-type recombinant Fg (13Rooney M.M. Farrell D.H. Van Hemel B.M. de Groot P.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1998; 92: 2374-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggested that clot retraction is a two-step process, such that AGDV sites in the γC-domains are important for initial binding to αIIbβ3 and may be involved in the initial step of clot retraction. The second step, the development of clot tension, does not depend exclusively on either AGDV or RGD sites. Thus, such a model suggests involvement of a novel binding site in Fg that is engaged by αIIbβ3 and/or other integrin(s) in the second step of clot remodeling. In this study, we have sought to localize the binding site in Fg that participates in platelet-mediated clot retraction. Guided by a lead that mAb 2G5 inhibited clot retraction, we have identified a novel recognition sequence in the γC-domain of Fg, γ370–383, and demonstrated that two platelet integrins, αIIbβ3 and α5β1, bind this sequence during clot retraction and platelet adhesion. Proteins, Peptides, and Monoclonal Antibodies—Human Fg was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The D100 (M r 100,000) and D98 (M r 100,000) fragments of Fg were prepared by digestion of Fg with plasmin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and purified as described previously (14Ugarova T.P.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12942-12951Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fg was labeled with 125Ibythe Chloramine T procedure. Thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. The peptide duplicating the Fg sequence γ365–383, NGIIWATWKTRWYSMKKTT, a series of overlapping peptides spanning this sequence, and a scrambled γ370–383 peptide (P3′-scr) (Table I) were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a preparative C18 Vydac column using a 5–90% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Authenticity and purity of the peptides were verified by mass spectroscopy. In addition, the Fg peptide γ400–411 (H12) was synthesized. Peptides duplicating γ340–357, γ351–370, and γ383–395 of Fg (designated H19, H20, and P2-C, respectively) and the IIICS-1 peptide of fibronectin were previously described (16Ugarova T.P.

Open table in a new tab The following antibodies directed to different integrin subunits were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA): anti-β1 mAb 1965 (clone JB1A), anti-β1 mAb 1957z (clone 25E11), anti-α5β1 mAb 1969 (clone JBS5), anti-α5 mAb 1956z (clone P1D6), anti-αv mAb 2021z (clone AV1), anti-αvβ3 mAb 1976z (LM609), anti-α2β1 mAb 1998 (clone BHA2.1), and polyclonal antibody to integrin α5, 1928, directed against the cytoplasmic tail. mAb CD41 against αIIbβ3 was purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France). mAb GTI-N4P (clone AP3) against αIIbβ3 was from GTI (Brookfield, WI). Chimeric Fab 7E3 (abciximAb), which recognizes integrins αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, was a generous gift from Dr. B. Coller (Rockefeller University). mAbs 4F10 and 2G12 directed against αIIbβ3 were from Dr. V. Woods (University of California, San Diego). mAb 1413 (clone R7.1), which recognizes the αL subunit of leukocyte integrin αLβ2, mAb w6/32 directed against major histocompatibility complex class I, and purified IgG were used as controls. The anti-Fg mAbs were mAb 2G5, mAb 3G11, mAb 2F10, mAb 4-2, and mAb 4A5. mAb 2G5 was raised using human fragment DD and recognizes the Fg γ373–385 sequence (18Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16193-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs 3G11 and 2F10 cross-compete with mAb 2G5, suggesting that they recognize the epitopes within γCin the vicinity of γ365–383 (19Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). mAb 4–2 recognizes the Fg sequence γ390–402 (20Moskowitz K.A. Kudryk B. Coller B.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). mAb 4A5 recognizes the C terminus of γC, γ406–411 (21Matsueda G.R. Bernatowicz M.S. Mosesson M.W. Amrani D. Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio P. Fibrinogen 3: Biochemistry, Biological Functions, Gene Regulation, and Expression. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 133-136Google Scholar), and was a gift from Dr. G. Matsueda (Bristol-Meyers Squibb). Cells—Platelets were collected from aspirin-free human blood, anti-coagulated with acid/citrate/dextrose, and isolated by differential centrifugation followed by gel filtration on Sepharose 2B-CL. CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 (22(1998) J. Biol. Chem., 273, 35039–35047Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. J. Fox (Cleveland Clinic). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 mm HEPES. Surface expression levels of αIIbβ3 and α5β1 on αIIbβ3-expressing and wild-type CHO cells were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using integrin subunit-specific mAbs. The cells were stained with mAbs and with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). The level of α5β1 in wild-type and αIIbβ3-transfectants was similar, and the level in αIIbβ3-transfectants was ∼8-fold lower than that of αIIbβ3 as assessed from the ratio of mean fluorescence intensities. Expression of Recombinant γC-domains and Mutagenesis—The recombinant γC-domains were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase as described previously. The coding region for the wild-type γC-domain (residues Ile145–Val411) was amplified using as template plasmids p674 (23Bolyard M.G. Lord S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) consisting of full-length cDNA encoding the human Fg γ-chain that was provided by Dr. S. Lord (University of North Carolina). The primers used for the γC-domain were 5′-GGAACCTTGCAAAGACACGGGATCCATCCATGATATC-3′ (forward), 5′-CTCTTTTGAAACGGATCCTTAAACGTCTCC-3′ (reverse). The underlined region is the BamHI recognition sequence that was introduced in primers for the γC cloning. The fragments were digested and cloned in the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The accuracy of the DNA sequence was verified by sequencing. The plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli strain BL-21(DE3)pLysS, and expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h at 30 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified from soluble fractions of E. coli lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose. The analyses of purified γC proteins by SDS-PAGE showed a major band migrating as expected (60 kDa) and a minor band (5–10% of the level of the major bands in different preparations) of ∼30 kDa. The intactness of the COOH-terminal end of the γC-domain was confirmed by Western blot analysis using mAb 4A5 directed against γ406–411. A series of mutants with truncations in the C-terminal part of γC were produced using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Fibrin Clot Retraction Assays—Whole blood was collected with informed consent from healthy volunteers and anticoagulated by adding acid/citrate/dextrose in the presence of 2.8 μm prostaglandin E1. Platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation followed by gel filtration on Sepharose 2B in divalent cation-free Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% BSA and were resuspended in isotonic HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4), containing 35 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml glucose. The reaction mixture (total volume 1.0 ml) consisted of 3 × 108 platelets, 0.25 mg/ml Fg, 1 mm CaCl2 in glass tubes coated with Sigmacote (Sigma). Clot retraction was initiated by adding 1 unit of thrombin at 22 °C. Fibrin clot retraction triggered by activated platelets was monitored by taking photographs of clots at several time intervals using a digital camera. The images were analyzed, and the areas occupied by clots were calculated using Scion Image software. Clot retraction was expressed as a percentage of retraction defined as [1 - (area t/area t 0)] × 100, where area t 0 is the cross-sectional area occupied by fibrin clot in the absence of platelets and area t is the area occupied by the retracted clot. Thus, 0% is defined as no retraction, and 100% would be hypothetical full retraction. Maximal retraction attained in these experiments is typically ∼80–90% after ∼2 h. To characterize the process of clot retraction in the presence of inhibitors (mAbs and peptides) and to compare their potency, several parameters were derived from the kinetic curves of retraction. They are the lag phase, V max, and IC50. The lag phase is defined as the time from the onset of the process until the first visible changes in clot morphology. It was determined from the interception of the steepest part of the kinetic curve with the abscissa, which reflects the time spanned after adding thrombin. The maximal slope of the curve reflects the rate (V max) of retraction at a given concentration of the inhibitor and was measured as percentage of retraction/min. The value of IC50 is defined as the concentration of the inhibitor that produces 50% of maximal inhibition. Effect of Fg Peptides on Platelet Function, on Binding of Fg to Platelets, and on Fibrin Polymerization—To assess the effect of Fg peptides on platelet function, secretion of ATP by thrombin-activated platelets was measured using a Lumi-aggregometer (Chromo-Log Corp., Havertown, PA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, to 0.45 ml of platelet-rich plasma, 50 μl of CHRONO-LUME reagent containing luciferin-luciferase was added, and the mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Different concentrations (0–150 μm) of the Fg peptides were added, and aggregation was initiated by the addition of 2 units/ml thrombin. A change in luminescence that indicates the amount of ATP released was measured in the absence or presence of peptides. 125I-Fg binding to platelets was measured with the ligand at 0.3 μm as described (24Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet-bound Fg was separated from the free ligand by centrifugation of 50-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture through 20% sucrose, and the number of Fg molecules bound was calculated based on specific activity. The effect of peptides on fibrin polymerization was assessed in fibrin polymerization assays using fibrin monomer as described (14Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13687-13693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrin monomer was prepared by clotting of Fg with thrombin and dissolving the fibrin clot in 0.02 m acetic acid at 4 °C. Adhesion Assays—The wells of 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with different concentrations of proteins or peptides for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. The coated wells were postcoated with 1% BSA inactivated at 75 °C for platelet adhesion assays or 1% polyvinyl alcohol for CHO cell assays. Platelets were labeled with 10 μm Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in isotonic HEPES buffer, and resuspended at 1 × 108/ml in the same buffer supplemented with 1% BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2. Calcein-labeled wild-type and the αIIbβ3-expressing CHO cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Aliquots (100 μl) of cells were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 50 and 30 min for platelets and CHO cells, respectively. The nonadherent cells were removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The number of adherent cells was determined using the fluorescence of aliquots with a known number of labeled cells. In inhibition experiments, platelets were mixed with different concentrations of peptides or mAbs for 20 min at 22 °C before they were added to the wells coated with adhesive substrates. Affinity Chromatography of Platelet Lysates—To identify the integrins that bind to γ365–383, the P3 peptide was coupled to ECH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Platelet lysates were prepared from outdated platelets by lysing cells in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 2% Triton X-100 reduced, pH 7.4, and applied onto the affinity matrix. The columns were washed first with buffer A (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, containing 0.2% Triton X-100 reduced, pH 7.4), and bound material was eluted with buffer A containing 2 mg/ml P3. Proteins strongly bound to the affinity matrix were eluted with Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 4 m urea. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels under nonreducing conditions followed by Western blotting using anti-integrin subunit specific and anti-Fg mAbs. Proteins in the gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and the membranes were incubated with mAbs against αIIb (CD41, 3 μg/ml), β3 (AP3, 0.5 μg/ml), and β1 (1965, 1 μg/ml) and polyclonal anti-α5 antibody (1928) at 1:5000 dilution and anti-Fg mAb 4-2 (5 μg/ml). Bound antibodies were detected by reaction with a peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by the addition of SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The integrin subunits were identified on the basis of positive staining and characteristic molecular weight. Inhibition of Platelet-mediated Fibrin Clot Retraction by mAb 2G5—Previous studies have demonstrated that mAb 2G5 inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation (18Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16193-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mAb recognizes the Fg sequence γ365–383 in the γC-domain and, thus, does not appear to compete with AGDV at γ408–411, the binding site for platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (18Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16193-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, previous data have indicated that mAb 2G5 had no effect on binding of radiolabeled Fg to stimulated platelets (18Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16193-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have further examined whether mAb 2G5 affects platelet-mediated fibrin clot retraction. The mAb inhibited clot retraction in a dose-dependent manner; 50% inhibition was attained at ∼15 μg/ml mAb, and 50 μg/ml produced complete inhibition. The potency of mAb 2G5 was similar to that of Fab 7E3, which binds platelet integrins αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 and inhibits clot retraction (10Osdoit S. Rosa J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6703-6710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Cohen I. Burk D. White J.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Smith R.A.

In addition, the effect of mAb 2G5 was similar to that of mAb 4A5 (IC50 ∼10 μg/ml) directed against the binding site for αIIbβ3 at γ408–411 (21Matsueda G.R. Bernatowicz M.S. Mosesson M.W. Amrani D. Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio P. Fibrinogen 3: Biochemistry, Biological Functions, Gene Regulation, and Expression. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 133-136Google Scholar), which inhibits platelet adhesion (27Gartner T.K. Amrani D.L. Derrick J.M. Kirschbaum N.E. Matsueda G.R. Taylor D.B. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 47-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and clot retraction (26Smith R.A. Mosesson M.W. Rooney M.M. Lord S.T. Daniels A.U. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22080-22085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two other anti-Fg mAbs, 3G11 and 2F10, which have specificity overlapping with that of mAb 2G5 (19Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) also efficiently blocked clot retraction. Effect of γ365–383 on Clot Retraction—Based on the recognition specificity of mAb 2G5, we hypothesized that a peptide duplicating its epitope might block clot retraction. Accordingly, we synthesized a peptide, corresponding to γ365–383 (designated P3), and tested its ability to inhibit clot retraction. Fig. 1A shows that P3 was a strong inhibitor of retraction. Increasing concentrations of peptide progressively blocked retraction; at 300 μg/ml, the process was inhibited completely, and fibrin clots did not retract after 24 h. The effect of P3 on clot retraction was characterized in detail by using a sensitive assay in which temperature was decreased to 22 °C, which retarded the process of retraction and allowed accurate quantification of several kinetic parameters, including the lag phase, V max, and IC50 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1B shows the rate of clot retraction in the presence of different concentrations of P3. The lag phase, V max, and IC50 values were calculated from the progress curves of retractions (Table I). The IC50 value, defined as the concentration of peptide that produced 50% of maximal clot retraction after 2–3 h, was 51 ± 7 μm (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the P3 effect was verified by testing several control peptides. Fg peptides corresponding to sequences flanking P3 (γ365–383), H19 (γ340–357), and P2-C (γ383–395) and the peptide duplicating the IIICS-1 sequence in fibronectin did not inhibit clot retraction. In addition, a scrambled P3′ peptide was completely inactive. As other essential controls, 1) the P3 peptide did not inhibit fibrin polymerization and did not change the fibrin clot morphology in the absence of platelets; 2) platelet function was not affected by P3, as tested by the ATP release reaction; and 3) P3 did not inhibit the binding of soluble Fg to activated platelets, as determined by using 125I-Fg. The last finding is consistent with the previous data indicating that mAb 2G5 did not inhibit Fg binding to stimulated platelets (18Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16193-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the active determinants within P3, several overlapping peptides spanning P3 and its flanking regions were synthesized (Table I) and tested for their ability to inhibit clot retraction. Kinetic parameters derived from progression curves of clot retraction in the presence of different peptides allowed the comparison of peptide potencies. Shown in Table I are the concentrations of each peptide that produced 50% inhibition of the lag phase and V max of clot retraction. Peptides derived from the NH2-terminal and central parts of P3 were the most active inhibitors. In fact, γ365–377 was more active than the parental P3. The reason for the enha"
https://openalex.org/W1987169321,"We previously suggested that proteins gain more stability from the burial and hydrogen bonding of polar groups than from the burial of nonpolar groups (Pace, C. N. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 310–313). To study this further, we prepared eight Thr-to-Val mutants of RNase Sa, four in which the Thr side chain is hydrogen-bonded and four in which it is not. We measured the stability of these mutants by analyzing their thermal denaturation curves. The four hydrogen-bonded Thr side chains contribute 1.3 ± 0.9 kcal/mol to the stability; those that are not still contribute 0.4 ± 0.9 kcal/mol to the stability. For 40 Thr-to-Val mutants of 11 proteins, the average decrease in stability is 1.0 ± 1.0 kcal/mol when the Thr side chain is hydrogen-bonded and 0.0 ± 0.5 kcal/mol when it is not. This is clear evidence that hydrogen bonds contribute favorably to protein stability. In addition, we prepared four Val-to-Thr mutants of RNase Sa, measured their stability, and determined their crystal structures. In all cases, the mutants are less stable than the wild-type protein, with the decreases in stability ranging from 0.5 to 4.4 kcal/mol. For 41 Val-to-Thr mutants of 11 proteins, the average decrease in stability is 1.8 ± 1.3 kcal/mol and is unfavorable for 40 of 41 mutants. This shows that placing an –OH group at a site designed for a –CH3 group is very unfavorable. So, –OH groups can contribute favorably to protein stability, even if they are not hydrogen-bonded, if the site was selected for an –OH group, but they will make an unfavorable contribution to stability, even if they are hydrogen-bonded, when they are placed at a site selected for a –CH3 group. The contribution that polar groups make to protein stability depends strongly on their environment. We previously suggested that proteins gain more stability from the burial and hydrogen bonding of polar groups than from the burial of nonpolar groups (Pace, C. N. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 310–313). To study this further, we prepared eight Thr-to-Val mutants of RNase Sa, four in which the Thr side chain is hydrogen-bonded and four in which it is not.

This is clear evidence that hydrogen bonds contribute favorably to protein stability. In addition, we prepared four Val-to-Thr mutants of RNase Sa, measured their stability, and determined their crystal structures. In all cases, the mutants are less stable than the wild-type protein, with the decreases in stability ranging from 0.5 to 4.4 kcal/mol. For 41 Val-to-Thr mutants of 11 proteins, the average decrease in stability is 1.8 ± 1.3 kcal/mol and is unfavorable for 40 of 41 mutants. This shows that placing an –OH group at a site designed for a –CH3 group is very unfavorable. So, –OH groups can contribute favorably to protein stability, even if they are not hydrogen-bonded, if the site was selected for an –OH group, but they will make an unfavorable contribution to stability, even if they are hydrogen-bonded, when they are placed at a site selected for a –CH3 group. The contribution that polar groups make to protein stability depends strongly on their environment. The prevailing view for the past 40 years has been that globular proteins are stabilized mainly by the hydrophobic effect through the burial of nonpolar side chains (1Kauzmann W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (4062) Google Scholar, 2Tanford C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 4240-4247Crossref Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 3Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). We recently suggested that polar group burial makes a larger contribution to the stability of globular proteins than nonpolar group burial (4Pace C.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by most experimental studies (5Guerois R. Nielsen J.E. Serrano L. J. Mol.

Our previous studies of hydrogen bonding used mutants such as Tyr-to-Phe mutants in which a hydrogen-bonded group was removed and a cavity may be created (15Pace C.N. Horn G. Hebert E.J. Bechert J. Shaw K. Urbanikova L. Scholtz J.M. Sevcik J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A different approach is to use Thr-to-Val and Val-to-Thr mutations with the –OH group of a Thr or the –CH3 group of a Val interchanged. These mutations are less likely to leave a cavity and should give a more direct comparison of the relative contribution of polar and nonpolar group burial. The effect of these mutations on stability has been studied previously with Staphylococcus nuclease (16Byrne M.P. Manuel R.L. Lowe L.G. Stites W.E.

We have previously compared the stability of RNase Sa and two close relatives, RNase Sa2 and RNase Sa3, and determined the pH and salt dependence of their stability (25Pace C.N. Hebert E.J. Shaw K.L.

In this work, we report studies of eight Thr-to-Val mutants of RNase Sa: four in which the Thr side chains are hydrogen-bonded and four in which they are not. In addition, we report studies of four Val-to-Thr mutants of RNase Sa. The crystal structures of the four Val-to-Thr mutants were determined to assess whether the newly introduced –OH group formed a hydrogen bond. The locations of the residues studied in RNase Sa are shown in Fig. 1. By considering our results and those reported by other groups, we are able to gain further insight into the relative contributions of hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect to protein stability. Proteins—RNase Sa and mutants thereof were prepared, expressed, and purified as previously described (15Pace C.N. Horn G. Hebert E.J. Bechert J. Shaw K. Urbanikova L. Scholtz J.M. Sevcik J. J. Mol.

The protein solutions were buffered at pH 7.0 with 30 mm MOPS. 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal denaturation curves for the RNase Sa variants were determined by measuring the change in circular dichroism at 234 nm in ≈0.1 mg/ml solutions in 1-cm cuvettes on an Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectrophotometer (25Pace C.N. Hebert E.J. Shaw K.L. Schell D. Both V. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Hartley R.W. Grimsley G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The temperature was increased from 5 to 80 °C in 1-degree increments (equilibration time, 1.5 min; bandwidth, 1 nm, and time constant, 10 s). A nonlinear least-squares analysis was used to fit the thermal denaturation data to Equation 1 (34Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar), x0026;x0026;y=((yf+mf·(T))+(yu+mu·(T))·exp((ΔHm/RT)x0026;x0026;·((T-Tm)/Tm)))/(1+exp((ΔHm/RT)·((T-Tm)/Tm)))(Eq. 1) where y is the observed circular dichroism; y f + m f·(T) and y u + m u·(T) describe the linear dependence of the pre- and post-transitional base lines on temperature, respectively; ΔH m is the enthalpy of unfolding at T m; and T m is the midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve. Curve fitting was performed using Origin software (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). The reversibility of thermal denaturation was checked by reheating the samples and was >95% as judged by comparison of the ΔH m values for the two scans. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—Crystals of RNase Sa mutants V2T, V36T, V43T, and V57T were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Protein solutions were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized enzymes in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (V2T, V36T, and V43T), or 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.4 (V57T), at concentrations of 20 mg/ml (V36T and V43T) and 10 mg/ml (V2T and V57T). Well solutions were 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, and 10% dioxane (V2T, V36T, and V43T) and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.5, and 2% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400 (V57T). Crystallization drops of 3-μl volume were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein and well solutions. Crystals with dimensions of ∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm were obtained after 1–2 weeks. Data were collected at 100 K with a Rigaku rotating anode generator of CuKα x-ray radiation using osmic mirrors and a MacScience DIP 0230 image plate detector. Data sets were processed with the program DENZO (35Otwinowski Z. DENZO Data Processing Package. Yale University, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar). The crystals of the mutants belong to the space group P212121, and the mutant and wild-type crystals were isomorphous. The starting model was the wild-type RNase Sa structure (Protein Data Bank code 1RGG) (31Sevcik J. Dauter Z. Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and it was used without molecular replacement. The refinements were performed with CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

As with wild-type RNase Sa, there are two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit that are referred to as A and B. Like the wild-type structure, all mutants have a sulfate anion bound to Arg63 and Thr64 of molecule A. An analysis of the structures showed that the mutant structures are almost identical to the wild-type structure. Table III shows the side chain conformation around the Cα–Cβ bond (χ1) of the Val residues in wild-type RNase Sa and the Thr residues in the four Val-to-Thr mutants. The side chain conformation of the Thr residues in the mutants is similar to that of the Val residues in wild-type RNase Sa except for V2T. For V2T, the side chain rotates to increase the exposure of the –OH group to solvent (see Table V). Similar changes are observed in molecules A and B.Table IIISide chain conformation of Val residues in wild-type RNase Sa and of Thr residues in four Val-to-Thr mutantsRNase Saχ1aBecause of the difference in IUPAC-IUB definition of the side chain angles between Val and Thr, 240° or 120° is added to or subtracted from, respectively, the χ1 value for Thr.Wild-type (Val2)178°Mutant (Thr2)-61°Wild-type (Val36)177°Mutant (Thr36)174°Wild-type (Val43)179°Mutant (Thr43)180°Wild-type (Val57)172°Mutant (Thr57)164°a Because of the difference in IUPAC-IUB definition of the side chain angles between Val and Thr, 240° or 120° is added to or subtracted from, respectively, the χ1 value for Thr.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows a superposition of the mutant and wild-type structures at the sites of the Val-to-Thr substitution. In V2T, V36T, and V43T, water molecules form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the –OH group. In V57T, the –OH group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the Oγ1 of Thr18. Thr-to-Val Mutants—The changes that may be important to stability for Thr-to-Val mutations are summarized in Table IV. Because a Val side chain is larger than a Thr side chain, there might be a decrease in stability due to unfavorable steric interactions. On the other hand, both hydrophobicity and side chain conformational entropy will favor the Val side chain. The other factor that must be kept in mind is what happens to the hydrogen-bonding partner(s) of the Thr in the mutant protein. If the partner is unpaired in the mutant, it will decrease the stability because the partner will hydrogen bond to water in the unfolded protein. In mutants such as Tyr-to-Phe mutants, where a cavity is created, it is more likely that the hydrogen-bonding partners will be able to hydrogen bond to a water molecule than in Thr-to-Val mutants, where there will generally not be a cavity. We compare results for these two types of mutations below. Parameters characterizing the environment of the Thr residues in RNase Sa are summarized in Table V.Table IVVolume, hydrophobicity, and side chain conformational entropy changes for Thr-to-Val mutationsVolumeaBased on the volumes determined by Tsai et al.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab We will first consider the four Thr residues that are not hydrogen-bonded in RNase Sa. None of the –OH groups for these four residues are completely buried. Consequently, unfavorable steric interactions will probably make only a small contribution to the ΔΔG values. Both hydrophobicity and side chain conformational entropy will favor the mutants, and the contributions should be proportional to the extent of side chain burial. If we multiply the sum of the hydrophobicity term (1.3 kcal/mol) and the side chain entropy term (0.7 kcal/mol) by the fraction buried for the side chain, we would expect the mutants to be more stable than the wild-type protein by 1.0 (Thr5), 1.1 (Thr16), 1.5 (Thr59), and 1.7 (Thr72) kcal/mol. (For comparison, Byrne et al. (16Byrne M.P. Manuel R.L. Lowe L.G. Stites W.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13949-13960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) took into account differences in both main chain and side chain conformational entropies and concluded that Val residues will be favored over Thr residues by 2.5 kcal/mol. This is 0.5 kcal/mol per mol higher than our estimate of 2.0 kcal/mol.) However, only one of the mutants was observed to be 0.3 kcal/mol more stable than wild-type RNase Sa (Tables II and VI). Note that three of the –OH groups are hydrogen-bonded to water in the folded protein, and the fourth is 49% exposed to solvent, so it will be also. In the unfolded protein, these same –OH groups will be hydrogen-bonded to water. This suggests that the interactions of the –OH groups with the protein relative to their interactions with water are more favorable than for –CH3 groups. These interactions would be mainly dipole-dipole interactions other than hydrogen bonds and dipole-induced dipole interactions. In this case, we are placing a –CH3 group in a site designed for an –OH group, and the packing will probably not be as favorable for the –CH3 group. In summary, these results suggest that a polar –OH group may make a larger contribution to the stability of a protein than a nonpolar –CH3 group even when the –OH group is not hydrogen-bonded. We showed previously that the buried –OH groups of Tyr residues can make a favorable contribution to protein stability even when they are not hydrogen-bonded in the folded protein (15Pace C.N.

The decreases in stability appear to reflect the hydrogen-bonding properties of the Thr residues being replaced. The most destabilized is Thr56, which forms three charge-neutral hydrogen bonds; next is Thr82, which forms one charge-neutral and two neutral-neutral hydrogen bonds; next is Thr18, which forms two neutral-neutral hydrogen bonds; and last is Thr67, which forms a single intramolecular hydrogen bond and is not significantly less stable than wild-type RNase Sa (Table V). Note also that the decrease in stability is greatest for the two Thr residues with completely buried –OH groups that are the most tightly packed (Table V). The much larger decreases in stability observed when the Thr –OH groups are hydrogen-bonded compared with when they are not hydrogen-bonded suggests that hydrogen bonds make a favorable contribution to protein stability. In Table VI, we summarize results for 40 Thr-to-Val mutants in which the stability has been measured. The outliers may provide the best test cases for theoreticians to use to improve their computational methods. One outlier is Thr29 in α-lactalbumin. The –OH group of this Thr is hydrogen-bonded and completely buried, but the stability of the Thr-to-Val mutant is 1.9 kcal/mol greater than for the wild-type protein. Horii et al. (39Horii K. Saito M. Yoda T. Tsumoto K. Matsushima M. Kuwajima K. Kumagai I. Proteins. 2001; 45: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have been able to account for the experimental result using a theoretical approach. It will be interesting to see if their theoretical approach can also account for the T59V mutant of RNase Sa. Here, the Thr –OH group is hydrogen-bonded and 94% buried, but the stability of the mutant is 1.7 kcal/mol less than that of the wild-type protein. Again, the results in Table VI show that Thr residues make a greater contribution to stability when they are hydrogen-bonded than when they are not and that even when the –OH group of the Thr is not hydrogen-bonded, it can make a contribution to the stability comparable to that of a –CH3 group. Val-to-Thr Mutants—Parameters characterizing the environment of the Val residues in wild-type RNase Sa and of the Thr residues in the mutant proteins are summarized in Table VII. All of the Val-to-Thr mutants are less stable than wild-type RNase Sa by an average of 1.8 ± 1.1 kcal/mol (Tables II and VIII). The –OH groups of the Thr residues are generally more exposed to solvent than the –CH3 group of the Val that they replace (Table VII). This shows that the –CH3 group prefers the environment provided by the protein, but the –OH group prefers the environment provided by water. This will minimize the penalty for burying an –OH group at a site in the protein designed for a –CH3 group. Only the –OH group of Thr57 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the four mutant proteins. Surprisingly, the decrease in stability for T57V is considerably larger than for any of the other Thr-to-Val mutants. Val57 is completely buried, and our results suggest that despite forming a hydrogen bond, the –OH group in V57T must have very unfavorable interactions with other polar groups in the protein. This result will also provide a good test of the computational methods used to estimate stability changes on the basis of theory.Table VIIAccessibility, number of interatomic contacts, and hydrogen-bonding interactions of Val residues in wild-type RNase Sa and of Thr residues in four Val-to-Thr mutantsRNase SaAtomBuriedaThe accessibility (% buried) and the hydrogen bonding (distance between the electronegative atoms and hydrogen-bonding partners) were analyzed with the program pfis (26).

For 41 mutants, when the Val –CH3 group is replaced by an –OH group, the average decrease in stability is 1.8 ± 1.1 kcal/mol, and it is unfavorable in 40 of 41 mutants. The expected decrease in stability based on the changes in hydrophobic bonding and side chain conformational entropy is 2.0 kcal/mol (Table IV). This shows that replacing a –CH3 group with an –OH group at a site designed for a –CH3 group is almost always unfavorable, and it is modeled quite well by the predicted changes in conformational entropy and the hydrophobicity. The average decrease in stability is 2.5 kcal/mol when the Val side chain is >95% buried, but only 0.9 kcal/mol when it is <95% buried (Table VIII). This suggests that introducing a polar –OH group into the hydrophobic core is considerably more unfavorable than introducing it near the surface. In contrast, when the Thr-to-Val mutants are considered in reverse, as Val-to-Thr substitutions, there is an average increase in stability, and it is greater when the side chain is >95% buried than when it is <95% buried. Again, this shows the importance of whether the site was originally designed for an –OH group or a –CH3 group. Crystal structures have been determined for 12 Val-to-Thr mutants. In eight, the newly introduced –OH group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond; and in four, it does not. The average decrease in stability is 2.0 kcal/mol for the mutants in which the Thr –OH group forms a hydrogen bond, but only 0.7 kcal/mol for those in which it does not (Table VIII). This is a surprising result. If the theoreticians can understand these results, they may be able to improve the force fields so that they can predict protein structures. Burying nonpolar groups almost always stabilizes the folded conformations of proteins. Burying polar groups only stabilizes folded proteins when the site was selected by evolution for a polar group. This suggests that favorable van der Waals interactions and longer range electrostatic interactions may be just as important as hydrogen bonds in stabilizing buried polar groups. Concluding Remarks—In a previous study of Ala-to-Ser and Val-to-Thr mutants of T4 lysozyme, it was concluded that “the results are consistent with the view that many hydrogen bonds within proteins contribute only marginally to stability, but that non-charged polar groups that lack a hydrogen-bonding partner are very destabilizing (ΔΔG > 3 kcal/mol)” (18Blaber M. Lindstrom J.D. Gassner N. Xu J. Heinz D.W. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11363-11373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We think that this view was reached only because –OH groups were introduced at sites not selected by evolution for –OH groups. If one also considers mutants in which a hydrogen-bonding group is removed (Tyr-to-Phe mutants) or replaced by a –CH3 group at a site designed for an –OH group (Thr-to-Val mutants), one reaches a different conclusion (Table IX). Most hydrogen bonds make a substantial contribution to stability (≈1 kcal/mol/hydrogen bond), and polar groups at favorable sites can make a favorable contribution to stability even if they are not hydrogen-bonded (Table IX). The theoretical studies that reach different conclusions need to be re-examined. We have emphasized previously the importance of van der Waals interactions in the tightly packed interior of a protein to the contribution of polar group burial to stability (4Pace C.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, several groups have pointed out that the enhanced van der Waals interactions resulting from the tight packing of groups in the interior of folded proteins are also of crucial importance to the hydrophobic effect (24Loladze V.V.

These include the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), proteintyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), small G proteins of the ARF and Rho families, and possibly the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. This study addresses the mechanism of PLD activation by the M3 muscarinic receptor expressed endogenously in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells and heterologously in COS7 cells. The M3 receptor is a member of the Group I, rhodopsin-related GPCR family that is expressed in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. The best established signaling pathway from the M3 receptor is the pertussis toxin-insensitive activation of phospholipase C (PLC) via the heterotrimeric G protein Gq/11, although PLD is also strongly activated. In various cell types, PKC, protein-tyrosine kinases, ARF, and Rho have each been specifically implicated in M3 receptor-mediated PLD activation (6Zhang Y. Altshuller Y.M. Hammond S.M. Hayes F.

ARF1 and ARF6 are representative of the main classes of cellular ARFs (Classes I and III) and have distinct subcellular distributions in many cell types.

The present experiments investigate the mechanisms of M3 receptor-mediated PLD activation in 1321N1 and COS7 cells in comparison to those utilized by other GPCRs in the same conditions. We address specifically the roles played by ARF1/6 and PLD1/2 as well as the subcellular location of the relevant components and the site at which the PLD activation response occurs. In addition, we provide explicit evidence for agonistregulated physical association of ARFs with the M3 receptor and show that this may involve binding to its third intracellular loop (i3) domain.

Molecular Reagents—In order to prepare the SPFLAGhM3R.pcDNA3 construct, the human M3 receptor was PCR-amplified from first strand cDNA made from RNA extracted from the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line using the Stratagene reverse transcriptase-PCR kit. In the first round, a 1.9-kb fragment encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDA) at the 5′-end was amplified using primer pair FLAGhM3R.fp [5′-GACTACAAAGACGATGACGACGCCATGACCTTGCACAATAAC] and hM3R.rp [5′-ATCATCACCAGAAGTCACCCC], utilizing the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the second round, 0.5 μl of the first round PCR was amplified with the primer 5′-CAGGCATGAAGACGATCATCGCCCTGAGCTACATCTTCTGCCTGGTATTCGCCGACTACAAAGACGATGACG-3′, encoding a modified influenza hemagglutinin signal sequence, and the hM3R.rp. The 1.9-kb fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and Qiaex II (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK) and then subcloned into the pGEMTEasy cloning vector (Promega Biosciences Inc., Southampton, UK).

Cell Culture and Transfection—1321N1 human astrocytoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% normal calf serum and 100 μg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Prior to transfection, COS7 cells were grown to ∼70% confluence and were then transfected using FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Transfected cells were used in experiments 72 h after transfection. In a small number of experiments, HEK 293 cells were similarly transfected. In all experiments involving transfection, equivalent amounts of empty vector were substituted in control samples to compensate for any omitted plasmid. Ligand Binding Assays—Specific binding of [3H]NMe-QNB was measured in membrane fractions of 1321N1 and sFM3 receptor-transfected COS7 cells. Cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and then homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with 2 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and aliquots were taken for protein assay (Coomassie binding method; Pierce). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed twice more. For the binding assay, 1% bovine serum albumin was added. Ligand concentrations were varied from 20 pm to 2 nm, and nonspecific binding was defined by 1 μm NMe-atropine. After 4 h at 25 °C, an excess of ice-cold buffer was added, tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant was aspirated from the pellet. Data were curvefitted by nonlinear regression (Fig P, Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Cell surface specific binding of [3H]oxotremorine-M was measured to 1321N1 and sFM3 receptor-transfected COS7 cells in 12-well plates at 4 °C. Culture medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1% bovine serum albumin and then plates were chilled on ice. Ligand (5 nm), with or without 3 μm NMe-atropine to determine nonspecific binding, was added, and samples were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C to minimize internalization. Incubations were then quenched with excess ice-cold buffer and washed once. Ice-cold “acid strip” solution (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl) was added for 5 min to release surface-bound ligand. The internalization of specific [3H]oxotremorine-M binding sites into COS7 cells was measured at 37 °C over a time course of 0–50 min following the addition of ligand. Both ligand and NMe-atropine concentrations were as in the experiments carried out at 4 °C. Total and nonspecific binding levels were assessed at each time point. Following 5 min with cold acid strip solution to remove surface-bound ligand, cells were solubilized in 1% SDS, 1 m NaOH and then neutralized, to determine [3H]ligand in both cell surface and internalized compartments. Signal Transduction Assays—Cellular [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]InsP) production (PLC activity) was measured in 12-well plates following labeling with 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol for 18 h in serum-free medium. Agonist responses were measured usually over 30 min in the presence of 10 mm LiCl before cells were lysed in ice-cold 10 mm formic acid, and [3H]inositol phosphates were separated by ion exchange (38MacKenzie C.J. Lutz E.M. Johnson M.S. Robertson D.N. Holland P.J. Mitchell R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Inhibitory agents and the LiCl were added 30 min and 15 min prior to agonist, respectively. [3H]Phosphatidylbutanol ([3H]PtdBut) production (PLD activity) was measured in 12-well plates following labeling with 1.5 μCi/well [3H]palmitate for 18 h in serum-free medium. It has been shown that the presence of serum causes elevated basal activity of PLD (21Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Agonist responses were measured usually over 30 min in the presence of 30 mm butan-1-ol. Assays were terminated, phospholipids were extracted into chloroform/methanol, and [3H]PtdBut was separated by thin layer chromatography (39McCulloch D.A. Lutz E.M. Johnson M.S. Robertson D.N. MacKenzie C.J. Holland P.J. Mitchell R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Inhibitory agents and the butan-1-ol were added 30 min prior to and immediately before agonist, respectively. In experiments with PMTx (40Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), agonist incubations were carried out over a total period of 4 h, with replacement of medium containing fresh PMTx and LiCl or butan-1-ol at 2 h. All data from signal transduction and ligand binding experiments are expressed as means ± S.E. from between 4 and 10 separate determinations. Immunoprecipitation of sFM3 Receptor—In order to immunoprecipitate the sFM3 receptor with any associated proteins, plasmids encoding the sFM3 receptor and either ARF1-HA or ARF6-HA were transiently transfected into COS7 cells. 72 h later, the cells were serum-deprived for 4 h. Cells were then exposed to carbachol (20 μm) or no drug for 15 min and washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution before being solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1% CHAPS, 0.75% sodium deoxycholate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium molybdate, and 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 ml/175-cm2 flask for 1 h on ice). Carbachol was readded where appropriate. Extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove particulate material and precleared with Protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow (Sigma) (20 μl of 1:1 suspension/ml for 45 min at 4 °C). After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed to tubes containing either mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody (clone M2, 10 μg/ml; Sigma) or nonimmune mouse IgG (10 μg/ml; Sigma) with 40 μl/ml Protein G-Sepharose suspension, before rolling at 4 °C overnight. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer before 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) was added per ml of original supernatant. SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto “Immobilon-P” polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Ltd., Watford, UK) were carried out using a Phastsystem apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were carried out on the samples and original supernatants to detect immunoprecipitated proteins and monitor input levels. The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal raised to the third intracellular loop of the M3 receptor (41Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (gift from Andrew Tobin) and rabbit polyclonal against the HA epitope tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Autogen Bioclear Ltd., Calne, UK), followed by preabsorbed secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon International Ltd., Harrow, UK). Bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and then measured by quantitative densitometry. In further experiments, an alternative procedure was used in which the sFM3 receptor associated with ARF1-HA or ARF6-HA immunoprecipitates was measured by specific [3H]NMe-QNB binding. Cells treated with or without carbachol were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer with 10% glycerol, and precleared supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg/ml 12CA5 mouse monoclonal HA antibody (or nonimmune mouse IgG) for 90 min followed by Protein G-Sepharose for 40 min. This more rapid procedure was designed to minimize the possibility of any nonspecific interactions of the solubilized proteins. Immunoprecipitates were washed in immunoprecipitation buffer with 10% glycerol and then resuspended into [3H]NMe-QNB binding buffer (above) with 10% glycerol and 0.3 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidyl choline prior to ligand binding, as above. Cell Surface Biotinylation—In some experiments, cell surface proteins were biotinylated using a membrane-impermeant reagent (biotinamidohexanoic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester sodium salt) (Sigma); 1 mm for 2 h at 4 °C). The reaction was quenched with 75 mm glycine (10 min at 4 °C), and cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline before returning to minimal essential medium and warming to 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated with 20 μm carbachol (10 min) or control before solubilization. Extracts were incubated with monomeric avidin-agarose (1 h at 4 °C) and washed in solubilization buffer before biotinylated proteins were eluted by incubation in 2 mm biotin for 30 min at 4 °C. These supernatants were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 HA antibody (or nonimmune IgG control) and subsequently used in specific [3H]NMe-QNB binding assays, as above. GST Fusion Protein Interaction Assays—The GST-M3i3 (Arg252– Gln490) construct in pGEX-4T-1 and the control GST-BKSTREX construct in pGEX-5X-1 were expressed in BL21-RIL bacterial cells, which were then grown up in standard 2× YT (yeast extract, tryptone, NaCl) medium with 2% glucose added. When the cells had reached an A 600 of 0.6–0.8 units/ml, expression of the fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed with BugBuster reagent (Novagen, CN-Biosciences) for 10 min and again centrifuged. The supernatant, containing the GST fusion proteins, was added to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were incubated with the bacterial supernatant for 20 min at room temperature to allow binding of the GST fusion proteins to the beads. The matrix formed was then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and used immediately. In order to provide cytosolic extracts enriched with various ARF constructs, transfected COS7 cells were homogenized in ice-cold extraction buffer (2 ml/175-cm2 flask, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were then homogenized (Ystral homogenizer; setting 3, 15 s) before being centrifuged (12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –40 °C. ARF-HA-enriched extracts were incubated with the GST fusion protein affinity matrix in 250 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80) for 90 min at 4 °C with rolling. The beads were washed four times in Buffer A, and then the retained proteins were removed from the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer and applied to 20% homogenous Phastgels (Amersham Biosciences) for SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. Membranes were probed for HA immunoreactivity to monitor captured ARFs and for GST immunoreactivity to assess levels of fusion protein input (GST alone ∼29 kDa, GST-M3i3 ∼49 kDa, and GST-BKSTREX ∼35 kDa). Antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-HA and polyclonal anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL were as used in the immunoprecipitation studies. Input levels of ARF-HA immunoreactivity in extracts were also monitored, and both fusion protein and ARF inputs were carefully balanced to ensure comparability between samples. Subcellular Fractionation—Homogenates of sFM3 receptor-transfected COS7 cells (in 175-cm2 flasks), either control or treated with 200 μm carbachol for 10 min, were prepared and initially centrifuged at 1000 × g for 8 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The remaining membranes were fractionated through gradients of Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) under alkaline conditions designed to optimally separate endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and plasma membrane fractions (24Edwards Y.S. Murray A.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fractions (0.5 ml) were downloaded from the bottom of the gradient by peristaltic pump (1 ml/min), and adjacent fractions were combined into Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE on Nu-PAGE 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen)"
https://openalex.org/W2083398339,"We used reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and post source decay analysis (MALDI-PSD) to determine the muropeptide composition of the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. Structural assignment was determined for 28 muropeptide species isolated after HPLC separation and purification. Fourteen of these muropeptides were O-acetylated to different degrees. We identified the entire O-acetylation spectrum of dimers and trimers both in muropeptides and 1,6-anhydromuropeptides. On average, one of three disaccharides was O-acetylated. Furthermore, the degree of cross-linking of the N. meningitidis peptidoglycan was around 39% in all the strains analyzed. MALDI-PSD analysis of several muropeptide species indicated that meningococci only synthesize d-alanyl-meso-diaminopimelate cross-bridges. No muropeptides representative of covalent linkages of lipoproteins to the peptidoglycan could be identified, unlike in Escherichia coli. Finally, comparison of the muropeptide composition of penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-intermediate clinical strains of meningococci showed a positive correlation between the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin G and the amount of muropeptides carrying an intact pentapeptide chain in the peptidoglycan. This suggests that reduced susceptibility to penicillin G in N. meningitidis is associated with a decrease in d,d-carboxypeptidase activity and/or d,d-transpeptidase activity.

This suggests that reduced susceptibility to penicillin G in N. meningitidis is associated with a decrease in d,d-carboxypeptidase activity and/or d,d-transpeptidase activity. Neisseria meningitidis is a major human pathogen that is capable of crossing the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier to induce septicemia and meningitis (1Taha M.K. Deghmane A.E. Antignac A.

Penicillin is considered to be the treatment of choice for meningococcal diseases due to the intrinsic susceptibility of N. meningitidis to β-lactam antibiotics. Indeed, few N. meningitidis strains carry plasmid-encoded β-lactamases. However, meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin due to a decreased affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; PSD, post source decay; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; A2pm, diaminopimelic acid; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration.1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; PSD, post source decay; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; A2pm, diaminopimelic acid; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. associated with mosaic penA genes (2Bowler L.D.

The penA gene codes for the PBP2, which is homologous to high molecular weight class B PBPs and is closely related to Escherichia coli PBP3 and Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP2x. Therefore, reduced susceptibility to penicillin G in N. meningitidis is expected to be associated with changes in the peptidoglycan structure, as previously seen in S. pneumoniae (5Garcia-Bustos J. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5415-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), Haemophilus influenzae (6Burroughs M.H. Chang Y.S. Gage D.A. Tuomanen E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11594-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the related human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae (7Dougherty T.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 28: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several virulence factors are involved in bacteria-host interactions and are responsible for preventing bacterial clearance and allowing colonization. However, little is known about the role of peptidoglycan in meningococcal pathogenesis, partly because the structure of the N. meningitidis peptidoglycan is not known. Indeed, besides the central roles of peptidoglycan in bacterial growth, shape maintenance and cell division, there is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting that its degradation products play a major biological role in the innate immune response of the host. The tracheal cytotoxin from Bordetella pertussis is a peptidoglycan degradation product, GlcNAc-(β-1,4)-1,6-anhydromuramyl-l -alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate-d-alanine (8Luker K.E.

The same product from N. gonorrhoeae is cytotoxic for human fallopian tube epithelial cells (9Melly M.A. McGee Z.A. Rosenthal R.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 149: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several different muropeptides induce somnogenic, pyrogenic, and hematological effects (10Johannsen L. Rosenthal R.S. Martin S.A. Cady A.B. Obal Jr., F. Guinand M. Krueger J.M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2726-2732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Johannsen L. Toth L.A. Rosenthal R.S. Opp M.R. Obal Jr., F. Cady A.B. Krueger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: R182-R186PubMed Google Scholar), which are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of N. meningitidis. Accordingly, N. gonorrhoeae has been used as a model organism to study the peptidoglycan of Neisseria spp., with particular emphasis on its structure and the biological activity of its degradation products (9Melly M.A. McGee Z.A. Rosenthal R.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 149: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Dougherty T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 69-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Martin S.A.

Immun. 2002; 70: 2752-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the structural analysis of muropeptide species was only partial. Interestingly, N. meningitidis is cytopathic to human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, which constitute the first line of host defense (15Stephens D.S. McGee Z.A. Cooper M.D. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1987; 53: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The importance of penicillin resistance in meningococcal infection treatment failure and the potential biological properties of its peptidoglycan led us to perform a detailed structural analysis of the muropeptide composition of N. meningitidis using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and post source decay analysis (MALDI-PSD). In addition, we compared the peptidoglycan composition of a series of clinical meningococcal strains with different levels of reduced susceptibility to penicillin G. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The meningococcal strains used in this study were isolated from clinical samples and characterized at the French National Reference Center for Meningococci (Table I). N. meningitidis was grown on GCB medium (Difco) containing Kellogg supplements (16Kellogg D.S. Peacock W.L. Deacon W.E. Brown L. Pirkle C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serological typing was performed as previously described (17Frasch C.E. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. Rev. Infect.

Penicillin G, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime susceptibilities were tested by the diffusion method (Etest) on G medium (Sanofi Diagnostic Pasteur), and the polymorphism of the penA gene was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism as previously described (3Antignac A.

Open table in a new tab Peptidoglycan Preparation—Meningococci were inoculated in 500 ml of GCB liquid and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6–0.7. Peptidoglycan was isolated by an adapted version of the method developed for E. coli (19Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cultures were swirled in ice-alcohol baths and then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed once with ice-cold 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. The cells were added dropwise to 10 ml of boiling 4% SDS buffered with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and boiled for a further 30 min. After cooling to room temperature overnight, the SDS-insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was washed 5 times with warm water and resuspended in 5 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm NaCl. DNase and RNase (Sigma) were added at a concentration of 10 and 50 μg/ml, respectively, for 2 h at 37 °C. The peptidoglycan-associated proteins were removed by incubation with 50 μg/ml of proteinase K (Invitrogen) overnight at 37 °C. The SDS-insoluble material was reextracted with boiling 1% SDS for 15 min. The material was collected and washed by centrifugation four times as described above. The peptidoglycan pellet was resuspended in distilled water, lyophilized, and stored at –80 °C. The lyophilized peptidoglycan was resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.8) and completely digested with 25 μg/200 μl of muramidase from Streptomyces globisporus (Sigma) for 18 h at 37 °C. The enzyme reaction was stopped by boiling the sample for 3 min, and insoluble contaminations were removed by centrifugation. The digested peptidoglycan was mixed with an equal volume of 0.5 m sodium borate buffer (pH 8.0) in which sodium borohydride (10 mg/ml) had been freshly dissolved for 20 min exactly at room temperature. Excess borohydride was destroyed with 20% phosphoric acid, the pH of the samples was adjusted to 4.0, and the samples were filtered (0.2-μm pore size). Reverse-phase HPLC Analysis and Desalting of Muropeptides—For HPLC analysis, we used a linear gradient from 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.33), with 1 μg/ml sodium azide to compensate for base-line drift, to 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.1) containing 15% methanol for 120 min on a Hypersil ODS column (4.6 × 250 nm; 5-μm particles; ThermoHypersil-Keystone) at room temperature using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. UV detection was carried out at 205 nm. Isolated muropeptides were desalted by HPLC on the same column using a 0–50% acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, water. During the desalting step, some HPLC peaks were further separated in two muropeptide species that were designated a and b. The desalted muropeptides were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C. Mass Spectrometry—Desalted muropeptides were analyzed by MALDI-MS using 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole as the MALDI matrix as previously described (20Xu N. Huang Z.H. de Jonge B.L. Gage D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Alternatively, samples were desalted a second time directly on the sample plate and analyzed using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the MALDI matrix. Briefly, muropeptides were dissolved in 1 μl of acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid (70:30: 0.1%). Subsequently, 0.5 μl of the sample and 0.5 μl of a 6-fold dilution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were loaded onto the MALDI sample plate (96 × 2 Teflon plate, Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). Samples were air-dried at room temperature and washed for 30 s with 0.7 μl of cold water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). After removing the liquid with a pipette, samples were recrystallized with 0.5 μl of acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid (70:30:0.1%). MALDI-MS measurements were taken on a Voyager-DE STR spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The instrument was operated in the delayed extraction mode and in the reflector mode. Measurements were taken in the reflector mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, 76% grid voltage, and a delay extraction of 150 ns. Each mass spectrum was an average of 250–500 laser shots. Masses were measured using close external calibration with a mixture of four peptides (des-Arg 1-bradykinin, [M+H]+: 904.4681; angiotensin 1, [M+H]+: 1296.6853; neurotensin, [M+H]+: 1672.9175; ACTH 1839, [M+H]+: 2465.1989). For PSD experiments, the timed ion selector was used to select the [M+Na]+ value of the precursor ion. Muropeptide Composition of N. meningitidis Peptidoglycan—After muramidase digestion, the peptidoglycan from the penicillin-susceptible strain LNP8013 was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1) and used as peak source for structural analysis. The molecular mass (m/z) of each peak was determined by MALDI-MS. This allowed us to assign tentative structures to 28 distinct muropeptides present in the peptidoglycan of N. meningitidis (Table II; see also PSD data below and in Fig. 2, Fig. 2). Several peaks represented mixtures of different muropeptides. Some could be resolved during the desalting step (data not shown), allowing us to determine the major species present.Table IIStructural analysis by MALDI-MS of meningococcal muropeptides isolated by HPLCHPLC peakaPeak nomenclature corresponds to Fig. 1.

Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Better separation was achieved if the elution step was carried out at room temperature (25 °C) rather than at 55 °C. Consequently, it was not possible to assign structures unambiguously by directly comparing the HPLC muropeptide profiles of E. coli and N. meningitidis. Therefore, several major muropeptide peaks were further analyzed by MALDI-PSD. Fig. 2,Fig. 2 shows the MALDI-PSD spectra of muropeptides 8a (Fig. 2A), 12a (Fig. 2B), and 16 (Fig. 2C). The molecular masses of these muropeptides ([M+Na]+ of 1887.5331 m/z, 1929.8141 m/z, and 2853.2243 m/z, respectively) are consistent with several alternative structures. Indeed, muropeptide 8a may be either GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetra-tetra-GlcNAc-MurNAc or GlcNAc-Mur-NAc-tetra-(N(ϵ)-Ala)-tri-GlcNAc-MurNAc, and muropeptide 12a corresponded to the O-acetylated derivative of muropeptide 8a. The MALDI-PSD spectra of both of these muropeptides generated a 964.3584 m/z fragment that corresponds to GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetrapeptide, suggesting that both molecules are completely symmetrical. This is also suggested by the absence of a GlcNAc-MurNAc-tripeptide (893.3604 m/z) or a GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide (1035.4346 m/z) in the MALDI-PSD spectra of either muropeptide. Therefore, the muropeptide 8a and its O-acetylated derivative (muropeptide 12a) correspond to GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetra-tetra-GlcNAc-MurNAc and not to GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetra-(N(ϵ)-Ala)-tri-GlcNAc-MurNAc resulting from l,d-endopeptidase activity. Furthermore, the MALDI-PSD spectra of muropeptide 12a (Fig. 2B) revealed a small 1859.1779 m/z fragment, corresponding to the parent ion minus an alanine residue. In the positive ion mode, muropeptides fragment preferentially from the C-terminal end as b ions (20Xu N. Huang Z.H. de Jonge B.L. Gage D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the alanine residue is located at the C terminus, which is consistent with the structure of GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetra-tetra-GlcNAc-MurNAc. Finally, the MALDI-PSD spectra of muropeptide 16 (Fig. 2C) also indicated that this muropeptide is completely symmetrical (absence of 893.3604 m/z and 1958.8322 m/z ion fragments). Additionally, the presence of two ion fragments of 1636.7225 m/z and 1841.3890 m/z, corresponding to fragments 1725.6344 m/z and 1929.7173 m/z, respectively, minus an alanine residue (Fig. 2C), again suggest that this molecule contains an alanine residue at its C terminus. We concluded that muropeptide 16 corresponds to the trimeric muropeptide [GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetra]3 carrying an O-acetyl group. Given the structural assignment of these three major muropeptides, the molecular masses of the other muropeptides and their relative retention times compared with these major muropeptides, and the temperature-dependent nature of the elution profile according to structure (19Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), we were able to assign structures to all muropeptides species unambiguously (Table II). Interestingly, some differences were observed between the N. meningitidis and the related pathogen N. gonorrhoeae chromatogram profiles (7Dougherty T.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 28: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Dougherty T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 69-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found no evidence of muropeptides carrying glycine residues in N. meningitidis as observed in gonococci (12Dougherty T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 69-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Martin S.A. Rosenthal R.S. Biemann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7514-7522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extent of O-acetylation of dimers and trimers differed in meningococci and in gonococci (21Garcia-Bustos J.F. Dougherty T.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We were unable to estimate the percentage of anhydromuropeptides and, therefore, to calculate the average length of meningococcal glycan chains. In fact, most anhydro-muropeptides co-eluted with other muropeptides that constituted the major fraction of the HPLC peaks (for example, muropeptides 8b and 12b) (Fig. 1 and Table II). Finally, contrary to the report by Dougherty (12Dougherty T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 69-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the presence of tetramers in gonococcal peptidoglycan similarly to in E. coli (22Glauner B. Holtje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found no evidence for such structures in meningococci, with trimers being the most polymerized muropeptide species identified. Degree of Cross-linking and O-Acetylation—This analysis permitted us to assess the degree of cross-linking and of disaccharide O-acetylation. Our calculations took into account the presence of muropeptide mixtures in some peaks. Two scenarios were encountered, (i) one single muropeptide was found to be the major species in a given peak, and for the purpose of our calculations, we decided to consider it to be the only structure, or (ii) several of the different muropeptides in a single peak were present in significant amounts. In such cases, the peak area was allocated proportionally to each structure. We calculated the degree of cross-linking according to Glauner (19Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and found a percentage of around 38.5% for strain LNP8013, consistent with that determined for other Gram-negative bacteria (6Burroughs M.H. Chang Y.S. Gage D.A. Tuomanen E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11594-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Glauner B. Holtje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol.

The degree of disaccharide O-acetylation was calculated as follows: Σ (OAc monomers + di-OAc dimers + tri-OAc trimers + ½ OAc dimers + ⅔ di-OAc trimers + ⅓ OAc trimers)/Σ muropeptides. Note that we used the peak area and not the molar percentage of each muropeptide for our calculation, meaning that we took the molar proportion of disaccharides directly into account. We estimated that one in every three disaccharides is O-acetylated, which is similar to previous estimates for gonococci (25Clarke A.J. Dupont C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our data also enabled us to estimate an empirical formula to calculate the shift in retention time of a muropeptide modified by O-acetylation. Each O-acetylation increases the retention time by 25.18 min divided by the number of disaccharide units of a given muropeptide. For example, the retention time of a dimer with one O-acetylated disaccharide will be 13 min longer than that of the non-O-acetylated dimer, whereas if both disaccharides are O-acetylated it will be 26 min longer. Based on this empirical formula, we were able to compare observed and calculated retention times, resulting in a S.D. of ± 0.89 min (Table III). The calculated retention times were close to the observed ones in all cases except for the major monomer GlcNAc-MurNAc tetrapeptide.Table IIIComparison of calculated and measured elution behavior of muropeptides according to their degree of O-acetylationMuropeptideaDi, disaccharide dipeptide; Tri, disaccharide tripeptide, Tetra, disaccharide tetrapeptide; Penta, disaccharide pentapeptide (disaccharide = N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid); Anh, 1, 6-anhydromuramic acid; OAc, O-acetylation on N-acetylmuramic acid.Retention timeMeasuredbRetention times were obtained from Fig. 1.CalculatedcCalculated according to the following formula: muropeptide retention time + (number of OAc units × 25.18 min/number of disaccharide units).minTetra36.9Tetra OAc58.062.1Tetra-tri64.8Tetra-tri OAc77.777.4Tetra-tetra71.2Tetra-tetra OAc83.883.8Tetra-tetra di-OAc96.596.4Tetra-penta75.4Tetra-penta OAc88.088.0Tetra-tetra-tetra OAc93.2Tetra-tetra-tetra di-OAc102.5101.6Tetra-tetra-tetra tri-OAc111.6110.0Tetra-tetra (Anh)101.6Tetra-tetra (Anh) OAc111.6114.2Tetra-tetra-tetra (Anh) OAc115.6Tetra-tetra-tetra (Anh) di-OAc124.2124.0a Di, disaccharide dipeptide; Tri, disaccharide tripeptide, Tetra, disaccharide tetrapeptide; Penta, disaccharide pentapeptide (disaccharide = N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid); Anh, 1, 6-anhydromuramic acid; OAc, O-acetylation on N-acetylmuramic acid.b Retention times were obtained from Fig. 1.c Calculated according to the following formula: muropeptide retention time + (number of OAc units × 25.18 min/number of disaccharide units).

However, the molecular mechanisms by which homocysteine could interfere with normal cell function are poorly understood in a whole organ like the liver, which is central to the catabolism of homocysteine. We used a combination of differential display and cDNA arrays to analyze differential gene expression in association with elevated hepatic homocysteine levels in CBS-deficient mice, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Expression of several genes was found to be reproducibly abnormal in the livers of heterozygous and homozygous CBS-deficient mice. We report altered expression of genes encoding ribosomal protein S3a and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, suggesting such cellular growth and proliferation perturbations may occur in homozygous CBS-deficient mice liver. Many up- or down-regulated genes encoded cytochromes P450, evidence of perturbations of the redox potential in heterozygous and homozygous CBS-deficient mice liver. The expression of various genes involved in severe oxidative processes was also abnormal in homozygous CBS-deficient mice liver. Among them, the expression of heme oxygenase 1 gene was increased, concomitant with overexpression of heme oxygenase 1 at the protein level. Commensurate with the difference in hepatic mRNA paraoxonase 1 abundance, the mean hepatic activity of paraoxonase 1, an enzyme that protects low density lipoprotein from oxidation, was 3-fold lower in homozygous CBS-deficient mice. Heterozygous CBS-deficient mice, when fed a hyperhomocysteinemic diet, have also reduced PON1 activity, which demonstrates the effect of hyperhomocysteinemia in the paraoxonase 1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1994993681,"Ron, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for the macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), activates multiple signaling pathways by recruiting several positive regulators to a multifunctional docking site. Here we show that stimulation by MSP also recruits a negative regulator, the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase, to the multifunctional docking site as well as to a juxtamembrane tyrosine autophosphorylation site. c-Cbl recruitment to these two sites results in polyubiquitylation of Ron molecules, which are subsequently sorted for endocytosis and degradation. Both the phosphotyrosine binding domain of c-Cbl and its RING domain are essential for downregulation of Ron. Although Ron and c-Cbl are found also in physical complexes that include Grb2, these associations are insufficient for productive ubiquitylation of Ron. Our results shed light on the mechanism of receptor desensitization mediated by c-Cbl and its binding partner Grb2."

Neisseria meningitidis is an exclusive human bacterium that usually infects the nasopharynx. It occasionally provokes invasive infections such as septicemia, meningitis, and arthritis. Meningococcal infections are still a major public health concern due to periodic epidemics of meningitis in Africa and local outbreaks in developed countries. This concern is heightened by the increasing prevalence of meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G (PenI), 1The abbreviations used are: PenI, reduced susceptibility to penicillin; PenS, penicillin-susceptible; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; TR, transformant; S-PBP2, susceptible-PBP2; R-PBP2, resistant-PBP2; IC50, inhibition concentration 50. one of the major antibiotics used for the treatment of meningococcal infections.

Meningococcal strains that are highly resistant to penicillin G (MIC > 1 μg/ml) due to the production of a plasmid-encoded β-lactamase have been detected in some countries (5Fontanals D. Pineda V. Pons I. Rojo J.C. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1989; 8: 90-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Dillon J.R. Pauze M. Yeung K.H.

However, meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G (PenI) (MICs between 0.125 and 1 μg/ml) have been reported worldwide (9Oppenheim B.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 98-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this reduction in susceptibility is at least partly due to the decreased affinity of PBP2 encoded by an altered penA gene (10Spratt B.G. Nature. 1988; 332: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Mendelman P.M. Campos J. Chaffin D.O. Serfass D.A. Smith A.L. Saez-Nieto J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). N. gonorrhoeae also shows increased resistance to penicillin G due to the decreased affinity of both PBP1 and PBP2 for penicillin G combined with alterations of the gonococcal porin and the overexpression of the MtrCDE efflux pump (12Ropp P.A. Hu M. Olesky M. Nicholas R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). N. meningitidis is naturally competent for transformation, which enables the horizontal transfer of DNA between strains, resulting in mosaic structures at genetic loci and a highly diverse meningococcal population (13Feil E.J. Maiden M.C. Achtman M. Spratt B.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Holmes E.C. Urwin R. Maiden M.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The penA gene is altered as a result of DNA transfer between meningococcal strains or from commensal Neisseria species (15Spratt B.G. Zhang Q.Y. Jones D.M. Hutchison A. Brannigan J.A. Dowson C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8988-8992Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Spratt B.G. Bowler L.D. Zhang Q.Y. Zhou J. Smith J.M. J. Mol.

We previously developed a rapid approach to define meningococcal penA alleles based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Penicillin-susceptible (PenS) strains harbor highly related penA alleles regardless of their genotype. Conversely, PenI strains harbor different penA alleles, and the PenI phenotype is directly related to alterations in the penA gene in N. meningitidis (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The penA gene encodes PBP2, a 60-kDa protein, which is homologous to high molecular weight class B PBPs. By analogy with PBP3 from Escherichia coli, PBP2 probably catalyzes a transpeptidation reaction that is necessary for the cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the meningococcal cell wall. Alterations of penA gene mostly affect the 3′ transpeptidase-encoding region. The active serine residue SXXK, the SXN, and the KTG motifs, which are all located in this region, are usually conserved, but a high degree of polymorphism is observed in the surrounding sequences (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because penicillin binds covalently to PBP2, the alterations around the active site-encoding domain probably reduce the affinity of PBP2 for penicillin G, thus accounting for the PenI phenotype. However, the effects of penA alterations on the enzymatic activity of PBP2 (particularly the transpeptidation reaction involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis) and the involvement of such modifications in the PenI phenotype have not been addressed. The lack of information concerning the structure of the N. meningitidis peptidoglycan has hindered this analysis. We recently solved this structure using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (57Antignac A. Rousselle J.-C. Namane A. Labigne A. Taha M.-K. Boneca I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31521-31528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to characterize meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G and to study the functional consequences of PBP2 alterations. In particular, we analyzed the modifications in the peptidoglycan structure in well defined isogenic strains that only differed by the penA gene. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The meningococcal strains used in this study are listed in Table I. N. meningitidis was grown for 18 h on GCB medium (Difco) containing Kellogg supplements (20Kellogg D.S. Peacock W.L. Deacon W.E. Brown L. Pirkle C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli TG1 was used as a host for cloning experiments, and E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS was used as an expression system (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). E. coli cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml kanamycin and 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol when necessary. Antibiotic susceptibility testing by the Etest method and serological typing were performed as previously described (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Abdillahi H. Poolman J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 48: 367-371Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Frasch C.E.

N. meningitidis strain LNP8013 was transformed with either the entire penA gene or the 3′ end of the penA gene amplified from PenI strains with oligonucleotides 99-14/99-23 and AA-18/99-23 (Table II), respectively, as previously described (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Zhang Q.Y. Saez Nieto J.A. Jones D.M. Spratt B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The crude membranes (30 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of [3H]benzylpenicillin (20 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences). The reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of unlabeled penicillin G (2.5 mg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. The binding affinity of penicillin G to purified PBP2s was assayed by competition experiments with [3H]benzylpenicillin. The purified PBP2s (2 μg of protein) were first incubated with increasing concentrations of penicillin G, then with saturating concentrations of [3H]benzylpenicillin and processed as described above. After SDS-PAGE analysis, the gels were fixed for 30 min in 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid, washed for 10 min with water, and placed in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The gels were dried and used to expose Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C. The signals were quantified using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Infrared Spectroscopy—Cells that had been grown for 18 h were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in distilled water. The optical densities of the suspensions were adjusted to yield optimal infrared spectra. A 35-μl aliquot of cells and a 20-μl aliquot of purified peptidoglycan preparations were transferred to a ZnSe optical plate (sample holder), vacuum-dried, and then used directly for Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy. Each sample was measured in five independent assays. All spectra were recorded between wave numbers 4000 and 500 cm–1 with an IFS 28/B Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The OPUS software, version 3.02 (Bruker), was used to process the data. Determination of Peptidoglycan Structure—Peptidoglycan preparations, reverse-phase HPLC analysis, desalting of muropeptides, and mass spectrometry were performed as previously described (57Antignac A. Rousselle J.-C. Namane A. Labigne A. Taha M.-K. Boneca I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31521-31528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptidoglycans were isolated by an adapted version of the method developed for E. coli (25Glauner B. Holtje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate, digested with muramidase from Streptomyces globisporus, and reduced with sodium borohydride. Muropeptides were separated and desalted by HPLC on a Hypersil ODS column (ThermoHypersil-Keystone) and submitted to mass spectrometry analysis. All matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and post source decay experiments were carried out on a Voyager DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) as previously described (57Antignac A.

Molecular Typing—Strains were typed by multilocus DNA fingerprinting using five genes (pilA, pilD, crgA, regF, and iga) as previously described (26Guibourdenche M. Giorgini D. Gueye A. Larribe M.

Polymorphisms of the penA and ponA genes were analyzed by RFLP as previously described (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ponA gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides AA-6 and AA-7 (Table II). Amplicons were then digested with HpaII and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. The nucleotide sequences of the penA gene were analyzed as previously described (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant PBP2s—penA′ codes for a water-soluble form of PBP2 lacking the N-terminal transmembrane domain. penA′ from strains with different penA alleles (LNP8013, LNP16519, LNP17041, LNP16454, LNP17723, and LNP18425) was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides AA-4 (with 5′ BsaI adaptor) and AA-2 (with 5′ XhoI adaptor) (Table II). These resulting fragments were digested with BsaI and XhoI and ligated into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET28b (Novagen) to create genes encoding PBP2s with six C-terminal histidine residues (His6-tagged PBP2s) expressed under the control of the T7 bacteriophage promoter. These recombinant plasmids were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, and protein purification was performed using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) as previously described (29Deghmane A.E. Petit S. Topilko A. Pereira Y. Giorgini D. Larribe M. Taha M.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1068-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The fractions containing PBP2 were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, adjusted to 20% glycerol (v/v), and stored at –20 °C. Construction of penA-lacZ Transcriptional Fusions—The entire penA coding sequence from strain LNP8013 (penA1 allele) was amplified with oligonucleotides 99-1 and 99-2 (Table II) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to obtain the recombinant plasmid pAA3. A 400-bp fragment located immediately downstream from the penA gene on the meningococcal chromosome was amplified with oligonucleotides AA-13 (with a 5′ NdeI adaptor) and AA-14 (with a 5′ SacI adaptor) (Table II). The resulting fragment was cloned between the NdeI and SacI sites located downstream from the penA gene in pAA3. A promotorless lacZ gene (30Perkins J.B. Youngman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was introduced into the SpeI site located downstream from the penA gene. The aph-3′ gene, encoding kanamycin resistance (31Taha M.K. Morand P.C. Pereira Y. Eugene E. Giorgini D. Larribe M. Nassif X. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was amplified with oligonucleotides KM-6 and KM-7 (Table II) and inserted into the blunt-ended HindIII site at the end of the lacZ gene. This recombinant plasmid, named pAA8, harbors the penA-lacZ-aph-3′ operon (Fig. 1A) and was used to transform meningococcal PenS strain LNP8013 (penA1) and PenI strains LNP16969 (penA21) and LNP16635 (penA11) (Table I). Upon transformation, the recombinant plasmid pAA8 is not maintained, and double recombination occurs. PCR and RFLP analysis were used to select transformants in which lacZ and aph-3′ genes had been integrated correctly but in which the original penA allele in the chromosome had been preserved in each strain. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Characterization of Meningococcal Strains—We first selected a subset of well defined meningococcal clinical isolates including ten PenI strains and one PenS strain (Table I). We determined the serogroup, serotype, and serosubtype of each strain. The MICs of penicillin G, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime were determined by the Etest method. The multilocus DNA fingerprinting approach using five genes (pilA, pilD, crgA, regF, and iga) showed that strains belonged to different genetic lineages (Table I). RFLP analysis showed that the penA allele of all PenI strains differed from that of the strain LNP8013 (PenS) (Table I). Because alterations of both PBP2 and PBP1 are associated with an increased level of penicillin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae (12Ropp P.A. Hu M. Olesky M. Nicholas R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we also used RFLP to analyze the ponA polymorphism in 66 PenS and PenI meningococcal strains. Several restriction enzymes were tested, and only digestion with HpaII gave four highly related ponA alleles, but no association was observed between ponA alleles and PenS/PenI phenotypes (Table I and data not shown). It has previously been shown that the disappearance of PstI site in the ponA gene is correlated with penicillin resistance in gonococci (12Ropp P.A. Hu M. Olesky M. Nicholas R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, this polymorphism was not found in any of our meningococcal strains (data not shown). We next transformed PCR-amplified penA alleles from eight PenI strains into the PenS strain LNP8013 to generate a set of isogenic meningococcal variants that differed only by penA alleles. All the transformants (TR) acquired the penA allele from the donor strain and showed reduced susceptibility to penicillin G, with an MIC greater than 0.125 μg/ml (Table I). Effects of penA Alterations on Its Own Expression—We studied the expression of different penA alleles by analyzing the expression of penA-lacZ transcriptional fusions. The penA coding sequence from strain LNP8013 was cloned upstream from a promoterless lacZ gene. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pAA8, also harbored the aph-3′ gene, encoding resistance to kanamycin and the region of the meningococcal chromosome located immediately downstream from the penA gene (Fig. 1A). Transformation and allelic replacement into the PenS strain, LNP8013, and two PenI strains, LNP16969 and LNP16635, allowed us to construct strains expressing lacZ under the control of the promoter region of the chromosomal penA1, penA21, and penA11 genes, respectively (Table I). The β-galactosidase activity reflected the transcription of these alleles. No significant differences were observed in β-galactosidase activities of the PenS and PenI strains in our experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). These results show that penA alterations do not affect the transcription of the penA gene and suggest that the transcriptional level of penA does not play a role in the PenI phenotype. Effects of penA Alterations on Binding of Penicillin to PBP2—We found that 10 times less [3H]benzylpenicillin bound to PBP2s from all PenI strains than to PBP2 from the PenS strain in crude membranes (PBP2s from PenI and PenS strains were saturated by 0.5 and 0.05 μg/ml [3H]benzylpenicillin, respectively) (Fig. 2). There was no apparent difference in the amount of [3H]benzylpenicillin bound to the other PBPs (PBP1 and PBP3) between the two types of strains, even in strains with higher MICs (saturation at 0.5 and 0.05 μg/ml [3H]benzylpenicillin for PBP1 and PBP3, respectively). In transformants, the acquisition of altered penA genes and reduced susceptibility to penicillin G were accompanied by changes in the binding of [3H]benzylpenicillin to PBP2s as in the donor strains but not to PBP1 and PBP3 (Fig. 2). We next studied the binding of penicillin G to purified PBP2s from PenS and PenI strains. penA alleles lacking the transmembrane-coding region (penA′) were amplified and cloned into pET28b (Novagen), creating genes coding for water-soluble forms of PBP2s with six C-terminal histidine residues. His6-tagged PBP2s were overproduced and purified to greater than 95% purity (data not shown). We then determined the binding affinity of the purified PBP2s for penicillin G in competition experiments with [3H]benzylpenicillin. We tested purified PBP2s from one PenS (S-PBP2) and five PenI (R-PBP2s) strains with different penicillin G MICs. The binding was scored by determining the concentration of non-radioactive penicillin G that inhibited the binding of saturating concentrations of [3H]benzypenicillin by 50% (inhibition concentration 50, IC50). R-PBP2s bound less penicillin G than S-PBP2. The IC50 values and the penicillin G MICs of the corresponding PenI transformants matched closely. However, no strict correlation was found between the IC50 values and the penicillin G MICs of the corresponding clinical PenI strains (Fig. 3). These data strongly suggest that alterations in the penA genes resulted in PBP2s with decreased affinity for penicillin G. However, the decreased affinity of PBP2s for penicillin G cannot solely explain the different penicillin G MICs of the clinical PenI isolates. Effects of penA Alterations on the Structure of Meningococcal PBP2—We sequenced the region of the penA gene that encodes the transpeptidase domain of PBP2 of a large collection of PenI clinical isolates obtained in France, England, and Spain as previously described (19Antignac A. Kriz P. Tzanakaki G. Alonso J.M. Taha M.K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of PBP2 (amino acids 298–581) were aligned, and meningococcal PenI strains showed 8.5–14.4% divergence (data not shown). Eight positions were modified in almost all PenI strains (Fig. 4). These altered positions were located around the conserved KTG motif. The corresponding residues in PBP2x from Streptococcus pneumoniae are part of the structure that forms the active site (33Dessen A. Mouz N. Gordon E. Hopkins J. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45106-45112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), particularly the β-sheets 3 and 4 (Fig. 4). This suggests that these amino acid substitutions are important in determining reduced affinity of PBP2 for penicillin G. We transformed the PenS strain LNP8013 with a PCR-amplified DNA fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the penA gene harboring these eight modifications. All the transformants obtained replaced their 3′ end of the penA gene by the transforming fragment and displayed reduced susceptibility to penicillin G with an MIC ranging from 0.38 to 1 μg/ml. Therefore, this penA fragment was able to confer resistance to a PenS strain, suggesting that only a small number of amino acid changes are important for decreasing the affinity of meningococcal PBP2 for penicillin G. Association between Bacterial Cell Wall Alterations and PBP2 Modifications—Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can be used to analyze bacterial cell walls and peptidoglycans. Infrared spectroscopy has been used to tentatively assign bacterial molecules according to their vibrational features (34Naumann D. Barnickel G. Bradaczek H. Labischinski H. Giesbrecht P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Spectra for the intact PenS strain (LNP8013) and its isogenic PenI derivatives (TR 16454, TR TH-41) were recorded and compared between wave numbers 4000 and 500 cm–1. Variations in peptidoglycan structure can be detected by comparing infrared absorption in the wave number regions corresp"

The enzyme displays MQH2:NO oxidoreductase (qNOR) activity, consists of a single subunit, and contains heme and nonheme iron in a 2:1 ratio. The combined results of EPR, resonance Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy show that one of the hemes is bis-His-coordinated low spin (gz = 3.015; gy = 2.226; gx = 1.45), whereas the other heme adopts a high spin configuration. The enzyme also contains one nonheme iron center, which in the oxidized enzyme is antiferromagnetically coupled to the high spin heme. This binuclear high spin heme/nonheme iron center is EPR-silent and the site of NO reduction. The reduced high spin heme is bound to a neutral histidine and can bind CO to form of a low spin complex. The oxidized high spin heme binds NO, yielding a ferric nitrosyl complex, the intermediate causing the commonly found substrate inhibition in NO reductases (K i(NO) = 7 μm). The qNOR as present in the membrane is, in contrast to the purified enzyme, quite thermostable, incubation at 100 °C for 86 min leading to 50% inhibition. The pure enzyme lacks heme b and instead contains stoichiometric amounts of hemes Op1 and Op2, ethenylgeranylgeranyl and hydroxyethylgeranylgeranyl derivatives of heme b, respectively.

Denitrification serves as an alternative to aerobic respiration to generate a proton motive force and is found in many prokaryotic microbes that thrive under anaerobic conditions. In denitrification, nitrate is reduced via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide to dinitrogen (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Studies on denitrification in other branches of the bacteria are scarce; the properties of the NO reductase from the Gram-positive Bacillus azotoformans have been reported recently (10Suharti S. Strampraad M.J. Schröder I. de Vries S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several archaea are capable of denitrification (e.g. the halophiles Haloferax denitrificans and Haloarcula marismortui and the hyperthermophiles Ferroglobus placidus and Pyrobaculum aerophilum) (11Afshar S.

These organisms were shown to reduce nitrate as in bacteria via nitrite, NO, and N2O to N2. P. aerophilum is a hyperthermophilic archaeon growing optimally at temperatures of 100 °C and can utilize nitrate or oxygen as terminal electron acceptors (11Afshar S. Kim C. Monbouquette H.G.

In P. aerophilum, both the nitrite reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are bound to the membrane, in contrast to Gram-negative bacteria (11Afshar S. Kim C. Monbouquette H.G. Schröder I.I. Appl.

Furthermore, P. aerophilum is also the only denitrifier identified so far in which menaquinol is the electron donor to all four denitrification reductases (15De Vries S. Schröder I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this paper, the purification of the NO reductase from P. aerophilum is described. NO reductases are integral membrane proteins and ancient members of the superfamily of heme-copper oxidases (16Castresana J. Moreira D. J. Mol.

Two conserved histidines are ligands to a low spin heme center, which serves as the site where electrons enter; one histidine residue acts as a ligand to a high spin heme center, and the remaining three histidine residues coordinate to FeB in the NO reductases or to CuB in the oxidase branch. The oxidized NO reductases contain a binuclear center consisting of a nonheme iron center, FeB, and a high spin heme group, ∼3.5 Å apart, connected through an oxo-bridge conveying a strong antiferromagnetic coupling (3Wasser I.M. de Vries S.

Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although NO reductases can reduce oxygen and oxidases can slowly reduce NO, both enzymes are optimized for their reaction with their natural substrates (5Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. J.

Whereas the properties of the binuclear active site are very similar for all three, the site of electron entry is quite different.

Friedrich B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Genes encoding the qNOR have been identified in denitrifying soil (R. eutropha) and marine bacteria (Synechocystis), in the genome of the denitrifying marine archaeon P. aerophilum and in nondenitrifying pathogenic micro-organisms such as Neisseria meningitides, Neisseria gonorrhea, and Corynebacterium diphteriae (4Cramm R.

Schröder I. de Vries S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This NOR uses menahydroquinone as electron donor, consists of two subunits (the smaller one containing CuA), and is called qCuANOR (3Wasser I.M. de Vries S. Moënne-Loccoz P. Schröder I. Karlin K.D. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1201-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Suharti S. Strampraad M.J. Schröder I. de Vries S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A qNOR has been purified for the first time as a histidinetagged enzyme from R. eutropha (4Cramm R. Pohlmann A. Friedrich B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme consists of a single subunit (84,000 kDa). The enzyme lacks heme c and contains heme b and nonheme iron in an approximately 2:1 ratio, respectively. The enzyme is inactive with cytochrome c as electron donor but showed a low menahydroquinone-dependent activity, classifying it as a qNOR. The genome of P. aerophilum contains a gene (Q8ZSS8) putatively encoding a qNOR (38Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Membranes of P. aerophilum contain a NO reductase oxidizing MQH2, thus classifying it as a functional qNOR (15De Vries S. Schröder I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This paper describes its purification and presents a structural and spectroscopic characterization. Whereas the purified enzyme is similar in several respects to the qNOR from R. eutropha, which was purified as the His-tagged mutant, the Pyrobaculum enzyme is the first NO reductase shown to contain modified hemes rather than b hemes (39Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21473-21479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Furthermore, the qNOR as present in the membrane is very thermostable. The modified hemes might be one of the factors contributing to thermostability of the qNOR. Cell Growth and Enzyme Purification—Cells from P. aerophilum were grown, harvested, and stored essentially as described previously (11Afshar S. Kim C. Monbouquette H.G. Schröder I.I. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3004-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Afshar S. Johnson E. de Vries S. Schröder I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5491-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared as follows. Frozen cells (30–60 g) were thawed and diluted five times with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgSO4, 2–4 mg of each DNase and RNase, and 0.5 mm PMSF. The suspension was homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The P. aerophilum cells were completely broken as a result of this hypotonic treatment. The broken cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The pellet, mainly cell debris, was discarded, and 0.5 mm PMSF was added to the supernatant. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. The pellet representing the membrane fraction was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm PMSF, and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. The resulting pellet was suspended in a small volume of the same buffer and stored at -40 °C until use. After thawing, the membranes were brought to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Immediately after the addition of 0.5 mm PMSF, the membranes were extracted with 1.0% dodecyl maltoside, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to the first CM-Sepharose column (V = 60 ml equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) plus 0.1% dodecyl maltoside); the flow-through was directly applied to a POROS-HQ column (V = 60 ml equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) plus 0.1% dodecyl maltoside). NO reductase activity was exclusively found in the flow-through, which was applied to a second CM-Sepharose column identical to the first one. After washing with 5 column volumes, a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) was applied over 5 column volumes. Fractions with more than 45% of the fraction with the maximal activity were pooled, concentrated about 20-fold, and subsequently diluted 1:1 with a buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) plus 0.1% dodecyl maltoside before application to a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (V = 6 ml equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) plus 0.1% dodecyl maltoside). After washing with 5 column volumes, a linear potassium phosphate gradient (0.1–1.0 m) was applied over 10 column volumes. Active fractions were selected as above, pooled, concentrated 10–20 times, diluted 10-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) plus 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, and concentrated again. This cycle of dilution and concentration was repeated once more. The pure qNOR was stored at -80 °C. Spectroscopic Methods—Optical spectra were recorded with an SLM Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer or a HP-8453 photodiode array spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were recorded with a Varian E-9 spectrometer at X-band frequency equipped with a home-built helium-flow system (41von Wachenfeldt C. de Vries S. van der Oost J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Prior to freezing, samples were made anaerobic to remove oxygen, which, in wide field scans, yields signals (e.g. at g = 1.5) that interfere with gx resonances of low spin heme centers. Resonance Raman spectroscopy was performed as described in Ref. 28Moënne-Loccoz P. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5147-5152Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar. Enzyme Activity—Polarographic enzyme assays of NO reductase were performed with the Clark electrode essentially as reported before (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Rates were determined from the steepest slope of the curved activity trace. Briefly, the reaction was performed in a closed 1.4-ml chamber at 54.5 °C containing an anaerobic buffer of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, which was saturated with a 5% NO, 95% N2 stock, yielding ∼55 μm dissolved NO. The reaction may be started with membranes or pure qNOR as well as with the substrate MQH2 (65–300 μm) or with ascorbate (10 mm)/phenazine ethosulfate (100 μm), in all cases yielding essentially the same rates. The Clark electrode is stable up to at least 93 °C, the highest temperature tested. A methanolic solution of menaquinol was prepared by reducing menaquinone using a 10% molar excess of sodium borohydride under a nitrogen atmosphere. To determine the temperature stability of qNOR in membranes or of the pure enzyme, incubations were performed up to 3 h at 100 or 75 °C or up to 24 h at 56 or 23 °C. Incubation for more than 3 h at 75 or 100 °C did not yield reproducible results, and hence those longer incubation times have been omitted from Fig. 8. PMSF (1 mm) was added in all incubations to prevent proteolytic degradation. Analytical Methods—SDS-PAGE was performed as described in Ref. 6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. NO reductase samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 6 °C and were not boiled in SDS buffer to prevent aggregation of the hydrophobic protein. To obtain (almost) complete denaturation, 5 m urea was added to the sample prior to loading. For N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, NO reductase (5 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described in Ref. 6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by means of automatic Edman degradation at the NWO protein sequencing facility at the University of Leiden. The amount of heme was determined using the pyridine hemochrome method, and nonheme iron was determined colorimetrically with the ferene method (cf. Ref. 10Suharti S. Strampraad M.J. Schröder I. de Vries S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein was determined at a temperature of 60 °C, allowing unfolding of the thermostable proteins using the BCA protein assay reagent of Pierce and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The native molecular mass of the purified NO was determined using Superdex 200 HR 10/30-column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in an eluent containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Extraction of hemes and reversed phase chromatography with a Novapak C18 column (plus guard column) were performed with the eluents as described in Ref. 39Lübben M.

Purification—Membranes from P. aerophilum contain a NO reductase, which uses MQH2 as substrate and thus belongs to the subclass of qNORs (15De Vries S. Schröder I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Hendriks J. Oubrie A. Castresana J. Urbani A. Gemeinhardt S. Saraste M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This qNOR was purified from P. aerophilum membranes after solubilization with 1.0% dodecyl maltoside, extracting ∼85% of the NOR activity (Table I). The solubilized enzyme did bind to CM-Sepharose, however, only after application to a second CM-Sepharose column. We suggest that because the genome of P. aerophilum encodes many (putative) genes with high pI values (average pI of 8.4–8.5) (38Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the qNOR is excluded from the first CM-Sepharose column. The flow-through of the first CM-Sepharose column was subsequently applied to an anion exchanger, POROS-HQ. As expected on the basis of its calculated pI (9.4), NO reductase eluted again in the flow-through, but other denitrification enzymes did bind; their purification will be described elsewhere. NO reductase activity bound to the second CM-Sepharose column and eluted at 175–260 mm NaCl. Pooled fractions were applied to hydroxyapatite chromatography. Active enzyme eluted between 0.9 and 1.0 m phosphate. After these two chromatographic steps, the enzyme was purified ∼54-fold with respect to the membranes and was found to be essentially pure on the basis of its SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 1 and Table I), prosthetic group content (see below), and its chromatographic behavior on gel filtration.Table ISummary of the purification of the P. aerophilum NO reductasePreparationTotal proteinSpecific activity at 54.5 °CYieldPurificationmgμmol NO/mg min%Membranes43750.061001.00ExtractaHigh speed supernatant after the dodecyl maltoside extraction of membranes.

Activities obtained with Asc/phenazine ethosulfate were essentially the same Open table in a new tab The SDS-PAGE profile of the urea-denatured purified (Fig. 1, lane 2) protein shows a main band around 75–80 kDa, in agreement with the molecular mass of 78.8 kDa calculated from the DNA sequence (38Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The relatively faint bands at ∼41–43 kDa are not impurities but represent remaining partially folded states of the enzyme. The bulk of the NO reductase migrates at this position when urea is omitted during denaturation (Fig. 1, lane 3). The N termini of the bands at 41–43 and 75 kDa were all blocked as determined after blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride paper. Direct sequencing of the nonblotted enzyme preparation did yield a sequence, corresponding to ∼1% of the total amount of protein. The 30 N-terminal residues obtained, APAAGVA... QLFP, correspond precisely to residues 122–151 of the published sequence of gene Q8ZSS8 (38Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is suggested that the peptide starting at residue 122 represents a minor (e.g. proteolytic) fragment and that the majority of the protein is blocked at the N terminus. Chromatography on Superdex 200 yielded a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 127 ± 7 kDa (not shown). Assuming that the qNOR like other membrane proteins binds one dodecyl maltoside micelle of about 40–50 kDa (42Neugebauer J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the purified NO reductase is most likely a single subunit monomeric enzyme. The total heme and nonheme iron contents of the pure protein were 26.6 and 16.1 nmol/mg, respectively, yielding a stoichiometry of enzyme/heme/nonheme iron of 1:2.13:1.27. The prosthetic group content corresponds to a protein of ∼75 kDa based on heme content and is close to that calculated on the basis of the DNA-derived protein sequence (25.4 and 12.7 nmol/mg, assuming two hemes and one nonheme iron, respectively, and a mass of 78.8 kDa) confirming its high purity (95% on the basis of heme). A final indication of purity and homogeneity of the qNOR was the observation that the heme/protein ratio measured as the absorbance ratio at 410 nm/280 nm was constant over the peak eluting from the hydroxyapatite column; neither this ratio nor the specific activity increased after subsequent chromatography with CM-Sepharose or Superdex 200 (data not shown). We conclude that the qNOR is essentially pure and contains one nonheme iron center and two heme centers. Identity of the Hemes—The identity of the heme groups of purified NOR was determined with the pyridine hemochrome method. Heme c was absent. The pyridine hemochrome absorbance maximum was at 555 nm, which corresponds to a shift of ∼1 nm to the blue with respect to pyridine hemochrome obtained from myoglobin. Reversed phase chromatography of heme extracts of the pure enzyme identified only very small amounts of heme b and the presence of two hydrophobic modified forms of heme b (Fig. 2) i"

Despite its importance, the gene and/or the protein responsible for this activity has not yet been identified. Here we report the purification, identification, and biochemical characterization of an enzymatic activity that synthesizes SM in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SM synthase-like activity was found secreted in the culture medium of P. aeruginosa, strains PA01 and PAK, whereas it could not be detected in cultures of Escherichia coli. From the medium of PAK cultures, SM synthase was purified through sequential chromatographic columns. After separation on polyacrylamide-SDS gels and visualization by silver staining, the purified enzyme showed two bands, one of ∼75 kDa and one of 30–35 kDa. Interestingly, the highly purified SM synthase preparation also showed neutral sphingomyelinase activity. We therefore investigated whether the protein we purified as SM synthase could actually be the previously identified PlcH, a 78-kDa phospholipase C known to hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine and SM in P. aeruginosa. First, the purified SM synthase preparation contained a 78-kDa protein that reacted with monoclonal antibodies raised against purified PlcH. Second, purified PlcH showed SM synthase activity. Third, using different knockout mutant strains for the PlcH operon, PlcH was found to be necessary for SM synthase activity in P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, SM synthase activity was specific to the Pseudomonas PlcH as other bacterial phospholipases did not display SM synthase activity. Biochemical studies on the Pseudomonas SM synthase confirmed that it is a transferase, similar to the mammalian enzyme, that specifically recognizes the choline head-group and the primary hydroxyl on ceramide. This SM synthase did not have reverse transferase activity. In conclusion, the Pseudomonas PlcH also exerts SM synthase activity; therefore, for the first time, we have identified a structural gene for a SM synthase.

In particular, the biochemical synthesis of SM occurs via the action of a phosphatidylcholine:ceramide choline phosphotransferase (sphingomyelin synthase; SM synthase), which transfers the phosphorylcholine moiety from phosphatidylcholine (PC) onto the primary hydroxyl of ceramide, thus producing SM and diacylglycerol (DAG) (1Ullman M.D.R.

Acta. 1984; 793: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Important biological roles have been clearly established for ceramide and DAG (substrate and product of SM synthase) in the regulation of fundamental cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis (for reviews, see Refs. 3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 4Kolesnick R. J. Clin.

Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the cellular role of SM synthase goes beyond the production of SM. In fact, SM synthase could represent a key mechanism in the control of the cellular levels of ceramide and DAG and therefore would influence functions mediated by these bioactive lipids. Indeed, a number of studies have documented regulation of SM synthase activity. It has been shown, for instance, that activity of SM synthase is enhanced in conditions of increased proliferation such as regenerating rat liver (9Miro-Obradors M.-J. Osada J. Aylagas H. Sanchez-Vegazo I. Palacios-Alaiz E. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), SV-40 transformation of human fibroblasts (10Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Additionally, it has been shown that SM synthase activity is inhibited by tumor necrosis factor α in Kym-1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells before the onset of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis and that this inhibition is a caspase-dependent event (13Bourteele S.

Finally, DAG formed through activation of SM synthase has been associated with activation of NF-κB in SV-40-transformed human fibroblasts (14Luberto C. Yoo D.S. Suidan H.S. Bartoli G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14760-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite the biological importance of SM synthase, understanding of the molecular mechanisms of its regulation is limited by the fact that no successful purification of the protein has been achieved and the gene(s) encoding for this activity remain elusive.Although sphingolipids are primarily present in eukaryotes, some prokaryotic cells express and secrete enzymes with sphingolipid-metabolizing capability. For example, the bacteria Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus produce and secrete a phospholipase C that recognizes SM as substrate at neutral pH, and this enzyme is responsible for their hemolytic activity (15Yamada A.

Importantly, analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) from B. cereus has led to the identification of at least three homologous genes: two in mammalian cells (nSMase1/lysoPAF-PLC and nSMase2) (17Tomiuk S.

The products of these genes have all proven to hydrolyze SM in vitro at neutral pH and therefore to have neutral SMase activity.Other bacteria known to express and secrete sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes are Pseudomonas species. SMases have been isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20Ostroff R.M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), Pseudomonas fluorescens (21Sueyoshi N. Kita K. Okino N. Sakaguchi K. Nakamura T. Ito M. J.

Immun. 1990; 58: 4020-4029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although sequence and substrate specificity might be different. The SMase from P. aeruginosa (PlcH) is a phospholipase C that recognizes both SM and PC as substrates, whereas the SMase from P. fluorescens only recognizes SM. In addition, an alkaline ceramidase (CDase) has been purified, characterized and identified from the culture media of P. aeruginosa AN17 (23Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Importantly this bacterial CDase shares significant homology to the mammalian mitochondrial CDase (24Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol.

We have purified and characterized this bacterial SM synthase activity and have found it to correspond to the previously identified PlcH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All columns used for protein purification were from Amersham Biosciences. BCA protein assay kit and Triton X-100 were from Pierce. Phosphatidylcholine (brain) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and NBD-C6-ceramide from Molecular Probes. Thin layer chromatography silica plates (60 Å) were from Whatman. Sample concentrators Microcon Centrifugal Filter Devices (YM-10) were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Silver staining kit was purchased from OWL Separations Systems (Portsmouth, NH). Lennox L Broth Base was from Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom). Ammonium sulfate, MES monohydrate, EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma.Cultures of Pseudomonas for Purification—A starting culture of P. aeruginosa cells, PAK strain (kind gift from Dr. Joan Olson, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), from a frozen stock was incubated with vigorous shaking at 30 °C in LB for 14 h. A 1:500 dilution of the starting culture was incubated at 30 °C overnight in 6 liter of synthetic medium containing 8.2 mm NH4Cl, 2.5 mm K2HPO4, 74.9 mm NaCl, 21.8 mm glucose, 2.5 g/liter LB, pH 7.2. The culture was centrifuged at 6500 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate for 3–4 h at 4 °C with gentle swirling, and subsequently centrifuged at 2500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Triton X-100). The suspension was clarified through a 0.45-μm syringe filter.Butyl-Sepharose—The filtered solution was adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and applied to a 20-ml HiTrap butyl-Sepharose column (1.2 mg of proteins/ml of column) previously equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A + 1 m ammonium sulfate) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The bound proteins were washed with 5 column volumes of buffer B at 1 ml/min flow rate. Proteins were eluted by decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration from 1 m to zero applying a 6-column volume linear gradient of buffer A. Fractions of 3 ml were collected, and SM synthase activity (50 μl/fraction) and protein assay were performed. The butyl-Sepharose column was then washed with 5 column volumes of double distilled water (ddH2O) at a rate of 2 ml/min, and fractions of 5 ml were collected. Water wash fractions were also tested for SM synthase activity and protein concentration, and fractions with peak activity were combined with fractions with peak activity from the elution step of the butyl-Sepharose.Octyl-Sepharose—Pooled fractions with peak activity from the butyl-Sepharose column were adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and loaded on a 10-ml octyl-Sepharose column (0.7 mg of proteins/ml of column) previously equilibrated with buffer B. The loosely associated proteins were washed at 0.5 ml/min for 3 column volumes of buffer B, followed by a 2.5-column volume step elution at 55% buffer B. Proteins were further eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 1.5-column volume linear gradient of buffer B (from 55 to 0%), and the column was further washed with 2.4 column volumes. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and SM synthase activity (50 μl) and protein concentration were determined.Blue Sepharose—Fractions with peak activity from the octyl-Sepharose column were pooled, adjusted to pH 6.0, and loaded (0.3 mg of proteins/ml of column) at 0.5 ml/min on a 2-ml Blue Sepharose high performance column equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Triton X-100). A step elution with 7.5 column volumes of 12% buffer D (buffer C + 1.5 m NaCl) was followed by an increasing linear gradient of NaCl (from 12 to 75% buffer D) and a column wash with 75% buffer D of 11 column volumes each. One-ml fractions were collected, and the SM synthase activity (50 μl) and protein concentration were determined. The fractions with peak activity were then pooled, desalted, and buffer-exchanged with buffer E (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Triton X-100) on PD-10 desalting columns.Mono P—The desalted, buffer-exchanged fractions were applied to a 1-ml Mono P column equilibrated with Buffer E. The column was washed at 0.5 ml/min with 7 column volumes of Buffer E, and then eluted by decreasing the pH with Buffer F (1:8 dilution of Polybuffer 74, pH 4.0). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and neutralized with concentrated Tris buffer, pH 7.4–9.0. SM synthase activity (50 μl) was determined.Mono S—The fractions with peak activity from the Mono P column were combined and adjusted to 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, then loaded onto a 1 ml Mono S column previously equilibrated with Buffer G (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Triton X-100). A column wash at 0.5 ml/min with 7 column volumes of Buffer G preceded the elution step with Buffer H (Buffer G + 1.5 m NaCl) consisting of a linear gradient (0–0.75 m NaCl) of 10 column volumes and 20 column volumes of 1.5 m NaCl. One-ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1.5 m Tris, pH 9.0. SM synthase assay was performed on 100 μl/fraction, and active fractions were concentrated on YM-10 Microcon centrifugal filters, separated on an 8% Tris-glycine gel, and visualized by silver staining.SM Synthase Assay—The SM synthase assay was performed using aliquots (50–100 μl depending on the column) from the fractions of interest. The substrate was prepared as a 2× mixture of 40 μm NBD-C6-ceramide and 240 μm PC resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA by sonication and vortexing until clear. The substrate was diluted 1:1 with the protein, and the incubation was carried out for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice by addition of a volume of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) 3 times the assay volume. After vortexing, the phases were clarified by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min. The lower phase was transferred to new tubes, dried down, and lipids were resuspended with 30 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). NBD-C6-sphingomyelin was separated from the substrate by thin layer chromatography in chloroform, methanol, and 15 mm CaCl2 (60: 35:8). Fluorescence was measured by using a Storm 860 Imaging Analysis System from Amersham Biosciences. Data were analyzed using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences.Characterization Experiments—PlcHR2 was purified as previously described (26Stonehouse M.J. Cota-Gomez A. Parker S.K. Martin W.E. Hankin J.A. Murphy R.C. Chen W. Lim K.B. Hackett M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and diluted to 0.1 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 for the SM synthase assay. The reaction mixture contained 16.7 pg/μl of purified protein, 75 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 μm NBD-C6-ceramide, and 120 μm PC in a total volume of 100 μl and was carried out for 15 and 30 min at 30 °C. Formation of NBD-C6-SM was determined as previously indicated. In some experiments, radioactive PC was used instead of fluorescent C6-ceramide as the labeled substrate. Briefly, a 2× substrate mixture containing 200 μm C6-ceramide and 240 μm [14C-choline]PC (specific activity of ∼45 nCi/nmol) was resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4. The substrate was diluted 1:1 with the protein (200 μl final reaction volume) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the dark. The reaction was stopped with 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.2 ml of ddH2O. After vortexing, the samples were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min to separate the phases. The lower phase was collected and dried down, then resuspended with 40 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and separated by thin layer chromatography in chloroform, methanol, and 15 mm CaCl2 (60:35:8). The plate was analyzed by autoradiography, the [14C-choline]C6-SM band was identified by comparison with an authentic standard, and the radioactivity associated with the band of interest was quantified by scintillation counting.Neutral SMase Activity—Neutral SMase activity was determined using radiolabeled substrate delivered in a mixed micelle system. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 nmol of sphingomyelin, 100,000 cpm of 14C-labeled sphingomyelin and an aliquot from the fractions to be tested (10–50 μl) in a final volume of 200 μl. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.2 ml of water. After vortexing and centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, 400 μl from the upper phase were counted in 4 ml of scintillation fluid.PC-PLC Activity—Purified PlcHR2 (40–140 pg/μl) was incubated with 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (p-NPPC) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 25% glycerol, in a total volume of 200 μl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in a 96-well plate, and production of the chromogenic product p-nitrophenyl was measured at 405 nm (26Stonehouse M.J. Cota-Gomez A. Parker S.K. Martin W.E.

Microbiol. 2002; 46: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).BCA Protein Determination—Protein concentration was determined according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Pierce).Western Blotting—The Western blot analysis for PlcHR2 was performed as previously described (26Stonehouse M.J. Cota-Gomez A. Parker S.K. Martin W.E. Hankin J.A. Murphy R.C. Chen W. Lim K.B. Hackett M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 7% PAGE-SDS gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose at 80 V for 1 h. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween, and blotted with monoclonal antibodies (H952, 1:250 dilution) in the blocking solution. After extensive washing, the membranes were blotted with secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:4000 dilution) in blocking medium for 1 h. The signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSPurification of SM Synthase from P. aeruginosa—Given that P. aeruginosa produces and secretes enzymes with sphingolipid-metabolizing activities such as neutral sphingomyelinase and neutral/alkaline ceramidase, we wondered whether this bacterium also produced SM synthase activity. Indeed we found that two different strains of P. aeruginosa, PA01 and PAK (but not other bacteria such as Escherichia coli) produced and secreted in the medium an enzymatic activity able to synthesize SM using phosphatidylcholine and ceramide as substrates (data not shown). The activity found in the medium from PAK cultures was greater than that measured from PA01; therefore, the protocol was optimized for the purification of the secreted SM synthase activity from Pseudomonas using the PAK strain.SM synthase present in the medium of an overnight culture was concentrated by incubation with 60% ammonium sulfate, and then the precipitated proteins were resuspended in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5. The suspension was filtered, adjusted to a final concentration of 1 m ammonium sulfate, and subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a butyl-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with the same buffer containing 1 m ammonium sulfate (buffer B) (Fig. 1A). In these conditions, most of the activity was found to bind to the matrix whereas the bulk of the proteins (∼84% of the total proteins), represented mainly by small size proteins and/or peptides, were found in the flow-through. Elution of the activity was observed in two distinct peaks upon decrease of the ammonium sulfate concentration, a first peak at ∼0.43 m ammonium sulfate and a second peak at ∼100 mm ammonium sulfate. Moreover, when the column was regenerated with a wash of double distilled water, ∼30% of the initial SM synthase activity and 10% of proteins were eluted from the column. The fractions containing the two peaks of activity were combined with the activity recovered in the water wash, and the buffer and salt concentration were adjusted to 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 1 m ammonium sulfate. The total volume was applied to an octyl-Sepharose column (Fig. 1B) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The SM synthase activity was found to bind to the column, as did most of the other proteins. Elution of SM synthase was then achieved by decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration similar to what was observed with the butyl-Sepharose column. The bulk of the proteins eluted at ∼50 mm ammonium sulfate (although this value has been at times lower), whereas detachment of SM synthase from the column was mostly obtained at zero salt. This column therefore almost completely desalted the preparation obtained from the previous column and allowed an additional step in the purification process (2–3-fold). Also in this case, ∼20% of the loaded activity and proteins were still bound to the matrix after the elution step. The water-eluted enzyme was not purified further, as it behaved differently in the next column from the one eluted with 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, and no salt, underscoring the possibility of the existence of SM synthase in different isoforms or at different stages of denaturation and/or aggregation.Fractions with peak activity were pooled (typically fractions 228–238; Fig. 1B), the pH was adjusted to 6.0, and the total volume was applied to a Blue Sepharose affinity column previously equilibrated with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0 (Fig. 1C). The bulk of the proteins did not bind to the column, whereas SM synthase did, and it was eluted at 0.4 m NaCl as a single peak by application of an increasing linear gradient of salt (from 0.18 m to 1.13 m NaCl). To elute the SM synthase activity in the middle of the gradient as a defined peak without too much tailing, it was important that the sample that was loaded had a conductivity between 0.6 and 3 millisiemens. In this step of purification, SM synthase was enriched ∼20–25-fold.Next, fractions containing peak activity were pooled, desalted, and buffer-exchanged with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using PD-10 columns. The enzyme was further purified by application to a Mono P chromatofocusing column (Fig. 1D) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted by decreasing the pH with an increasing linear gradient of Poly-buffer 74 adjusted to pH 4.0. The isoelectric point of the protein was determined to be ∼4.7–4.9. Because the low amount of protein applied to this and to the next column (Mono S) did not allow an accurate protein determination in the fractions, the efficacy of the columns was determined by silver staining.Fractions at pH 4.7–4.9 were pooled together (typically a total of 2 ml), adjusted to pH 4.0 with sodium acetate (at a final concentration of 20 mm), and applied to a cation exchange Mono S column (Fig. 1E). In these conditions, SM synthase bound to the column, and it was eluted with 0.34 m NaCl, applied as an increasing linear gradient. By analysis with silver staining of the proteins separated on a SDS gel, fractions with peak SM synthase activity contained only two bands, one at ∼75 kDa and one at ∼30 kDa, and both correlated with the activity (data not shown).Purified SM Synthase Also Shows N-SMase Activity— P. aeruginosa PA01 is known to express and secrete a N-SMase activity (encoded by the plcH gene) for which the theoretical isoelectric point and molecular mass are ∼5.0 and 78 kDa, respectively (20Ostroff R.M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), similar to what was observed with the purified SM synthase. Because SM synthase activity was observed in both PAK and PA01 strains, and the gene encoding for N-SMase activity in PAK is identical to the plcH gene in PA01, 2M. L. Vasil, unpublished observations. we wondered whether the purified preparation of SM synthase from PAK also contained N-SMase activity. To this end, N-SMase activity was measured in the fractions collected from the Mono P chromatofocusing column (Fig. 2A). As shown in the figure, not only was N-SMase activity detected in the fractions but this activity mimicked the profile of the SM synthase activity (Fig. 1D). In contrast, no significant acid SMase activity was detected (data not shown). N-SMase activity was then measured in fractions collected from the last column of the purification protocol, the cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 2B). Also in this case, N-SMase activity paralleled exactly SM synthase activity.Fig. 2Determination of neutral SMase activity in highly purified SM synthase. Aliquots of fractions from the Mono P (A) and Mono S (B) columns were tested for N-SMase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the existence of a N-SMase in the highly purified SM synthase preparation, a Western blot analysis was performed on the fractions with peak activity for SM synthase from a Blue Sepharose column using monoclonal antibodies raised against purified PlcH from P. aeruginosa, strain PA01 (26Stonehouse M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2015598028,"BEHAB (brain-enriched hyaluronan-binding protein)/brevican is the most abundant chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix of the adult rat brain. BEHAB/brevican expression is up-regulated coincident with glial cell proliferation and/or motility, including during early central nervous system development and in invasive glioma. An understanding of the molecular interactions that mediate BEHAB/brevican function is still in its infancy because of the existence of several BEHAB/brevican isoforms, each of which may mediate different functions. Here, we describe a novel BEHAB/brevican isoform, B/b130, and demonstrate that it is neither the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked splice variant of BEHAB/brevican nor a cleavage product of the full-length protein (B/b150). B/b130 is an underglycosylated isoform of BEHAB/brevican, lacking glycosaminoglycan chains as well as most of the sugars that invest B/b150. B/b130 localizes exclusively to the particulate fraction of rat brain and associates with the cell membrane by a previously undescribed calcium-independent mechanism. In addition, B/b130 is the major isoform of BEHAB/brevican that is up-regulated in a rat model of invasive glioma and may therefore contribute to the invasive ability of glioma cells. Further understanding of BEHAB/brevican isoforms will advance our knowledge of the function of this ECM component and may help identify new potential therapeutic targets for primary brain tumors.

The ECM 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CRP, complement regulatory protein; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; HA, hyaluronic acid; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phopholipase C; En, embryonic day n; Pn, postnatal day n. of the central nervous system is composed of a hyaluronic acid scaffold invested with proteoglycans and nonfibrous glycoproteins (1Celio M.R. Blumcke I. Brain Res. Rev. 1994; 19: 128-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), but it lacks the typical fibrous proteins found in other tissues (2Bignami A. Hosley M. Dahl D. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 188: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Sanes J.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 491-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Proteins that interact with this HA-based matrix organize the central nervous system ECM and regulate many of the developmental processes in the central nervous system, including cell motility, neurite extension, synaptogenesis, and synaptic stabilization (for reviews see Refs. 4Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 5Hartmann U. Maurer P.

The lecticans, a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (7Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) including aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and BEHAB (brain-enriched HA-binding protein)/brevican, interact with HA in the central nervous system. Each lectican is expressed in the central nervous system in a temporally and spatially regulated manner (8Milev P. Maurel P. Chiba A. Mevissen M. Popp S. Yamaguchi Y. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Two of the lecticans, neurocan and BEHAB/brevican, are expressed exclusively in the central nervous system, the latter being the most prominent chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the adult rat brain (9Yamaguchi Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar). Like all of the lecticans, the structure of BEHAB/brevican includes an N-terminal HA-binding domain, a middle chondroitin sulfate attachment region and a C-terminal selectin-like domain consisting of an epidermal growth factor-like, a C-type lectin, and a complement regulatory protein-like domains (10Yamaguchi Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Apart from HA, bound by the N-terminal domain of BEHAB/brevican, two other binding partners have been described. BEHAB/brevican binds the ECM glycoprotein tenascin-R and a subset of membrane sulfated glycolipids via its C-type lectin domain, both through calcium-dependent mechanisms (11Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegard D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Miura R. Aspberg A.

BEHAB/brevican mRNA expression increases over the course of rat brain development, reaching a plateau in adulthood (13Seidenbecher C.I. Gundelfinger E.D. Bockers T.M. Trotter J. Kreutz M.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The roles proposed for BEHAB/brevican in normal developing brain include regulation of cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth and a role in synaptic plasticity (14Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miura R. Ethell I.M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our studies, demonstrating a spike in BEHAB/brevican expression early in development in the ventricular zone coincident with gliogenesis (16Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an increase in BEHAB/brevican expression during reactive gliosis after a stab injury (17Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 157: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), have suggested a role for BEHAB/brevican in glial cell proliferation and motility. Consistent with these results, BEHAB/brevican expression is also dramatically up-regulated in surgical samples of glioma, notoriously invasive primary tumors of the central nervous system, as well as in a rodent glioma model (18Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar). We have further shown that BEHAB/brevican up-regulation and its subsequent proteolytic processing contribute to the invasive phenotype of glioma (19Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nutt C.L. Zerillo C.A. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7056-7059PubMed Google Scholar). An understanding of the molecular interactions and mechanisms through which these many functions are mediated is still incomplete. One of the difficulties in characterizing the functions of BEHAB/brevican is the molecular complexity of this protein. Two isoforms of BEHAB/brevican are generated by alternative splicing, a full-length, secreted protein and a C-terminally truncated splice variant (21Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Rauch U. Fassler R. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The latter lacks the entire C-terminal domain, which is replaced by an attachment sequence for a GPI anchor. The middle region of BEHAB/brevican contains a conserved cleavage site that is proteolyzed by members of the ADAMTS (disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family of proteases (22Matthews R.T.

The full-length, secreted BEHAB/brevican protein (∼145–150 kDa), as well as its 90- and 50-kDa cleavage products, are detected in the adult rat brain (19Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, glycosylation variants of BEHAB/brevican have led to its characterization as a “part time proteoglycan,” because glycoforms are found both with and without chondroitin sulfate GAG chains (9Yamaguchi Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the different isoforms of BEHAB/brevican created by alternative splicing, proteolytic cleavage, or differential glycosylation may interact differently with the cell surface and with other ECM components. To investigate the functional role of BEHAB/brevican, we first need to gain a more complete understanding of its molecular heterogeneity. Here, we have identified a novel isoform of BEHAB/brevican, B/b130, with a developmental expression pattern that differs from all previously described BEHAB/brevican isoforms. Also unlike the previously described BEHAB/brevican isoforms, B/b130 associates with the cell membrane by a calcium-independent mechanism. Our studies indicate that B/b130 is generated by a post-translational process that gives rise to an underglycosylated or unglycosylated form of BEHAB/brevican. Importantly, B/b130 is the major BEHAB/brevican isoform upregulated in an experimental model of invasive glioma. Our work suggests that in addition to alternative splicing and cleavage, differentially glycosylated isoforms of BEHAB/brevican may play unique roles in central nervous system development and glioma. Subcellular Fractions from Rat Brain—To analyze the developmental expression of BEHAB/brevican, female Lewis rats of several postnatal ages were deeply anesthetized under halothane and sacrificed by decapitation. Embryos of 14–18 gestational days were quickly removed from terminally anesthetized pregnant rats onto ice and decapitated. Forebrains were quickly dissected on ice and homogenized in 10 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.32 m sucrose (TS buffer) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was centrifuged at 950 × g for 10 min, and the nuclear pellet (P1) was washed once by rapid rehomogenization in TS buffer and centrifuged as above. The post-nuclear supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to provide total particulate and soluble fractions. For further subcellular fractionation from adult rat forebrain samples, the postnuclear supernatant, obtained as indicated above, was centrifuged according to established protocols (25Rodriguez de Lores A. Alberici M. De Robertis E. J. Neurochem. 1967; 14: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), yielding a mitochondrial/synaptosomal pellet (P2), a light microsomal pellet (P3), and a final soluble fraction. To separate mitochondrial and synaptosomal membranes, the P2 pellet was resolved in a discontinuous sucrose gradient as previously described (26Jones D.H. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To prepare the subcellular fractions for protein electrophoresis, aliquots of membrane and soluble fractions were equilibrated at a final total protein concentrations of 1–2 mg/ml in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 8 (CH buffer), containing 10 mm EDTA and treated with 0.25 unit/ml of protease-free chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris (EC 4.2.2.4; Seikagaku) for 8 h at 37 °C. Chondroitinase reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in the presence of 1× gel loading buffer. Release of BEHAB/Brevican Isoforms from Brain Membranes—To characterize the association of different BEHAB/brevican isoforms with the cell membrane, total membranes (1Celio M.R. Blumcke I. Brain Res. Rev. 1994; 19: 128-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2Bignami A. Hosley M. Dahl D. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 188: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar mg total protein/ml) obtained from rat forebrain were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA or 0.2% Triton X-100, for 1 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, the membranes were resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate at pH 11.3 for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the membranes were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 20 min. Released BEHAB/brevican was recovered in the supernatant, and the membranes containing retained BEHAB/brevican were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer and resuspended in the same initial volume. All of the samples were finally equilibrated with CH buffer and treated with chondroitinase ABC prior to protein electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation studies, the membranes were extracted for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.6% w/v CHAPS and further processed according to standard protocols. PI-PLC Treatment and Detergent Extraction with Triton X-114 —To reveal the GPI-anchored isoform of BEHAB/brevican, rat brain microsomal membranes were resuspended in CH buffer with 0.25 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC and 1 unit/ml of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus (EC 3.1.4.10; Sigma) for 8 h at 37 °C. The samples were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE. To determine the electrophoretic mobility of GPI-anchored BEHAB/brevican before releasing its GPI anchor, we performed a protein extraction on chondroitinased rat brain membranes using the detergent Triton X-114 (Sigma). This detergent allows the separation of water-soluble membrane-associated proteins from hydrophobic or GPI-bound proteins, according to a previously established procedure (27Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the microsomal membranes were resuspended in CH buffer at 2 mg of total protein/ml and detergent-extracted for 60 min on ice by adding precondensed 10% v/v Triton X-114 to a final concentration of 2% v/v. Solubilized proteins were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation of the extract at 20,800 × g for 20 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. This supernatant was warmed at 37 °C, producing an aqueous phase and a detergent-containing phase. Both phases were then isolated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature and exhaustively washed to avoid cross-contamination. Extracted proteins in the detergent phase were precipitated with acidic ethanol at –20 °C, washed with cold acetone, and resolubilized in a small volume of CH buffer in the presence of 0.6% w/v CHAPS. Samples from the aqueous and detergent phases were then treated with PI-PLC for 8 h at 37 °C before SDS-PAGE.

Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with a pCDNA3.1 vector containing a cDNA insert encoding green fluorescent protein (generously provided by Dr. Tom Hughes, Yale University). Stable transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Oli-neu cells were transiently transfected with the same rat BEHAB/brevican cDNA. In addition, the full-length rat BEHAB/brevican cDNA was subcloned in a pCDNA3.1/V5-His6 vector to produce V5/His6-tagged BEHAB/brevican, which was also transiently transfected in Oli-neu cells. In all cases, the expression of the desired transgene was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (19Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of BEHAB/brevican protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, as described below. Preparation of Cell Membranes and Immunocytochemistry—The Cells were routinely collected 24–48 h post-transfection and homogenized in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free) and 2 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science). The total membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 30 min and prepared for protein electrophoresis. For live immunocytochemical staining of transfected Oli-neu cells, the cultures were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates for 24–48 h before transfection with the V5/His6-tagged full-length BEHAB/brevican cDNA. Unfixed, unpermeabilized cultures were rinsed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) without serum and then incubated with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cultures were again rinsed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, rinsed, and then incubated for 60 min with Alexa-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). The cultures were finally rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, briefly counterstained with propidium iodide (0.2 μg/ml), and prepared for fluorescence microscopy. Intracranial Grafts—Intracranial grafts of stably transfected CNS-1 cells were performed as described previously (18Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested at 80% confluence, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in injection buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 μg/ml MgCl2, 1 μg/ml CaCl2, and 0.1% w/v d(+)-glucose) at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/μl. Cell suspension (3 μl) was injected stereotaxically into the thalamus of 45-day-old female Lewis rats over a 5-min period. The animals were returned to their cages and monitored for signs of compromised neurological functions during a 2-week period. After 2 weeks, the rats were terminally anesthetized and decapitated, and the brains were quickly dissected, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –70 °C for further processing. The brains were grossly sectioned, and the samples were obtained from the visualized tumors as well as from the equivalent regions of the contralateral side of the brain, where tumors were not detected. Soluble and particulate fractions of normal rat brain and rat brain gliomas were prepared as described above. Glycosidase Treatments—To remove O-linked oligosaccharides present in BEHAB/brevican isoforms, chondroitinased samples were equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7, and treated with 20 milliunits/ml O-glycosidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae (EC 3.2.1.97; Roche Applied Science) and 100 milliunits/ml sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (EC 3.2.1.18; Roche Applied Science). Similarly, N-linked oligosaccharides were removed by incubation with 100 units/ml glycopeptidase F from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (EC 3.5.1.52; Sigma). In all cases, the samples were incubated with the enzymes for 8 h at 37 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors. Enzyme digestions were stopped by boiling the samples in 1× gel loading buffer. Western Blot Analysis—The samples were electrophoresed on reducing 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (B6) produced against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GAG attachment region (amino acids 506–529) of rat BEHAB/brevican. Alternatively, BEHAB/brevican was detected by employing affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced against synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acids 60–73 of rat BEHAB/brevican (antibody B5) and the amino acids 859–879 of human BEHAB/brevican (antibody BCRP). The 50-kDa cleavage product of BEHAB/brevican was detected with an antibody (B50) directed against the neoepitope originated by the proteolytic processing of the full-length protein. The antibodies B6, B5, and B50 have been previously described for the detection or rat BEHAB/brevican in rat brain samples (22Matthews R.T. Gary S.C. Zerillo C. Pratta M. Solomon K. Arner E.C. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22695-22703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Antibodies B6 and B5 do not detect mouse BEHAB/brevican. Accordingly, to detect BEHAB/brevican produced endogenously by Oli-neu cells, a mouse-derived cell line, we employed a monoclonal anti-brevican antibody (Beckton-Dickinson) that detects mouse BEHAB/brevican. V5/His6-tagged recombinant full-length BEHAB/brevican was detected with a monoclonal antibody anti-V5 epitope (Invitrogen). In all cases, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were employed. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate. Identification of a Novel, Developmentally Regulated, BEHAB/Brevican Isoform in the Rat Brain—BEHAB/brevican (B/b) protein was detected in the rat brain as early as embryonic day 18 (E18), with levels increasing during postnatal development to reach the adult level of expression by postnatal day 21 (P21) (Fig. 1). The lack of detectable protein at E14 was consistent with our previous observations, where BEHAB/brevican mRNA was first detected by in situ hybridization in the rat cortex only after E16 (16Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of GAG chains by chondroitinase treatment, the largest isoform of BEHAB/brevican migrated at ∼150 kDa (B/b150), as reported previously (22Matthews R.T. Gary S.C. Zerillo C. Pratta M. Solomon K. Arner E.C. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22695-22703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The B/b150 isoform was detected predominantly in the soluble fraction early in development but later was found in both soluble and particulate fractions. In parallel with the increase in expression of B/b150 over the course of development, the major cleavage products of BEHAB/brevican also increased (Fig. 1). These cleavage products are generated by cleavage of B/b150 at the Glu395-Ser396 site by aggrecanase-1/ADAMTS-4, a protease of the ADAMTS family, producing a 50-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 90-kDa C-terminal fragment (22Matthews R.T. Gary S.C. Zerillo C. Pratta M. Solomon K. Arner E.C. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22695-22703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). B/b150 and its cleavage products are first detected in the soluble fraction but over the course of development localize increasingly to the particulate fraction of rat brain homogenates. The immunochemical analysis carried out here also revealed a new, ∼130-kDa BEHAB/brevican band (B/b130) in the particulate fraction. B/b130 was most highly expressed between P3 and P14 and was expressed at lower levels in the adult. B/b130 Is Distinct from the GPI-linked BEHAB/Brevican Isoform—Given the particulate localization of B/b130, we asked whether this band corresponded to the previously reported, GPI-linked isoform of BEHAB/brevican (21Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Rauch U. Fassler R. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Initially, we observed that both B/b150 and B/b130 were released by nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 (Fig. 2A) and zwitterionic detergents such as CHAPS (not shown) from the particulate fraction. Indeed, both isoforms could be released by detergent concentrations as low as 0.2% w/v Tx-100, indicating a particular sensitivity to the disruption of their hydrophobic interactions with the membranes. This observation suggested that B/b130 might not be a GPI-linked protein, because many GPI-linked proteins sit in plasma membrane rafts and tend to have low solubility in Triton X-100 (31Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, previous work reported that the BEHAB/brevican GPI-linked isoform was sensitive to Triton X-100 extraction (21Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Rauch U. Fassler R. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On the other hand, brief treatment with alkaline sodium carbonate, which releases membrane-associated but not GPI-linked or integral membrane proteins, also released both B/b150 and B/b130 from the particulate fraction (Fig. 2A). Together, these results provide evidence that both B/b150 and B/b130 are likely to be peripherally associated with the cell membrane. To test further whether B/b130 might represent the GPI-linked isoform of BEHAB/brevican, we treated membranes from adult rat brain with PI-PLC, an enzyme that can release GPI-linked proteins. PI-PLC treatment generated a ∼120-kDa band, which was clearly differentiable from B/b150 and B/b130 (Fig. 2B) in straight 7% acrylamide gels. This 120-kDa band was entirely released by PI-PLC and was not detected in the resulting particulate (membrane) fraction (Fig. 2C). Treatment of the soluble fraction of the brain homogenate with PI-PLC did not give rise to a 120-kDa band (not shown), indicating that the GPI-linked isoform that gives rise to the 120-kDa band specifically localized to the particulate fraction, as would be predicted for a GPI-linked protein. BEHAB/brevican has been described as a part time proteoglycan, because the protein is detected with and without GAG addition (9Yamaguchi Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore important to note that detection of the 120-kDa band released by PI-PLC required prior treatment with chondroitinase ABC, suggesting that the majority of the GPI-linked isoform is invested with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (data not shown). In addition to our results obtained with alkaline sodium carbonate and Triton X-100, we observed that although PI-PLC treatment led to the evolution of the 120-kDa band, the immunoreactivity of B/b130 was unaffected. These results suggested that the 120-kDa band was not derived from B/b130 and thus that B/b130 was not a GPI-linked isoform of BEHAB/brevican. Therefore, we were left with the question of what molecular mass the GPI-anchored isoform of BEHAB/brevican runs prior to removal of its lipid anchor, because we observed no obvious depletion of any of the immunoreactive bands following PI-PLC treatment. Answering this question required the isolation of the GPI-anchored isoform from all other BEHAB/brevican forms, prior to the removal of its lipid anchor. To that end, we extracted the membrane fraction with the detergent Triton X-114. Triton X-114 forms a homogeneous solution with water at 4 °C but partitions into an aqueous phase and a detergent phase at 37 °C. Previous work has determined that"

In mitochondria, the precise mechanisms by which RNAs are degraded, including the role of polyadenylation, are not well understood. Our previous in organello pulse-chase experiments suggest that poly(A) tails stimulate degradation of mRNAs in the mitochondria of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (Militello, K. T., and Read, L. K. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 731–742). In this report, we developed an in vitro assay to directly examine the effects of specific 3′-sequences on RNA degradation. We found that a salt-extracted mitochondrial membrane fraction preferentially degraded polyadenylated mitochondrially and non-mitochondrially encoded RNAs over their non-adenylated counterparts. A poly(A) tail as short as 5 nucleotides was sufficient to stimulate rapid degradation, although an in vivo tail length of 20 adenosines supported the most rapid decay. A poly(U) extension did not promote rapid RNA degradation, and RNA turnover was slowed by the addition of uridine residues to the poly(A) tail. To stimulate degradation, the poly(A) element must be located at the 3′ terminus of the RNA. Finally, we demonstrate that degradation of polyadenylated RNAs occurs in the 3′ to 5′ direction through the action of a hydrolytic exonuclease. These experiments demonstrate that the poly(A) tail can act as a cis-acting element to facilitate degradation of T. brucei mitochondrial mRNAs.

The control of RNA stability is essential for the regulation of gene expression in all organisms (1Dreyfus M. Régnier P.

However, the effect of 3′-poly(A) tails on RNA half-lives differs dramatically depending on the organism and subcellular compartment in which it occurs. In eukaryotic cytoplasm, poly(A) tails at the 3′-ends of mature mRNAs act in conjunction with the poly(A)-binding protein to stabilize mRNA (4Bernstein P. Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Conversely, polyadenylation destabilizes mRNA in bacteria (2Carpousis A.J. Vanzo N.F. Raynal L.C.

In these systems, poly(A) tails are added both to mature 3′ termini and to endonucleolytic cleavage products, subsequently signaling rapid decay of the corresponding RNAs. The role of polyadenylation in the turnover of mitochondrial RNAs is not well understood. In plant mitochondria, polyadenylation has been reported to destabilize RNAs (7Gagliardi D. Perrin R.

Polyadenylated endonucleolytic cleavage products have not been detected in plant mitochondria, but polyadenylation of mature mRNA 3′-ends is correlated with reduced RNA abundance in vivo and promotes rapid RNA degradation in vitro (7Gagliardi D.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Experiments performed in our laboratory using intact mitochondria from Trypanosoma brucei demonstrated that polyadenylation can also act to destabilize mRNAs in the mitochondria of this organism (10Militello K.T. Read L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2308-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which polyadenylation acts to destabilize RNA remain undefined in both plant and trypanosome mitochondria. Interestingly, trypanosomes differ from bacteria, chloroplasts, and plant mitochondria in that a significant fraction of the steady-state mitochondrial mRNA population in trypanosomes is polyadenylated (2Carpousis A.J.

Thus, although there are apparent similarities between trypanosomes and other organisms in which mRNA polyadenylation triggers rapid decay, poly(A)-mediated control of mitochondrial RNA stability in trypanosomes is likely to involve novel features. Gene expression in T. brucei mitochondria involves a complex set of processes. Expression begins with the generation of polycistronic transcripts containing both mRNA and rRNA sequences (14Read L.K.

Thus, differential expression of specific mRNAs must be accomplished through post-transcriptional events. For example, polycistronic transcripts must be cleaved precisely at their 5′- and 3′-ends to release individual monocistronic mRNAs (14Read L.K. Myler P.J. Stuart K. J. Biol.

In addition, 12 of the 18 mRNAs encoded in T. brucei mitochondria undergo an extensive RNA editing process that creates start codons, stop codons, and open reading frames for otherwise untranslatable RNAs (22Simpson L. Sbicego S. Aphasizhev R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As stated above, mRNAs are also polyadenylated at their 3′-ends.

Parasitol. 1994; 68: 197-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This suggests that polyadenylation of mitochondrial mRNAs has an important regulatory function during trypanosome development. We previously employed in organello pulse-chase experiments to study the role of polyadenylation and mRNA stability in regulating T. brucei mitochondrial gene expression (10Militello K.T. Read L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2308-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These assays revealed two distinct mRNA turnover pathways in T. brucei mitochondria. The first pathway involves specific and rapid degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs and requires the addition of UTP. The second pathway mediates slow degradation of mRNAs and is not dependent on the presence of a poly(A) tail or the addition of exogenous UTP. These studies suggested that mRNA 3′-poly(A) tails can act as cis-acting elements to facilitate RNA decay in T. brucei mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro assay that allows us to directly examine the roles of specific 3′-sequences in RNA decay. We found that a salt-extracted mitochondrial membrane fraction preferentially degraded polyadenylated mitochondrially and non-mitochondrially encoded RNAs over their non-adenylated counterparts. Turnover of unedited mitochondrial RNAs was stimulated by poly(A) tails as short as 5 nucleotides, although an in vivo tail length of 20 adenosines supported the most rapid decay. In addition, the nuclease activity was slowed by insertion of uridines into the poly(A) tail and delayed by internalization of the poly(A) tract. Finally, we show that poly(A)-specific degradation proceeded in the 3′ to 5′ direction by the action of a hydrolytic exonuclease. These results define the 3′-poly(A) tail as a cis-acting element that promotes RNA degradation in T. brucei mitochondria, thereby providing support for the model that polyadenylation can destabilize trypanosome mitochondrial mRNAs in vivo. Furthermore, our studies suggest that polyadenylation may be a general mechanism by which degradation of mitochondrial RNAs is mediated. Cell Culture and Mitochondrial Isolation—Procyclic form T. brucei brucei clone IsTaR1 stock EATRO 164 was grown as described (23Brun R. Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial vesicles were isolated on 20–35% linear Percoll gradients and stored at –80 °C (24Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Extract Preparation—Percoll gradient-purified mitochondrial vesicles were thawed on ice and collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Heraeus Instruments Biofuge Pico. Pelleted mitochondrial vesicles were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at a concentration of 2 × 1010 cell eq/ml. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm iodoacetamide). Vesicles were lysed at 4 °C for 10 min in Buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The resulting mitochondrial lysate was used for in vitro degradation assays or centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (S100) was recovered and stored at –80 °C for use in enzymatic assays. The pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet (washed membrane fraction) was resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 1010 cell eq/ml in Buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 1 m KCl to extract peripheral membrane proteins. This resuspension was homogenized with a B-type pestle and Dounce and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The homogenized extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (salt-extracted membrane protein (EMP) 1The abbreviations used are: EMP, salt-extracted membrane protein; RPS12, ribosomal protein S12; RBP16, RNA-binding protein of 16 kDa.) was dialyzed against 1 liter of Buffer A and stored at –80 °C for use in enzymatic assays. The poly(A)-specific nuclease activity present in this fraction (see “Results”) was stable for +1 month at –80 °C. The pellet from the last centrifugation step (insoluble membrane protein) was dialyzed into Buffer A and stored at –80 °C for later use. Protein quantification was performed with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In Vitro Transcription—All RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription from PCR-generated templates, created using the primers indicated in Table I, with the exception of pBluescript II SK– RNA. The sense primers all contain a region complementary to the RNA of interest and a T7 promoter region (shown in boldface in Table I). The antisense primers contain a region complementary to the RNA of interest and an extension of appropriate length and composition to produce the RNAs indicated in Table I. The plasmid pBluescript II SK– (referred to as pBSC; Stratagene) was linearized by digestion with BamHI to serve as a template for synthesis of a 77-nucleotide RNA. To generate the template for in vitro transcription of pBSC-A20, pBSC was amplified by PCR using the primers indicated in Table I. The plasmid used to generate the 218-nucleotide RBP16 PCR products with or without a 20-adenosine 3′-extension was previously described (25Hayman M.L. Read L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12067-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The plasmid RPS12-U (10Militello K.T. Read L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2308-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template to generate a 221-nucleotide RPS12un (where “un” is unedited) RNA without or with 3′-extensions, except for RPS12un-intA20 (where “int” is internal).Table IPrimers used for PCR to generate templates for in vitro transcriptionRNAPolarityPrimer SequenceAll pBSCS5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′pBSC-A20AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGATCCCCCGGGCTGC-3′All RPS12unS5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTAATACACTTTTGATAACAAACTAAAGTAAA-3′RPS12unAS5′-AAAAACATATCTTATTCT-3′RPS12un-A5AS5′-TTTTTAAAAACATATCTTATTCT-3′RPS12un-A10AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTAAAAACATATCTTATTCT-3′RPS12un-A15AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAACATATCTTATTCT-3′RPS12un-A20AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAACATATCTTATTCT-3′RPS12un-A30AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAACATATCTTATTCT-3′RPS12un-U20AS5′-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACATATCTTAT-3′RPS12un-AUAS5′-TTTTTTTAAAATTTTTTTTTAAAAACATATCTTAT-3′RPS12un-intA20AS5′-AAAAACATATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCTTATTCTAAAATC-3′All A6unS5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGGGAATTTTGAGGAGATTCTTG-3′A6unAS5′-TATTATTAACTTATTTGATCTTATTC-3′A6un-A20AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATTATTAACTTATTTGATCTTATTC-3′All RBP16S5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTTAAAGGAGAACGAGAAGATG-3′RBP16AS5′-CTGACAAATAACGGACTTC-3′RBP16-A20AS5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCTGACAAATAACGGACTTC-3′ Open table in a new tab The pRPS12unAI9 plasmid (a plasmid containing 20 adenosine residues inserted 9 bp from the 3′ terminus of the complete 221-nucleotide RPS12un RNA) was used as a template for generation of RPS12un-intA20 PCR products. This plasmid (pRPS12unAI9) was created by PCR amplification of RPS12-U with primers RPS12unAI9–5′ (5′-GCGAATTCCTAATACACTTTTGATAACAAACTAAAGTAAA-3′) and RPS12unAI9–3′ (5′-GCGGATCCAAAAACATATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCTTATTCTAAAATC-3′). Amplified reaction products were digested and ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pBSC to create plasmid pRPS12unAI9. For generation of A6un (where “A6” is ATPase-6) PCR products, we initially created plasmid pA6un-3′-221. The pA6un-3′-221 plasmid was generated by PCR amplification of T. brucei genomic DNA primed with A6un-221–5′ (5′-GCGAATTCGGGGAATTTTGAGGAGATTCTTG-3′) and A6un-221–3′ (5′-GCGGATCCTATTATTAACTTATTTGATCTTATTC-3′). This amplification created a product corresponding to the 3′ 221 nucleotides of the unedited ATPase-6 sequence containing exogenous 5′-EcoRI and 3′-BamHI restriction sites. This amplified sequence was digested and ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pBSC to create pA6un-3′-221. RNA was synthesized from the templates described above with T7 RNA polymerase and radioactively labeled with [α-32P]UTP using the Megascript in vitro transcription system (Ambion Inc.). Labeled RNAs were separated on 7 m urea and 6% acrylamide denaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography or UV shadowing. Full-length products were excised, eluted from the gel, and concentrated by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. In Vitro Degradation Assays—RNA degradation activity was initially characterized in the mitochondrial lysate, S100 fraction, EMP fraction, and insoluble membrane protein fraction (see Fig. 1A) (data not shown). Assays were carried out in 25 μl of Buffer A containing 1 mm UTP, and 2.5 pmol of both RPS12un and RPS12un-A20 RNAs. UTP was added to each assay to account for the previously observed in organello requirement of the rapid poly(A)-specific turnover pathway for this nucleotide (10Militello K.T. Read L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2308-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Initial reactions for all fractions were started by the addition of 12.5 μg of protein to RNAs and incubation at 27 °C for the times indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (50 mm EDTA and 0.2% SDS) and extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) using phase lock gels (Eppendorf). The entire aqueous phase was added to 20 μl of 90% formamide loading buffer and heated for 3 min at 90 °C. Equal volumes of each reaction were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7 m urea and 6% acrylamide gel and autoradiography. Non-saturated autoradiographs were analyzed using a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer and Multi-Analyst software (Version 1.1). Percent full-length RNA remaining was determined by analyzing the density of areas corresponding to full-length RNAs. All other reactions (see Figs. 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) were performed as described above, except that RNAs were assayed in separate tubes.Fig. 2Mitochondrially encoded RNAs with 3′-poly(A) extensions degrade more rapidly than their corresponding non-adenylated RNAs.

https://openalex.org/W1980669433,"Bacterial promoters of the extended –10 class contain a single consensus element, and the DNA sequence upstream of this element is not critical for promoter activity. Open promoter complexes can be formed on an extended –10 Escherichia coli galP1 promoter at temperatures as low as 6 °C, when complexes on most promoters are closed. Here, we studied the contribution of upstream contacts to promoter complex formation using galP1 and its derivatives lacking the extended –10 motif and/or containing the –35 promoter consensus element. A panel of E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzymes containing two, one, or no α-subunit C-terminal domains (αCTD) and either wild-type σ70 subunit or σ70 lacking region 4.2 was assembled and tested for promoter complex formation. At 37 °C, αCTD and σ70 region 4.2 were individually dispensable for promoter complex formation on galP1 derivatives with extended –10 motif. However, no promoter complexes formed when both αCTD and σ70 region 4.2 were absent. Thus, in the context of an extended –10 promoter, αCTD and σ70 region 4.2 interactions with upstream DNA can functionally substitute for each other. In contrast, at low temperature, αCTD and σ70 region 4.2 interactions with upstream DNA were found to be functionally distinct, for σ70 region 4.2 but not αCTD was required for open promoter complex formation on galP1 derivatives with extended –10 motif. We propose a model involving σ70 region 4.2 interaction with the β flap domain that explains these observations. Bacterial promoters of the extended –10 class contain a single consensus element, and the DNA sequence upstream of this element is not critical for promoter activity. Open promoter complexes can be formed on an extended –10 Escherichia coli galP1 promoter at temperatures as low as 6 °C, when complexes on most promoters are closed.

We propose a model involving σ70 region 4.2 interaction with the β flap domain that explains these observations. Most Escherichia coli promoters are characterized by the presence of two 6-bp sequence elements centered ∼10 and 35 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation point. These promoters are referred to as –10/–35 class promoters. Interaction of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; αCTD, α-subunit C-terminal domains; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; αCTD, α-subunit C-terminal domains; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. σ70 subunit with –10 and –35 promoter elements is responsible for promoter recognition and transcription initiation. σ70 conserved region 4.2 recognizes the –35 promoter element, while σ70 conserved region 2.4 recognizes the –10 promoter element (reviewed by Gross et al., Ref. 1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 2Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments of promoter sequences permit the derivation of consensus sequences for the –10 and –35 promoter elements and show that most promoters deviate from the consensus (3Ozoline O.N. Tsyganov M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4533-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Promoter elements of strong promoters tend to deviate from consensus less than promoter elements of weak promoters. Thus, assuming that promoter elements with consensus sequence are preferred binding sites for σ70 regions 2.4 and 4.2, the strength of regions 2.4 and 4.2 interaction with their respective promoter elements determines the efficiency of promoter complex formation.For most promoters, RNAP σ70 regions 2.4 and 4.2 interactions with their target promoter elements are sufficient for promoter complex formation. On some promoters, the presence of RNAP α-subunit C-terminal domains (αCTDs) greatly increases transcription initiation beyond the basal level achieved through σ70-promoter element interactions (4Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou K. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). On these promoters, αCTDs make sequence-specific interactions with an A-rich promoter element (the “UP-element”) located upstream of the –35 promoter element (reviewed by Gourse et al., Ref. 5Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the absence of a UP-element, αCTD non-specifically interacts with upstream DNA and the stimulatory effect of these interactions is less significant.There exists a minor class of promoters that lack recognizable –35 promoter elements and whose –10 elements are extended with an upstream dinucleotide TG. Genetic data show that specific interaction between an additional region of σ70, conserved region 2.5, and the TG motif is required for promoter complex formation on promoters of this class (6Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Evidently, this additional contact is strong enough to make promoter complex formation on extended –10 promoters independent of σ70 region 4.2 and –35 promoter element interaction (7Kumar A. Malloch R.A. Fujita N. Smillie D.A. Ishihama A. Hayward R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In order for template-directed RNA synthesis to occur, promoter DNA has to become locally melted (opened). In the catalytically competent open promoter complex, the melting extends from –12 to +3 positions and thus includes the entire –10 promoter element. Promoter opening is temperature-dependent, and promoter complexes formed on –10/–35 type promoters “close” below 15 °C (8Severinov K. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, promoter complexes on the extended –10 galP1 promoter remain open at temperatures as low as 5 °C (9Grimes E. Busby S. Minchin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6113-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Burns H.D. Minchin S.D.

J. 1996; 317: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reason for this unusual behavior is not completely understood. For example, while it is clear that the extended –10 motif contributes to promoter opening at low temperature (9Grimes E. Busby S. Minchin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6113-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it is not sufficient, since open promoter complexes on some extended –10 promoters are sensitive to low temperature (12Burns H.D. Belyaeva T.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Belyaeva T. Griffiths L. Minchin S. Cole J. Busby S. Biochem.

However, due to technical constrains, relatively large fragments of promoter DNA were altered. As a result, interpretation of some of the published data is complicated, since promoter complex formation can be affected by sequences outside of promoter consensus elements. In this work, we used several derivatives of the galP1 promoter obtained by site-specific mutagenesis and a set of RNAP mutants that lacked αCTD and/or σ70 region 4.2 to study promoter complexes formation in the absence of αCTD-UP element interactions, σ70 region 4.2- –35 promoter consensus element interactions and σ70 region 2.5-extended –10 motif interactions. Our results indicate that on the extended –10 galP1 promoter, αCTD-DNA interactions and σ70 region 4.2-DNA interactions are functionally equivalent, and at least one of these interactions is necessary for promoter complex formation at physiological temperature of 37 °C. In contrast, galP1 promoter complex formation at low temperature of 6 °C is strictly dependent on the presence of σ70 region 4.2.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsPlasmid pT7σ (15Zalenskaya K. Lee J.

Plasmids harboring galP1 promoter derivatives were constructed by site-specific PCR mutagenesis using pTZ19galP1 as a template and cloned in pTZ19.Proteinsσ 70 and σ 70-(1–565)—The wild-type σ70 RNAP subunit was purified from BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the pT7σ plasmid as described (20Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).To purify C-terminally truncated σ70-(1–565), E. coli XL-1Blue cells were transformed with the pCYB2_σ1–565 plasmid. Transformants were grown in 1 liter of LB with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at room temperature to an OD600 of 0.6–0.8, and expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to 1 mm. After 6 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer H containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by sonication; the lysate was clarified by low speed centrifugation and loaded onto a 1-ml chitin column equilibrated in buffer H. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer H and then quickly flushed with 3 column volumes of freshly prepared buffer H containing 30 mm dithiothreitol. The column outlet was sealed, and the column was left overnight at 4 °C. Pure σ70-(1–565) was eluted with 3 column volumes of buffer H without dithiothreitol, dialyzed against buffer H, and stored at –20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol.RNAP Core Enzymes—The wild-type RNAP core enzyme and the mutant lacking both αCTDs were prepared by in vitro reconstitution as described (18Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expr.

RNAP was loaded on the column in TGE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) and eluted using a linear 60-ml gradient of NaCl from 0.23 to 0.4 m. Fractions containing RNAP core and holoenzymes were pooled separately, concentrated to 1–2 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. Heterodimeric RNAP core enzyme containing one wild-type α-subunit and one α-subunit lacking CTD was purified from XL1-Blue strain transformed with the plasmid pREII-NHα45A (1–235) according to the procedure of Niu and co-workers (21Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The core and holoenzyme fractions were separated on the Protein-Pak Q8 HR column (Waters) and stored as described above.AsiA—E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pLysE plasmid (Novagen) were transformed with pET21AsiA. Transformants were grown in 2 liters of LB with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) at room temperature to OD600 of 0.6–0.8 and expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to 1 mm. After 6 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer C containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl. Cells were lysed by sonication and after a low speed centrifugation, cell extract was loaded onto a 5-ml chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) loaded with Ni2+ and attached to an FPLC. The column was washed with buffer C containing 20 mm imidazole, and AsiA was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in the buffer. The eluate was diluted 5-fold with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1.65 m (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 8 ml phenyl-Toyopearl column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed and eluted with an (NH4)2SO4 gradient from 1.3 to 0 m. Homogeneous AsiAHIS protein was eluted from the column at 20–0 mm (NH4)2SO4, concentrated to 1 mg/ml concentration and stored at –20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol.In Vitro TranscriptionAbortive transcription initiation reactions contained, in 10 μl of transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl), 20 nm RNAP core enzyme and 320 nm σ70 or 640 nm σ70-(1–565). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 10 nm promoter fragments, 0.1 mm initiating dinucleotide CpA, and 3 μCi (3000 Ci/mmol) of [α-32P]UTP. Reactions proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C and were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer containing 9 m urea. Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing (8 m urea) 20% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager.Determination of Open Complex Dissociation KineticsOpen complex lifetime was measured on linear promoter-containing DNA fragments using an abortive transcription assay. Reactions contained, in 40 μl of buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 175 mm NaCl, 2 mm β–mercaptoethanol), 80 nm wild-type and mutant RNAP core enzymes and 80 nm σ70 or 160 nm σ565. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 10 nm promoter fragments and additional incubation for 15 min at 30 °C. A 10-μl reaction aliquot was transferred to tubes containing 0.1 mm dinucleotide CpA, 10 μm UTP, and 3 μCi (3000 Ci/mmol) of [α-32P]UTP. Abortive transcription initiation was allowed to proceed for 10 min and was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer containing 9 m urea. The remainder of promoter complex reaction was supplemented with 100 μg/ml heparin and incubation at 30 °C was continued. 10-μl reaction aliquots were withdrawn immediately after the heparin addition and 30 and 90 min after the heparin addition and assayed for abortive transcription as described above. Reaction products were resolved, visualized, and quantified as described above.DNase I FootprintingThe 147-bp DNA fragments (–96 to +51) harboring the galP1 promoter and its derivatives were amplified by PCR from appropriate plasmids using universal T7 promoter and M13 reverse primers. PCR fragments were digested with HindIII and labeled at nontemplate strand by filling the HindIII sticky end with Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Promoter complexes were formed in 15 μl of transcription buffer containing 200 nm RNAP core enzymes and a 4-fold excess of σ70 or 8-fold excess of σ70-(1–565). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, followed, when necessary, by the addition of 1 μm of AsiA and further 10 min incubation at the same temperature. Reactions were next supplemented with 10 nm32P-endlabeled promoter fragments and incubated for 20 min at assay temperature. DNase I footprinting reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 or 1 unit of DNase I (Worthington) for 37 and 6 °C reactions, respectively. The reactions proceeded for 30 s at the assay temperature and were terminated by addition of 85 μl stop-mixture (20 mm EDTA, 10 μg of denatured calf thymus DNA, and water) followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were dissolved in 8 μl of formamide-loading dye and analyzed using 7% polyacrylamide/8 m urea sequencing gels.KMnO4 ProbingReactions were set up as described above for DNase I footprinting. Promoter complexes were treated with 1 mm KMnO4 for 15 s at the assay temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 300 mm, followed by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and 20 min treatment with 10% piperidine at 95 °C. Reaction products were analyzed using 7% polyacrylamide urea gels.Gel Retardation AssayThe reactions contained, in 20 μl of transcription buffer, 10 nm RNAP wild-type and mutant core enzymes combined with appropriate amounts of σ70 or σ70-(1–565). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, transferred to 6 °C, and incubated for additional 10 min, followed by the addition of 10 nm32P-endlabeled galP1 promoter fragment. After further 30 min of incubation at 6 °C, reactions were combined with 4 μl of loading buffer (transcription buffer containing 50% glycerol and 0.05% bromphenol blue). When necessary, heparin was added to the final concentration 50 μg/ml, and reactions were immediately loaded on 5% (29:1) polyacrylamide Tris borate/EDTA gel. The gel was run in a cold room and reactions products were revealed by autoradiography.RESULTSThe galP1 Promoter Derivatives Used in This Work—A galP1 promoter derivative previously constructed and characterized by Burns et al. (12Burns H.D. Belyaeva T.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used as a starting point of this work. The promoter differs from the natural galP1 promoter by three point mutations. Two substitutions at positions –9 and –8 relative to the start point of transcription create a consensus extended –10 promoter element, TGcTATAAT, instead of the wild-type sequence TGcTATggT. The third substitution introduces a T at position –19 and destroys the overlapping galP2 promoter, thus simplifying the analysis of galP1 promoter complexes. We used site-directed mutagenesis to construct “second-generation” derivatives of the optimized galP1 promoter constructed by Burns et al. (Fig. 1A). The first derivative, galP1-35, contains the consensus –35 promoter element, TTGACA, incorporated 18 base pairs upstream of T at position –12, the first base of the –10 consensus element. The second derivative, galP1-TG, was constructed by substituting the TG motif of the extended –10 promoter consensus element for AC. The resultant promoter was named galP1-TG. The final construct, galP1-35-TG, is a derivative of galP1-35 and also has the TG extended –10 motif substituted with AC. Note that our nomenclature differs from that adopted by Kamali-Moghaddam and Geiduschek in the accompanying article (28Kamali-Moghaddam M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29701-29709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).The ability of promoter fragments containing galP1 and its derivatives to serve as templates for the synthesis of CpApU from the CpA primer and the UTP substrate by E. coli RNAP σ70 holoenzyme was investigated (Fig. 1B). DNA fragments containing galP1, galP1-35 as well as galP1-35-TG supported high and comparable levels of CpApU synthesis. In contrast, little transcription was detected when RNAP was combined with the galP1-TG fragment (less than 5% compared with other promoters used here). These result indicate the following. (i) galP1 has no functional –35 promoter consensus element. (ii) The –10 consensus promoter element alone, in the absence of the TG motif, is insufficient for transcription initiation, and (iii) the consensus –35 element sequence introduced in galP1-35-TG promoter is functional.Promoter Complex Formation by RNAP Mutants Lacking αCTD and/or σ 70 Region 4.2 on galP1 Derivatives—We wished to determine the contribution of RNAP domains capable of interaction with upstream promoter sequences, the αCTD and the σ70 subunit region 4.2, to promoter complex formation on galP1 and its derivatives. To this end, 5 mutant RNAP holoenzymes that lack one or both αCTDs and/or σ70 region 4.2 and wild-type σ70 RNAP holoenzyme were prepared. RNAP holoenzymes were reconstituted in vitro by combining RNAP core containing two copies of the wild-type α subunit, RNAP core that has one α and another copy truncated at amino acid 235, and RNAP core that contains two copies of truncated α with either wild-type σ70, or with a σ70 mutant that is truncated at amino acid position 565, σ70-(1–565), and thus lacks region 4.2 (16Severinov K. Muir T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16205-16209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Minakhin L. Niedziela-Majka A. Kuznedelov K. Adelman K. Heyduk T. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Native PAGE analysis showed that reconstituted RNAP holoenzymes contained less than 5% RNAP core (data not shown). The ability of mutant holoenzymes and wild-type RNAP control to form promoter complexes at 37 °C with DNA fragments containing galP1 and its active derivatives was investigated by DNase I footprinting. The footprinting results obtained with DNA fragments that contained functional promoters galP1, galP1-35, and galP1-35-TG are presented in Fig. 2, A–C, respectively. On all three promoters, the wild-type holoenzyme protected DNA from +20 to –23 (Fig. 2, A–C, lane 2). DNase I hypersensitive sites centered at positions –25, –36, –44, –57, and –67 were also observed in complexes formed on all three promoters with wild-type RNAP. The DNA between the hypersensitive sites was protected (Fig. 2, A–C, lane 2). This periodic pattern of protection and hypersensitivity has been attributed to wrapping of upstream DNA around RNAP (Attey et al., Ref. 11Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The hypersensitive site at position –25, was very prominent in the galP1-35 and galP1-35-TG complexes, and was less pronounced in galP1 complexes. DNase I hypersensitivity at about –25 is a common feature of promoter complexes formed by bacterial RNAP (3Ozoline O.N. Tsyganov M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4533-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); it may result from DNA bending that arises when RNAP establishes simultaneous contacts with the –35 and –10 promoter consensus elements (2Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). If this interpretation is correct, weaker hypersensitivity in the galP1 complexes is expected, since σ70 region 4.2 does not make specific contacts with DNA on galP1. In the galP1-35, and galP1-35-TG complexes, but not in galP1 complexes, position –5 was exposed to DNase I attack (compare, for example Fig. 2, A–C, lane 2).Fig. 2Promoter complex formation on galP1 promoter derivatives using mutant RNAP holoenzymes lacking αCTD and/or σ70 region 4.2. Promoter complexes were formed at 37 °C using the indicated RNAP holoenzymes on DNA fragments containing indicated functional galP1 promoter derivatives. Promoter fragments were 32P-endlabeled at the top (non-template strand). Promoter complexes were footprinted with DNase I, reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 7% sequencing gel and revealed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On all three promoters, complexes formed by σ70 holoenzymes lacking one of the αCTDs were very similar to the corresponding wild-type RNAP complexes, though protection of a DNase I-sensitive band at –52 was decreased somewhat (Fig. 2, A–C, compare lanes 2 and 3). In complexes formed by σ70 holoenzyme lacking both αCTDs, protection at –52 and –48 was further decreased (Fig. 2, A–C, compare lane 4 with lanes 3 and 2), suggesting that in the wild-type RNAP complexes, protection of AT-rich sequence between positions –52 and –48 is due to αCTD binding, in agreement with earlier results (11Attey A. Belyaeva T. Savery N. Hoggett J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).No footprint was observed when σ70-(1–565) holoenzymes were combined with galP1-35-TG (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–7). This result is expected, since the interaction between σ70 region 4.2 and the –35 promoter consensus element is essential for promoter complex formation on the –10/–35 class promoters. In contrast, footprints were readily observed when σ70-(1–565) holoenzymes reconstituted from wild-type core enzyme or from core enzyme lacking one αCTD were combined with galP1 and galP1-35, also as expected (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 5 and 6). These footprints are distinct from the corresponding σ70 holoenzyme footprints in that position –37, which is fully protected in the presence of σ70 RNAP complexes, is hypersensitive in the presence of σ70-(1–565) RNAP, presumably because specific interactions between σ70 region 4.2 and the –35 promoter element (galP1-35) or nonspecific interactions between σ70 region 4.2 and promoter DNA (galP1) are lacking. In complexes formed by σ70-(1–565) RNAP holoenzymes containing both αCTDs, protection at around –40/–50 is present (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 5), suggesting that αCTD is able to interact with its binding site independently of σ70 region 4.2. Hypersensitivity at –67 and at –57 is absent in σ70-(1–565) complexes. The reasons for this are unclear, since σ70 region 4.2 is only expected to interact with promoter DNA ∼35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start point (1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, RNAP holoenzyme lacking both αCTDs and σ70 region 4.2 produced no footprints on extended –10 galP1 or galP1-35 promoters (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 7). Since the removal of these RNAP domains individually had no effect on promoter complex formation, we conclude that on galP1 and galP1-35, αCTD, and σ70 region 4.2 interactions with upstream promoter DNA can substitute for each other. However, the removal of both of these interactions prevents promoter complex formation even in the context of a consensus extended –10 promoter.Stability of Promoter Complexes—The dissociation kinetics of promoter complexes formed on galP1 and its two active derivatives, galP1-35 and galP1-35-TG, was investigated. Promoter complexes were formed, challenged with DNA competitor heparin, and the amount of complexes that survived heparin challenge was determined by withdrawing reaction aliquots at various times after heparin addition and supplementing them with the CpA primer and radioactive UTP substrate to allow the production of radioactively labeled abortive transcript CpApU. Reaction products were separated by denaturing PAGE and the decline of CpApU synthesis over time was monitored. The results are presented in Fig. 3A. As can be seen, in the case of the wild-type RNAP promoter complexes on galP1-35, no decline in abortive synthesis was observed even after 90-min incubation in the presence of heparin.

Mutations in this region are observed in many human tumors. Examination of the locations of these mutations reveals interesting patterns; specifically, Ser45 and Thr41 appear more frequently in malignant tumors, and Ser37 and Ser33 are more common in benign entities. To test whether these patterns represent functional differences in β-catenin signaling mechanisms, we generated mutations of each of these residues. Stable transformation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed a transformed phenotype with each of the four mutations, as assessed by growth in soft agar and collagen. Functional assays including proliferation assays, cell shedding assays, and wounding assays demonstrated two groups. Ser45 and Thr41 represent a more transformed phenotype, whereas Ser37 and Ser33 behaved similarly to the vector in these assays. Assessment of downstream genes demonstrated increased activation of the β-catenin target gene cyclin D1 by Ser45. Finally, we examined the kinase activity of IκB kinase-α and found that this kinase, unlike glycogen synthase kinase-3β, appears to preferentially phosphorylate Ser45 and Thr41, independent of priming by casein kinase-1. We conclude that these sites may represent an alternative (non-wnt) signaling pathway, which may be inappropriately activated in tumors with mutations of these residues. β-Catenin-mediated signaling can be constitutively activated by truncation or mutation of serine and threonine residues in exon 3.

We conclude that these sites may represent an alternative (non-wnt) signaling pathway, which may be inappropriately activated in tumors with mutations of these residues. β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein, participating in both cadherin-mediated adhesion and the wnt signaling cascade. To stabilize cell-cell adhesion, β-catenin provides a necessary link between cadherin molecules and the α-catenin-based linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, contributing structural integrity to the complex (1Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 2Hajra K.M. Fearon E.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002; 34: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). When β-catenin is released from the adhesive complex, it participates in the wnt signaling pathway and possibly other signal transducing functions (3Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Normal wnt signaling begins when the wnt ligand binds its receptor, Frizzled, which leads to activation of the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled. Dishevelled, possibly through Frat-1 (frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphoma)/GSK3β 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; CK1, casein kinase-1; PKA, protein kinase A; IKK, IκB kinase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase.-binding protein, inactivates the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β. Inactivated GSK3β allows a non-phosphorylated pool of β-catenin to accumulate in the cytosol, translocate to the nucleus, and act as a cofactor for the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor transcription factors. Downstream genes of β-catenin activation include cyclin D1, c-myc, CD44, BMP-4, MMP-7, c-jun, and others (2Hajra K.M. Fearon E.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002; 34: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 4Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of the wnt signal, GSK3β complexes with adenomatous polyposis coli, axin, and casein kinase-1 (CK1) bind β-catenin and facilitate its phosphorylation at key serine and threonine residues: Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45. This phosphorylation event is essential for β-catenin binding to β-TRCP, an F-box protein associated with ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, which leads to destruction of β-catenin by proteasome-mediated degradation. β-Catenin can avoid degradation, independent of wnt signaling, if members of the signaling pathway or β-catenin does not function normally. Indeed, mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli in colon cancer have been widely reported (2Hajra K.M. Fearon E.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002; 34: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Axin mutations have also been reported in ovarian carcinoma, medulloblastoma, colon, and hepatocellular cancers (5Wu R. Zhai Y. Fearon E.R. Cho K.R.

Mutations in β-catenin have been identified in a variety of benign and malignant human tumors. Alterations to the β-catenin gene are primarily point mutations in exon 3. Exon 3 is considered the hot spot for mutations because it contains the key serine and threonine residues phosphorylated by GSK3β and other kinases. However, the mutation spectrum of β-catenin is not limited to serine and threonine residues, but includes other adjacent residues (see Fig. 1). 2Complete references are available upon request. Previously, it was supposed that any mutation in exon 3 could lead to equivalent stabilization of β-catenin and transcriptional activation of wnt target genes. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that the serine and threonine residues of β-catenin are phosphorylated differentially by CK1 and GSK3β. CK1α and CK1ϵ have been shown to phosphorylate β-catenin at Ser45, acting as a priming mechanism for GSK3β (9Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R499-R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Without CK1 phosphorylation of Ser45, phosphorylation of the remaining Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 sites by GSK3β is greatly reduced, as is appropriate degradation of β-catenin. These data indicate an important differential role of individual residues in β-catenin (9Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R499-R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In a parallel pathway, protein kinase A (PKA) has been identified as part of the priming mechanism for β-catenin (10Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PKA acts distinctly from the CK1-axin-GSK3β complex, operating instead through a presenilin-GSK3β-β-catenin complex. This presenilin model of β-catenin regulation was shown to be independent of wnt regulation. Therefore, it represents another route cells use to regulate β-catenin, exclusive of the canonical wnt pathway, but still through GSK3β (10Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition to CK1, PKA, and GSK3β, phosphorylation of β-catenin has been demonstrated with IκB kinase (IKK)-α and IKKβ both in vitro and in vivo (11Lamberti C. Lin K.M. Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Verma I.M. Byers S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42276-42286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). IKKα localizes in the nucleus in IKKβ-null cells, whereas IKKβ localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus in IKKα-null cells, perhaps indicating different compartmentalization of these kinases. Furthermore, IKKβ decreases β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity, whereas IKKα increases β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. These results suggest that differential behavior of β-catenin with IKKα and IKKβ may contribute to cellular localization of β-catenin and its signaling abilities (11Lamberti C. Lin K.M. Yamamoto Y.

Based on the pattern of mutations in benign and malignant human lesions and the ability of β-catenin to be differentially phosphorylated by CK1, PKA, IKKs, and GSK3β, we hypothesized that individual mutations might confer different transforming effects in normal cells. Specifically, we tested the serine and threonine residues most commonly mutated in exon 3, Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45, by creating stable cell lines in the MDCK epithelial cell line. Although all of the mutants were able to form aggregates in soft agar, indicating that they all confer some level of cellular transformation, two functional classes of mutations emerged: Ser45 and Thr41 and Ser37 and Ser33. IKKα appears to preferentially phosphorylate the Ser45/Thr41 group, suggesting a mechanism by which β-catenin signaling can be differentially regulated. Cell Lines Used—MDCK cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants were generated using two different kits. Mutants S45A and S33A were made with the MORPH site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Mutants T41A and S37A were produced using the QuikChange PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template for mutagenesis reactions in both kits was full-length wild-type β-catenin in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with a FLAG tag directly upstream of the β-catenin start codon. Mutants were confirmed by direct sequencing (Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). All target codons were changed to alanine. Following confirmation of the sequence, mutant plasmids were transformed into DH5α bacteria. Large preparations of plasmids for transfection were generated using maxi-prep kits (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Stable Cell Lines—Subconfluent MDCK cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) on 10-cm plates with 2 μg of DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000. 2 days post-transfection, the cells were split 1:20, and growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was added. Cells were selected in G418 for 10–12 days. Colonies were picked using colony rings, and candidate clones were screened by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Clones were maintained in G418-supplemented growth medium to prevent loss of expression of the gene over multiple passages of the clones. Extraction and Western Blotting—A Triton lysate (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) of cultured stable cells was made 3 days post-plating on 6-well Falcon plates (BD Biosciences). Lysate concentration was measured using BioRad reagent, and 20–40 μg of total lysate was loaded onto 15-cm 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels run at 15 °C for 6 h. Gels were transferred in high glycine transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl/glycine (pH 8.0) and 20% methanol) to 0.45-μm Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) on the Genie transfer apparatus (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). Membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and 0.5% Tween (BSA/TBS/Tween) for 30 min. Primary antibody, either anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution or anti-β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories) at 1:10,000 dilution, was added to fresh BSA/TBS/Tween and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following washing with TBS/Tween, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce) was incubated with the blots at 1:40,000 dilution in TBS/Tween for 45 min. Detection of bands was done with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film. Exposures were taken in the linear range of the reagent signal. RNA and Northern Blotting—RNA was made by CsCl purification. Briefly, 80–100% confluent cells in T-75 flasks were lysed with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate and 25 mm sodium acetate (0.45-μm filter; Nalgene, Rochester, NY). Lysate was applied to a 5.7 m CsCl and 25 mm sodium acetate cushion (0.45-μm filter; Nalgene) in polyallomer centrifuge tubes (14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter, Jersey City, NJ). Samples were spun in an SW 40.1 ultracentrifuge at 28,000 rpm for 16–18 h at 20 °C. The following day, pellets of RNA were washed twice with 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.1% SDS; ethanol-precipitated; and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate/water. The RNA solution was quantitated at 260 nm on a spectrophotometer; and 15 μg was added to 25 μl of loading buffer, boiled, chilled, and loaded onto a 0.6% denaturing RNA gel. Gels were run in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA for 4 h. Gels were transferred, top down, with alkaline transfer buffer (3 m NaCl, 8 mm NaOH (pH 11.4), and 0.2 mm Sarkosyl) for 2 h onto Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene). Following transfer, the membrane was neutralized with 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) and UV-cross-linked (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Membranes were prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene). [32P]dCTP-radiolabeled β-catenin, cyclin D1, or actin probe (isolated from plasmid DNA) was generated using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). The probe was boiled and added to the prehybridization solution at 1–2 × 106 counts/ml. The blots were hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C, washed three times at room temperature with 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS and twice at 55 °C with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and exposed to film for 1–24 h at –80 °C. Quantitation of Bands on Gels—Gels were quantitated using TotalLab 1-D analysis software (Non-Linear Dynamics, Durham, NC). The densities of bands were measured in pixel concentration and are given in arbitrary units. For quantitation of Western blots, samples were run in triplicate, and S.E. was calculated. Immunohistochemistry—MDCK stable cells were grown on four-chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and fixed 48 h post-plating with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde and TBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked in 1% BSA and TBS, and then exposed to primary antibody in 1% BSA and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen). The anti-β-catenin antibody was an in-house polyclonal antibody (YR6) and was used at 1:500 dilution. The anti-FLAG antibody was monoclonal antibody M2 and was used at 1:1000 dilution. The secondary antibodies were Goat-Anti Rabbit-Alexa 488 (β-catenin) and Goat Anti Mouse-Cy3 (FLAG-tagged β-catenin) (Amersham Biosciences). Secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS/Tween. Cells were mounted in Immunomount medium (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Pictures were taken at a magnification of ×200. Soft Agar Assay—Cells (5000 cells/well) were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% agarose, and PBS and plated onto 6-well Falcon plates previously coated with 0.6% agarose cushions. After gelling for 20 min, MDCK growth medium was added and changed every 2–3 days for 14 days. Cells were stained with 0.005% crystal violet and 95% ethanol for 1 h at room temperature. Pictures of multiple fields of colony formation were photographed, and the number of colonies was counted using NIH Image. Six fields were counted for each assay; S.E. was generated; and clones were tested against the vector by Student's t test using Prism software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Following image capture, soft agar cushions were fixed in buffered Formalin and paraffin-embedded overnight. Blocks were sectioned and hematoxylin/eosin-stained, and pictures were taken under a magnification of ×400 on an inverted microscope. Three-dimensional Collagen I Assay—Rat tail collagen I was obtained from BD Biosciences. Briefly, a collagen I matrix (final concentration of 2.2–2.4 mg/ml) was made by mixing 10× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.02 n acetic acid to volume, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 1 m NaOH. Immediately, stable cells, previously trypsinized, washed, and pelleted, were resuspended at 500,000 cells/ml in collagen I solution. The collagen I cell suspension was dripped onto p60 Falcon Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) and allowed to set at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 min. Complete medium was gently added and changed every 2 days for 8 days. On day 8, collagen I droplets were removed with forceps, fixed in Formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and hematoxylin/eosin-stained. Pictures were taken on a dissecting microscope at a magnification of ×100. Aggregation Assay—Calcium-dependent aggregation of clones was measured. 90% confluent cells on 10-cm Falcon tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences) were trypsinized in 1% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with rocking. Cells were collected in Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and spun at 1200 rpm to pellet the cells. Cells were resuspended in fresh Hank's balanced salt solution and passed 10 times through a 23-gauge needle to create a single cell suspension. Cells were counted on a Z series Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter), and 600,000 cells/ml were resuspended either in Hank's balanced salt solution, 1% BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2 or in Hank's balanced salt solution and 1% BSA without CaCl2. On 24-well Falcon plates (BD Biosciences), 0.5 ml of cell suspension was plated and rocked for 3 h at 175 rpm in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. After 3 h, cells were fixed with buffered Formalin and spotted onto positively charged glass slides (VWR, West Chester, PA). Cells were air-dried and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Cell aggregates were then counted (1000 total particles/well), and the percentage of cells in clumps of more than three cells was assessed. Assays were run in triplicate, and Student's t tests were performed using Prism software. Growth Curve—Cells were plated at 300,000 cells/well on 12-well Falcon plates (BD Biosciences) and fed every 2nd day. On days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, cells were washed with PBS, and 0.25 mg/ml trypsin/EDTA was added to each well. Cells were resuspended to a single cell suspension in growth medium to quench trypsin. They were then read on the Z Series Coulter Counter. Each time point was plated in triplicate. S.E. was calculated for each time point, and Student's t tests were carried out using Prism software to determine significance. Cell Shedding Assay—On day 12 of the growth curve, cells were washed thoroughly with PBS, and 1 ml of growth medium was added. 24 h later, the shed cells were collected and read on the Coulter Counter as described for the growth curve. Each cell line was read in triplicate, and Student's t tests were performed using Prism software to evaluate the significance. Wounding Assay—6-well Flacon plates were prepared for wounding assays by scoring the plates with a needle so that wounds could be oriented for photographs. After scratching the plates, they were washed with PBS to remove any debris. 1.5 × 106 cells were plated in triplicate and allowed to adhere for 12–16 h at 37 °C in 15% CO2. Cells were wounded with a disposable pipette tip, and pictures were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h. The change in area over 10 h was measured using NIH Image, and Student's t tests were conducted using Prism software. Kinase Assay—Hemagglutinin-tagged IKKα was transfected into COS cells, and extracts were immunoprecipitated with the antibody directed against the hemagglutinin epitope. Immunopurified IKKα was added to kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm ATP1mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The kinase assays were performed in the presence of 5 μg of bacterially expressed GST fusion protein consisting of wild-type β-catenin, β-catenin-(1–91), β-catenin-(1–30), β-catenin-(1–56), or β-catenin-(1–68). After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, the reactions were mixed with protein sample buffer, heated at 90 °C, and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The phosphoprotein products were visualized by autoradiography. Spectrum of Mutations of Individual Residues in Exon 3 of β-Catenin in Human Tumors—β-Catenin mutations in human malignancies occur with widely varied frequency in different tumor types. To assess the spectrum of mutations reported in the literature, studies reporting mutations detected by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and/or direct sequencing from human tumors were recorded. Each time a residue was reported as changed, it was tallied without respect to the residue it was changed to or the number of point mutations detected per patient tumor. Therefore, the number of mutations reflects the number of times a particular mutation was reported as altered in the literature. Some sites are rarely mutated, appearing only once or twice in the literature, including Ser23, Ser29, Thr42, and Ser60. In contrast, six residues are mutated abundantly and either are known kinase targets or are directly adjacent to these residues. These residues include, in order of frequency, Ser37, Ser45, Thr41, Asp32, Ser33, and Gly34 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, Asp32, which is not a residue that can be phosphorylated, is more commonly mutated than Ser33, one of the recognized GSK3β sites. All of the residues on the graph had an incidence of more than five reports in the literature. Thus, a second population of low level mutations exists, including Ile35, His36, Thr40, Ala43, Pro44, Ser47, and Lys49. Mutations of Thr41 and Ser45 are more frequent in malignant lesions compared with benign tumors, which are predominantly mutated at Ser37 and Ser33 (Fig. 1, A and B). Epithelial tumors and non-epithelial tumors differ most markedly at Thr41, which is less frequently altered in non-epithelial lesions (Fig. 1, C and D). Ser37 mutants are the most frequent overall, but do not appear to be correlated with either class of malignancy. Closer examination of the spectrum of mutations in epithelial tumors suggests that mutation profiles may be tissue-specific (Fig. 2, A–D). Colorectal carcinomas favor mutations of Thr41 and Ser45, whereas gastric/esophageal cancers have few mutations of Thr41 and none of Ser45. In gastric/esophageal cancers, Ser37 is the dominant mutation represented, as in urogenital cancers. Hepatocellular cancers have the broadest spectrum of mutations, with Ser45, Thr41, and Asp32 representing a 1.5–2-fold increase over Ser33, Gly34, and Ser37. Thus, β-catenin mutations create distinct fingerprints for individual cancers. Given the range of mutations seen and the varied tumor behaviors associated with these mutations, we hypothesize that individual mutations differentially act on β-catenin-mediated signaling pathways, resulting in diverse biological functions. To assess this possibility, we generated a series of point mutations of the most commonly mutated serine and threonine residues by alanine scanning. Generation of MDCK Stable Cells Lines with Mutant β-Catenin and Its Localization—Stable cell lines were generated in MDCK cells, a nontransformed epithelial cell line with intact cadherin and wnt signaling components. To discern wild-type from mutant β-catenin constructs, mutants were FLAG-tagged. To detect the relative amounts of FLAG-tagged to endogenous β-catenin, total cell lysates were run on 6% gels to separate the 92-kDa endogenous β-catenin from the 94-kDa FLAG-tagged β-catenin mutants (Fig. 3, left panels). The relative abundance of each band was quantified in triplicate and is represented in arbitrary units (Table I).Table IRatios of FLAG-tagged to endogenous β-catenin in stable clonesVectorS45AT41AS37AS33ARNA04.21.10.40.33Protein02.71.31.10.75 Open table in a new tab Because S45A has more FLAG-tagged β-catenin compared with endogenous β-catenin and S33A has less FLAG-tagged β-catenin compared with endogenous β-catenin, we wondered if these differences were due to expression of the β-catenin mutants or if they were due to post-transcriptional events such as protein turnover. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that gene expression levels mirrored protein expression levels (Fig. 3, right panels; and Table I). This suggests there is not a dramatic difference in the degradation rate of the protein. Equal loading of Northern blots was assessed by blotting with actin (data not shown). It was expected that stabilization of β-catenin would lead to nuclear translocation and that the FLAG-tagged mutants would be detectable in the nucleus. Previously, we have shown that transient overexpression of these point mutants in MDCK cells leads to nuclear localization and speckling in the nucleus (12Chung G.G. Provost E. Kielhorn E.P. Charette L.A. Smith B.L. Rimm D.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4013-4020PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have shown dramatic nuclear localization in transients, stable expression in cell lines of these four clones demonstrated no evidence of nuclear localization. Repeated attempts to create stable lines with overexpression of the wild-type construct failed to produce cells that were sustainable in culture. One clone, which at first appeared useful, had metabolic problems in assays for >3 days. This inability to create a wild-type β-catenin-overexpressing clone was repeated by two researchers. It is believed that, in this strain of MDCK cells, overexpression of wild-type β-catenin is toxic. A neomycin-resistant clone without FLAG-β-catenin integration was used as a vector control for experiments to determine the effects of endogenous β-catenin in MDCK cells. In the MDCK stable cells, all four constructs localized to the membrane with some heterologous cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 4). In subconfluent cells, stronger cytoplasmic staining was seen (data not shown); but at confluence, FLAG staining demonstrated that all of the mutants could localize to the membrane. In confluent cultures, when cytoplasmic staining was detected, there was frequently an enlargement in the cell morphology, and the cell appeared to be crawling over the monolayer, with cytoplasmic extensions visible. Phase images and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of these cells revealed that these cells had intact nuclei. In contrast to the FLAG staining in mutants, vector-only cells exhibited perinuclear, nonspecific background staining in both subconfluent (data not shown) and confluent cells. Cells growing on top of one another or with enlarged morphology and cytosolic projections were never observed in vector control cells. A Basic Level of Transformation Is Observed in All Constructs as Assayed by Anchorage-independent Growth and by Growth in Collagen I—All of the mutants were capable of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Fig. 5, A and B). The structures of the colonies that formed in soft agar were assessed by hematoxylin/eosin staining of the colonies in cross-section. Vector-only colonies formed small compact balls of polarized cells. Each of the mutant cell lines formed complex cystic structures consisting of multicellular arrangements. All of the clones formed significantly more colonies than the vector when quantified, demonstrating that each serine or threonine mutant was capable of anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 5B). MDCK cells demonstrate three-dimensional cystic growth in collagen I (13Bao Q. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2791-2800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kadono Y. Shibahara K. Namiki M. Watanabe Y. Seiki M. Sato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 8 days suspended in collagen I, fixed, sectioned, and stained to evaluate colony morphology. Similar to the growth in soft agar, non-transfected MDCK cells formed small, tight, compact colonies, whereas each of the mutants formed larger cystic structures with architecture that was similar among all four of the clones (Fig. 5A). Since all of the mutant forms of β-catenin localized at the membrane (Fig. 4), we evaluated the ability of these clones to form aggregates. No statistically significant difference was observed in any of the mutant's ability to participate in calcium-dependent aggregation compared with the vector (Fig. 5C). Additionally, eac"

Zymosan, which consists of yeast cell particles, is also one of the strong macrophage activators containing β-(1,3)glucans (24Reichner J.S. Fitzpatrick P.A. Wakshull E. Albina J.E.

Zymosan has been reported to bind to membrane components such as complement receptor 3, a scavenger receptor, lactosylceramide, and dectin-1 (27Taylor P.R. Brown G.D. Reid D.M. Willment J.A.

It has been suggested that signals from zymosan are transmitted through heterodimers of TLR2 and TLR6 (15Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L.

It has recently been reported that curdran, a linear β-(1,3)glucan, stimulates the binding macrophages to pattern-recognition receptors using MyD88 for its signal transduction, although the responsible receptors includes TLRs have not been identified (29Kataoka K. Muta T. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36825-36831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cellulose β-(1,4)glucan is the predominant polysaccharide in plant cell walls but is also produced by fungi and bacteria such as Acetobacter species (30Minakami H. Entani E. Tayama K. Fujiyama S. Masai H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 2405-2414Google Scholar, 31Tayama K. Minakami H. Entani E. Fujiyama S. Masai H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 959-966Google Scholar, 32Tayama K. Minakami H.

Hemicellulose derived from soybean hull, presumably containing β-(1,3)-(1,4)glucan, has been reported to stimulate macrophages to produce nitric oxide and interleukin (IL)-1β (33Nagata J. Higashiuesato Y. Maeda G. Chinen I. Saito M. Iwabuchi K. Onoe K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 4965-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, there is no report concerning the immunostimulatory activity of β-(1,4)glucan. Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with a predominant T-helper 2 (Th2) cellular response, IgE synthesis, airway infiltration by eosinophils, and bronchial hyperreactivity (34Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Page C.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 515PubMed Google Scholar, 35Galli G. Chantry D. Annunziato F. Romagnani P. Cosmi L. Lazzeri E. Manetti R. Maggi E. Gray P.W. Romagnani S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Naive CD4+ T cells initially stimulated with an allergen in the presence of IL-4 tend to develop into CD4+ T cells that secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 for IgE isotype switching. Th1 cells, into which naive CD4+ T cells preferentially differentiate in the presence of IL-12, IL-18, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), secrete IFN-γ and TNF-α not only for induction of cell-mediated immunity but also for inhibition of Th2 responses (36Gajewski T.F. Joyce J. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 15-22PubMed Google Scholar, 37Manetti R. Parronchi P. Giudizi M.G. Piccini M.P. Maggi E. Trinchieri G. Romagnani S. J. Exp.

Therefore, cytokines involved in Th1-biased response are thought to regulate Th2-mediated allergic response. In the present study, we found that a bacteria cellulose AC-1 derived from Acetobacter species was a potent inducer of IL-12 p40 and TNF-α production by macrophages in vitro. AC-1, a β-glucan composed of β-(1,4)glucan with branches of glucosyl residues, has a molecular mass of 1 × 106 daltons. Polymyxin B- and proteinase-treated AC-1 stimulated spleen-adherent cells to produce TNF-α, whereas such cytokine production was not detected in cellulase-treated AC-1. Results of experiments using TLR4-deficient mice and TLR4-transfected human cell line indicated that TLR4 is involved in pattern recognition of AC-1. When oral administration of AC-1 was begun immediately after ovalbumin (OVA) immunization, significant decreases in the serum levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 accompanied by augmented IFN-γ production occurred. These results suggest that AC-1, a potent IL-12 and TNF-α inducer, suppresses allergic inflammation with IgE production, thus offering an approach for the treatment of allergic disorders. Animals—C3H/HeN mice, C3H/HeJ mice and BALB/c mice (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were used in the experiments at 6–10 weeks of age. Mutant mice (F2 interbred from 129/Ola x C57BL/6) with a deficiency in TLR2 were generated by gene targeting and kindly provided by S. Akira (Osaka University, Japan) (4Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). Age- and sex-matched groups of TLR2-deficient (TLR2–/–) mice and their littermate (TLR2+/–) mice were used for the experiments. These mice were bred in our Institute under specific pathogen-free conditions. Purification of AC—The polysaccharide AC series of the Acetobacter species used in this study were prepared and purified by the method reported in a previous paper (30Minakami H. Entani E. Tayama K. Fujiyama S. Masai H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 2405-2414Google Scholar). Briefly, five strains of polysaccharide-producing Acetobacter species were cultivated in a shaking flask at 30 °C for 5 days, and the cells were removed by both centrifugation (10,000xg) of diluted broth and filtration with celite. The cell-free polysaccharides were precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, and the precipitate was dissolved in water. Then 5% aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution was added until no more precipitate was formed. The insoluble acidic polysaccharide-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide complex was collected by centrifugation and redissolved in 20% sodium chloride solution. After dialysis against running water, the polysaccharide was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water. The acidic polysaccharide thus obtained was dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. We named these polysaccharides AC series as follows: AC-1, Acetobacter polysaccharogenes MT-11-2; AC-2, A. polysaccharogenes 1007; AC-3, A. polysaccharogenes 1011; AC-4, Acetobacter xylinum MH-1597; AC-5, A. xylinum 1053). The endotoxin content of AC-1 (100 μg/ml) was estimated by using an endotoxin-specific chromogenic Limulus test (Wako) to be 32 pg/ml. This level of endotoxin does not affect TNF-α production in a culture supernatant of peritoneal adherent cells of C3H/HeN mice. In some experiments, AC-1 (100 μg/ml) was treated with 10 μg/ml of polymyxin B (Wako) at 37 °C for 2 h for deactivation of LPS activity or treated with actinases E (Kakenshouyaku) 37 °C for 24 h and then DEAE anion chromatography for removal of protein. AC-1 (5 mg) was incubated with 1 mg of β-(1,4)glucanase (Wako) in 0.05 m acetate buffer (2.5 ml) at pH 5.0 and 37 °C for 24 h. LPS was treated in the same manner. Analysis with High-performance Anion-exchange Chromatography Coupled with a Pulsed Amperometric Detection—The polysaccharides from Acetobacter species were subjected to acid hydrolysis using trifluoroacetic acid and high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection in an effort to identify optimum hydrolysis conditions for composition analysis of their carbohydrate components. The 10-mg sample was mixed with a final concentration 2 n trifluoroacetic acid containing 10 g/ml fucose as an internal standard in a glass tube sealed with a screw cap. After 18 h at 100 °C, solutions were dried under a stream of nitrogen; the residues were then redissolved in water and the hydrolyzate solutions transferred to autosampler vials. The hydrolyzates were stable in water at –20 °C for at least 1 month. Samples were analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography on a Dionex 500 system (Dionex Corp.) supplied with a pulsed amperometric detector. The system was equipped with a CarboPac column (packed silica appropriate for mono-, di-, tri-, and oligosaccharide analysis). Sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, 250 mm in water) was used as the eluant. Analyses were performed in the isocratic mode (% water/% NaOH = 48:52). Flow rate was set to 0.6 ml/min. To minimize carbonate formation in the system, which leads to a dramatic reduction of the retention times, a small amount of Ba(CH3COO)2 (4 mm) was added to the alkaline eluant. Data were collected and analyzed on computers equipped with the Dionex PeakNet software. Cell Preparation—All cell lines were grown in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air and passaged every 2 or 3 days to maintain logarithmic growth. Two mouse macrophage cell lines, J744.1 and RAW264.7, and a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney 293), were obtained from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience). Adherent cells from the peritoneal cavity of C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ, TLR2+/–, or TLR2–/– mice were used as a source of mouse macrophages. Briefly, peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum were cultured on plastic plates for 2 h at 37 °C. After nonadherent cells had been removed, fresh complete medium was added to the adherent cells with or without AC-1 or control reagents in the presence of IFN-γ (30 units/ml). Isolation of the Full-length cDNA Clone Encoding Mouse TLRs— Messenger RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cell using a Quick Prep Micro mRNA Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). mRNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase prior to reverse transcription-PCR using a Superscript 2 preamplification system. The resulting templates were subjected to PCR reactions with murine each TLR-specific primers. The primers used were as follows: TLR1 sense, 5′-TGCGGCCGCACCATGACTAAACCAAATTCC-3′; TLR1antisense, 5′-CGGGATCCTTGCTGTGTGTAACACGTTCCT-3′; TLR2 sense, 5′-TGCTGGAGCCCATTGAGAGGA-3′; TLR2 antisense, 5′-GGACTTTATTGCAGTTCTCAG-3′; TLR4 sense, 5′-TTGCGGCCGCTGCCAGGATGATGCCTCCCT-3′; TLR4 antisense, 5′-CGGGATCCGGTCCAAGTTGCCGTTTCTTGT-3′; TLR6 sense, 5′-TGCGGCCGCACCATGGTAAAGTCCCTCTGG-3′; TLR6 antisense, 5′-CGGGATCCAGTTTTCACATCCTCATTGACT-3′; TLR9 sense, 5′-AGCTTCCTGCTGGCTCAGC-3′; TLR9 antisense, 5′-GGACGCAGGATCACCAACAC-3′. Each PCR product was electrophoresed and transferred to and hybridized with murine TLR cDNA as a probe. DNA sequence analysis was performed on these plasmid clones using a DNA sequencer (model 373A) and a Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems). Plasmids—Murine TLR tagged with p3xFLAG at the carboxyl terminus was generated by PCR and ligated into the expression plasmid CMV14 (Sigma). All TLR plasmids used in transfections were purified using an Endo-free plasmid kit (Qiagen). A mouse CD14 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)-mCD14, and a NF-κB-responsive reporter, pGL3-NFκB-Luc, have been described previously (39Matsuguchi T. Takagi K. Musikacharoen T. Yoshikai Y. Blood. 2000; 95: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged each TLRs expression plasmid and mouse MD2 expression plasmid were generated by inserting the whole mTLR and MD-2 coding region cDNA into the p3xFLAG-CMV14 vector. TLR Expression by Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 1 × 108 cells/ml. The lysates were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk-TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) in TBST for 1 h, washed three times with TBST, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in 5% nonfat milk-TBST. After three washes in TBST, the blot was developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using a lumino-image analyzer (LAS-1000plus, Fujifilm). Luciferase Assay—HEK 293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well 1 day before transfection. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of pGL3-NF-κB/Luc (a luciferase reporter construct containing the consensus NF-κB binding sequence), 0.4 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase as an internal control (Promega, Madison, WI), and either 1.0 μg of mTLRs/FLAG using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, the HEK 293 cells were stimulated with AC-1 for 8 h. The cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Wallac 1420, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) or Steady-Glo Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Background luciferase activity was subtracted. Cytokine Measurement—J744.1 or RAW264.7 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated with the AC series, and the levels of IL-12 p40 and TNF-α production were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 24 h after incubation. Adherent cells of PEC from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ or TLR2+/– and TLR2–/– mice were incubated for 24 h with AC-1, LPS (Escherichia coli O55, Sigma), synthetic lipoprotein (palmitoyl-Cys(R,S)-2,3-di(plamitoyloxy)-propyl-Ala-Gly-OH, Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland), or synthetic lipid A (Ono-4007, Osaka Japan) in the presence or absence of IFN-γ, and the culture supernatant was then collected. IL-12 p40 and TNF-α levels in the culture supernatant were determined by ELISA. ELISAs for IL-12 p40 and TNF-α were performed using commercially available kits from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Immunization and Challenge—Mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 50 μg of chicken OVA (Gradee, Sigma) absorbed in 100 μl of the alum on day 0. Twelve days later, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μg of OVA in 100 μl of alum. The mice were challenged intragastrically with a suspension of 100 μl of AC-1 (10 mg/ml) or PBS on days 1, 4, 9, and 14. Spleens and sera were obtained on day 29 and stored at –20 °C until analysis. Measurement of Cytokine Production of Spleen Cells—Spleen cells were incubated on a nylon wool column at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 60 min. The cell population eluted from the column contained >90% T cells as determined by flow cytometric analysis with anti-CD3ϵ monoclonal antibody. T cells (5 × 105) and mitomycin C-treated naive spleen cells (5 × 105) were cultured in 96-well cell culture plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences) with 200 μg of OVA. After 48 h of culture, the cultured supernatants were collected, and the amounts of secreted IL-4 and IFN-γ in the supernatants were determined by ELISA. Commercial ELISA kits were used to measure the levels of IL-4 and IFN-γ (Genzyme Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a—Levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were determined by ELISA. Sample wells of an ELISA plate were coated with OVA and left overnight and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in borate-buffered saline (0.05 m borate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.6, 100 μl/well) at 37 °C for 30 min. Diluted samples (100 μl/well) were incubated for 90 min at room temperature (Samples for IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were diluted 1:1000, 1:10000, and 1:10000, respectively). The plates were washed with borate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgE (GAM/IgE(Fc) PO, Nordic), IgG1 (peroxidase rabbit anti-mouse IgG1, γ1-specific, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or IgG2a (peroxidase rabbit anti-mouse IgG2a, γ2-specific, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 90 min at room temperature. After further washing, plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 100 μl/well of o-phenylendiamine solution (1 μg/ml with 3% H2O2), and the OD was read at 492 nm. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of the data was determined by Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant. Structure of the Polysaccharide AC Series—Five strains of Acetobacter species that produce a new type of extracellular soluble polysaccharide were isolated, and the composition of their carbohydrate components was analyzed using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with a pulsed amperometric detector. A representative polysaccharide, AC-1, isolated from the culture filtrate of A. polysaccharogenes MT-11-2(1005) is composed of d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, and d-glucuronic acid in the molar ratio of 3.0:1.0:1.1:1.5. The composition of the carbohydrate components in each sample is shown in Table I. NMR spectroscopy indicated that the dominant d-glycosidic linkages must be in β-configuration (30Minakami H. Entani E. Tayama K. Fujiyama S. Masai H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 2405-2414Google Scholar). To obtain information on the mode of glycosidic linkages, both native and carboxyl-reduced polysaccharides were methylated, and the partially methylated sugars in the acid hydrolysate were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. The identities and proportions of the cleavage fragments of the native and carboxyl-reduced polysaccharides indicate that polysaccharide AC-1 has a highly branched structure with a repeating unit of 11 sugar residues. It contains a backbone chain of β-(1,4)-linked d-glucose, residues and two of the four d-glucose residues are branched at the O-3 position. There are two kinds of side chains; one is terminated with d-glucose residues and the other with d-glucuronic acid residues, as indicated by the increase in approximately 1 mol of tetra-O-methyl-d-glucose in the methylated, carboxyl-reduced polysaccharide. In addition, the polysaccharide contains (1,6)-linked d-glucose, (1,6)-linked d-galactose, and (1,2)-linked d-mannose residues. They are most probably located in the side chains, as revealed by the fragmentation analysis (31Tayama K. Minakami H. Entani E. Fujiyama S. Masai H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 959-966Google Scholar). Similar analysis was performed on AC-4 derived from A. xylinum MH-1597. The structural feature of polysaccharide AC-4 resembles that of polysaccharide AC-1 except for the sugar arrangement in the side chains. Thus, AC is a β-glucan composed of β-(1,4)glucan with branches of glucosyl residues (Fig. 1).Table IMolar ratio of carbohydrate components of polysaccharides AC seriesStrainGlcGalFucManRhaGlcAManAGlcNAcGalNAcnmolAC-1A. polysaccharogenes MT-11-2 (1005)3.01.0-1.1-1.50.1-+AC-2A. polysaccharogenes 10073.00.5-0.5-0.3-+-AC-3A. polysaccharogenes 10113.01.1-1.9-0.70.1--AC-5A. xylinum 10533.0--2.20.80.60.1-- Open table in a new tab Bacterial Cellulose Derived from Acetobacter Species Stimulated Mouse Macrophages to Produce IL-12 p40 and TNF-α—We screened soluble β-(1,4)glucans derived from Acetobacter species by measuring the levels of cytokine production in the mouse macrophage cell lines J774.1 and RAW264.7. Among the various preparations, AC-1, -2, and -3, all of which are derived from A. polysaccharogenes, stimulated J774.1 to produce IL-12 p40 (Fig. 2A). AC-1, derived from Acetobacter polysaccharogenes MT-11-2, at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml induced the maximal level of TNF-α production in both mouse macrophage cell lines among the preparations (Fig. 2, B and C). RAW264.7 cells did not produce IL-12 p40 in response to AC-1 or LPS (data not shown). AC-1 was used in the following experiments. Next, an experiment was carried out to determine whether AC-1 induces production of IL-12 p40 and TNF-α by primary culture of macrophages from naive mice. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, AC-1 induced significantly high levels of IL-12 p40 and TNF-α production by peritoneal adherent cells from BALB/c mice. To further purify the polysaccharides from AC-1, we treated AC-1 with protease and subjected them to ion exchange chromatography. Protease-treated products of AC-1 exhibited almost the same level of activity to induce TNF-α production as that of nontreated AC-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the protein moiety of AC-1 is not required for the activity of AC-1. Because Acetobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria containing LPS, we examined the effect of treatment of AC-1 with polymyxin B, which neutralizes LPS activities, on the production of TNF-α by macrophages. As shown in Fig. 3C, polymyxin B inhibited the activity of LPS (100 ng/ml) but not the activity of AC-1. Thus, the possibility that induction of the activity of AC-1 is due to contamination by LPS is ruled out. Backbone Chain of β-(1,4)Glucan Is Important for AC-1 Activity—As shown in Fig. 1, AC-1 has a branched structure containing a backbone chain of β-(1,4)-linked d-glucose, two of every four glucose residues being substituted at the O-3 positions to form two kinds of branches. To determine the involvement of β-(1,4)glucose linkage of AC-1 in stimulation of macrophages, AC-1"

These observations, along with the identification of formylmethionine at the N terminus of several mitochondrially synthesized proteins (6Feldman F. Mahler H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3702-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led to the widely accepted dogma that mitochondrial protein synthesis initiation requires fMet-tRNAfMet in a process involving IF2. However, the absolute requirement for formylation of initiator tRNA in mitochondrial protein synthesis has been recently brought into question by genetic and biochemical analyses in S. cerevisiae. It was shown that yeast strains unable to synthesize fMet-tRNAfMet , due either to mutations in the FMT1 gene encoding the formyltransferase, or the MIS1 gene encoding mitochondrial C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase, exhibit normal mitochondrial function and stability (7Li Y. Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2886-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This suggests that protein synthesis in yeast mitochondria can initiate with non-formylated Met-tRNAfMet . Furthermore, in vitro binding assays have shown that purified yeast mIF2 supports significant binding of both fMet-tRNAfMet and Met-tRNAfMet to Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits, with 6- to 7-fold higher binding of fMet-tRNAfMet than Met-tRNAfMet (8Garofalo C. Trinko R. Kramer G. Appling D.R. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, purified bovine mIF2 showed much greater preference (20- to 50-fold) for fMet-tRNAfMet relative to unformylated Met-tRNAfMet in binding assays in vitro (9Liao H.-X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20714-20719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domain structures of bacterial IF2 (10Laalami S. Sacerdot C. Vachon G. Mortensen K. Sperling-Petersen H.U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5805-5811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been elucidated. The N-terminal domains are highly variable in sequence and length between the different IF2s. A conserved, central G domain contains primary structure elements typical for GTP/GDP binding and GTPase activity. The C domain, also with several conserved amino acids, binds the initiator tRNA. More specifically, for Bacillus stearothermophilus IF2, the last 90 amino acids have been shown to contain the entire binding site for initiator tRNA (14Guenneugues M. Caserta E. Brandi L. Spurio R. Meunier S. Pon C.L. Boelens R. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5233-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The yeast mIF2 shares 30–40% homology with IF2s from mammalian mitochondria and E. coli, with most of the sequence identities found in the G and C domains. Yeast mIF2 is nuclear encoded by the IFM1 gene (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) containing codons for 676 amino acids. Mutations in this gene result in the petite phenotype (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), indicative of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis (16Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, the domain structure of yeast mIF2 was investigated by expressing full-length and truncated forms of the gene in an ifm1 deletion strain. In addition, a cDNA-encoding bovine mIF2 was expressed in yeast ifm1 deletion strains, and its activity in yeast mitochondrial protein synthesis was analyzed. Finally, the ability of bovine mIF2 to initiate protein synthesis in yeast mitochondria without formylation of the initiator tRNA was investigated using fmt1 mutants. Materials—The following reagents and materials were used: media (Difco Laboratories), 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA, Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd., Oxford, CT), Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), restriction enzymes and Geneticin (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD), erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and cycloheximide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). All other chemical reagents were from Sigma or Fisher. Strains and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are described in Table I. All strains were derived from the EUROSCARF deletion set (Frankfurt, Germany), including LOY1, which was obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection of EUROSCARF diploid Y21714. The Y03039 × Y11714 diploid was constructed by mating the two haploid strains and selecting for diploids nutritionally. Haploid double mutant strains (Δifm1 Δfmt1) were obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection of the Y03039 × Y11714 diploid, and the disruptions were confirmed by PCR.Table IYeast strains and plasmid constructsRelevant genotypeSourceYeast strainsY21714a/α his3/his3 leu2/leu2 lys2/LYS2 MET15/met15 ura3/ura3 ifm1::KanMX4/IFM1EUROSCARFLOY1α his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 ifm1::KanMX4This workY03039a his3 leu2 met15 ura3 fmt1::KanMX4EUROSCARFY11714α his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 ifm1::KanMX4EUROSCARFY03039 × Y11714a/α his3/his3 leu2/leu2 lys2/LYS2 MET15/met15 ura3/ura3 ifm1::KanMX4/IFM1 FMT1/fmt1::KanMX4This workPlasmid constructspVTU-IFM1pVT101U with full-length IFM1pVTU-IFM1-422pVT101U with first 421 amino acids of IFM1YEp-IFM1YEp352 with full-length IFM1YEp-IFM1-422YEp352 with first 421 amino acids of IFM1pVTU-IFM1-pre+G+CpVT101U with mitochondrial targeting sequence and G+C domain of IFM1pVTU-bmIF2pVT101U with bovine mIF2 behind MIS1 mitochondrial targeting sequencepVTL-IFM1pVT101L with full-length IFM1pVTL-IFM1-pre+G+CpVT101L with mitochondrial targeting sequence and G+C domain of IFM1 Open table in a new tab Rich media contained 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and either 2% glucose (YPD) or 3% glycerol and 2% ethanol (YPEG) as carbon sources. Synthetic minimal medium contained 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose or 2% galactose as carbon sources, and was supplemented with the following as necessary for growth (final concentration): l-leucine (30 mg/liter), l-histidine (20 mg/liter), l-lysine (30 mg/liter), l-methionine (20 mg/liter), and uracil (20 mg/liter). Solid media contained 2% agar. To select for yeast strains with an integrated kanamycin resistance cassette, Geneticin was added at a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. Diploids were sporulated on solid medium at 25 °C, and tetrads were dissected as described previously (17Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling in Δifm1 Δfmt1 yeast strains required the addition of 5-FOA to agar plates. 5-FOA plates contained 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% 5-FOA, 2% glucose, and amino acids at the concentrations used in minimal medium, except 50 mg/liter uracil. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid constructs are shown in Table I. Pfu DNA polymerase was used for PCR amplification of DNA when plasmids were constructed. The complete sequence of the yeast IFM1 gene was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using primers IFM1–5′ and IFM1–3′fl, containing HindIII and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (Table II). The resulting PCR product was digested and ligated into yeast expression vector, pVT101U (18Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), to generate the pVTU-IFM1 construct. Similarly, the nucleotide sequence encoding the N-terminal 421 amino acids of IFM1 was amplified using primers IFM1–5′ and IFM1–3′422, which contained HindIII and XbaI recognition sites, respectively. The IFM1–3′422 primer was designed to replace amino acid 422 with a stop codon. The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and ligated into pVT101U, to generate the pVTU-IFM1–422 construct. Full-length and truncated forms of yeast mIF2 were also cloned into the yeast vector, YEp352 (19Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The full-length IFM1 gene was subcloned from pVTU-IFM1 with SphI and BamHI. The truncated version of IFM1 was cleaved from pVTU-IFM1 using SphI and BglII, which cleaves at codon 423. The resulting DNA fragments were ligated into the SphI and BamHI sites of YEp352 to construct YEp352-IFM1 and YEp352-IFM1–422, respectively. Both constructs include the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (ADH) from the pVT101U vector to drive expression of the IFM1 insert. The YEp352-IFM1–422 construct does not have a stop codon in the insert sequence and when expressed produces a protein product with an additional 34 vector-encoded amino acids at its C terminus before an in-frame stop codon is read.Table IISequences of oligonucleotide primersNameSequenceIFM1-5′CTTCCATAAGCTTACTAATAGATCATGCTCIFM1-3′flGCGGGATCCTTACAAGTAACGAGGAACTCGIFM1-3′422CTTCTAGAAGATCTTACCTTTIFM1-144-5′AGATGGTATAGAGCCCCCGTGGTAACTCS-AGCGAAGAAGTCCAAAGCTIFM1-41-3′GGGGCTCTATACCATCTTTGCTGGCACS-BCTGCACAATATTTCAAGCbIF2CTGCTTCTCAACAGAAATCTCCATTACCTTCbIF2DACCGTCTAGATTAAAATCCTGGATCCCAAGMis1ACAGCAAGCTTGCTAAAAGGAAATGTTGTCGMis1BGAGATTTCTGTTGAGAAGCATGCACAGTTG Open table in a new tab A plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the mature bovine mIF2 was obtained from Dr. Linda Spremulli (University of North Carolina). To express the protein in yeast mitochondria, this cDNA, along with a yeast mitochondrial targeting sequence, was cloned into a yeast expression vector, using overlap extension PCR (20Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Specifically, the DNA encoding the bovine mIF2 was PCR-amplified from the plasmid using 5′ and 3′ primers, bIF2C and bIF2D. The 100-nucleotide mitochondrial targeting sequence of the yeast MIS1 gene (21Shannon K.W. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7717-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from a plasmid containing the full-length MIS1 open reading frame using primers Mis1A and Mis1B. The bIF2C primer contained 10 nucleotides of MIS1 mitochondrial targeting sequence on the 5′ end, and the Mis1B primer contained 10 nucleotides of bovine mIF2 cDNA on the 5′ end. The resulting PCR products from these two reactions were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and combined in a second PCR reaction with primers Mis1A and bIF2D. This second PCR reaction generated a product with the MIS1 targeting sequence fused to the mature bovine mIF2 cDNA, at codon 78. The final PCR product was cleaved with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into pVT101U, to generate the pVT-bmIF2 construct. A plasmid containing the yeast IFM1 G+C domain fused behind the predicted IFM1 mitochondrial targeting sequence was also constructed using overlap extension PCR (20Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The IFM1 sequence was PCR-amplified from pVTU-IFM1 starting at the nucleotides encoding amino acid 144 of the full-length protein. Oligonucleotide primers IFM1–144-5′ and CS-A, which hybridizes downstream of the pVT101U multiple cloning region, were used for this reaction. A second PCR reaction amplified the first 41 codons of IFM1 with primers IFM1–41-3′ and CS-B, which hybridizes upstream of the pVT101U multiple cloning site. These two PCR products were used in a third reaction, along with primers CS-A and CS-B to generate a product containing the IFM1 G+C domain fused behind the predicted IFM1 presequence. This final PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into pVT101U to generate the pVTU-IFM1-pre+G+C construct. DNA sequence analysis of the inserts of all plasmid constructs was performed at the DNA facility of the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. For plasmid shuffling experiments, the full-length IFM1 gene and the IFM1-pre+G+C insert were subcloned from the pVT101U vectors into pVT101L plasmids (18Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The inserts were removed from pVTU-IFM1 and pVTU-IFM1pre+G+C using SphI and ligated into the SphI-cleaved pVT101L plasmid to generate pVTL-IFM1 and pVTL-IFM1-pre+G+C constructs. Complementation Analyses—Plasmids were transformed into various yeast strains as described previously (17Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Due to the high rate of irreversible loss of mitochondrial DNA in ifm1 disrupted strains, heterozygous diploid strains (IFM1/ifm1::KanMX4) were typically transformed with a plasmid expressing IF2 prior to sporulation and tetrad dissection when testing the function of the plasmid-borne gene. Following sporulation and tetrad dissection, haploid spores were screened for mutant ifm1 or fmt1 loci by yeast colony PCR (22Sathe G.M. O'Brien S. McLaughlin M.M. Watson F. Livi G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling was used to test the function of pVTL-IFM1 and pVTL-IFM1-pre+G+C constructs in Δifm1 Δfmt1 mutant yeast strains. The double mutant strain carrying the pVTU-bmIF2 plasmid was transformed with pVTL-IFM1, pVTL-IFM1-pre+G+C, or pVT101L, selecting for transformants on minimal medium lacking uracil and leucine. Transformants were grown in +Ura media and plated onto 5-FOA plates to select for strains that evicted the pVTU-bmIF2 plasmid. The resulting Δifm1 Δfmt1 strains carrying the pVTL-IFM1, the pVTL-IFM1-pre+G+C, or the empty pVT101L vector were tested for growth on YPEG plates. Isolation of Yeast Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from yeast by differential centrifugation according to Glick and Pon (23Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), scaled down for 4 liters of yeast culture. The concentration of mitochondrial protein in crude mitochondrial pellets was estimated as described previously (23Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These pellets were resuspended in 0.6 m sorbitol/20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4) and 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Resuspended mitochondria were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C for in organello aminoacylation assays. Actual concentration of mitochondrial protein was 10–12 mg/ml according to BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assays (Pierce). In Organello Aminoacylation Assays—In organello aminoacylation assays for detection of Met-tRNA formyltransferase activity were performed essentially as described previously (24Tan T.H.P. Bochud-Allemann N. Horn E.K. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except 20–40 μCi of [35S]methionine were used rather than a labeled methionine/cysteine mixture. Following a 15-min, 30 °C incubation with radioactive methionine, total RNA was isolated from mitochondrial pellets using TRI reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was resuspended in 15 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.2) and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C, to deacylate the tRNA. Escherichia coli tRNAfMet (Sigma) was aminoacylated as described (8Garofalo C. Trinko R. Kramer G. Appling D.R. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and ∼1 pmol (0.015 μCi) of each, [ 35s]Met-tRNAfmet and f[ 35s]Met-tRNAfmet , were deacylated along with the mitochondrial tRNA and used as standards. The deacylated tRNA was ethanol-precipitated, and the supernatant containing the released [35S]methionine or formyl[35S]methionine was lyophilized and resuspended in 15 μl of water. 2 μl of each reaction, along with 1 μl of each standard, were spotted onto a cellulose 300 thin-layer chromatography plate (Selecto Scientific), which was developed in butanol:acetic acid: H2O (2:1:1). The dried plate was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and scanned with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445SI, to detect labeled methionine and formylmethionine. Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—In vivo labeling of mitochondrial translation products was performed as described (25Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Pon L.A. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. Vol. 65. Academic Press, San, Diego2001: 429-438Google Scholar), using 1175 Ci/mmol [35S]methionine. Cells were grown in minimal media with 2% galactose. As a negative control, some strains were grown in minimal galactose medium containing 2 mg/ml erythromycin to completely inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis (26Terpstra P. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12662-12669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Erythromycin was also present in the buffer during the labeling procedures for the cell samples grown with this inhibitor. Following the 30-min labeling incubation, samples were processed as described previously (25Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Pon L.A. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. Vol. 65. Academic Press, San, Diego2001: 429-438Google Scholar), except that the acetone wash was done twice. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the dried gel analyzed by phosphorimaging. Predicted Domain Structure of Yeast mIF2—The primary amino acid sequence of yeast mIF2, encoded by the nuclear IFM1 gene, is 30–40% identical to IF2s from E. coli and bovine mitochondria, with highest homology in the G and C domains of the protein. The predicted domain structure for yeast mIF2, based on E. coli and bovine mIF2 domain structures, is shown in Fig. 1A. A mitochondrial targeting sequence, predicted to be 41 amino acids in length (PSORT II analysis, available at psort.nibb.ac.jp/form2.html), is followed by the N-terminal domain, which is quite divergent among all IF2 sequences elucidated to date. A highly conserved G domain beginning at amino acid 144 follows the N-terminal domain and is responsible for the GTPase activity of the protein. The C domain, extending from amino acid 300 to 676, also contains several conserved residues and is likely responsible for initiator tRNA binding. Complementation of an ifm1 Null Mutant—Vambutas et al. (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a respiratory-deficient ifm1 mutant strain. Mutant cells were capable of growth on glucose but were unable to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source, glycerol plus ethanol. The resulting petite phenotype was rescued by expression of the full-length IFM1 gene. Furthermore, they reported that expression of the N-terminal 422 amino acids of IFM1 (indicated in Fig. 1A) was sufficient to complement the respiratory deficiency of their ifm1 mutant strain. This truncated protein lacks most of the C domain, and it is the C-terminal part of the C domain that binds fMet-tRNAfMet in B. stearothermophilus IF2 (14Guenneugues M. Caserta E. Brandi L. Spurio R. Meunier S. Pon C.L. Boelens R. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5233-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Meunier S. Spurio R. Czisch M. Wechselberger R. Guenneugues M. Gualerzi C.O. Boelens R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1918-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This result, therefore, might indicate significant differences in the domain structure of yeast mIF2, as compared with other IF2s. However, the nature of the chromosomal ifm1 mutant used by Vambutas et al. (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was not defined, and it is possible that the rescue by this truncated protein resulted from a gene conversion event or from intragenic complementation (28Zimmermann F.K. Gundelach E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1969; 103: 348-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The truncated protein might not be functional in an ifm1 null mutant. Therefore, we constructed an ifm1 deletion strain (LOY1) by sporulation and tetrad dissection of the EUROSCARF diploid, Y21714 (IFM1/ifm1::KanMX4). As expected, LOY1 is respiratory-deficient. Plasmids for expression of the full-length IFM1 gene and the first 421 amino acids of IFM1 were constructed and transformed into the LOY1 mutant strain, which was then tested for the ability to grow non-fermentatively on glycerol plus ethanol (Fig. 1B). The plasmid construct expressing the full-length IFM1 gene, pVTU-IFM1, was able to rescue the respiratory deficiency (petite phenotype) of the ifm1 deletion strain (Fig. 1B). However, the plasmid expressing the first 421 amino acids of IFM1 in the pVT101U vector (pVTU-IFM1–422) was not able to rescue growth on glycerol plus ethanol plates (Fig. 1B). Because of the potential for irreversible loss of mitochondrial function in strains defective in mitochondrial protein synthesis (29Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), these two constructs were also transformed into the heterozygous diploid, Y21714 (IFM1/ifm1::KanMX4). Following sporulation and tetrad dissection, strains carrying both the ifm1 chromosomal mutation and the IFM1-expressing plasmids were tested for growth on glycerol plus ethanol media. As before, the full-length IFM1 was able to rescue the petite phenotype, but the construct expressing the N-terminal 421 amino acids of IFM1 was not (data not shown). Upon closer inspection, we noted that the truncated IFM1 construct used by Vambutas et al. (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) encoded 34 additional, unrelated amino acids after amino acid 422 before reaching a stop codon in the vector. The C-terminal fusion of these unrelated amino acids could possibly affect the function of the expressed protein in rescuing the petite phenotype. For this reason, we prepared a second construct (YEp352-IFM1–422) to express an identical protein to the one reported by Vambutas et al. (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with the additional 34 amino acids at the C terminus. We also inserted the full-length IFM1 into the same vector (YEp352-IFM1). These constructs are identical to those used by Vambutas et al. (15Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), except that in our case, expression was driven from the ADH promoter rather than the IFM1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 1B, YEp352-IFM1–422 was unable to rescue the petite phenotype of our ifm1 null mutant. Full-length IFM1 in the same vector, however, did rescue the petite phenotype. Ma and Spremulli (13Ma J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5805-5811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that the purified G+C domain of the bovine mIF2 is able to promote GTP-dependent binding of fMet-tRNAfMet to mitochondrial ribosomes in vitro. Similarly, binding studies in vitro using yeast mIF2 indicate that the G+C domain alone is capable of binding initiator tRNA (8Garofalo C. Trinko R. Kramer G. Appling D.R. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine if yeast mIF2 is functional in the initiation of protein synthesis in vivo without its N-terminal region, a plasmid expressing just the G+C domain of IFM1 behind its predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (pVTU-IFM1-pre+G+C) was transformed into the ifm1 mutant strain, LOY1. The resulting transformants grew on glycerol plus ethanol media, showing that the G+C domain of yeast mIF2 is sufficient to sustain mitochondrial protein synthesis in vivo (Fig. 1B). Upon storage at –70 °C, LOY1 lost the ability to be rescued by plasmid-borne IFM1, probably due to loss of mitochondrial DNA. This is consistent with the high frequency of ρ0 and ρ– in mutants deficient in mitochondrial protein synthesis (29Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, subsequent experiments were initiated in heterozygous diploids, to ensure stability of the mitochond"
https://openalex.org/W2062116865,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DPP1-encoded diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate to form phosphatidate and Pi. The enzyme also dephosphorylates phosphatidate to form diacylglycerol and Pi. Because diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, phosphatidate, and diacylglycerol have roles as lipid signal molecules in higher eukaryotic cells, it is important to understand how diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase is regulated. Analysis of DPP1 expression using PDPP1-lacZ reporter genes with a series of deletions from the 5′ end of the promoter indicated sequences responsible for enzyme expression. Three binding sites (URSPDS) for transcription factor Gis1p were identified in the DPP1 promoter (consensus sequence of 5′-T(A/T)AGGGAT-3′). A gis1Δ mutant exhibited elevated levels of DPP1 expression and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase activity. Direct interaction between Gis1p and DPP1 promoter elements was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutations in the three URSPDS elements within the DPP1 promoter abolished Gis1p-DNA interactions in vitro and abolished the regulation of DPP1 in vivo. These data indicated that Gis1p was a repressor of DPP1 expression. Phospholipid composition analysis of the gis1Δ mutant showed that Gis1p played a role in regulating the cellular level of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, as well as the levels of the major phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DPP1-encoded diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate to form phosphatidate and Pi. The enzyme also dephosphorylates phosphatidate to form diacylglycerol and Pi. Because diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, phosphatidate, and diacylglycerol have roles as lipid signal molecules in higher eukaryotic cells, it is important to understand how diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase is regulated. Analysis of DPP1 expression using PDPP1-lacZ reporter genes with a series of deletions from the 5′ end of the promoter indicated sequences responsible for enzyme expression. Three binding sites (URSPDS) for transcription factor Gis1p were identified in the DPP1 promoter (consensus sequence of 5′-T(A/T)AGGGAT-3′). A gis1Δ mutant exhibited elevated levels of DPP1 expression and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase activity. Direct interaction between Gis1p and DPP1 promoter elements was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutations in the three URSPDS elements within the DPP1 promoter abolished Gis1p-DNA interactions in vitro and abolished the regulation of DPP1 in vivo. These data indicated that Gis1p was a repressor of DPP1 expression. Phospholipid composition analysis of the gis1Δ mutant showed that Gis1p played a role in regulating the cellular level of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, as well as the levels of the major phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. DGPP 1The abbreviations used are: DGPP, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: DGPP, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. is a minor phospholipid in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Wu W.-I.

Its formation from phosphatidate and ATP is catalyzed by phosphatidate kinase (1Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). DGPP accumulation is transient and coincides with a rise in phosphatidate levels (3Munnik T. Meijer H.J.G. Ter Riet B.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As phosphatidate itself is a potent signal mediator, researchers have hypothesized that DGPP serves as a precursor of a specific pool of phosphatidate (1Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or is synthesized as a means to attenuate phosphatidate-driven signals (4Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, DGPP itself specifically enhances prostaglandin secretion in macrophages (7Balboa M. Balsinde J. Dillon D.A. Carman G.M. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 522-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a key event in the leukocyte immunoinflammatory response. Because DGPP has not been identified in mammalian membranes (8Dillon D.A. Chen X. Zeimetz G.M. Wu W.-I. Waggoner D.W. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10361-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that DGPP in the membranes of an invading organism may help macrophages target foreign cells (7Balboa M.

The yeast DGPP phosphatase enzyme is a member of the lipid phosphate phosphatase superfamily (10Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14606-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DGPP phosphatase utilizes a wide range of lipid phosphate substrates in vitro (1Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B.

Chem. 1999; 273: 14331-14338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar).To better understand the function of DGPP, we have focused on the regulation of DGPP phosphatase expression in S. cerevisiae. DPP1 expression increases under stressful growth conditions. For example, the expression of DPP1 and DGPP phosphatase activity is induced in stationary phase (17Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G.-S. Quinn J.E. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40887-40896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a condition when cells cease proliferation because of nutrient starvation (18Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnson G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation is further enhanced by inositol supplementation (17Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G.-S. Quinn J.E. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40887-40896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, DPP1 expression is tightly coupled to zinc homeostasis (19Han G.-S. Johnston C.N. Chen X. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10126-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Zinc deprivation results in induced levels of DPP1 expression and the DGPP phosphatase enzyme (19Han G.-S. Johnston C.N. Chen X. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10126-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, DPP1 is one of the most highly regulated genes that respond to zinc in the entire genome (20Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this work, we demonstrated that DPP1 was negatively regulated by the transcription factor Gis1p. Gis1p is primarily expressed during stationary phase (22Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and functions as both a transcription repressor (23Jang Y.K. Wang L. Sancar G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and activator (22Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our analysis showed that Gis1p repressed the expression of DPP1 and DGPP phosphatase. Gis1p bound to three URSPDS elements within the DPP1 promoter, and loss of any URSPDS element affected DPP1 expression in vivo. Phospholipid analysis of a gis1Δ mutant showed a decrease in the level of DGPP, as well as alterations in the major phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Cultures were harvested, washed in deionized distilled water, diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in media containing 0 or 1.4 μm zinc sulfate, and grown for 24 h. Cultures were then diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and grown to stationary phase in media containing 0 or 1.4 μm zinc sulfate. This two-step regimen was required to deplete internal stores of zinc from the cell. For zinc-free glassware, items were washed with Liqui-Nox and rinsed several times with distilled water followed by a final rinse with deionized distilled water. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl (pH 7.4)) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to cultures of DH5α carrying plasmids. Yeast and bacterial media were supplemented with 2 and 1.5% agar, respectively, for growth on plates.For heterologous expression of the His-tagged GIS1 gene product, E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS bearing plasmid pGH305 was grown in 4 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Cells were grown to saturation at 37 °C, and the cultures were diluted into 50 ml of fresh medium (initial cell density of A 600 nm = 0.025). Cultures were grown until the cell density reached an A 600 nm of 0.5, diluted into 1000 ml of fresh medium, and grown until the cell density reached an A 600 nm of 0.5. Expression of the GIS1 gene was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the growth medium. After incubation for 2 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.DNA Manipulations and Amplification of DNA by PCR—Plasmid and genomic DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligations were performed by standard protocols (26Sambrook J.

Conditions for the amplification of DNA by PCR using Vent polymerase were optimized as described by Innis and Gelfand (28Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J.

Plasmid pJO2 (PDPP1-lacZ) contains the DPP1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene of E. coli (17Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G.-S. Quinn J.E. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40887-40896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGH210 replaces the EcoRI fragment of pJO2 with a truncated DPP1 promoter containing 0.44 kb of the upstream sequence (19Han G.-S. Johnston C.N. Chen X. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Carman G.M. J.

Using appropriate primers, a series of PDPP1-lacZ deletion plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification using plasmid pJO2 as the template. Each PCR product was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and substituted for the 0.87-kb HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pJO2.

For this construction, 2.7- and 1.8-kb DNA fragments were amplified using genomic DNA as template with restriction sites incorporated at both 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were digested with SacI/PstI or PstI/SalI as required. Plasmid YEp352 (29Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) was digested with SacI and SalI. The vector and both PCR fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated at 16 °C for 15 h to generate plasmid pJO19. Plasmid construction was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. The GIS1 open reading frame (2.7 kb) was amplified by PCR using plasmid pJO19 as the template, and the PCR products were digested with XhoI and BamHI. This DNA fragment was cloned into the XhoI/BamHI site of plasmid pET-15b to generate plasmid pGH305. The correct in-frame fusion was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis.The Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate plasmids pJO20 through pJO26. These plasmids were derivatives of pJO2 (PDPP1-lacZ) and contained mutations in the three URSPDS elements of the DPP1 promoter. The core of each URSPDS contains the sequence 5′-AGGGA-3′ (30Boorstein W.R. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Each site was mutated to convert the sequence 5′-AGGGA-3′ to 5′-AAAAA-3′. Mutagenesis was not performed directly with plasmid pJO2 because of the template size limitations of this method. Accordingly, the DPP1 promoter of plasmid pJO2 was first subcloned into the EcoRI site of plasmid pPCR-Script AMP SK(+) to form plasmid pJO18. Single mutations in URSPDS1, URSPDS2, and URSPDS3 were constructed using plasmid pJO18 as the template to make pJO18-S1, pJO18-S2, and pJO18-S3. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild type DPP1 promoter in plasmid pJO2 was replaced with the mutated DPP1 promoters from pJO18-S1, pJO18-S2, and pJO18-S3 to form plasmids pJO20-pJO22. The orientation of the inserted fragments was verified with PstI digestion.Construction of the gis1Δ and rph1Δ Mutants—The gis1Δ and rph1Δ mutants were constructed by the PCR-mediated gene deletion method of Brachmann et al. (31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Plasmids pRS413 and pRS415 were templates for PCR. The disruption DNA fragment for the GIS1 deletion (gis1Δ::LEU2) was amplified using pRS415 with primers containing the flanking sequences of the GIS1 gene. The disruption DNA fragment for the RPH1 deletion (rph1Δ::HIS3) was amplified using pRS413 with primers containing the flanking sequences of the RPH1 gene. These DNA fragments were transformed into W303–1A to replace the chromosomal copies of the GIS1 and RPH1 genes with the auxotrophic marker genes by homologous recombination (31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Deletion of each gene in the transformants was confirmed by PCR using appropriate primers for the GIS1 and RPH1 genes, respectively. The gis1Δ and rph1Δ mutants that we isolated were designated strains JOY37 and JOY38, respectively.Expression and Purification of His-tagged Gis1p from E. coli—All steps in the purification of the recombinant Gis1p were performed at 4 °C. E. coli cells containing the His-tagged Gis1p were washed once in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and suspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by a freeze-thaw cycle followed by two passes through a French press at 20,000 pounds/square inch. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell extract (supernatant) was gently mixed for 2 h with 2 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-NTA-agarose. The enzyme/Ni2+-NTA-agarose mixture was packed in a 10-ml PolyPrep disposable column. The column was washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 45 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The His-tagged protein was then eluted from the column in 1-ml fractions with a total of 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The purified Gis1p preparation was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10% glycerol and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Complementary single stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Table III). The annealing reactions contained 10 μm oligonucleotide in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Samples were incubated for 2 min at 85 °C and then for 15 min at 65, 37, 25, and 4 °C. To facilitate labeling, the oligonucleotides were designed to leave a 5′ overhanging end after annealing. Approximately 1.5 μg of double stranded DNA was incubated with 5 units of Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dTTP (400–800 Ci/nmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. Unincorporated dNTPs were separated from the labeled DNA using ProbeQuant G-50 Spin columns.Table IIIDNA fragments used for electrophoretic mobility shift assaysElementAnnealed oligonucleotidesaUnderlined sequences are the URSPDS elements, and bold sequences are URSPDS element mutations.URSPDS15′-GCAGCTCTTCATAAAGGGACAACACGGCTT-3′3′-CGTCGAGAAGTATTTCCCTGTTGTGCCGAA-5′URSPDS25′-GTTAGAGTGCGATCCCTTTAAAAAAAAGTA-3′3′-CAATCTCACGCTAGGGAAATTTTTTTTCAT-5′URSPDS35′-TCTAGAAACGTTAGGGAATAAACTGTTATC-3′3′-AGATCTTTGCAATCCCTTATTTGACAATAG-5′URSPDS1 mutant5′-GCAGCTCTTCATAAAAAAACAACACGGCTT-3′3′-CGTCGAGAAGTATTTTTTTGTTGTGCCGAA-5′URSPDS2 mutant5′-GTTAGAGTGCGATTTTTTTAAAAAAAAGTA-3′3′-CAATCTCACGCTAAAAAAATTTTTTTTCAT-5′URSPDS3 mutant5′-TCTAGAAACGTTAAAAAATAAACTGTTATC-3′3′-AGATCTTTGCAATTTTTTATTTGACAATAG-5′a Underlined sequences are the URSPDS elements, and bold sequences are URSPDS element mutations.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in a 20-μl volume containing 4 pmol of radiolabeled DNA probe (1.75 × 105 cpm/pmol), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 6 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and the indicated concentrations of recombinant Gis1p. DNA-protein complexes were allowed to form at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were mixed with 3 μl of loading solution (40% glucose, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) and resolved from free DNA by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels (1.5-mm thickness) at 200 V for 2 h. Gels were dried onto blotting paper, and the reaction products were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis.Preparation of the Cell Extract and the Total Membrane Fraction— Yeast cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm Na2-EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Cells were disrupted by homogenization with chilled glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) using a Biospec Products Bead-Beater. Samples were homogenized for ten 1-min bursts followed by a 2-min cooling between bursts at 4 °C. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The total membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the cell extract at 100,000 × g for 2 h. Membranes were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-maleate (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol (w/v), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration of the cell extracts and membrane fractions were determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal.

Here we delineate bound orientations of d-tubocurarine (d-TC) and its methylated derivative metocurine using mutagenesis, ligand binding measurements, and computational methods. When tested against a series of lysine mutations in the ϵ subunit, the two antagonists show marked differences in the consequences of the mutations on binding affinity. The mutations ϵL117K, ϵY111K, and ϵL109K decrease affinity of metocurine by up to 3 orders of magnitude but only slightly alter affinity of d-TC. At the α subunit face of the binding site, the mutation αY198T decreases affinity of both antagonists, but αY198F preferentially enhances affinity of d-TC. Computation of antagonist docking orientations, based on our structural model of the α—ϵ site of the human AChR, indicates distinct orientations of each antagonist; the flatter metocurine fits into a pocket formed principally by the ϵ subunit, whereas the more compact d-TC spans the narrower crevasse between α and ϵ subunits. The side chains of ϵTyr-111 and ϵThr-117 juxtapose one of two quaternary nitrogens in metocurine but are remote from the equivalent quaternary nitrogen in d-TC, which instead closely approaches αTyr-198. The different docked orientations arise through tilt of the curariform scaffold by ∼60° normal to the nitrogen-nitrogen axis, together with a 20° rotation about the axis. The overall mutagenesis and computational results show that despite their similar structures, d-TC and metocurine bind in distinctly different orientations to the adult human AChR.

The overall mutagenesis and computational results show that despite their similar structures, d-TC and metocurine bind in distinctly different orientations to the adult human AChR. The ligand binding domain of the nicotinic receptor has served as a prototype for understanding ligand recognition in members of the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Contained within the synaptic protrusion of these receptors, the ligand-binding sites are formed at interfaces between subunits. In the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptors; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; α-bgt, α-bungarotoxin; d-TC, d-tubocurarine; MD, molecular dynamics; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells. found at the motor end plate, the α subunit forms one face of each binding site, whereas a non-α subunit, γ, δ, or ϵ, forms the opposing face (1Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 3: 431-446Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Residues critical for ligand binding have been identified by using subunit chimeras and point mutations combined with measurements of binding of probes that interact with structures in both subunits at the interface. These probes helped establish the subunit interface structure of the ligand binding domain and include curare and its derivatives (2Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Chiara D. Xie Y. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6689-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), α-conotoxins (4Sine S.M.

The recent x-ray structure of acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) elegantly confirmed the subunit interface structure of the ligand binding domain (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Curare and its derivatives competitively antagonize the AChR found at the motor end plate by occupying one of the two ligand-binding sites (9Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10144-10156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Steinbach J.H. Chen Q. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 230-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curare binds more tightly to the α–ϵ than to the α–δ site, and thus its functional antagonism at tens of nanomolar concentrations results from occupancy of this high affinity binding site. Curariform antagonists contain a rigid, cyclic hydrocarbon scaffold bearing two tetrahydroisoquinoline rings and two electron-deficient nitrogen atoms separated by about 9 Å (11Sobell H.M. Sakore T.D. Tavale S.S. Canepa F.G. Pauling P. Petcher T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Codding P.W. James M.N.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1973; 29: 935-942Crossref Google Scholar). Thus two appropriately spaced, positively charged centers represent the minimal components required in a high affinity competitive antagonist, also known as the antagonist pharmacophore. At the core of the antagonist pharmacophore concept is the idea that structurally related antagonists block function by binding to the α–ϵ site in the same orientation. We therefore sought to determine whether different methylated derivatives of curare bind in the same orientation to the human muscle AChR, and we addressed this question using mutagenesis, measurements of antagonist binding, and computational determinations of antagonist docking orientation. We examined binding of d-TC and its fully methylated derivative metocurine to AChRs containing mutations of key residues at the ligand-binding site. By using our previously described structural model of the AChR ligand binding domain, based on lysine scanning and homology modeling (13Sine S.M. Wang H.-L. Bren N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29210-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we used molecular dynamics simulation to generate multiple snapshots of the binding site structure, and computed optimal docking orientations of antagonist for each snapshot. Unexpectedly, both our experimental and computational determinations of antagonist binding reveal that d-TC and metocurine bind in distinctly different orientations to the adult human muscle AChR. The results have important consequences for the design of neuromuscular blocking agents and of drugs targeted against other types of nicotinic receptors. Materials— 125I-α-Bungarotoxin was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and d-tubocurarine (d-TC) chloride from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The fully methylated analog of d-tubocurarine, metocurine iodide, was a gift from the Eli Lilly Co. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were from the American Type Culture Collection. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Sources of the adult human AChR subunit cDNAs subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRBG4 are as described (14Ohno K. Wang H.-L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel E.G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mutations were constructed using the QuickChange kit from Stratagene. The presence of each mutation and the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by automated dye terminator sequencing. Expression of Mutant Receptors and Ligand Binding Measurements—HEK cells were transfected with mutant or wild type AChR subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (2Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In brief, 3 days after transfection, intact HEK cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm EDTA. Ligand binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-bungarotoxin (α-bgt) binding (15Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were centrifuged, resuspended in high potassium Ringer's solution, and divided into aliquots for ligand binding measurements. Potassium Ringer's solution contains the following: 140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 30 mg/liter bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 10–11 mm NaOH. Specified concentrations of competing ligand were added prior to adding 125I-α-bgt, which was allowed to occupy approximately half of the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by adding potassium Ringer's solution containing 100 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. Cells were filtered through Whatman GF-B filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester and washed with potassium Ringer's solution. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 mm acetylcholine. The total number of 125I-α-bgt-binding sites was determined by incubation with the toxin for 90 min. The initial rate of toxin binding was calculated as described (15Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield fractional ligand occupancy. Competition measurements were analyzed according to the sum of two binding sites present in equal numbers as shown in Equation 1, 1-Y=0.5/(1+[ligand]/KA)+0.5/(1+[ligand]/KB)(Eq. 1) where Y is fractional ligand occupancy, and K A and K B are intrinsic dissociation constants. Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation—To account for the contribution of protein dynamics to ligand docking, we carried out a 1-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of our the structural model of human AChR (13Sine S.M. Wang H.-L. Bren N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29210-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the AMBER 7 program, which included the parm 99 force field (27Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). The protein was solvated in a water box using the TIP3P model for water molecules, extended at least 10 Å in each direction from the protein (28,165 water molecules included), and 66 Na+ and 16 Cl– counter ions were added to neutralize the system by employing the LEAP module of AMBER 7. The entire system was first energy-minimized by employing the SANDER module of AMBER 7 and then gradually heated to 298 K using a 30-ps heating step; in these computations the Particle Mesh Ewald method was employed to calculate long range electrostatic interactions. Following the heating step, the system was maintained at 298 K, and the MD simulation was computed at 1-fs intervals with frames collected every 1 ps. Because the linker joining β–strands 8 and 9 in each subunit (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 13Sine S.M. Wang H.-L. Bren N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29210-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) did not achieve a single stable structure in preliminary MD simulations, the protein main chain atoms were constrained in space, but side chain atoms were freely flexible. During the simulation, the SHAKE algorithm was turned on to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the nonbonded interaction cut-off was set to 8.0 Å. Trajectories from the subsequent 1,000-ps MD simulation were collected for docking computation. From each of the 1,000 frames of the dynamic AChR structure, atomic coordinates of the α and ϵ subunits were collected for docking computation. Partial charges were then assigned to each atom of the α and ϵ subunits using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charge model, which is used in the application of the AMBER force field. Crystal structures of metocurine (12Codding P.W. James M.N.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1973; 29: 935-942Crossref Google Scholar) and d-TC (11Sobell H.M. Sakore T.D. Tavale S.S. Canepa F.G. Pauling P. Petcher T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were used to prepare the ligands for docking. Hydrogen atoms were added by employing QUANTA, followed by a 500-step energy minimization of all the hydrogen atoms using the CHARMM module in QUANTA. Partial charges were assigned to each atom of the ligand using the semiempirical charge model-1 (CM1) in the AMSOL 6.7.2 program (16Winget P. Thompson J.D. Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. J. Phys. Chem. 2002; 106: 5160-5168Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following settings: the SM5.4PDA solvation mode, the AM1 semiempirical method, water as solvent, the “TRUSTE” optimizer, and “CHARGE” set to +2 based on the net charge of both ligands. Docking computations were performed using the AUTODOCK 3.0.3 program. Nonpolar hydrogens were removed from each ligand, and their partial atomic charges were united with the bonded carbon atoms. For each frame of the α–ϵ subunit pair, the ligand was arbitrarily positioned at the subunit interface using QUANTA, and then docking computations were performed using the Lamarkian genetic algorithm with grid sizes 40 × 40 × 40 (grid spacing 0.375 Å), yielding 10 docked conformations per frame. During the docking computation, free rotation was allowed about bonds to hydroxyl or methyl groups of each curare analog (Fig. 1), but the remaining atoms were maintained in the coordinates of the crystal structures. Parameters in AUTODOCK were assigned default values. The resulting 10,000 docking orientations for each ligand produced by AUTODOCK 3.0.3 were analyzed by grouping them into clusters with similar ligand orientations. We employed a cluster analysis that classified structures as similar in 1-Å intervals of the ligand root mean square deviation. This study arose from the chance observation that a series of lysine mutations in the human ϵ subunit, previously used to assess surface or buried orientations of residue side chains (13Sine S.M. Wang H.-L. Bren N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29210-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), impaired binding of metocurine much more than its structural analog d-TC. The side chain of each mutated residue in this series was shown to project on the protein surface, rather than into the hydrophobic core, and to localize in loops E–G at the ϵ subunit face of the ligand binding domain. We were also motivated by measurements of functional antagonism of mouse AChR showing different effects of mutations at ϵ59 on potency of several curare analogs (29Dilger J.P. Sine S.M. Pedersen S.E. Vidal A.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 214Google Scholar). We co-expressed each lysine mutation with complementary α, β, and δ subunits in HEK293 cells, and we determined binding of d-TC and metocurine to receptors on intact cells by competition against the initial rate of α-bungarotoxin binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). For each antagonist, occupancy of the adult human AChR is well described by the sum of two binding sites present in equal number, corresponding to the α–ϵ and α–δ subunit interfaces. Metocurine distinguishes between the two binding sites to the greatest degree, exhibiting a ratio of dissociation constants of 83, whereas for d-TC the ratio is 15 (Fig. 2 and Table I). For the lysine mutations in binding site loops E and F (loop E, ϵW55K, ϵG57K, and ϵD59K; loop F, ϵL109K, ϵY111K, and ϵT117K), large reductions in affinity are observed for metocurine, whereas much smaller reductions are observed for d-TC; notably, the mutation ϵT117K exhibits almost absolute selectivity between the two antagonists. Exceptions to these metocurine-selective mutations include the loop F mutation ϵL119K and the loop G mutations ϵD173K and ϵD175K, which diminish affinity of both d-TC and metocurine. These findings show that the ϵ subunit contributes to binding of metocurine much more than binding of d-TC.Table IEffects of lysine mutations on antagonist bindingMetocurined-TubocurarineNo.K1logK 1/K1wtK2logK 2/K2wtNo.K1logK 1/K1wtK2logK 2/K2wtWT145.9e-84.9e-6128.1e-81.2e-63.3e-82.1e-64.0e-83.5e-7ϵS53K25.6e-70.979.0e-60.2011.1e-60.771.9e-60.221.3e-70.256.1e-70.257.2e-71.3e-6ϵW55K21.3e-52.552.8e-6-0.1631.1e-60.991.6e-60.162.8e-60.144.2e-80.018.1e-70.264.5e-70.18ϵG57K21.3e-52.553.0e-6-0.1534.8e-70.652.1e-60.201.9e-60.101.7e-70.012.7e-70.341.2e-60.29ϵD59K22.4e-61.827.1e-60.2223.6e-70.492.2e-60.222.8e-70.091.1e-60.103.0e-70.026.5e-70.22ϵN107K13.8e-8-0.024.9e-60.1016.2e-80.201.5e-60.084.5e-95.9e-71.3e-83.1e-7ϵL109K26.4e-53.055.4e-6-0.0216.5e-71.224.1e-60.528.3e-60.283.4e-60.141.9e-71.2e-6ϵY111K22.8e-61.684.0e-6-0.1032.0e-70.531.1e-6-0.095.3e-70.307.9e-70.078.2e-80.075.7e-70.21ϵS115K22.1e-70.553.7e-6-0.1511.9e-70.691.6e-60.107.2e-80.071.5e-60.344.2e-83.4e-7ϵT117K36.0e-52.914.3e-6-0.1232.6e-70.361.7e-60.167.0e-60.101.0e-60.142.4e-70.413.6e-70.16ϵL119K35.2e-43.972.8e-6-0.1822.0e-52.605.6e-7-0.464.2e-40.267.3e-70.189.9e-60.311.8e-70.13ϵD173K33.8e-70.805.7e-60.0333.2e-61.641.3e-60.021.2e-70.151.2e-60.071.3e-60.202.4e-70.06ϵD175K31.0e-61.236.3e-60.1121.5e-61.201.6e-60.072.6e-70.115.6e-70.114.9e-80.1500.10 Open table in a new tab Each lysine mutation in this series increases the dissociation constant of one of the two ligand binding sites, presumably the α–ϵ site, whereas the dissociation constant of the presumed α–δ site is little changed (Table I). This site selectivity is evident from inspection of the log ratio of dissociation constants of mutant to wild type receptors computed for each of the two binding sites; the ratio clearly deviates from zero for the affected site (dissociation constant K 1) but is close to zero for the other site (dissociation constant K 2; see Table I). Perturbation at only one of the two binding sites is expected because each mutation is located in the ϵ subunit, which contributes to the α–ϵ site, whereas the remaining α–δ site contains no mutation. The results from lysine mutagenesis are combined with our computational determinations of antagonist docking orientation, described below, to illustrate the metocurine footprint at the ϵ subunit face of the binding site (Fig. 3). Highlighted in space-filling rendering are side chains of key residues in the ϵ subunit that, following mutation to lysine, markedly impair binding of metocurine. The mutagenesis-generated footprint reveals an elongated pocket in the ϵ subunit that closely complements the concave hydrophobic face of the metocurine scaffold. The large size and positive charge of the lysine side chain make it a good probe of proximity to the positively charged antagonist. Lack of a mutational effect ensures that the ligand does not bind at the site of the mutation, but a large effect does not guarantee contact between the mutated residue and antagonist in the complex. We therefore examined the consequences of conservative mutations of several residues in the ϵ subunit, and we found the best evidence for direct interaction for residues in loops F and G. The loop F mutation ϵY111F markedly enhances affinity for metocurine but not that of d-TC, whereas the loop G mutation ϵD173A diminishes affinity of d-TC but not that of metocurine (Table II). The mutations ϵT117Y and ϵT117A show only minor effects on binding of either antagonist, indicating that polarity of the side chain at position ϵ117 is not essential for binding. The overall results of conservative mutations in the ϵ subunit indicate ϵTyr-111 deep in the binding pocket contributes to binding of metocurine, whereas ϵAsp-173 at the periphery contributes to binding of d-TC; the intervening residues, while likely proximal to bound antagonist, may contribute hydrophobicity or van der Waals contacts rather than specific polar interactions.Table IIEffects of conservative mutations on antagonist bindingMetocurined-TubocurarineNo.K1logK 1/K1wtK2logK 2/K2wtNo.K1logK 1/K1wtK2logK 2/K2wtWT145.9e-84.9e-6128.1e-81.2e-63.3e-82.1e-64.0e-83.5e-7ϵD59A21.6e-70.485.2e-60.1034.0e-70.431.4e-60.123.9e-80.131.6e-60.103.6e-70.375.8e-70.25ϵY111T16.3e-9-0.463.3e-60.3426.3e-8-0.121.7e-60.108.3e-104.3e-74.7e-80.545.1e-70.01ϵY111S11.2e-8-0.192.0e-60.1217.0e-8-0.131.8e-60.221.7e-92.8e-76.7e-91.7e-7ϵY111F25.3e-9-0.804.7e-60.2636.9e-8-0.371.6e-60.193.4e-90.022.6e-60.027.5e-80.422.6e-70.02ϵT117Y12.7e-80.173.0e-60.3011.1e-70.051.8e-60.234.5e-94.9e-73.7e-86.3e-7ϵT117A14.2e-80.362.6e-60.2414.9e-8-0.299.7e-7-0.045.2e-93.3e-78.5e-91.7e-7ϵD173N22.5e-8-0.313.9e-6-0.0826.0e-8-0.251.9e-60.241.9e-80.286.6e-70.221.3e-90.071.2e-60.22ϵD173A34.4e-8-0.042.8e-6-0.2235.1e-70.661.5e-60.181.6e-80.107.8e-70.234.7e-80.102.2e-70.12αY93F11.1e-70.264.0e-6-0.1112.9e-8-0.266.3e-7-0.432.3e-88.0e-77.8e-91.7e-7αY93T14.9e-80.411.1e-6-0.3712.6e-8-0.466.8e-7-0.301.3e-82.7e-73.7e-96.8e-7αY190F28.6e-80.186.4e-60.1221.2e-70.101.6e-60.133.1e-80.171.3e-60.014.2e-80.032.8e-70.10αD195A11.1e-70.124.4e-6-0.1718.6e-8-0.039.7e-7-0.081.7e-87.2e-78.8e-99.9e-8αD195N11.1e-7-0.117.7e-60.0018.6e-8-0.021.3e-60.052.2e-81.6e-69.6e-91.9e-7αY198F39.5e-80.215.2e-7-1.2049.5e-9-1.033.5e-8-1.374.1e-80.246.6e-70.529.0e-90.301.6e-80.20αY198T26.8e-52.974.1e-50.7421.4e-52.202.1e-51.193.8e-50.143.4e-50.377.6e-60.161.4e-50.33 Open table in a new tab Residues in the α subunit also contribute selectively to antagonist binding. Mutations targeting the three signature tyrosines found in all nicotinic receptors had to be structurally conservative to prevent loss of expression. The mutation αY198T markedly diminishes affinity of both antagonists, but the mutation αY198F selectively increases affinity of d-TC (Fig. 2 and Table II). Mutations of αTyr-93 and αTyr-190 have only minor effects on binding of both antagonists (Table II); the αY190T mutation eliminated α-bungarotoxin binding (not shown), either through misfolding or by preventing binding of the toxin, and could not be studied further. Thus αTyr-198 contributes to binding of both antagonists, but the selective enhancement of binding by αY198F makes it a good candidate for direct interaction with d-TC. To determine the origin of the mutational specificity at the atomic structural level, we computed docking orientations of d-TC and metocurine to our structural model of the α–ϵ-binding site of the human AChR (13Sine S.M. Wang H.-L. Bren N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29210-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because proteins are intrinsically dynamic, we employed a computational strategy that accounts for this key property. We therefore used MD simulation to generate an ensemble of protein structures accessible to the antagonist and computed docking of antagonist to each snapshot of the dynamic structure. The computational analysis was patterned after the pioneering work of McCammon and co-workers (17Carlson H.A. McCammon J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and our application of that approach to curariform antagonist binding to AChBP (18Gao F. Bren N. Little A. Wang H.-L. Hansen S. Talley T. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One difference, however, was the need to constrain the α-carbon backbone of the AChR ligand binding domain during MD simulation, while allowing free movement of all side chains (see “Experimental Procedures”). We therefore carried out a 1-ns MD simulation, with the α-carbon backbone constrained, and collected 1000 frames of the dynamic structure for computation of antagonist docking. Application of AUTODOCK 3.0.3 generated 10 docked structures per frame to give a total of 10,000 docked structures for each antagonist. We then grouped these into clusters of similar structures by sorting them into 1-Å intervals of the ligand root mean square deviation (see “Experimental Procedures”). For both antagonists, our cluster analysis reveals a predominant ligand orientation within the binding pocket (cluster 1), along with several smaller clusters with different orientations (Fig. 4). For d-TC, comparison of orientations in clusters 1 and 2 reveals only a minor shift of the ligand within the binding pocket, whereas for metocurine, clusters 1 and 2 represent fundamentally different orientations (Fig. 4). The most frequent orientation produced by AUTODOCK has been shown for many protein-ligand complexes to agree well with the bound orientation observed in x-ray structures of the complexes (19Osterberg F. Morris G.M. Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. Proteins. 2002; 46: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We nevertheless considered the orientation of metocurine in cluster 2 a formal possibility to be evaluated in light of our mutagenesis results. Our computational determinations indicate that d-TC and metocurine, despite having identical molecular scaffolds and rigid cyclic structures, bind in distinctly different orientations to the α–ϵ site of the adult human AChR (Fig. 5). The concave hydrophobic face of metocurine lies across β-strands 5′, 6, and 2 of the ϵ subunit (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 13Sine S.M. Wang H.-L. Bren N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29210-29223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), with one of the two quaternary nitrogens (N2) penetrating deep into the binding site to juxtapose ϵTyr-111 and ϵThr-117, and the other quaternary nitrogen (N1) extending peripherally to approach the β8-β9 linker harboring ϵAsp-173 and ϵAsp-175. By contrast, the concave face of d-TC orients toward the α subunit, with its quaternary nitrogen (N2) juxtaposing αTyr-198, and its tertiary nitrogen (N1) projecting peripherally toward ϵAsp-173 in the β8-β9 linker. The change in orientation from that of metocurine to that of d-TC results from tilt of the curariform scaffold by ∼60° normal to the nitrogen-nitrogen axis, together with a 20° rotation about the axis. Table III lists computationally determined distances between key atoms of each antagonist and determinants of binding at the α–ϵ subunit interface. The key atoms of the antagonists include the most proximal nitrogen to the binding determinant in question, as well as the most proximal carbon atom in the curariform scaffold. These distances are mean values computed from all frames of the dynamic structure in cluster 1 (Fig. 4); for both antagonists mean values are also listed for cluster 2.Table IIISeparations distances between AChR-binding site residues and bound antagonistAtom pairsMetocurineAtom pairsd-TubocurarineCluster 1Cluster 2Cluster 1Cluster 2mean±S.D.mean±S.D.mean±S.D.mean±S.D.Loop EϵG57(Cα):C-E3.90.27.20.2ϵ57(Cα):C-F4.50.23.90.2ϵW55(Cγ):N17.40.37.40.3ϵ55(Cγ):N17.70.47.30.3ϵD59(Cγ):C-D4.20.38.20.4ϵ59(Cγ):C-EF6.90.37.50.2Loop FϵN107(Oδ):N214.30.817.60.7ϵN107(Oδ):N212.11.312.21.2ϵL109(Cγ):N25.70.49.30.4ϵL109(Cγ):N27.80.66.10.3ϵL109(Cγ):C-AB3.80.311.20.3ϵL109(Cγ):C-D5.60.36.50.4ϵY111(Cζ):N24.10.56.00.6ϵY111(Cζ):N210.40.78.20.7ϵS115(Oγ):N115.90.315.90.3ϵS115(Oγ):N113.60.515.90.4ϵT117(Cβ):N24.70.35.90.3ϵT117(Cβ):N29.80.57.40.3ϵT117(Cβ):C-AB3.60.67.60.3ϵT117(Cβ):C-D6.20.44.10.2ϵL119(Cγ):C-C3.50.25.30.1ϵL119(Cγ):C-F3.00.23.40.3ϵL119(Cγ):C-C3.70.25.90.2ϵL119(Cγ):C-F2.50.23.50.3Loop GϵD173(Oδ):N14.20.49.40.3ϵD173(Oδ):N15.10.42.80.5Loop AαY93(Cζ):N213.60.716.70.6αY93(Cζ):N26.10.68.20.5Loop BαW149(Cϵ):N210.80.513.70.3αW149(Cϵ):N25.50.36.30.4Loop CαY190(Cζ):N113.40.37.90.30αY190(Cζ):N112.00.211.40.4αY198(Cζ):N26.60.610.20.3αY198(Cζ):N23.00.33.20.2 Open table in a new tab The computed separation distances for the predominant cluster 1 support our experimental observations that particular residues at the α–ϵ interface are proximal to bound metocurine, whereas others are proximal to bound d-TC.

https://openalex.org/W1973449122,"Cdc25A regulates cell cycle progression, has oncogenic and anti-apoptotic activity, and is over-expressed in many human tumors. Phosphorylation by Chk1 and Cds1/Chk2 down-regulates Cdc25A levels in response to genotoxic stresses. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether Chk1 and Cds1/Chk2 are uniquely responsible for regulating Cdc25A stability during interphase or if other kinase activities contribute. Here we report that treatment of HeLa cells with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in Cdc25A protein levels. Transfection with dominant-negative Cdk mutants demonstrated that only a Cdk2 mutant increased Cdc25A protein levels; Cdk1 and Cdk3 mutants had no effect. The increased Cdc25A protein levels were the result of an increase in the half-life of the protein; no increase in Cdc25A mRNA levels was observed. These results demonstrate Cdk2 kinase activity contributes to the labile nature of Cdc25A during interphase and redefine the nature of the Cdc25A-Cdk2 autoamplification feedback loop."

The toxin affects several signal transduction pathways, resulting in increased inositol phosphate production, stimulation of protein kinase C activity, Ca2+ mobilization, actin rearrangements, and increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation (5Lax A.J. Grigoriadis A.E. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that function as molecular switches that transduce signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) to effector proteins such as enzymes or ion channels (6Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 7Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem.

The Gα proteins are divided into four families: Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gα12 (8Spiegel A.M. Schenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 536-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 9Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The Gαq class are widely expressed and regulate various effector proteins including phospholipase Cβ and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (10Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of GPCRs results in a conformational change in the Gα subunit, favoring the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. GTP binding results in the dissociation of Gα-GTP and βγ complexes, each of which can modulate effector proteins. The regulation of these processes in vivo has yet to be fully elucidated. Recently it has been demonstrated that the α subunit of Gq is a target for tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Gαq increased its ability to activate phospholipase Cβ in an in vitro model, suggesting that phosphorylation may modulate the activity of the G protein in vivo (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Modulation of Gαq phosphorylation using chemical inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or tyrosine phosphatases had a profound effect on the production of inositol trisphosphates (IP3) in vivo (12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Umemori H. Hayashi T. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7399-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transient expression of a dominant active mutant of the Fyn tyrosine kinase elevated the phosphorylation of Gαq but blocked receptor-stimulated IP3 production (12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results implied that cellular kinases and phosphatases coordinately regulate the activity of Gαq. The experiments presented here were designed to determine whether PMT stimulated activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. We show that PMT is a potent stimulator of Gαq tyrosine phosphorylation but that this phosphorylation step is not a prerequisite for Gαq activation. Furthermore, using wild-type and mutant forms of PMT, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq can potentiate signaling through the Gq-coupled bombesin receptor.

The cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 33-mm dishes, and after a 24-h growth period they were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Invitrogen BV) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After6hthe cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM I and then cultured in DMEM for a further 18 h. The cells were washed twice with DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 3:1 (v/v) and then incubated in the same medium for a further 48 h to induce quiescence. A total of 2 μg of pcDNA3 containing the relevant Gαq construct was used to transfect each dish. Statistical Analysis—Data for production of inositol phosphates in Fig. 5 are presented as the means and standard errors from seven independent experiments with each point repeated in triplicate. Statistical analysis was carried out using the STATA 7 program (STATA Corp.). The significance of differences between various treatments was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. PMT Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Gα q—Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with mitogenic concentrations of PMT potently stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the α subunit of Gq (Fig. 1a). Increases in tyrosine phosphorylation were concentration-dependent, reaching a maximum at a PMT concentration of ∼70 pm (Fig. 1a). The increase in phosphorylation occurred after a lag period of 1 h and peaked around 4–6 h after exposure to PMT (Fig. 1b, upper panel). The lag period is consistent with the time required for binding and internalization of the toxin to occur. Mutation of cysteine 1165 to serine in PMT (PMTC1165S) leads to a complete loss of mitogenic activity and toxicity without grossly affecting toxin structure (19Ward P.N. Miles A.J. Sumner I.G. Thomas L.H. Lax A.J. (1998) Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, PMTC1165S was found to stimulate an increase in Gαq phosphorylation with kinetics matching those of the wild-type toxin (Fig. 1b, lower panel). Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with the GPCR agonist bombesin also stimulated phosphorylation of Gαq (Fig. 1c). However, in contrast to PMT, phosphorylation of Gαq stimulated by bombesin was highly transient, peaking at 1 min post exposure and returning to basal levels within 5 min. The increase in Gαq phosphorylation stimulated by PMT or PMTC1165S, but not by bombesin, could be effectively blocked by preincubation of the cells with either methylamine or a PMT antiserum (Fig. 1, d and e). This strongly suggested that the induced phosphorylation was a specific effect that followed toxin internalization. PMT Stimulates Phosphorylation of Tyrosine 349 —Umemori et al. (12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that GPCR agonists promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of Gα11 at tyrosine residue 352. It was therefore important to identify the site of Gαq/11 phosphorylation in response to stimulation with PMT. Murine Gαq (1–353) was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and the C-terminal tyrosine residue (349), analogous to Gα11 tyrosine 352, was changed to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and nucleotide sequencing. Embryonic fibroblasts deficient in both Gαq and Gα11 (Gαq/11–/– cells) were transfected with either wild-type or mutant (Y349F) Gαq, and the expression of the Gα subunit was determined. In agreement with previous studies (28Liu S. Carrillo J.J. Pediani J.D. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), an anti-Gαq/11 antiserum directed against the C terminus of the G protein failed to detect the mutant Y349F Gαq. However, probing of the membranes with an antiserum directed against an internal sequence of Gαq (115–133) revealed equivalent expression of both constructs (data not shown). Because the C-terminal antiserum fails to recognize mutant Y349F Gαq, it was not possible to use this antiserum for immunoprecipitation. It was therefore decided to carry out Gαq immunoprecipitation using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and probe blots with the antiserum directed against the internal sequence of Gαq. Wild-type or mutant (Y349F) Gαq was expressed in Gαq/11–/– cells, and cells were stimulated either with a mixture of bradykinin and thrombin or with wild-type or mutant PMT. In cells expressing wild-type Gαq treatment with GPCR agonists or toxins resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. In contrast, mutant Y349F Gαq was not immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine in either untreated or treated cells (Fig. 2a). Parallel experiments revealed that the observed changes in phosphorylation were not due to major differences in the expression of either wild-type or mutant Gαq (Fig. 2b). This indicated that Gαq Tyr349 represents the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to either GPCR or toxin stimulation. PMT, but Not PMTC1165S, Stimulates Activation of Gq—It had been assumed that mutant PMT (PMTC1165S) failed to activate pathways associated with wild-type toxin, although this had never been demonstrated. We decided to determine whether PMT and PMTC1165S each stimulated activation of Gq. The initial steps of G protein activation in response to either bombesin or toxins were determined by analyzing binding of the GTP analog GTPγS. Because PMT is predicted to act enzymatically, standard GTPγS binding assays were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The use of an in vitro assay system means prolonged incubation steps are not required because the toxin does not require cellular binding and internalization. PMT and bombesin each stimulated concentration-dependent binding of GTPγS to Swiss 3T3 membrane fractions (Fig. 3a). PMT potently stimulated GTPγS binding at concentrations (picomolar range) 100-1000-fold lower than the GPCR agonist bombesin. In contrast, PMTC1165S did not stimulate a significant increase in GTPγS binding in parallel experiments (Fig. 3a) under a variety of conditions (longer incubation periods or higher toxin concentrations; data not shown). To determine whether Gq was directly affected by both bombesin and PMT, we performed GTPγS binding assays followed by immunoprecipitation with antisera against Gαq. Membranes from Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 70 pm PMT or PMTC1165S or 20 nm bombesin as indicated. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess GTPγS and by using normal rabbit serum. Bombesin and PMT each stimulated direct GTPγS binding to Gq (Fig. 3b). The kinetics of GTPγS binding differed between bombesin and PMT. As previously reported, bombesin stimulated a rapid increase in the levels of bound GTPγS, which peaked 5–10 min after addition (22Offermanns S. Heiler E. Spicher K. Schultz G. FEBS Letts. 1994; 349: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By comparison, increases in GTPγS binding stimulated by PMT occurred gradually, peaking 40–50 min after addition. This result would support the concept that PMT has an enzymatic action, with GTP binding occurring downstream of a toxin-catalyzed event. PMTC1165S had no effect on GTPγS binding to Gαq (Fig. 3b). Thus despite stimulation of Gαq tyrosine phosphorylation by PMTC1165S, this mutant failed to stimulate this key indicator of Gq activation. To further investigate the functional role of tyrosine phosphorylation in G protein activation, the production of inositol phosphates was determined. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors linked to members of the Gαq subfamily stimulates phospholipase Cβ-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. As previously reported (1Rozengurt E. Higgins T.E. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Staddon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), bombesin and PMT were potent activators of this pathway. In contrast, we found PMTC1165S did not stimulate inositol phosphate production (Fig. 3c). A wide variety of experimental conditions (longer incubation periods or higher toxin concentrations) failed to elicit increases in inositol phosphates in response to PMTC1165S (data not shown). These findings demonstrated that PMT and bombesin but not PMTC1165S could activate Gq and that tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq did not necessarily lead to its activation. PMT Activation of Gq Is Not Dependent on Gq Tyrosine Phosphorylation—The ability of PMTC1165S to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq without leading to its activation conflicts with the model proposed by Umemori et al. (13Umemori H. Hayashi T. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7399-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation occurred downstream of GTP binding. We decided to investigate whether phosphorylation of Gαq was required for activation of phospholipase C. Cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein to block phosphorylation of Gαq. Genistein blocked tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by PMT in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). The increased phosphorylation of Gαq in response to either PMT or bombesin was completely blocked by prior exposure to 50 μm genistein (Fig. 4b). Daidzein, an analog of genistein, which lacks tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, had no effect on the phosphorylation of Gαq (data not shown). Application of 20 nm bombesin or 70 pm PMT to Swiss 3T3 cells pretreated with the solvent Me2SO or daidzein resulted in the production of inositol phosphates. However, at concentrations that blocked tyrosine phosphorylation, genistein only inhibited inositol phosphate production stimulated by bombesin and did not inhibit the stimulation of inositol phosphate production by PMT (Fig. 4c). This result demonstrated that phosphorylation of Gq is not an absolute requirement for phospholipase C activation in vivo. Furthermore, these data strongly argue against PMT acting directly as a tyrosine kinase. PMT Enhances Inositol Phosphate Production in Response to Bombesin—It was previously reported that pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with subsaturating concentrations of PMT enhanced the production of IP3 in response to neuropeptides but not platelet-derived growth factor (2Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate this effect, we asked whether PMTC1165S could also enhance the production of IP3. As previously reported, PMT was able to facilitate the production of IP3 in response to bombesin treatment (Fig. 5). Although treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PMTC1165S alone did not stimulate production of IP3, pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PMTC1165S significantly enhanced the production of IP3 in response to bombesin (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5). The degree of potentiation stimulated by either wild-type or mutant PMT (approximately 140 and 142%, respectively, of additive values) was comparable (Table I) and thus argues that PMT facilitates the production of IP3 in response to bombesin through phosphorylation of Gαq tyrosine 349.Table IPMT and PMTC1165S potentiate inositol phosphate production in response to bombesin.TreatmentInositol phosphatesPotentiationcpm%Control186 ± 14NABombesin519 ± 28NAPMTC1165S187 ± 15NAPMT1294 ± 20NABombesin with PMTC1165S pretreatment659 ± 35141.6Bombesin with PMT pretreatment2206 ± 150140.2 Open table in a new tab Role of Src Family Kinases in Gq/11 Phosphorylation—The differential effects of wild-type and mutant PMT on the stimulation of phosphorylation and inositol phosphate production suggested that a cellular kinase phosphorylated Gαq. Src family kinases (subsequently referred to as Src kinases) have been postulated to be possible regulators of this process (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Umemori H. Hayashi T. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7399-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of Src kinases, we utilized the recently described Src/Yes/Fyn-deficient (SYF–/–) cell line (23Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We compared activity in these cells with SYF–/– cells rescued with a retroviral vector expressing murine c-Src (YF–/– cells). PMT potently stimulated DNA synthesis in both cell lines, indicating that the cells were responsive to toxin (Fig. 6, a and b). PMTC1165S did not stimulate DNA synthesis in either cell line under the same experimental conditions. Interestingly, bombesin only stimulated DNA synthesis in the Src expressing control cells (YF–/–). This suggested that Src kinases might be required for GPCR stimulated DNA synthesis. To ensure differences were not due to a lack of receptor expression, we analyzed membrane fractions for the presence of the bombesin/GRP receptor. Both cell lines expressed the receptor (Fig. 6c). The ability of PMT to induce phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) was investigated to check the phenotype of the cell lines. PMT stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in YF–/– cells but not in SYF–/– cells (Fig. 6d). Finally, we investigated the effect of toxins and bombesin on the phosphorylation of Gαq in YF–/– and SYF–/– cells (Fig. 6, e and f, respectively). Treatment of quiescent YF–/– cells with PMT, PMTC1165S, or bombesin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. By comparison, no changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq could be observed in quiescent SYF–/– cells, although there was a high basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. Although it is not clear why Gαq was highly phosphorylated in these cells, the data demonstrate that Src kinases mediate the phosphorylation of Gαq. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins can modulate their activity and/or promote interaction with other molecules (24Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Several neuropeptides that regulate cell growth and differentiation induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. Recent studies have indicated that Gαq phosphorylation forms part of a novel cycle in which tyrosine kinases and phosphatases regulate Gq activation (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Umemori H. Hayashi T. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7399-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to further investigate the role of phosphorylation using PMT. The results presented here show for the first time that PMT induces both dose- and time-dependent increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. A nontoxic mutant of PMT (PMTC1165S) also stimulated phosphorylation, with kinetics matching those of wild-type PMT. Phosphorylation of Gαq/11 in response to wild-type or mutant PMT occurs at Gαq tyrosine residue 349. Previous studies indicated that this tyrosine residue is also phosphorylated in response to GPCR agonists, an event confirmed in these studies. Our data demonstrate that the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by either wild-type or mutant PMT is a specific event following toxin internalization. Methylamine, an agent that increases endosomal and lysosomal pH (25Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 199-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore inhibits the entry and processing of many toxins, selectively blocked the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by PMT. Similarly, the early addition of neutralizing antisera to PMT selectively blocked phosphorylation of Gαq. The addition of PMT to cell membranes induced an increase in binding of GTPγS to Gαq. This is the first description of an in vitro assay for PMT activity. PMTC1165S neither affected GDP/GTP exchange nor stimulated an increase in levels of inositol phosphates. Thus the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by PMTC1165S does not lead to activation of Gq. These data demonstrate that stimulation of Gαq tyrosine phosphorylation can occur in the absence of G protein activation and confirm that phosphorylated Gαq is not constitutively active in the basal GDP bound state (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lui et al. (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that in Rat-1 fibroblasts transformed with the v-src oncogene, inositol phosphate production stimulated by endothelin-1 was increased 6-fold, without changes in the number of receptors. This increased response was mediated through Gq, which was phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s). Moreover, when extracted G protein was reconstituted with exogenous phospholipase C, ALF4--stimulated Gq activity was significantly increased in extracts from v-src transformed cells. These data implied that phosphorylation of Gq may have a regulatory role in vivo. Subsequent studies by Umemori et al. (12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Umemori H. Hayashi T. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7399-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have further investigated the role of Gq tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating G protein activity. These authors demonstrated that Gq was phosphorylated upon ligand activation. This phosphorylation was suggested to prevent interaction of the GPCR with Gq and was essential for the activation of Gq by receptor stimulation (12Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the data conflict with the previous report of Lui et al. (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), who clearly demonstrated that phosphorylated Gq in v-src transformed cells could still interact with and be activated by the endothelin-1 receptor. Indeed, in such cells the production of IP3 was potentiated by the phosphorylation of Gq. Similarly, overexpression of c-Src in mouse fibroblasts potentiates both agonist-induced signaling through β-adrenergic receptors and cAMP accumulation in response to cholera toxin (26Bushman W.A.

Linder M.E. Shannon J.D. Parsons S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Tyr37 lies near the site of Gβγ binding in the N terminus, whereas Tyr377 is located in the extreme C terminus, within a region of Gαs important for receptor interaction. Moreover, phosphorylation of Gαs by immune-complexed c-Src resulted in enhanced rates of receptor-mediated GTPγS binding and GTP hydrolysis (29Hausdorff W.P. Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These data support the findings of Lui et al. (11Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Gα subunits does not, in itself, prevent interaction of the G protein with the GPCR. Most recently, Liu et al. (28Liu S. Carrillo J.J. Pediani J.D. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported that an aromatic group is required for efficient information transfer from an agonist occupied receptor to Gα11. However, their data established that tyrosine 352 could be substituted with phenylalanine or tryptophan without abolishing G protein activity. These findings, together with the data presented here, clearly demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq/11 is not a requirement for G protein activation in vivo. To further address this problem we investigated the effects of wild-type and mutant PMT on the production of IP3 in response to bombesin. As reported previously (2Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type PMT facilitated the production of IP3 in response to bombesin. Interestingly, we have now shown that mutant PMT can also potentiate signaling via the bombesin receptor. Wild-type and mutant PMT each stimulated phosphorylation of Gq, but importantly, only the wild-type toxin activated the G protein. These findings imply that phosphorylation of Gq alone is not sufficient to uncouple the receptor from the G protein. The mechanism through which tyrosine phosphorylation of Gq is induced remains unclear. Our data support the suggestion that a cellular kinase is activated early in the G protein cycle to phosphorylate Gq. Umemori et al. (13Umemori H. Hayashi T. Inoue T. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7399-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) proposed that a kinase is activated in response to GTP-GDP exchange on Gq. However, the findings that mutant PMT can stimulate phosphorylation of Gq in the absence of GTP-GDP exchange suggest that this model may be an oversimplification. To further understand the mechanisms through which phosphorylation of Gαq is regulated, the putative kinase must be identified. Previous work has indicated Src family kinases are critical mediators of this pathway. Our data using Src-deficient cell lines suggest that Src mediates phosphorylation of Gq in response to PMT in vivo. However, because basal phosphorylation of Gq is high in these cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that other kinases may also be involved. In summary, these studies have conclusively demonstrated that PMT activates members of the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins. Utilizing GPCR agonists and a mutant form of PMT, we have confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq can be dissociated from G protein activation. Moreover, the finding that wild-type and mutant PMT can potentiate GPCR signaling highlights as yet undefined roles for tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq. We thank Drs. H. Cox and A.

https://openalex.org/W2011068237,"It has been believed that retinal guanylyl cyclase (retGC), a key enzyme in the cGMP recovery to the dark state, is solely activated by guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. However, a question has arisen as to whether the observed GCAP stimulation of retGC is sufficient to account for the cGMP recovery because the stimulated activity measured in vitro is less than the light/GTP-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase activity. Here we report that the retGC activation by GCAPs is larger than previously reported and that a preincubation with adenine nucleotide is essential for the large activation. Under certain conditions, ATP is two times more effective than adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a hydrolysis-resistant ATP analog; however, this study mainly used AMP-PNP to focus on the role of adenine nucleotide binding to retGC. When photoreceptor outer segment homogenates are preincubated with AMP-PNP (EC50 = 0.65 ± 0.20 mm), GCAP2 enhanced the retGC activity 10–13 times over the control rate. Without AMP-PNP, GCAP2 stimulated the control activity only 3–4-fold as in previous reports. The large activation is due to a GCAP2-dependent increase in V max without an alteration of retGC affinity for GCAP2 (EC50 = 47.9 ± 2.7 nm). GCAP1 stimulated retGC activity in a similar fashion but with lower affinity (EC50 = 308 nm). In the AMP-PNP preincubation, low Ca2+ concentrations are not required, and retGC exists as a monomeric form. This large activation is accomplished through enhanced action of GCAPs as shown by Ca2+ inhibition of the activity (IC50 = 178 nm). We propose that retGC is activated by a two-step mechanism: a conformational change by ATP binding to its kinase homology domain under high Ca2+ concentrations that allows large enhancement of GCAP activation under low Ca2+ concentrations.

Nature. 1988; 334: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Two membrane guanylyl cyclases, retGC-1 and -2 (also referred to as ROS GC-1 and -2 or GC-E and GC-F, respectively), are involved in the cGMP synthesis in photoreceptor OS (9Shyjan A.W. de Sauvage F.J.

Commun. 1997; 234: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been shown that retGC-1 is localized in the photoreceptor layer and that cone OS contains more retGC-1 than rod OS (15Liu X. Seno K. Nishizawa Y. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Matsumoto H. Wakabayashi T. Usukura J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Cooper N. Liu L. Yoshida A. Ponzdnyakov N. Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1996; 6: 211-222Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In photoreceptor OS, retGC-1 appears to be associated with the marginal region of disk membranes and/or the plasma membranes (15Liu X. Seno K. Nishizawa Y. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Matsumoto H. Wakabayashi T. Usukura J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). retGC-2 is localized in photoreceptors (12Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5535-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); however, detailed localization of retGC-2 in retina has not been reported. RetGC shares an overall molecular configuration similar to those of peptide-regulated GCs and contains an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, a kinase homology domain (KHD), and a catalytic domain (17Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar, 18Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, it has been believed that regulation of retGC is different from those of peptide-regulated GCs. For example, GC-A, a typical peptide-regulated GC, is activated through binding of atrial natriuretic peptide to the extracellular domain (17Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar, 18Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In retGC, the extracellular domain appears not to be required for the stimulation, although its real function is unknown. Instead, the Ca2+-sensitive stimulation of retGC is mediated by binding of calmodulin-like Ca2+-binding proteins termed GCAPs (19Gorczyca W.A. Grey-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4014-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B.

The mechanism of retGC activation by GCAPs is not clear; however, dimerization (or oligomerization) of retGC appears to be involved (24Yang R.-B. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13738-13742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12522-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is also known that retGC is activated by S100 proteins, other Ca2+-binding proteins, at high Ca2+ concentrations (28Pozdnyakov N. Yoshida A. Cooper N.G.F. Margulis A. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14279-14283Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Margulis A. Pozdnyakov N. Sitaramayya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This regulation is believed to be involved in retinal cells other than photoreceptor OS. It should be noted that the relationship between GCAP localization and their functions appears to be controversial. Immunocytochemical analysis (30Cuenca N. Lopez S. Howes K. Kolb H. Invest. Ophthlmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kachi S. Nishizawa Y. Olshevskaya E. Yamazaki A. Miyake Y. Wakabayashi T. Dizhoor A. Usukura J. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), with genetic analysis of cone degeneration (32Payne A.M. Downes S.M. Bessant D.A.R. Taylor R. Holder G.E. Warren M.J. Bird A.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17311-17314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggests that GCAP1 is primarily expressed in cones, whereas GCAP2 is primarily detected in rods and, at a lower level, in cones. Very recent studies using double knockout mice (GCAP–/–) showed, as expected, that overexpression of bovine GCAP2 in GCAP–/– rescued the Ca2+ sensitivity of retGC and the time for the rod recovery from saturating flashes (34Mendez A. Burns M.E. Sokal I Dizhoor A.M. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 35Burns M. Mendez A. Chen J. Baylor D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the GCAP2 overexpression could not restore the normal kinetics of response evoked by subsaturating flashes (34Mendez A. Burns M.E. Sokal I Dizhoor A.M. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Howes et al. (36Howes K.A. Pennesi M.E. Sokal I. Church-Kopish J. Schmidt B. Margolis D. Frederick J.M. Rieke F. Palczewski K. Wu S.M. Detwiler P.D. Baehr W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that GCAP1 expression in GCAP–/– restored the wild type properties of rod light response in the absence of GCAP2. They proposed that GCAP1 supports the generation of wild type flash responses in rods. In these studies using double knockout mice, it is not clear whether the expression of bovine GCAPs in mouse rods completely restores the function of the missing mouse GCAPs and whether the overexpression of GCAP2 disturbs normal functions. Moreover, it is not known whether all GCAPs expressed in GCAP–/– function properly and whether GCAP–/– can restore all normal properties if both GCAPs are expressed. There is another crucial difference between peptide-regulated GCs and retGC. ATP is obligatory in the stimulation of GC-A (17Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar, 18Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, ATP has not been reported to be essential for the GCAP stimulation of retGC. ATP has been believed to only modify retGC activity; low ATP concentrations (less than ∼0.5 mm) slightly stimulate and high ATP concentrations (more than ∼1 mm) significantly inhibit retGC activity in OS membranes (38Krishnan N. Fletcher R.T. Chader G.J. Krishna G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 523: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Sitaramayya A. Marala R.B. Hakki S. Sharma R.K.

Biochem. 1995; 148: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several studies also reported the synergetic effect of ATP and GCAPs on retGC activity (21Laura R.P. Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B.

Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although the ATP concentrations used in these studies (less than 0.5 mm) were lower than the physiological ATP concentrations in rods (3–4 mm) (44Robinson W.E. Hagins W.A. Nature. 1979; 280: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the activation was not large in OS membranes. It should be emphasized that the significance of the inhibition of retGC by physiological ATP concentrations has been completely ignored in the previous studies of retGC regulation. There is another fundamental question ignored in the previous retGC studies: whether the observed GCAP-stimulated retGC activity is sufficient to account for the recovery of cGMP level to the dark state. Needless to say, the activity of purified retGC is less than that of light/GTP-stimulated PDE (45Hakki S. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 46Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6742-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) estimated, based on published data obtained in vitro and their measurements of retGC activities in vitro, that the maximal rate of cGMP hydrolysis in light/GTP-activated PDE is 7–200 times greater than the potential retGC activity. In addition, the content of retGC in rods is not larger than that of PDE, although these estimations varied (from 1:1 to 1:10) (46Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 47Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies on GCAPs–/– mice showed that the mean single photon response amplitude was nearly five times larger than that of wild type rods (34Mendez A. Burns M.E. Sokal I Dizhoor A.M. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 35Burns M. Mendez A. Chen J.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 3-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At all flash strengths examined, the light-evoked PDE activity measured as the rate of rise of the signal at early times was the same in GCAP–/– and control rods. These observations suggest that the level of GCAP-stimulated retGC activity in vivo may be similar or higher than that of light/GTP-activated PDE. Other electrophysiological studies also estimated the retGC activity in vivo as being higher than that measured in vitro (50Cornwall M.C. Fain G.L. J. Physiol. 1994; 480: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 51Koutalos Y. Nakatani K. Tamura T. Yau K.-W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 863-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These studies imply that there may be another mechanism for the retGC activation and/or that unknown components may be involved in the further stimulation of retGC by GCAPs in vivo. In this study, we have attempted to reconcile the difference in retGC activities observed in vivo and in vitro. We show that pretreatment of OS homogenates with adenine nucleotides (1–10 mm) enhances the level of retGC activity stimulated by GCAPs. Based on these observations, we propose a new mechanism for retGC activation. Materials—Frozen dark-adapted retinas were purchased from J. A. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). Okadaic acid and AMP-PNP were purchased from Sigma. TSKgel DEAE-2SW column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) was obtained from TosoHaas. [125I]Anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody from goat was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sources of other materials were described previously (25Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GCAP1 and -2 were kind gifts from Drs. Rameshwar K. Sharma (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) and Alexander M. Dizhoor (Pennsylvania College of Optometry), respectively. Antibodies against retGC-1 and GCAP2 were kindly provided from Drs. Fumio Hayashi (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan) and Alexander M. Dizhoor, respectively. Preparation of retGC Samples—OS preparations used in this study were isolated from bovine retinas without separation of rod OS from cone OS. Thus, the OS preparations were mixtures of rod and cone OS, although ROS is expected to present mainly in the preparations. In addition, retGC-1 was not separated from retGC-2 in the preparations. Therefore, the retGC activity described here is the activity measured as the total activity of retGC-1 and –2, although the retGC-1 activity is expected to be dominant due to the low contents of retGC-2 (12Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5535-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Bovine OS were prepared from dark-adapted retinas as described (52Yamazaki A. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GCAP-free membranes were prepared as described previously (25Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, OS isolated from 25 retinas were suspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A), homogenized by passing a needle with a 21-gauge diameter (seven times) and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The process was repeated seven times. The membrane fraction was further washed in 5 ml of Buffer B (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A). The process was repeated seven times. The membrane fraction (5 mg/ml) was suspended in Buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A) and stored at –70 °C. Preincubation of retGC with Adenine Nucleotides—An OS preparation (150 μg) was homogenized in 300 μl of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A) and incubated with 5 mm AMP-PNP. The preincubation was carried out on ice for 30 min unless otherwise noted. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the membrane fraction was washed in 750 μl of buffer E (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A) containing 5 mm AMP-PNP (x3) and then 750 μl of Buffer F (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 2mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin A) to exclude AMP-PNP (two times). The membrane fraction was suspended in 270 μl of Buffer F and used as retGC. Preincubation of OS homogenates with ATP (see Fig. 1) was carried out under slightly different conditions. Details of these conditions are described in the figure legend. We estimate that the residual concentration of AMP-PNP in the membrane fraction was less than 20 μm. This estimate is based on experiments using the radioactive tracers [8H]cGMP and [125I]anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody from goat. This estimation was also confirmed by HPLC using TSKgel DEAE-2SW column as described below. We also found that the AMP-PNP used was contaminated with ∼5% ADP. However, preincubation of OS homogenates with 5 mm ADP only increased retGC activity ∼15% as compared with OS membranes incubated without ADP, suggesting that the ADP contamination in AMP-PNP was not involved in the activation. Identification of Nucleotides—To estimate nucleotide concentrations in samples, the nucleotides were separated by HPLC, and their amounts were determined using the peak areas. The samples were prepared by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). After appropriate dilution, a portion of the supernatant was applied to a TSKgel DEAE-2SW column that had been equilibrated with Solution A (CH3CN in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 3.0, 20/80). The column was washed with 5 ml of Solution A, and the nucleotides were eluted by a 30-min linear gradient from Solution A to B (CH3CN in 0.5 m phosphate, pH 3.0, 20/80). The column chromatography was carried out with the flow rate 1.0 ml/min, and the nucleotides were detected by using a UV detector at 260 nm. The following are retention times of nucleotides measured under our conditions: cGMP, 7.6 min; ADP, 13.2 min; AMP-PNP, 18.8 min; GDP, 20.2 min; ATP, 21.6 min; and GTP, 28.9 min. Construction of Three-dimensional Models of KHD of retGC-1—The amino acid sequence of retGC-1 (bovine guanylyl cyclase D; Swiss-Protein code P55203) was aligned using Clustal X (53Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35598) Google Scholar) with the catalytic domains of four protein kinases for which crystal structures have been determined. The KHD sequence of retGC-1 (residues 536–830 using the Swiss Protein sequence numbers) as predicted by the multiple sequence alignment was then modeled using the Swiss PdbViewer 3.7b2 in conjunction with the Swiss Model program (54Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9634) Google Scholar). For modeling of the unstimulated conformation of retGC1, the coordinates of the nonactivated insulin receptor kinase domain (Protein Data Bank code 1IRK) were used as the template; fitting of the model to the template gave a root mean square deviation of 0.40 Å for 1080 carbon-α atoms. For the AMP-PNP-stimulated conformation, the coordinates for the activated insulin receptor kinase domain with bound AMP-PNP (Protein Data Bank code 1IR3) were used; fitting gave a root mean square value of 0.56 Å for 1030 carbon-α atoms. Measurement of retGC Activity—The activity of retGC was measured as described (25Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K. Dizhoor A.M. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 46Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under the assay conditions, the hydrolysis of cGMP formed was negligible, and a linear relationship exists between the retGC activity measured and the protein amounts used. The linear relationship was established even in the highly activated retGC (see Fig. 2B). All of the results about retGC activities were analyzed using the computer program Prism (GraphPad). We note that the concentration of protein used for the enzyme assay is expressed as total protein rather than the rhodopsin concentration frequently used for retGC activity. We also note that the protein concentration measured before the adenine nucleotide preincubation was used to calculate the enzyme activities. This calculation underestimates the actual specific activity of membrane-bound retGC because it includes soluble proteins that are subsequently removed by membrane washes. Measurements of protein concentrations indicated that ∼82% of the total proteins in OS homogenates were membrane-bound, implying that the actual enzyme activity may be ∼20% higher than the activity shown. Other Analytical Methods—Dimerization of retGC was monitored using a cross-linker, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, and Western blotting with a retGC-1-specific antibody (25Yu H. Olshevskaya E.

It should be emphasized that individual points obtained in all experiments represent the average values of duplicate assays and that all experiments were carried out more than two times, and the results were similar.

Pretreatment of OS Homogenates with Adenine Nucleotides Enhances Both Control and GCAP2-stimulated retGC Activities—When OS homogenates were preincubated with 1 mm ATP (37 °C, 30 min) and soluble components were washed out, GCAP2-stimulated retGC activities in membrane fractions were high (Fig. 1). This ATP activation was ∼10 times larger than the GCAP-stimulated retGC activities in GCAP-free membranes (47.6–56.2 as compared with 5.44 nmol cGMP/min/mg formed in the presence of 500 nm GCAP2). Such large activation of retGC was totally unexpected. We also found that the preincubation in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations was more effective than in its low concentration (56.2–47.6 nmol cGMP/min/mg formed in the presence of 500 nm GCAP2).

https://openalex.org/W2130738420,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is important in mediating human allergic diseases. We tested the hypothesis that a human Ig Fcγ-Fcϵ bifunctional chimeric protein, GE2, would inhibit IgE class switch recombination (CSR) by co-aggregating B-cell CD32 and CD23. Indeed, GE2 directly inhibited ϵ germ-line transcription, subsequent CSR to ϵ and IgE protein production. This CSR inhibition was dependent on CD23 binding and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and it was mediated via suppression of interleukin-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation. Treatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAPKK1 (MEK1)) and MEK2 reversed the ability of GE2 to decrease CSR and STAT6 phosphorylation. GE2 stimulation induced ERK phosphorylation, whereas it did not alter the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38 MAPK. The ability of GE2 to block human isotype switching to ϵ, in addition to its already demonstrated ability to inhibit mast cell and basophil function, suggests that it will provide an important novel benefit in the treatment of IgE-mediated diseases.

Allergic antibodies (IgE) play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, and severe allergic reactions to foods, drugs, and insect stings. These common and important diseases are of increasing concern worldwide. Removal of IgE by anti-IgE therapy has been shown to have clinical utility in the treatment human airway allergic disease (1Milgrom H. Fick Jr., R.B. Su J.Q. Reimann J.D. Bush R.K. Watrous M.L. Metzger W.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). However, anti-IgE does not interfere with the underlying issue of ongoing IgE production. Receptors for IgE and IgG are expressed, respectively, on human B cells as the low affinity trimeric IgE receptor (FcϵRII 1The abbreviations used are: FcϵRII, low affinity trimeric IgE receptor; FcγRII, Fc gamma receptor type II; αCD23, anti-CD23 antibody(s); sCD23, soluble CD23; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GT, germ-line transcript; MAPK, mitogenactivated protein kinase; CSR, class switch recombination; DC-PCR, digestion-circularization PCR; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR; CTs, switch circle transcripts; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; Ab, antibody; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; Ab, antibody; IL, interleukin; CT, circle transcript; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. (CD23)) and as two isoforms of the Fc gamma receptor type II (FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB (CD32)). CD23 has been proposed to be an important regulator of IgE synthesis (2Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Specific IgE antibody titers were increased and sustained in CD23-deficient mice as compared with controls (3Yu P. Kosco-Vilbois M. Richards M. Kohler G. Lamers M.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Anti-CD23 antibody (αCD23) treatment of rats inhibited antigen-specific IgE immune response by 90% (4Flores-Romo L. Shields J. Humbert Y. Graber P. Aubry J.P. Gauchat J.F. Ayala G. Allet B. Chavez M. Bazin H. Science. 1993; 261: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Human in vitro IgE production was also inhibited by monoclonal αCD23, an effect that was shown to require the Fcγ domain, as F(ab′)2 αCD23 was ineffective (5Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Brams P. Hariharan K. Chamat S. Cao X. LaBarre M.J. Chinn P.C. Morena R.A. Shestowsky W.S. Li Y.P. Chen A. Reff M.E. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, cross-linking of CD32 with CD23 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to down-modulate IgE production. We recently developed a novel human Ig Fcγ-Fcϵ bifunctional chimeric protein (GE2) (Fig. 1a) that inhibits mast cell and basophil FcϵRI-mediated function in vitro and in vivo (6Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because GE2 can cross-link CD32 with CD23, we tested this chimeric protein for its ability to affect IgE class switching and examined the events underlying this effect. IL-4 is a key participant in human Ig class switching and, in particular, in the production of IgE (7Lebman D.A. Coffman R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Berton M.T. Uhr. J.W. Vitetta E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2829-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The α chain of the IL-4 receptor activates the Janus kinase (JAK) family members followed by subsequent phosphorylation and activation of STAT6 (9Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT6 dimerizes and binds to the STAT6 consensus sequences in the IgH ϵ germ-line promoter and activates ϵ germ-line transcription with production of ϵ germ-line transcripts (ϵGTs), which themselves are felt to be important for switching to IgE. For optimal ϵ germ-line transcription and ϵGT production, synergy between IL-4 stimulation and a second signal through CD40 is required (13Shapira S.K. Vercelli D. Jabara H.H. Fu S.M. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) plays an important role in CD40 induction of ϵGTs (14Brady K. Fitzgerald S. Ingvarsson S. Borrebaeck C.A. Moynagh P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and is related to Ig class switch recombination (CSR) in our system (15Zhang K. Zhang L. Zhu D. Bae D. Nel A. Saxon A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110: 421-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined whether GE2 could alter induced isotype switching in primary human B cells. Sμ-Sϵ recombination was measured by digestion-circularization PCR (DC-PCR), and switch circle transcripts (CTs) and ϵGTs were assessed by RT-PCR. We also examined the effect of GE2 on IL-4 and αCD40-driven phosphorylation and activation of STAT6 as well as on phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. Reagents—Human IL-4 was purchased from R & D Systems. Anti-CD40 mAb G28.5 was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Anti-human IgE antibody (Mae1) against the Chϵ1 domain was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Jardieu (Genentech). Anti-ERK antibody (Ab), anti-phosphorylated ERK Ab, anti-JNK Ab, anti-phosphorylated JNK Ab, anti-p38 MAPK Ab, anti-phosphorylated p38 Ab, anti-phosphorylated STAT6 Ab, and U0126 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-STAT6 Ab was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 were obtained from Calbiochem. Restriction endonucleases and ligase were from Promega (Madison, WI). GE2 Construction and Expression—The construction and expression of the human Fcγ-Fcϵ Ig chimeric gene has been described in detail previously (6Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The expression vector containing the novel Ig Fcγ-Fcϵ chimeric gene was transfected into SP2/0 cells. GE2 was expressed in cell culture supernatants and purified using an anti-human IgE affinity column. The GE2 protein was reacted with anti-human ϵ- and γ-chain-specific antibodies. Cells and Cell Culture—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy volunteers by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque. Human B cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by T cell depletion after monocytes/macrophages and natural killer cells were removed. Human B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Omega, Tarzana, CA). DC-PCR for Human Sμ-Sϵ Recombination—DC-PCR was performed as described (16Yamada T. Zhu D. Saxon A. Zhang K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28830-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and was used to quantify the levels of Sμ-Sϵ recombination in stimulated primary human B cells. Genomic DNA was digested with BglII followed by ligation under conditions favoring self-ligation. The resultant ligated DNA was precipitated, and the appropriate amounts of DNA were used as templates for PCR with 5′ end primer (5′-GATATGCTGTTTGCACAAACTAG-3′) and 3′ end primer (5′-AACAACCCTCATGACCACCAGCT-3′). Amplification for 40 cycles was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The size of the expected PCR product was 222 bp. To verify the amount of ligated DNA between different groups and the efficiency for digestion and ligation of the input DNA sample, the human activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene was used as an unrelated control gene for the DC-PCR assay. BglII digestion generated a 4578-bp fragment from the human AID gene (EMBL/GenBank™ accession no. AB040430). 5′ end primer 5′-CCATGGTACAAATCTCAGGACGAATC-3′ and 3′ end primer 5′-AGATGGTGAAACCCCGTCTCTATTAA-3′ were used. This pair of primers amplified a 238-bp product. PCR was conducted with 10 ng of ligated DNA as templates at 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Ig Measurements—Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human IgE Ab against Chϵ1 and anti-human IgA Ab, respectively. Anti-human IgE Ab against Chϵ1 was necessary, as standard IgE assays detected the GE2 protein. After the wells were blocked with 0.1% gelatin for at least 1 h, 100 μl of culture supernatants was plated in duplicate wells, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After the plates were washed, alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-human IgE Ab with anti-human IgA Ab was added for detection. Absorbance was read with a Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total mRNA was obtained from stimulated and unstimulated cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA suspended in 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was digested with DNase I (Sigma) to remove possible contaminating DNA and was then extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by precipitation in ethanol. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA as described previously (17Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All PCR assays were done in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). For detection of IgH ϵGTs and GAPDH, PCR was conducted with 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1min. 5′ end primer 5′-AGCTGTCCAGGAACCCGACAGGGAG-3′ and 3′ end primer 5′-GTTGATAGTCCCTGGGGTGTA-3′ were used to amplify ϵGTs. 5′ end primer 5′-CTGCATCTGACTGTGCTTTCTGAG-3′ and 3′ end primer 5′-TTGTCAGCCTCATCAGGATTAGTG-3′ were used for FcγRIIA. 5′ end primer 5′-ATCACTGTCCAAGTGCCCAGCATG-3′ and 3′ end primer 5′-TTGACATGGTCGTTGGGAGGAAGA-3′ were used for FcγRIIB. The amplification conditions used for FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB PCR were 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Switch Circle RNA Transcripts—After total mRNA was obtained and reverse-transcribed to cDNA, CTs were amplified with the forward primer Iϵ 5′-GACGGGCCACACCATCCACAGGCACCAAATGGACGAC-3′ together with the reverse primer Cμ 5′-GTTGCCGTTGGGGTGCTGGAC-3′. Iϵ-Cμ (408 bp) CTs were amplified for 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (18Litinskiy M.B. Nardelli B. Hilbert D.M. He B. Schaffer A. Casali P. Cerutti A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Densitometric Analysis—The images of ethidium-stained gels were recorded using the gel documentation system Speedlight Platinum (Lightools Research, Encinitas, CA). The intensity of each band was measured with the BioImage software Basic Quantifier (Genomic Solutions Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). The samples were diluted to 50, 20, 10, and 5% before PCR amplification. The final quantitative estimates for the densitometric analysis were taken from the linear part of the curve. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Samples containing equal amount of protein were boiled with electrophoresis sample buffer for 3 min and separated using SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to the membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in pH 7.4 PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated with primary Abs for one h at room temperature, and washed and followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary Abs for 1 h. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax film from Eastman Kodak Co. Inhibition of Sμ-Sϵ Recombination and IgE Production by Ig Fcγ-Fcϵ Fusion Protein—We assessed the ability of GE2 to modulate IL-4-induced isotype switching in primary human B cells using DC-PCR. Sμ-Sϵ recombination was detected in highly purified primary B cells stimulated with IL-4-plus-CD40 (Fig. 1b , 2nd lane from left) but not in unstimulated cells (1st lane). IL-4-plus-CD40-induced-Sμ-Sϵ recombination was inhibited by GE2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b, last 4 lanes). Sμ-Sϵ recombination was decreased by 85% at 5 μg/ml of GE2 as measured by densitometry of the DC-PCR products. Because cross-linking of CD32 with CD23 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to down-modulate IgE production and GE2 suppressed IL-4-induced CSR, we also tested the effects of GE2 on IgE production from human B cells. IL-4-plus-CD40-induced IgE production was decreased by 65 and 75%, respectively, in the presence of 5 or 10 μg/ml GE2, although IgA production was unchanged (Fig. 1d). The Effect of GE2 on CTs—CSR from the mu gene generates an extrachromosomal reciprocal switch DNA recombination product, a switch circle with the IH promoter of the targeted CH gene, the switched DNA fragment, and Cμ (Fig. 2a). The IH promoter in the switch circle drives transcription of a chimeric I-Cμ product, referred to as CT (19Kinoshita K. Harigai M. Fagarasan S. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12620-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We also measured the effect of GE2 on IL-4-plus-CD40-induced CSR to ϵ by measuring the respective switch CTs (Fig. 2b , Iϵ-Cμ). Densitometric analysis provided that the inhibitory effect of GE2 on CSR to ϵ was 90%. GE2 Negatively Regulates Production of IgH ϵ Germ-line Transcripts—Expression of GTs from specific IgH loci is important in Ig CSR preceding the occurrence of isotype switching to those loci (20Stevnezer-Nordgren J. Sirlin S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody has been reported recently to inhibit ϵ GT production in B cells (21Yabuuchi S. Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Reff M.E. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because GE2 binds to CD23, we examined the ability of GE2 to alter IL-4-plus-CD40 induction of ϵGT transcription. GE2 inhibited IL-4-plus-CD40-induced ϵGT production in primary human B cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). Semi-quantitative analysis comparing these data demonstrated that GE2 at 5 μg/ml reduced IL-4-plus-CD40-driven production of ϵGTs by 80% (Fig. 3, a and b). Because CD32 binding is predicted to be involved in the effects of GE2 that we observed, we examined B cell expression of the variant forms of CD32, FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB, using RT-PCR and flow cytometry. This determination is important because FcγRIIA is an “activating” ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-containing receptor, whereas FcγRIIB is an “inhibitory” ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif)-containing receptor. We found that CD32 expressed on resting human B cells is almost exclusively express FcγRIIA. Stimulation with IL-4-plus-CD40 or cross-linking B cell receptors (membrane Ig) using F(ab′)2 anti-human Ig for 15 h increased expression of FcγRIIB mRNA more than 6-fold, whereas FcγRIIA expression was unchanged (data not shown). GE2 Inhibited STAT6 Phosphorylation in Primary Human B Cells—Because activation of STAT6 is essential in mediating the IL-4 response (12Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S Nakanishi K Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in both expression of ϵGTs and isotype switching to IgE (22Linehan L.A. Warren W.D. Thompson P.A. Grusby M.J. Berton M.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 302-310PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether IL-4-induced STAT6 activation was affected by GE2. Samples from appropriately stimulated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis with specific anti-phosphorylated STAT6. Phosphorylated STAT6 was detectable 1 h after IL-4 stimulation and remained elevated throughout 4 h of incubation (Fig. 4). However, IL-4-stimulated B cells treated with GE2 failed to maintain STAT6 phosphorylation beyond 1 h. PD98059 Reversed GE2-induced Suppression—It has been reported recently that MAPKs inhibit STAT activation and that a MEK inhibitor reversed this effect (23Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Bode J.G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18810-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To examine whether MAPK signaling is involved in the GE2 inhibition of ϵ CSR and IgE production, we tested the ability of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, to reverse the GE2-driven decrease in STAT6 phosphorylation. MEK1 and MEK2 act directly upstream of ERK-1 and ERK-2. Treatment with PD98059 almost completely reversed the ability of GE2 to decrease STAT6 phosphorylation (Fig. 5a , 4th lane from left). This same outcome was also observed using U0126, another specific MEK inhibitor that is structurally unrelated to PD98059, whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not reverse the GE2 effects (data not shown). To demonstrate the physiological relevance of this MEK inhibition, we examined its effect on GE2-induced suppression of IgE CSR. Pre-incubation of B cells with PD98059 also resulted in a near complete reversal of GE2-mediated inhibition of Sμ-Sϵ CSR in human primary B cells (Fig. 5b , 4th lane). MEK inhibition also reversed GE2-induced suppression of IL-4-plus-CD40-induced ϵGTs (Fig. 5c , 4th lane). p38 MAPK inhibition with SB203580 did not alter this suppression of ϵGT induction (data not shown). The Effect of GE2 on MAPK Phosphorylation—As the effects of GE2 on IgE CSR were reversed by specific inhibitors of MEK1 and MEK2, we examined the effect of GE2 on MAPK family signaling, which is critical in a variety of cellular functions. As expected, within 5 min after GE2 stimulation, ERK phosphorylation began to rise, reached a maximum at 15 min, and was maintained for 45 min (Fig. 6a). In contrast, GE2 did not alter the phosphorylation of JNK or p38 MAPK, although IL-4-plus-CD40 activated JNK and p38 MAPK (Fig. 6b , lane 3). We also tested for any effect of GE2 on IL-4-plus-CD40-driven phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK; no effects were detected in our system. Soluble CD23 Blocked the Effect of GE2—To test whether the GE2-induced ERK phosphorylation and GE2 inhibition of CSR are dependent on CD23 binding, we used a trimeric soluble CD23 (sCD23), which competes with CD23 on B cells for binding to the Fc ϵ region of GE2. Primary human B cells were cultured with GE2, GE2-plus-sCD23, or the appropriate controls, and the resulting ERK phosphorylation was examined. GE2-induced ERK phosphorylation was blocked by sCD23 in a dose-dependent matter (Fig. 7a). Soluble CD23 (10 μg/ml) reversed GE2 (5 μg/ml)-induced phosphorylation by 50%. This treatment also reversed GE2-induced inhibition of ϵGTs by 40% as determined by densitometry analysis of ϵGTs (Fig. 7b). Treatment with soluble α-chain of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI), which binds with very high affinity to the Fcϵ region involved in interaction with CD23, also blocked (85%) the ability of GE2 to inhibit ϵGT production (data not shown). Furthermore, we showed that sCD23 was able to reverse GE2 inhibition of CSR to ϵ by measuring the production of CTs (Fig. 7c , Iϵ-Cμ). To Optimally Inhibit ϵGTs and CTs, GE2 Needs To Be Present at the Time of Stimulation—To determine whether the inhibition of ϵGTs and CSR requires the presence of GE2 at the time of stimulation, cultures were established and GE2 was added at later time points. When GE2 was added 8 and 24 h following IL-4-plus-CD40 stimulation (Fig. 8), there was a marked loss of GE2 inhibitory effects. Densitometric analysis revealed that an 8-h delay led to a 45% decrease in the GE2 inhibitory effect on ϵGTs and a 20% decrease in the inhibition of CTs. A 24-h delay led to a 50% decrease in the GE2 inhibitory effect on ϵGTs and a 50% loss in the inhibition of CTs. Conversely, when GE2 was removed after an initial 1-h incubation, its inhibitory effect on the production of ϵGTs was reduced by 50% (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of GE2 to directly alter B cells isotype switching to ϵ and examined the mechanisms underlying this effect. IL-4-plus-CD40-induced Sμ-Sϵ recombination was inhibited by GE2 in a dose-dependent manner. GE2 inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the induction of IgE production and IL-4-plus-CD40-induced ϵGT production in primary human B cells. At the same time, GE2 inhibited STAT6 phosphorylation. Treatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, reversed the ability of GE2 to decrease STAT6 phosphorylation, to inhibit of Sμ-Sϵ CSR, and to induce ϵGTs. Furthermore, GE2 induced ERK phosphorylation, although it did not alter the phosphorylation of JNK or p38 MAPK. IL-4-plus-CD40-induced IgE were decreased by 75% in the presence GE2, whereas IgA production was unchanged. GE2 blocked IL-4-plus-CD40-induced CSR to ϵ. GE2 also inhibited production of ϵ GTs. These data are underscored by our results showing that GE2 has an inhibitory effect on IL-4-induced signaling for CSR in B cells and are further supported by the ability of GE2 to inhibit STAT6 phosphorylation, features known to play important roles in mediating the IL-4 response. This report shows that a human Ig Fcγ-Fcϵ bifunctional chimeric protein inhibits CSR and activates ERK in human B cells, effects not previously reported. At this time, it is difficult to be definitive as to the exact role of CD23 and/or FcγR binding. As will be described below, we feel that the overall data support the hypothesis that binding to both CD23 and FcγR is involved in the inhibitory effect of GE2 on CSR. CD23 binding appears to play a pivotal role in the inhibitory effect of GE2s, as might be predicted from studies with monoclonal anti-CD23 (21Yabuuchi S. Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Reff M.E. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although how GE2 induces ERK phosphorylation is unknown, we found that it is also dependent on CD23 binding. Monoclonal anti-CD23 antibody induces intracellular signaling, e.g. polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, and a rise in intracellular Ca2+ linked to a GTP-binding protein (24Kolb J.P. Renard D. Dugas B.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Nakamura et al. (5Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Brams P. Hariharan K. Chamat S. Cao X. LaBarre M.J. Chinn P.C.

Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) found that the inhibitory effect of αCD23 on human IgE production is dependent on the Fcγ domain and GE2 is expected to function through FcγR binding. However, the role(s) of FcγRIIA versus -B in the effects of GE2 will require further dissection. It has been reported recently that the triggering of FcγRIIA activates ERK (26Fernandez N. Renedo M. Sanchez Crespo M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). If GE2 binds to and cross-links CD23 to FcγRIIA on the surface of B cells, this should lead to ERK activation and may be one likely pathway for the effect of GE2. This is further supported by our data in which GE2-induced ERK phosphorylation was observed within 15 min, a time frame wherein detectable FcγRII expression is exclusively of the type A form. On the other hand, FcγRIIB is highly expressed on activated as opposed to resting B cells. Co-aggregation of FcγRIIB with other receptors (e.g. B cell receptor) is well known to have inhibitory effects on B cells by activating an inositol polyphosphate 5′-phosphatase (SHIP) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) (27Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 28D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, a pathway(s) utilizing cross-linking CD23 to FcγRIIB may also be involved in GE2 effects. However, GE2 inhibition of ϵGT and CSR was markedly but not completely abrogated when the GE2 were added 24 h after IL-4-plus-CD40 stimulation (Fig. 8), a time when FcγRIIB expression was enhanced. Further supporting the interaction of GE2 with FcγRIIA was the loss of 50% of the GE2 effect when it was removed after 1 h. Overall, these data showing that GE2-driven inhibition of CSR mainly occurs early suggests that it is mediated via FcγRIIA, although some lesser effect at later times via other pathway(s) is likely. An alternative explanation for the effects of GE2 is that it binds to and limits the mobility of FcγRII in the cell membrane. Although possible, we find this explanation less likely, as it has been found from studies with intact monoclonal antibodies to B cell surface molecules other than CD23 (e.g. CD19 or CD22), which would be expected to limit the mobility of FcR in the B cell membrane, that they generally fail to inhibit CSR. We have also recently developed a human bifunctional human Ig Fcγ-Fcγ protein for other purposes and took the opportunity to test the effect of this protein on CSR. This human Ig Fcγ-Fcγ protein, in doses up to 10 μg/ml, had no effect on primary B cell CSR in our system (data not shown). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of GE2 working via altering the mobility of FcγRII, we think it unlikely. That GE2 appears to work, at least in part, via ERK activation, raises the question as to how ERK activation would effect CSR. Extensive studies on the mechanisms underlying IL-4 signaling have provided insight into how IL-4 regulates immune responses that involve a complex interaction of signaling pathways including the activation of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6 (29Jiang H. Harris M.B. Rothman P. J. Allergy. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 105: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). ERK has been shown to regulate suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) (23Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Bode J.G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18810-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since SOCS-1 and -3 control STAT6 activation (30Haque S.J. Harbor P.C. Williams B.R. J. Biol.

In this study we have demonstrated that GE2, a novel human Ig Fcγ-Fcϵ bifunctional chimeric protein that cross-links CD23 and CD32 on the surface of human B cells, is able to directly inhibit CSR to the ϵ IgH locus. This effect was mediated, at least partially, by an effect on the ERK-STAT pathway. GE2 has recently been shown to inhibit antigen-driven IgE-induced activation of and mediator release in basophils and mast cells by co-aggregating FcϵRI with FcγRIIB (6Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, our demonstration of the ability of GE2 to inhibit CSR to IgE makes GE2 increasingly interesting as a potential therapy in human allergic diseases.

Potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor inhibited the residual activity of the mutants. The functional activity of the mutants in a plasma clot lysis assay correlated with their chromogenic activity. The effect of the mutations on other substrates depended on the particular mutation, with some of the mutants possessing more activity against hippuryl-His-leucine than wild type TAFIa.

Although it might seem that removal of one or a few amino acids from the C terminus of a peptide or protein would be of limited importance, it can have profound effects on their biological activity (1Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes (Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F., eds). Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). CPs perform many diverse functions in the body. These include digestion and assimilation of dietary proteins, processing of peptide hormone precursors, regulation of peptide hormone activity, and regulation of protein binding. Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI, EC 3.4.17.20) is a plasma protein that has basic carboxypeptidase activity upon activation. It is also known as plasma carboxypeptidase B, carboxypeptidase U, and carboxypeptidase R. TAFI is synthesized by the liver and circulates in plasma as a zymogen within a concentration range of 50–150 nm. It has been shown to play a role in the regulation of fibrinolysis both in vitro and in vivo (2Bajzar L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Nesheim M. Walker J. Wang W. Boffa M. Horrevoets A. Bajzar L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

TAFI is a glycoprotein with a M r ∼58,000. Following its activation by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex, activated TAFI (TAFIa) cleaves C-terminal basic residues of fibrin that are newly exposed by plasmin cleavage. Since these C-terminal basic residues are high affinity binding sites for both plasminogen and plasminogen activators, they serve as an amplification system for plasmin production. When TAFIa removes these C-terminal basic residues, plasmin production is reduced, leading to slower lysis of the clot. TAFIa may also be involved in plasmin-mediated cell migration (6Plow E.F. Allampallam K. Redlitz A. Trend. Cardiovas. Med. 1997; 7: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In vitro TAFIa can cleave a number of peptides with biological activity in the circulation such as bradykinin and anaphylatoxins (7Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5611-5816Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Shinohara T. Sakurada C. Suzuki T. Takeuchi O. Campbell W. Ikeda S. Okada N. Okada H. Int. Arch. Allergy.

In vivo, these peptides are degraded rapidly by the second CP present in plasma, carboxypeptidase N (CPN, EC 3.4.17.3). CPN is a M r ∼280,000 tetrameric enzyme consisting of two small catalytic subunits and two large glycosylated subunits. It is synthesized by the liver and circulates in plasma at 100 nm in a constitutively active form (10Erdos E.G. Erdos E.G. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Vol. 25. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1979: 427-487Google Scholar). Both TAFI and CPN belong to a class of metallocarboxypeptidases that catalyze the hydrolysis of the C-terminal peptide bond in peptides and proteins. Based on sequence analysis, metallocarboxypeptidases can be divided into two groups: 1) carboxypeptidases A1, A2, and B, TAFI, and mast cell carboxypeptidase A and 2) carboxypeptidases N, H/E, M, D, and Z (11Skidgel R.A. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Diseases. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1996: 241-283Google Scholar). The sequence similarity is high within each group (40–58%) but much lower between the two groups (14–20%). CPs from the first group are synthesized as inactive zymogens and require removal of a propeptide before they exert carboxypeptidase activity, optimally at neutral pH. Active CPAs have a preference for aromatic or aliphatic residues, whereas active CPBs favor basic residues. A naturally occurring small protein, carboxypeptidase inhibitor from potato (CPI), and synthetic compounds such as guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid inhibit the activity of these CPs. The three-dimensional structure and the mechanism of action for pancreatic carboxypeptidases A and B have been widely studied and are very similar (12Rees D.C. Lewis M. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 367-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 13Schmid M. Herriott J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Aviles F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, carboxypeptidases from the second group are constitutively active toward basic residues at various pH optima and possess a long C-terminal extension whose functions are unknown (11Skidgel R.A. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Diseases. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1996: 241-283Google Scholar). Although they are inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, they are not susceptible to inhibition by CPI. They perform important functions in regulation of biologically active peptides such as processing of propeptide hormones (15Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Steiner D.F. Docherty K. Carroll R. J. Cell.

Recently, the crystal structure of CPD has been elucidated and revealed an overall topological similarity to that of CPA and CPB but with unique structural features that may explain differences in the activity of the two groups of CPs (20Gomis-Ruth F.X. Companys V. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to investigate the structural basis for the differences in substrate specificity and susceptibility to CPI for CPs from the two groups. In this study, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to switch residues that may be involved in substrate binding between TAFI, a member of the first group of CPs, and CPN as a representative of the second group of CPs and then investigated the properties of the mutants. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. The mammalian expression vector, pCEP 4, Lipofectin, and Opti-MEM were from Invitrogen. Polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody, human TAFI-deficient plasma, human carboxypeptidase N, and TAFI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit were from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN. SP-Sepharose fast flow was from Amersham Biosciences. Centriprep 10 was from Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA. SDS-PAGE gels were from BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME.

Tissue plasminogen activator was from Genentech, South San Francisco, CA. Pefabloc SC was from Roche Applied Science. Construction of TAFI Mutants—All TAFI mutants were constructed based on the previously described wild type sequence (21Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except with alanine at position 147 of the zymogen (22Zhao L. Morser J. Bajzar L. Nesheim M. Nagashima M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into pCEP 4/TAFI, a plasmid coding for wild type TAFI cDNA, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A pair of primers was used to construct each of four point mutants, one with Asp to Gln mutation at position 256 (TAFI D256Q) (numbering starts with the first alanine of activated TAFI), one with Ser to Asp mutation at position 207 (TAFI S207D), one with Leu to Trp mutation at position 248 (TAFI L248W), and one with Asp to Ala mutation at position 257 (TAFI D257A). The primers used for TAFID256Q were 5′-ATAGATCCAATCCTGCCCACCTCCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGAGGTGGGCAGGATTGGATCTAT-3′; the primers used for TAFI-S207D were 5′-GGGACGATTGGATCTATCTATTGGGCATCAAATATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATATTTGATGCC CAATAGATAGATCCAATCGTCCC-3′; the primers used for TAFI-L248W were 5′-GGCTCAGAAACCTGGTACCTAGCTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAGCTAGGTACCAGGTTT CTGAGCC-3′; and the primers used for TAFI-D257A were 5′-TGGAGGTGGGGATGCTTGGATCTATGA-3′ and 5′-TCATAGATCCAAGCATCCCCACCTCCA-3′. A double mutant, TAFI D256Q/S207D, was constructed with the same pair of primers used for mutating Ser-207 to Asp using TAFI D256Q DNA as the template. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant TAFI—Expression plasmids coding for wild type and mutant TAFI were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using Lipofectin. Clones that expressed TAFI stably were selected by culturing cells in the presence of 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. For production of recombinant wild type and mutant TAFI, stably expressing clones were cultured in Opti-MEM. Conditioned medium was harvested after either 48 h or 72 h, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and stored at –20 °C in the presence of 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC. Expression of TAFI in the conditioned medium was confirmed by separation of proteins on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody. To isolate wild type and mutant TAFI, typically 1 liter of conditioned medium was diluted 20-fold with H2O and adjusted to pH 6.8 with 0.1 m HCl. The sample was applied to a 25-ml SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and washed extensively with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a salt gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting as above. Fractions containing recombinant TAFI were pooled and then concentrated using Centriprep 10. Purity was determined by silver staining of the gel following SDS-PAGE. The quantity of mutant and wild type TAFI was determined both by using the TAFI ELISA kit as well as by Western blotting with polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody. For identification and characterization of the second TAFI species present in the purified preparations of TAFI-L248W and TAFI-S207D, Western blotting of an SDS-PAGE was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-human TAFI peptide antibody raised against the peptide SEAVRAIEKTSKNT (residues 224–237). Reduction and alkylation of the samples was carried out by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol to samples of the TAFI mutants in SDS loading buffer and boiling for 10 min followed by addition of 50 mm iodoacetamide before analyzing by SDS-PAGE. For N-terminal sequencing, the samples were further purified on a plasminogen affinity column as described previously (22Zhao L. Morser J. Bajzar L. Nesheim M. Nagashima M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to remove trace contaminants. The N-terminal sequence was determined by 241 protein sequencer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) that uses standard N-terminal chemistry. Activation of TAFI and Carboxypeptidase B Activity Assay—Recombinant wild type or mutant TAFI (17 nm) was activated with 15 nm thrombin, 50 nm thrombomodulin, and 5 mm CaCl2 in 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 5–20 min. Activation was stopped by addition of 1 μm PPACK and was confirmed by analyzing denatured samples on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody. A non-activated control was prepared by preincubating PPACK with thrombin for 10 min before recombinant wild type or mutant TAFI and thrombomodulin were added. Carboxypeptidase B activity of TAFIa was measured in a chromogenic assay using hippuryl-arginine as the substrate. Carboxypeptidase activity of recombinant wild type and mutant TAFI was also measured using several other substrates: hippuryl-lysine, hippuryl-His-leucine, and hippuryl-phenylalanine. Carboxypeptidase N (3.6 nm) and pancreatic carboxypeptidase A (28.6 nm) were included in the assays as controls. Enzymes were incubated with these substrates for 30 min at room temperature, and the rate of hydrolysis was determined by conversion of the product, hippuric acid, to a chromogen with cyanuric chloride dissolved in dioxane. Briefly, in a 96-well microtiter plate, 12 μl of TAFIa, carboxypeptidase N, or carboxypeptidase A was mixed with 24 μl of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 12 μl of H2O, and 12 μl of 25 mm substrate dissolved in 20 mm NaOH. The reaction was stopped by addition of 80 μlof0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, and 60 μl of 3% (w/v) cyanuric chloride in dioxane. After mixing thoroughly by pipetting, the clear supernatant was transferred to a new well, and absorbance was measured at 382 nm. The background absorbance obtained in the absence of the enzyme was subtracted from all the measurements. The effect of CPI on the carboxypeptidase activity of TAFIa was determined by 5-min preincubation of the enzymes with CPI (1 μm final), which had been purified as described previously (23Nagashima M. Werner M. Wang M. Zhao L. Light D.R. Pagila R. Morser J. Verhallen P. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 333-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) prior to addition of the substrate. Plasma Clot Lysis Assay—In a 96-well microtiter plate, 30 μl of human TAFI-deficient plasma containing 12 μl of recombinant TAFI was mixed with 3 μlof0.8 μm thrombomodulin and 60 μl of assay buffer (40 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 80, pH 7.0). The mixture was immediately added to another well containing 4 μl of 75 NIH units/ml thrombin, 2 μl of 1 m CaCl2, and 4 μl of 29.4 nm tissue plasminogen activator in separate aliquots. The total volume of the mixture was made up to 120 μl with water. The final concentration of wild type or mutant TAFI in the solution was 3.4 nm. After mixing by pipetting, clot formation and lysis were monitored at 405 nm every 1 min at 37 °C using a SpectraMAX 250 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). In some reactions, 5 μl of 24 μm CPI was added to demonstrate the effect of inhibition of TAFIa activity on clot lysis. Lysis time was defined as the time at which turbidity is one-half the difference between the plateau reached after clotting and the base line value achieved at complete lysis. Construction of TAFI Mutants—Comparison of the TAFI sequence with those of other CPs suggested several residues that could be important for the substrate specificity of TAFIa. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence alignment between human TAFI and human CPN using SeqLab software based on secondary structure predictions. Numbering starts with the first alanine of the activated enzyme. Insertions and deletions were introduced to maximize the alignment. Although the overall identity between TAFI and CPN is only 14% (1Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes (Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F., eds). Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar), critical residues involved in zinc binding and catalysis, as well as many of the substrate binding residues, are conserved between the two proteins. From the alignment, we identified residues around the substrate binding site that may contribute to their differences in substrate specificity. We constructed five mutants of human TAFI to investigate these predictions. To test the importance of the negatively charged residues that define the P1′ pocket, Asp-256 in TAFI was mutated to Gln as in CPN. Similarly, Asp-257 was mutated to Ala. Ser-207 in TAFI was mutated to Asp as in CPN since this negatively charged residue in CPN is close to the P1′ pocket. Another mutation converted Leu-248 to Trp to examine the effect of introducing a bulky residue adjacent to Tyr-249 that is known to have an influence on substrate binding. A double mutant of Asp to Gln at residue 256 and Ser to Asp at residue 207 was also constructed to test whether this double mutation would result in cancellation of the effects of the charge reversal caused by either of the single mutations. Following site-directed mutagenesis, the DNA sequence of the plasmids was confirmed. The residues that were mutated are shown in Table I with the corresponding residues in the wild type, as well as in CPN and CPA.Table IA summary of the mutations made in human TAFI and corresponding residues in CPN and CPAResidueTAFI WTaWT, wild type.MutationCPNCPA207SerAspAspGly248LeuTrpTrpIle256AspGlnGlnIle257AspAlaAspAsp256AspGlnGlnIlea WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of TAFI and Mutants—To compare the properties of TAFI mutants with wild type TAFI, the recombinant proteins were expressed in 293 cells. Stable clones were selected, and recombinant proteins were purified by SPSepharose chromatography. Homogeneity of recombinant wild type TAFI was demonstrated using silver staining and Western blotting with polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody after separation on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and B). The purification profile of recombinant TAFI mutants D256Q, D257A, S207D, L248W, and D256Q/S207D was indistinguishable from that of wild type TAFI, implying that these mutations had not lead to gross alterations in their overall properties. As an example, the purification of D256Q is shown in Fig. 2, C and D, in which it can be seen that the mutant TAFI was eluted at the same salt concentration as the wild type TAFI. Wild type TAFI and the D256Q, D257Q, and D256Q/S207D mutants comigrated at the expected molecular weight of ∼58,000, which is similar to that of TAFI purified from plasma. TAFI L248W and S207D both showed a second band with a slightly lower apparent molecular weight than 58,000, both of which differ slightly from each other. From SDS-PAGE, the molecular weight of the second band from L248W and S207D was 49,000 and 50,000, respectively. Western blotting analysis showed that both bands in TAFI S207D and L248W reacted with polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody, indicating that both bands were TAFI (see Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 11). Only a single band was observed in preparations of wild type TAFI and other TAFI mutants (see Fig. 4, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Since the M r 49,000 and M r 50,000 bands in L248W and S207D preparations, respectively, was observed in Western blots of the crude medium that contained protease inhibitors, these smaller TAFI species were not degradation products produced during purification. Furthermore, the finding that the corresponding band was absent in preparations of wild type TAFI and other mutants including the double mutant that had been purified in the same way supports our hypothesis that the formation of these smaller TAFI species were a specific consequence of these particular mutations. Further analysis showed that the smaller TAFI species in S207D and L248W were not due to altered folding since reduction and alkylation of the samples prior to SDS-PAGE did not alter the pattern of the Western blots (data not shown).Fig. 4Activation of wild type (WT) and mutant TAFI by thrombin/thrombomodulin complex. Ten μl of non-activated and activated wild type and mutant TAFI were run on 10% SDS-PAGE under denatured conditions followed by Western blot using a polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody. Activation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples are non-activated and activated wild type TAFI (lanes 1 and 2), TAFI D256Q (lanes 3 and 4), TAFI D257A (lanes 5 and 6), TAFI D256Q/S207D (lanes 7 and 8), TAFI S207D (lanes 9 and 10), and TAFI L248W (lanes 11 and 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The possibility that the smaller TAFI species was the product of a proteolytic cleavage prior to harvesting of the conditioned medium due to altered susceptibility to proteolysis was tested as follows. We first tested the integrity of the N terminus of the mutant L248W by N-terminal sequencing. To do this, we further purified a TAFI L248W preparation by chromatography on plasminogen-Sepharose. Both M r 58,000 and M r 49,000 bands were detected, indicating that both TAFI species bound to plasminogen. The fractions containing the two TAFI species were pooled and concentrated prior to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Only one sequence, FQSGQVLAA, was detected for this mixture of the two forms of TAFI, which is the N-terminal sequence of the zymogen. Thus the N terminus for both the M r 58,000 and the M r 49,000 TAFI species is the same, suggesting that the C terminus of the lower molecular weight form has been proteolytically cleaved. To investigate the possibility that the C-terminal sequence had been truncated, we analyzed the TAFI preparations with an antibody specific for a C-terminal sequence. TAFI L248W and S207D and wild type TAFI were run on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel, and Western blotting was performed with an antibody raised against a peptide with the sequence SEAVRAIEKTSKNT that corresponds to residues 224–237 in the C terminus of TAFI. This antibody recognized wild type TAFI with M r 58,000 (Fig. 3A, lane 1), but it did not recognize the M r 50,000 species in the preparation of the S207D mutant (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Instead it bound to a band of M r 6,000. In the preparation of the L248W mutant, both the M r 58,000 and the M r 49,000 TAFI species were detected by the anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Fig. 3B shows the same samples analyzed with polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody in which the M r 58,000 species can be seen in all three samples and, in addition, the M r 49,000 species in the L248W mutant TAFI and the M r 50,000 species in the S207D TAFI. The intensity of the higher band with M r 58,000 in TAFI S207D (Fig. 3B, lane 2) was much lower than the lower band, indicating that the majority of S207D was in the lower form. This could explain the failure of the polyclonal antibody against the peptide to detect the M r 58,000 band (Fig. 3A, lane 2). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the M r 50,000 and M r 49,000 TAFI species present in S207D and L248W preparations differ in their C terminus and that the former lacked C-terminal residues containing the sequence SEAVRAIEKTSKNT, whereas the latter still contained this sequence. It is of note that the TAFI species with the longer sequence is migrating faster in SDS-PAGE. Activation of TAFI and Mutants—To investigate whether mutations around the substrate binding site influenced activation, wild type and mutant TAFI were incubated with the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex at room temperature. After various times, aliquots were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a polyclonal sheep anti-TAFI antibody. This antibody can only recognize the TAFI zymogen and TAFIa but not the activation peptide following its cleavage (data not shown). The time course of proteolytic activation of wild type and the TAFI mutants was similar when followed from 5 to 20 min, reaching the maximum after 10 min. The profiles after 10 min of activation are shown in Fig. 4. The TAFI zymogen with a molecular weight of 58,000 was cleaved to yield TAFIa with a molecular weight of 35,000 in all cases. Activation of the mutants was also calcium-dependent as shown for wild type TAFI, and activation was more efficient when 150 mm NaCl was used in the activation buffer rather than 300 mm NaCl (data not shown). Although all the mutants could be activated by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex, TAFI D256Q and the double mutant were more readily activated than wild type TAFI. Carboxypeptidase Activity of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant TAFIa—The effect of these mutations on TAFIa activity was measured using hippuryl-arginine as the substrate following their activation with the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex as described above. It is evident that the activity of all the mutants against hippuryl-arginine was greatly reduced (Fig. 5A). This reduction in activity is still significant when the data are normalized for differences in the extent of activation between wild type TAFI and TAFI mutants. Substrates with different C-terminal residues, hippuryl-lysine, hippuryl-His-leucine, and hippuryl-phenylalanine, were used to investigate whether the carboxypeptidase activities of the mutant TAFIa had altered substrate specificity (Fig. 5A). CPN and CPA were tested in the same assays as controls (Fig. 5B). Wild type TAFIa had high activity against hippuryl-arginine, lower activity against hippuryl-lysine, and even lower against hippuryl-His-leucine and hippuryl-phenylalanine, consistent with TAFIa being a basic carboxypeptidase with a preference for C-terminal arginine residues. All mutant TAFIas had greatly reduced activity toward both hippuryl-arginine and hippuryl-lysine as compared with that of wild type TAFIa. However, the magnitude of the reduction in activity toward hippuryl-arginine was greater, and consequently, they showed a slight preference for hippuryl-lysine, as is the case for CPN. CPA had no basic carboxypeptidase activity. Unlike CPA, the mutant TAFIas did not cleave hippury"
