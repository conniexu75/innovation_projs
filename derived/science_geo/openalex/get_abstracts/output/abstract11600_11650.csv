https://openalex.org/W1849137810,"The complete amino acid sequence of Crotalus adamanteus venom phospholipase A2-alpha has been determined by analysis of the five tryptic peptides from the citraconylated, reduced, and S-[14C]carboxamidomethylated enzyme. Earlier studies (Tsao, F. H. C., Keim, P. S., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1975) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 167, 706) provided the information necessary to align the tryptic fragments so that secondary cleavage procedures to establish overlaps were unnecessary. The subunit in the phospholipase A2-alpha dimer is a single polypeptide chain containing 122 amino acids and seven disulfide bonds. The histidine residue implicated in the active site of mammalian phospholipases is at position 47 in the C. adamanteus enzyme and is located in a domain of the molecule which is highly homologous in sequence with corresponding regions of phospholipases from a variety of venom and pancreatic sources. Comparative sequence analysis has revealed insights with regard to the function and evolution of phospholipases A2. Primary structural relationships observed among the snake venom enzymes parallel the phylogenetic classification of the venomous reptiles from which they were derived. It is proposed that phospholipases A2 of this general type be divided into two groups depending upon the presence or absence of distinctive structural features elucidated in this study."

https://openalex.org/W1602899744,"Sequences of human beta-globin mRNA were determined by analysis of complementary DNA. beta-mRNA was transcribed into double-stranded cDNA by RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. cDNA was cut by restriction endonucleases and the fragments were terminally labeled by means of polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. After purification, fragments were degraded by snake venom phosphodiesterase. Alternatively single-stranded [32P]cDNA was prepared by transcription in the presence of [alpha-32P]dCTP and actinomycin D; the product was digested by endonuclease IV and degraded by snake venom phosphodiesterase. cDNA tracts obtained by both labeling methods enabled us to construct a sequence for the translated and 3'-terminal untranslated regions of human beta-mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1576233898,"Developmental curves of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 total content and five monooxygenase activities from control and 3-methylcholanthrene-treated New Zealand White rabbits were determined from 5 days prior to birth to adulthood (110 days of age). Microsomes were concomitantly analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-Acetylarylamine (2-acetylaminofluorene) N-hydroxylase induction by 3-methylcholanthrene parallels quite closely increases in an electrophoretic band of 54,000 daltons and the approximately 2 nm spectral shift to the blue in the Soret peak of the reduced hemoprotein CO complex, and the induced N-hydroxylase activity is markedly inhibited by ..cap alpha..-naphthoflavone in vitro; these parameters develop in rabbits of age 10 days and older. Biphenyl 4-hydroxylase induction by 3-methylcholanthrene is at least 2-fold in the fetus and neonate for the first 10 days of age, is less than 2-fold between 16 and 40 days of age, and is absent in rabbits 50 days and older. Cytochrome P-450-mediated monooxygenases are implicated in the metabolic potentiation of certain carcinogens and other environmental pollutants. These data provide evidence for at least three different tissue-specific forms of regulation of inducible monooxygenase activities and their associated P-450 subunits by tissue-specific genes and the modification of these by temporal genes. These two types ofmore » genetic control may play a role in the susceptibility to chemical carcinogenesis or toxicity as a function of either age or tissue localization.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1560754421,"Ammonia production by hind limbs of rat was studied in perfused preparations during rest, exercise, and hypoxia, and while the perfusate contained epinephrine or cyanide. Ammonia production by hind limbs was also studied in situ during rest and exercise. Strong correlations were observed between ammonia, IMP, and lactate formation. Adenylosuccinate was not present in detectable amounts in resting muscle (less than 1 nmol/g dry weight) but it appeared and rose sharply in exercising muscle, and then declined during recovery. The maximum found was about 18 nmol/g dry weight. When IMP accumulation exceeded 2.8 mumol/g dry weight, the formation of adenylosuccinate diminished, presumably because of an inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase by excess substrate. Exercise resulted in a greatly increased output of ammonia and a decreased output of alanine and glutamine. The tissue contents of aspartate and glutamate were decreased, while that of alanine was increased. The content of malate increased 3-fold during exercise. Epinephrine, hypoxia, and cyanide each caused an increased output of ammonia at the expense of the amino acid content of the tissue. These results provide evidence for the operation of the purine nucleotide cycle in skeletal muscle under various conditions that are associated with an increased rate of glycolysis."

Appearance of the protein is dependent upon the presence of 0.3 M potassium chloride and dithiothreitol in the homogenization buffer. A 6 S protein having greater affinity for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 than 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is observed using all conditions and is increased by the addition of rat serum to cytosol. The 3.2 S protein is neither a serum contaminant nor a component of the 6 S protein and is probably not a consituent of tissues which which are not responsive to vitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W1518798071,"X-ray diffraction, scanning calorimetry, and polarizing light microscopy have used to determine the complete ternary phase diagram egg yolk lecithin/bovine brain sphingomyelin/water over the temperature range 10-44 degrees. The phase diagram shows that lateral separation of phospholipid bilayer phases can arise from variations in both composition and temperature. At 44 degrees in excess water, lecithin and sphingomyelin are miscible at all ratios in a lamellar liquid crystal bilayer phase. For samples containing greater than 33 mol % sphingomyelin, colling to 20 degrees results in the progressive lateral separation of an chain sphingomyelin lamellar gel phase from the lecithin/sphingomyelin liquid crystal bilayer phase. At 20 degrees and below, the spingomyelin gel phase co-exists with an bilayer phase, a stoichiometric peritectic molecular compound (66 mol % lecithin, 33 mol % sphingomyelin). Cooling mixtures containing less than 33 mol % sphingomyelin ultimately separates the compound from a lecithin liquid crystal bilayer phase containing small amounts of sphingomyelin. Although singificant variations in the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio occur in normal and pathological membranes, at 37 degrees our results would suggest complete bilayer phase and lateral phase separation of the ordered sphingomyelin gel phase appears uplikely."

https://openalex.org/W2407266184,"4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (I-hydroxyphenylpyruvate:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating, decarboxylating), EC 1.13.11.27) has been purified 800-fold in 25% yield from human liver by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate fractionation of an acetone powder extract and chromatography on hydroxylapatite, sulfopropyl-Sephadex C-50, and triethylaminoethyl cellulose. The preparation obtained was homogenous as determined by electrophoresis, gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium, and immunodiffusion. A molecular mass of 87 kilodaltons was obtained by sedimentation equilibrium. A subunit mass of 43 kilodaltons was obtained by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzymic activity had two pH optima around 4.5 and 7.8. The enzyme was equally activated by ascorbate or by a combination of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and glutathione in the presence of catalase. It was very sensitive to H,O, inhibition, which was abolished by a reductant and catalase. Addition of Fez+ and of various metal salts had no stimulatory effect on enzyme activity. The activity with the keto form of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate was 40 times higher than with enol tautomer as substrate. During optimized assay conditions, the apparent Michaelis constants were about 50 FM for 02, 0.03 mM for 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and 0.05 mM for phenylpyruvate. The corresponding apparent maximal velocities were 4 and 0.02 mmol mine1 (g of protein)-‘. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by iron and copper chelators. The activity of enzyme inhibited by diethyldithiocarbamate was restored by dialysis. Enzyme inhibited by bathophenanthroline was reactivated to -30% by dialysis and to -60% by addition of Fe’+. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase activity was not inhibited by different thiol group reagents in 1 mM concentrations with the exception of mercurials, which inhibited in lower concentrations. The enzyme contained about five thiol groups and one disulfide bridge/87 kilodaltons as determined by titration with 4-ehloromercuribenzoate and 5,5’dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) and by alkylation with iodo[lWlacetate and iodo[l-14Clacetamide."
https://openalex.org/W2141450310,"32P-labeled cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) RNAs were analyzed for their 5' termini by three different fingerprinting standard procedures. These analyses showed unequivocally that CPMV RNAs lack a structure like m7GpppN ... at their 5' termini. In addition, neither mono-, di- or triphosphorylated [(p)(p)pN ....] termini were found in the respective fingerprints. The inability to label the 5' termini treatment with gamma-32P-ATP and polynucleotide kinase, either per se or after pretreatment with alkaline phosphatase, strongly suggests the absence of a free 5'-OH and a free 5'-phosphate at the 5' terminal nucleotide in CPMV RNAs. The various analyses also showed that no 2' -O-methylated nucleotides, N6-methyladenosines or pseudo-uridines are present in CPMV RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2034597650,"The three RNA species isolated from virions of Uukuniemi virus, a proposed member of the newly defined Bunyaviridae family, have been characterized by analysis of 32P-labeled ribonuclease T1 oligonucleotides separated on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Each species contains unique oligonucleotides not present in the two others, indicating that the genome of this virus is segmented. Each segment appears to contain a unique primary sequence with little or no overlapping among the segments. The complexities of the RNA segments as calculated from the radioactivity in unique oligonucleotides of defined lengths are about 8000 (L RNA), 3500 (M) and 1900 (S) nucleotides. Since these values are similar to the molecular weights determined by other methods, each size class of RNA corresponds to a single molecular species. The presence of a 5' terminal pppAp ... structure in each RNA segment confirms indications from electron microscopy that the apparently circular RNA segments are not covalently closed. The absence of either a 5' terminal ""cap"" or 3' terminal poly(A) supports the concept that Uukuniemi virus is a negative strand virus."
https://openalex.org/W1558024408,"A coagulogen in Limulus lysate has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The purified coagulogen identified by its ability to clot with either trypsin or the purified Limulus clotting enzyme (Tai, J.Y., and Liu, T. Y. (1976) Fed. Proc. 35, 1486) has a molecular weight of 24,500. It consists of a single polypeptide chain of about 220 amino acids with glycine and serine as its NH2- and COOH-terminal residues; respectively. When acted upon by the Limulus clotting enzyme, the coagulogen releases a soluble C-peptide of about 45 amino acids and an insoluble coagulin of about 170 amino acids. The latter interacts in a noncovalent fashion to form the clot. Amino acid analyses together with the results of NH2- and COOH-terminal analyses suggest that the clot formation involves the cleavage of an--Arg--Lys--bond. Trypsin acts on the coagulogen to cause clotting by splitting the same peptide bond."

Only 1 electron was consumed per hemin molecule, and reoxidation of the reduced heme is accompanied by the transfer of 1 electron to oxidizing agents such as cytochrome c, cytochrome b5, or potassium ferricyanide. The present results are in disagreement with earlier dithionite titrations and reoxidation experiments which indicate that liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 is a 2-electron acceptor, but are in accord with previous potentimetric titrations and product yield data which indicate that this hemeprotein is a 1-electron acceptor. The cause for the discrepancy between the present and previous results is not fully understood."

https://openalex.org/W1565476970,"Alpha-Aminoadipate aminotransferase and kynurenine aminotransferase activities were co-purified from the rat kidney supernatant fraction. The resulting preparation was determined to be nearly homogenous by analytical disc gel electrophoresis at pH 8.9 and 7.5 isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A molecular weight of approximately 85,000 was determined on Sephadex G-200 chromatography and sucrose density gradient analysis. The enzyme was determined to be comprised of two subunits of approximately the same molecular weight (45,500 +/- 850) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An isoelectric pH of 6.56 +/- 0.06 was determined by focusing on polyacrylamide gels. Further evidence is provided to support the idea that the alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase and kynureine aminotransferase activities are properties of a single protein: (a) co-purification of the two activities from the rat kidney supernatant fraction with the ratio of their specific activities remaining constant, (b) similar chromatographic behavior, (c) a similarity in their dependence on added pyridoxal-P for activity, and (d) a similar pattern of heat inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1018742255,"Detergent-extracted cytochrome b5, which binds readily to phosphatidylcholine vesicles, has been shown to exchange between vesicles by the following experiments. When preformed cytochrome b5-vesicle complexes are incubated with fresh vesicles a new species arises which sediments in the analytical ultracentrifuge with a rate intermediate between those of the original components. When the same mixture is subjected to free boundary electrophoresis no slow moving component corresponding to pure vesicles is seen. The results of sucrose density gradient centrifugation are also consistent with the conclusion that cytochrome b5 exchanges between vesicles. The possibility that the above results were produced by vesicle fusion or aggregation was eliminated by light-scattering studies and a direct assay for vesicle fusion. The ability of cytochrome b5 to exchange between lipid structures has important implications not only in the cytochrome b5-lipid system but also in enzymatic reactions in which cytochrome b5 is involved."
https://openalex.org/W2099446879,"The effect of a divalent copper-tyrosine complex has been evaluated in rat liver microsome-catalyzed dealkylations. The copper complex, which is provided with superoxide dismutase activity, inhibits at micromolar concentrations aminopyrine, p-nitroanisol, and 7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylations. It has also been found that cumene hydroperoxide-supported p-nitroanisol demethylation, the formation of a 440 nm species, and the formation of superoxide radicals are inhibited by the divalent copper complex. On the other hand, 3-chloroperbenzoic acid has been found to support a copper complex-insensitive 7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylation. Oxygen uptake by rat liver microsomes is also inhibited by the copper complex. The data support the concept that the copper complex acts as a superoxide dismutase at the level of a cytochrome P-450 intermediate species, liganded with superoxide anions."

https://openalex.org/W2149122777,"Initial velocity patterns for human placental choline acetyltransferase show a series of converging lines for both the forward and reverse reaction; with Kacetyl coenzyme A = 11.9 micron, Kcholine = 0.41 mM, KCOA = 8.8 micron, and Kacetylcholine = 1.3 mM. The relative rates of acetylcholine synthesis (Vf) to acetylcholine breakdown (Vr) is 4.5. Product inhibition by acetylcholine is competitive with respect to choline and noncompetitive with respect to acetyl-CoA, while product inhibition by choline is competitive with respect to acetylcholine and noncompetitive with respect to coenzyme A. Chlorocholine, diethylaminoethanol, and acetylaminocholine were used as dead-end inhibitors and shown to inhibit competitively with respect to acetylcholine, and noncompetitively with respect to choline, acetyl-CoA, and CoA. At high choline concentrations, uncompetitive substrate inhibition is observed, and inhibition by acetylaminocholine changes from noncompetitive to competitive. Comparing the reactivity of dimethylaminoethanol to choline, and acetyldimethylaminoethanol to acetylcholine, the maximal velocities obtained with these analogues was approximately 25% of the natural substrates. These data are not consistent with the previously proposed ordered Theorell-Chance reaction mechanism, and have been interpreted in terms of a random binding mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2008366368,"UNTIL recently the presence of steroidal oestrogens in plants has been a matter for debate1, and any physiological significance associated with them has been generally disregarded2,3. Although steroidal oestrogens have been found in extracts of a few species4, the identification of oestrone in Phaseolus was based on equivocal procedures5. Moreover, as with any compound present in low concentration, it is possible that at least some of the oestrogens identified in plant extracts are attributable to external contamination. This risk can be eliminated by demonstrating the incorporation of radioactive label from a known precursor into the compounds of interest. We report here the incorporation of radioactive isotopes from (3RS)-2-14C-mevalonic acid DBED (MVA), 4-14C-oestrone and potassium 6,7-3H-oestrone sulphate into oestradiol by Phaseolus vulgaris L., cultivar Canadian Wonder. This represents the first case known to us of successful labelling of an identified steroidal oestrogen from 14C-MVA in a higher plant. It seems therefore that this class of mammalian sex hormone is produced in plants as well as animals."

https://openalex.org/W19947922,Immature female Sprague-Dawley rats (19-21 days old 50 gm) were used to systematically study DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in nuclei from the uterus after administration of 1 mcg estradiol dissolved in .1 ml of 9% NaC1 solution. Controls received only the saline solution. Experimental conditions included an excess of nucleoside 5-triphosphate and short-time assays (6 minutes) at low temperature to obtain the maximal velocity of the reaction and to minimize RNase activity. Nucleotide incorporation was measured in the absence (low ionic strength medium) or the presence (high ionic strength medium) of .25 M ammonium sulfate under various divalent cation concentrations either in the presence or absence of alpha-amanitin. The alpha-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase activity of nuclei was identical when measured under low ionic strength conditions with either Mg or Mn and under high ionic strength in the presence of Mn (all at 4 mM concentrations). At high ionic strength alpha-amanitin-sensitive activity is about 10 times greater than activity measured at low ionic strength Mn. In all the experiments initiation of new RNA chains was negligible. Estradiol administration leads to: a 50% increase in alpha-amanitin-resistant activity within 1-2 hours under all experimental conditions; a 100% increase by 2 hours in alpha-amanitin-sensitive activity under low ionic strength conditions; but no change in alpha-amanitin-sensitive activity at 6 hours under high ionic strength conditions. Since enzyme activity measured under high ionic strength conditions mainly reflects the number of enzyme molecules engaged in transcription these results suggest that estradiol leads to an early increase in number of alpha-amanitin-resistant molecules engaged in the process of transcription while the number of alpha-amanitin-sensitive molecules remains constant. The increase in alpha-amanitin-sensitive activity obtained under low ionic strength conditions can be interpreted as either an increase in template activity or an activation of the molecules already engaged in the process of transcription or both.(AUTHORS MODIFIED)

Cytochrome b5 and other electron acceptors in the microsomal preparation were saturated with reducing equivalents prior to addition of carbon monoxide to the system. Continued titration in the presence of CO revealed that 1 electron equivalent was required for the formation of P-450(Fe2+)-CO. These results are in agreement with previous findings of 1 electron equivalence for cytochrome P-450 of adrenocortical mitochondria and P-450CAM.
