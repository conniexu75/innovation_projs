https://openalex.org/W2037409969,"Epidemiological studies of the naturally transformable bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae have previously been confounded by high rates of recombination. Sequencing 240 isolates of the PMEN1 (Spain(23F)-1) multidrug-resistant lineage enabled base substitutions to be distinguished from polymorphisms arising through horizontal sequence transfer. More than 700 recombinations were detected, with genes encoding major antigens frequently affected. Among these were 10 capsule-switching events, one of which accompanied a population shift as vaccine-escape serotype 19A isolates emerged in the USA after the introduction of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine. The evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, and macrolides was observed to occur on multiple occasions. This study details how genomic plasticity within lineages of recombinogenic bacteria can permit adaptation to clinical interventions over remarkably short time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2018257401,"Circadian (∼24 hour) clocks are fundamentally important for coordinated physiology in organisms as diverse as cyanobacteria and humans. All current models of the molecular circadian clockwork in eukaryotic cells are based on transcription-translation feedback loops. Non-transcriptional mechanisms in the clockwork have been difficult to study in mammalian systems. We circumvented these problems by developing novel assays using human red blood cells, which have no nucleus (or DNA) and therefore cannot perform transcription. Our results show that transcription is not required for circadian oscillations in humans, and that non-transcriptional events seem to be sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells, we found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins, undergo ∼24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days under constant conditions (that is, in the absence of external cues). Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (that is, tunable by environmental stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian rhythms. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the interdependency of transcriptional and non-transcriptional oscillations in potentially all eukaryotic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2087185095,"Over the last five decades, progress in neural recording techniques has allowed the number of simultaneously recorded neurons to double approximately every 7 years, mimicking Moore's law. Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2086131827,"Circadian clocks are critical timing regulators of physiology and behaviour that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Most mechanistic models of the clock are based on transcription cycles, but evidence for post-translational regulation has recently surfaced in plants and cyanobacteria. Two groups now demonstrate a role for the oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins in maintaining an entrainable oscillation in human red blood cells and in the unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. These data suggest a role for non-transcriptional mechanisms in clock models and open the door to future work exploring the connections between the transcriptional and non-transcriptional circadian machinery. Circadian clocks are critical timing regulators of physiology and behaviour that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Most mechanistic models of the this clock are based on transcription cycles, but some evidence for post-translational regulation has recently surfaced in plants and cyanobacteria. This is one of two groups demonstrating a role for the oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins in maintaining an entrainable oscillation in human red blood cells and a unicellular alga. These data indicate a role for non-transcriptional mechanisms in clock models and open the door to future work exploring the connections between the transcriptional and non transcriptional circadian machinery. Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and coordinate numerous aspects of behaviour, physiology and metabolism, from sleep/wake cycles in mammals to growth and photosynthesis in plants1,2. This daily timekeeping is thought to be driven by transcriptional–translational feedback loops, whereby rhythmic expression of ‘clock’ gene products regulates the expression of associated genes in approximately 24-hour cycles. The specific transcriptional components differ between phylogenetic kingdoms3. The unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri possesses a naturally minimized clock, which includes many features that are shared with plants, such as a central negative feedback loop that involves the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 genes4. Given that recent observations in animals and plants have revealed prominent post-translational contributions to timekeeping5, a reappraisal of the transcriptional contribution to oscillator function is overdue. Here we show that non-transcriptional mechanisms are sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage, although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional components. We identify oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in mammals6. Moreover we show that pharmacological modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on rhythms in Ostreococcus. Post-translational mechanisms, and at least one rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than transcriptional clock regulators. It is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are non-transcriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria7, and are conserved across kingdoms."
https://openalex.org/W2156426644,"Understanding ancient climate changes is hampered by the inability to disentangle trends in ocean temperature from trends in continental ice volume. We used carbonate ""clumped"" isotope paleothermometry to constrain ocean temperatures, and thereby estimate ice volumes, through the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian glaciation. We find tropical ocean temperatures of 32° to 37°C except for short-lived cooling by ~5°C during the final Ordovician stage. Evidence for ice sheets spans much of the study interval, but the cooling pulse coincided with a glacial maximum during which ice volumes likely equaled or exceeded those of the last (Pleistocene) glacial maximum. This cooling also coincided with a large perturbation of the carbon cycle and the Late Ordovician mass extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1990432147,"How tightly tuned are the synaptic and intrinsic properties that give rise to neuron and circuit function? Experimental work shows that these properties vary considerably across identified neurons in different animals. Given this variability in experimental data, this review describes some of the complications of building computational models to aid in understanding how system dynamics arise from the interaction of system components. We argue that instead of trying to build a single model that captures the generic behavior of a neuron or circuit, it is beneficial to construct a population of models that captures the behavior of the population that provided the experimental data. Studying a population of models with different underlying structure and similar behaviors provides opportunities to discover unsuspected compensatory mechanisms that contribute to neuron and network function."

https://openalex.org/W2118775306,"We report that, in the rat, administering insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II, also known as IGF2) significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting. Inhibitory avoidance learning leads to an increase in hippocampal expression of IGF-II, which requires the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein β and is essential for memory consolidation. Furthermore, injections of recombinant IGF-II into the hippocampus after either training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting. To be effective, IGF-II needs to be administered within a sensitive period of memory consolidation. IGF-II-dependent memory enhancement requires IGF-II receptors, new protein synthesis, the function of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein and glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Moreover, it correlates with a significant activation of synaptic GSK3β and increased expression of GluR1 (also known as GRIA1) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor subunits. In hippocampal slices, IGF-II promotes IGF-II receptor-dependent, persistent long-term potentiation after weak synaptic stimulation. Thus, IGF-II may represent a novel target for cognitive enhancement therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2128508997,"The centriole, and the related basal body, is an ancient organelle characterized by a universal 9-fold radial symmetry and is critical for generating cilia, flagella, and centrosomes. The mechanisms directing centriole formation are incompletely understood and represent a fundamental open question in biology. Here, we demonstrate that the centriolar protein SAS-6 forms rod-shaped homodimers that interact through their N-terminal domains to form oligomers. We establish that such oligomerization is essential for centriole formation in C. elegans and human cells. We further generate a structural model of the related protein Bld12p from C. reinhardtii, in which nine homodimers assemble into a ring from which nine coiled-coil rods radiate outward. Moreover, we demonstrate that recombinant Bld12p self-assembles into structures akin to the central hub of the cartwheel, which serves as a scaffold for centriole formation. Overall, our findings establish a structural basis for the universal 9-fold symmetry of centrioles."

By using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy in concert with steered molecular dynamics simulations, we have observed transient sequence-specific excursions away from Watson-Crick base-pairing at CA and TA steps inside canonical duplex DNA towards low-populated and short-lived A•T and G•C Hoogsteen base pairs. The observation of Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA duplexes specifically bound to transcription factors and in damaged DNA sites implies that the DNA double helix intrinsically codes for excited state Hoogsteen base pairs as a means of expanding its structural complexity beyond that which can be achieved based on Watson-Crick base-pairing. The methods presented here provide a new route for characterizing transient low-populated nucleic acid structures, which we predict will be abundant in the genome and constitute a second transient layer of the genetic code."

https://openalex.org/W1603995462,"Searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded a large sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years (Myr) after the Big Bang (redshifts 6 > z > 3; ref. 1). The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8 galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10, 11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. Observations of z ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z > 9-10. Here we use the full two-year HUDF09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10 galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we show that, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is much smaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 Myr later at z ~ 8. This demonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased in both luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. The 100-200 Myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliest galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2076973648,"Loss of kidney function underlies many renal diseases. Mammals can partly repair their nephrons (the functional units of the kidney), but cannot form new ones. By contrast, fish add nephrons throughout their lifespan and regenerate nephrons de novo after injury, providing a model for understanding how mammalian renal regeneration may be therapeutically activated. Here we trace the source of new nephrons in the adult zebrafish to small cellular aggregates containing nephron progenitors. Transplantation of single aggregates comprising 10-30 cells is sufficient to engraft adults and generate multiple nephrons. Serial transplantation experiments to test self-renewal revealed that nephron progenitors are long-lived and possess significant replicative potential, consistent with stem-cell activity. Transplantation of mixed nephron progenitors tagged with either green or red fluorescent proteins yielded some mosaic nephrons, indicating that multiple nephron progenitors contribute to a single nephron. Consistent with this, live imaging of nephron formation in transparent larvae showed that nephrogenic aggregates form by the coalescence of multiple cells and then differentiate into nephrons. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the zebrafish kidney probably contains self-renewing nephron stem/progenitor cells. The identification of these cells paves the way to isolating or engineering the equivalent cells in mammals and developing novel renal regenerative therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2079229943,"The collective behaviour of a many-body system near a continuous phase transition is insensitive to the details of its microscopic physics; for example, thermodynamic observables follow generalized scaling laws near the phase transition. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in two-dimensional Bose gases presents a particularly interesting case because the marginal dimensionality and intrinsic scaling symmetry result in a broad fluctuation regime and an extended range of universal scaling behaviour. Studies of the BKT transition in cold atoms have stimulated great interest in recent years, but a clear demonstration of critical behaviour near the phase transition has remained elusive. Here we report in situ density and density-fluctuation measurements of two-dimensional Bose gases of caesium at different temperatures and interaction strengths, observing scale-invariant, universal behaviours. The extracted thermodynamic functions confirm the existence of a wide universal region near the BKT phase transition, and provide a sensitive test of the universality predicted by classical-field theory and quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our experimental results provide evidence for growing density-density correlations in the fluctuation region, and call for further explorations of universal phenomena in classical and quantum critical physics."
https://openalex.org/W1993963545,"Genetic imprinting — the preferential expression of a single parental allele — has typically been implicated as an influential factor during development, but whether unequal representation of one allele can influence social behaviour has not previously been studied. The adapter protein Grb10 is predominantly expressed from the maternal allele during embryogenesis. Here, Andrew Ward and colleagues demonstrate that Grb10 is predominantly expressed from the paternal allele in the brain from fetal life onwards, and that ablating this allelic bias induces modifications to social behaviour such as grooming. This is the first report of an imprinted gene for which tissue-specific actions of each parental allele can influence distinct physiological or behavioural processes. Genetic imprinting, or the preferential expression of a single parental allele, has typically been implicated as an influential factor during development, but whether unequal representation of one allele can influence social behaviour has not been studied. Here, it is demonstrated that the adaptor protein Grb10 is predominantly expressed from the paternal allele in brain and that ablating this allelic bias induces behavioural modifications of a social nature. At this time, Grb10 is unique in the sense that tissue-specific actions of each parental allele can influence distinct physiological or behavioural processes. Imprinted genes, defined by their preferential expression of a single parental allele, represent a subset of the mammalian genome and often have key roles in embryonic development1, but also postnatal functions including energy homeostasis2 and behaviour3,4. When the two parental alleles are unequally represented within a social group (when there is sex bias in dispersal and/or variance in reproductive success)5,6, imprinted genes may evolve to modulate social behaviour, although so far no such instance is known. Predominantly expressed from the maternal allele during embryogenesis, Grb10 encodes an intracellular adaptor protein that can interact with several receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signalling molecules7. Here we demonstrate that within the brain Grb10 is expressed from the paternal allele from fetal life into adulthood and that ablation of this expression engenders increased social dominance specifically among other aspects of social behaviour, a finding supported by the observed increase in allogrooming by paternal Grb10-deficient animals. Grb10 is, therefore, the first example of an imprinted gene that regulates social behaviour. It is also currently alone in exhibiting imprinted expression from each of the parental alleles in a tissue-specific manner, as loss of the peripherally expressed maternal allele leads to significant fetal and placental overgrowth. Thus Grb10 is, so far, a unique imprinted gene, able to influence distinct physiological processes, fetal growth and adult behaviour, owing to actions of the two parental alleles in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2031599833,"In the vertebrate retina, establishment of precise synaptic connections among distinct retinal neuron cell types is critical for processing visual information and for accurate visual perception. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine cells and bipolar cells establish stereotypic neurite arborization patterns to form functional neural circuits in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), a laminar region that is conventionally divided into five major parallel sublaminae. However, the molecular mechanisms governing distinct retinal subtype targeting to specific sublaminae within the IPL remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A signals through its receptor PlexinA4 (PlexA4) to control lamina-specific neuronal stratification in the mouse retina. Expression analyses demonstrate that Sema6A and PlexA4 proteins are expressed in a complementary fashion in the developing retina: Sema6A in most ON sublaminae and PlexA4 in OFF sublaminae of the IPL. Mice with null mutations in PlexA4 or Sema6A exhibit severe defects in stereotypic lamina-specific neurite arborization of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing dopaminergic amacrine cells, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) and calbindin-positive cells in the IPL. Sema6A and PlexA4 genetically interact in vivo for the regulation of dopaminergic amacrine cell laminar targeting. Therefore, neuronal targeting to subdivisions of the IPL in the mammalian retina is directed by repulsive transmembrane guidance cues present on neuronal processes."

https://openalex.org/W2012917547,"Polyubiquitin chains on substrates are assembled through any of seven lysine residues or the N terminus of ubiquitin (Ub), generating diverse linkages in the chain structure. PolyUb linkages regulate the fate of modified substrates, but their abundance and function in mammalian cells are not well studied. We present a mass spectrometry-based method to measure polyUb linkages directly from total lysate of mammalian cells. In HEK293 cells, the level of polyUb linkages was found to be 52% (Lys(48)), 38% (Lys(63)), 8% (Lys(29)), 2% (Lys(11)), and 0.5% or less for linear, Lys(6), Lys(27), and Lys(33) linkages. Tissue specificity of these linkages was examined in mice fully labeled by heavy stable isotopes (i.e. SILAC mice). Moreover, we profiled the Ub linkages in brain tissues from patients of Alzheimer disease with or without concurrent Lewy body disease as well as three cellular models of proteolytic stress: proteasome deficiency, lysosome deficiency, and heat shock. The data support that polyUb chains linked through Lys(6), Lys(11), Lys(27), Lys(29), and Lys(48) mediate proteasomal degradation, whereas Lys(63) chains are preferentially involved in the lysosomal pathway. Mixed linkages, including Lys(48), may also contribute to lysosomal targeting, as both Lys(63) and Lys(48) linkages are colocalized in LC3-labeled autophagosomes. Interestingly, heat shock treatment augments Lys(11), Lys(48), and Lys(63) but not Lys(29) linkages, and this unique pattern is similar to that in the profiled neurodegenerative cases. We conclude that different polyUb linkages play distinct roles under the three proteolytic stress conditions, and protein folding capacity in the heat shock responsive pathway might be more affected in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2010564453,"A major challenge in chromatin biology is to understand the mechanisms by which chromatin is remodeled into active or inactive states as required during development and cell differentiation. One complex implicated in these processes is the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which contains both histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling activities and has been implicated in the silencing of subsets of genes involved in various stages of cellular development. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a core component of the NuRD complex and contains a nucleosome remodeling ATPase domain along with two chromodomains and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers. We have previously demonstrated that the second PHD finger of CHD4 binds peptides corresponding to the N terminus of histone H3 methylated at Lys<sup>9</sup>. Here, we determine the solution structure of PHD2 in complex with H3K9me3, revealing the molecular basis of histone recognition, including a cation-π recognition mechanism for methylated Lys<sup>9</sup>. Additionally, we demonstrate that the first PHD finger also exhibits binding to the N terminus of H3, and we establish the histone-binding surface of this domain. This is the first instance where histone binding ability has been demonstrated for two separate PHD modules within the one protein. These findings suggest that CHD4 could bind to two H3 N-terminal tails on the same nucleosome or on two separate nucleosomes simultaneously, presenting exciting implications for the mechanism by which CHD4 and the NuRD complex could direct chromatin remodeling."

The danger associated with CA-MRSA stems from the combination of high virulence with antibiotic resistance. Although the basis of hypervirulence in CA-MRSA is currently unfolding more clearly (4Otto M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 64: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the molecular underpinnings of the fast and sustainable spread of CA-MRSA strains in the population are less well understood. Recent genome sequencing of a multitude of S. aureus genomes has revealed that many S. aureus strains, about half of those that have been sequenced, contain the complete genetic information required for the synthesis of an epidermin-like lantibiotic type bacteriocin (5Otto M. Götz F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified bacteriocins that comprise lanthionines, thioether-containing amino acids originating from the reaction of cystein sulfhydryl groups with dehydro amino acids formed by the dehydration of serine or threonine (6Bierbaum G. Sahl H.G. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2009; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Epidermin is a lantibiotic produced by a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (7Schnell N.

Zähner H. Kellner R. Jung G. Nature. 1988; 333: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Gallidermin is produced by Staphylococcus gallinarum and differs from epidermin in one amino acid position (9Schnell N. Entian K.D. Götz F. Hörner T. Kellner R. Jung G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 49: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Epidermin, gallidermin, and other lantibiotics often have considerable antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the producers are commonly protected by immunity systems such as specific lantibiotic exporters (10Otto M. Peschel A. Götz F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar, 11Peschel A. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Saris P.E. Immonen T. Reis M. Sahl H.G. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The presence of genetic information in many S. aureus genomes that is highly similar to that responsible for the biosynthesis of epidermin and gallidermin suggests that a similar lantibiotic is produced by those S. aureus strains. Earlier, we termed this hypothetical lantibiotic “aureodermin” (Adm), in analogy to the naming of S. epidermidis epidermin and S. gallinarum gallidermin (5Otto M. Götz F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but it has since frequently been called “Bsa” (for bacteriocin of S. aureus) or simply epidermin or gallidermin. Since their discovery in S. aureus genomes, it remained unclear whether the adm (bsa) genes code for a functional bacteriocin. By overexpressing the adm operon in an S. aureus laboratory strain, Daly et al. (13Daly K.M. Upton M. Sandiford S.K. Draper L.A. Wescombe P.A. Jack R.W. O'Connor P.M. Rossney A. Götz F. Hill C. Cotter P.D. Ross R.P. Tagg J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a functional lantibiotic is produced by the adm genes. The adm operon contains two structural genes, adm1 and adm2. However, only production of Adm2 (Bsa2) was observed. These authors also described that strains of the ST8 sequence type, which contain clinical strains such as S. aureus Newman, the MRSA strain USA500 and the epidemic U. S. CA-MRSA clone USA300, show antimicrobial activities. In HPLC/MS analyses, these activities correlated with the presence of peaks that indicated production of Adm2. On that basis, the authors suggested that bacterial interference by Adm2 contributes to increased colonization capacities of ST8 strains, in particular, the widespread CA-MRSA clone USA300, by a competitive ecological advantage. Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are a family of amphipathic, α-helical peptides found in S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and other staphylococci (14Donvito B. Etienne J. Denoroy L. Greenland T. Benito Y.

Vuong C. Otto M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 296: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which has been demonstrated for the β-type PSMs of S. epidermidis (21Wang R.

In addition, it has recently been shown that specific S. epidermidis PSMs, S. epidermidis PSMδ and δ-toxin (PSMγ), have antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pyogenes owing to their capacity to form pores in the bacterial cell membrane (22Cogen A.L. Yamasaki K. Sanchez K.M. Dorschner R.A. Lai Y. MacLeod D.T. Torpey J.W. Otto M. Nizet V. Kim J.E. Gallo R.L. J. Invest.

Finally, antimicrobial activities have been detected sporadically for other staphylococcal PSM-like peptides (23Beaudet R. Bisaillon J.G. Saheb S.A. Sylvestre M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whether S. aureus PSMs are antimicrobial and responsible for antimicrobial activities exhibited by some S. aureus strains is unknown. Importantly, PSMs are produced in high amounts in the USA300/USA500 lineage of the S. aureus clonal complex 8 (17Wang R. Braughton K.R. Kretschmer D. Bach T.H. Queck S.Y. Li M. Kennedy A.D.

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial activities of all known S. aureus PSM peptides. By construction and use of psm and adm deletion strains and purification of the antimicrobial activity of the USA300 strain, we demonstrate that PSM-derived peptides rather than the Adm2 lantibiotic are the source of that activity, suggesting a potential contribution of PSMs to the proposed competitive ecological advantage of CA-MRSA.

All PSM peptides used were N-formylated, unless otherwise noted. To produce multiple psm deletion mutants in S. aureus LAC, plasmid pKOR1psmα was constructed to delete the psmα operon without introduction of an antibiotic resistance cassette. To that end, two PCR products were amplified from chromosomal DNA of strain LAC using primers psmαatt1 and psmαrev1, and psmαatt2 and psmαrev2, respectively (Table 2). The two PCR products were cleaved using EcoRI and ligated, and the ligated product was cloned into plasmid pKOR1 (26Bae T. Schneewind O. Plasmid. 2006; 55: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) using the Invitrogen Clonase kit. Then, the resulting plasmid pKOR1psmα was transformed first into S. aureus RN4220 and finally S. aureus LAC hld and S. aureus LAC psmβ mutants (17Wang R. Braughton K.R. Kretschmer D. Bach T.H.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To that end, two PCR products flanking the adm operon were amplified from genomic DNA of strain USA300 (LAC) using primers admKOdownFor and admKOdownRev, and admKOupFor and admKOupRev, respectively (Table 2). The obtained PCR products were cloned up- and downstream of a spectinomycin resistance cassette that had previously been cloned in plasmid pBT2 via BamHI and SalI sites (29Kocianova S. Vuong C. Yao Y. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), using the restriction sites KpnI and BamHI, and SalI and HindIII, respectively. To facilitate plasmid excision after recombination, the secY antisense cassette from plasmid pKOR1 (26Bae T. Schneewind O. Plasmid. 2006; 55: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was amplified using primers secYtetFor and secYtetRev (Table 2), introducing EcoRV sites, and cloned into the EcoRV site of the pBT construct. The final construct was transformed into strain USA300 (LAC) via strain RN4220 and the allelic replacement procedure was performed as described (26Bae T. Schneewind O. Plasmid. 2006; 55: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in 50 ml TSB at 37 °C for 16 h, after which cultures were centrifuged and 30-ml aliquots of supernatants were collected and mixed with 10 ml of 1-butanol. Extraction was performed by shaking solutions in 37 °C for 2 h. After brief centrifugation, upper (butanol) phases were collected and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation. Dried samples were dissolved in 500 μl 8 m urea and used for further procedures. 100 μl of those samples were applied onto a μRPC C2/C18 ST 4.6/100 column (GE Healthcare) and run on an HPLC/MS system (1100 HPLC system connected to an MSD Trap SL mass spectrometer, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). An acetonitrile gradient from eluent A (0.1% TFA in water) to eluent B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) was applied as follows; 0% eluent B from 0 to 4 min, 0 to 50% eluent B linear gradient from 4 to 72 min, 50 to 100% eluent B linear gradient from 72 to 82 min, 100% eluent B from 82 to 90 min, 0% eluent B from 90 to 100 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and MS parameters were as published previously (17Wang R. Braughton K.R. Kretschmer D. Bach T.H. Queck S.Y. Li M. Kennedy A.D. Dorward D.W. Klebanoff S.J. Peschel A. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1510-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). For the purification of antimicrobial peptides, strain SF8300 (USA300) was grown in 1 liter of TSB at 37 °C overnight. The supernatant was collected, acidified to pH 6 with HCl, and applied onto an HR16/20 column packed with cation exchange SOURCE 30S material (GE Healthcare) using an AKTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare). Eluent A (20 mm H2PO4 in water:acetonitrile (7:3, v/v)) and eluent B (1 m NaCl, 20 mm H2PO4 in water:acetonitrile (7:3, v/v)) were used to elute samples with a flow rate of 5 ml/min and a linear gradient (eluent B, 0 to 100% in 80 min). After agar diffusion assays on Micrococcus luteus, fractions with antimicrobial activity were collected and concentrated by lyophilization. The concentrated fractions were injected onto a ZORBAX SB-C18 9.4 × 25 cm column (Agilent) and eluted with a flow rate of 4 ml/min and a linear gradient of 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile:water (0 to 100% in 80 min) with fractionation. Fractions were concentrated by lyophilization and applied to the agar diffusion assay. Active fractions were collected and applied to a SOURCE 5RPC ST 4.6/150 column (GE Healthcare). Samples were eluted using a 0.1% TFA acetonitrile:water gradient (0 to 20% in 2.5 min, 20 to 80% in 2.5 to 52.5 min, and 80 to 100% in 52.5 to 55 min) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were assayed for antimicrobial activity by the agar diffusion assay and analyzed by reversed phase (RP)-HPLC/electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS. To determine antimicrobial activities of LC fractions or culture filtrates, M. luteus was used as a test strain. 100 μl of an overnight culture of M. luteus was added to 500 ml of autoclaved agar solution (5 g of casein hydrolysate peptone; 2.5 g of yeast extract; 2.5 g of NaCl; 1.31 g of K2HPO4; and 7.5 g of agar). 20–60 μl of culture filtrate or LC samples were applied on paper disks and placed onto the agar plates after drying. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight and examined for halo production around paper disks representing antimicrobial activity. To determine antimicrobial activities against S. pyogenes, the same procedure was used, but bacteria were added to Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.2% yeast extract (THY). Overnight cultures of each strain grown in proper media (Staphylococcal strains in TSB, Streptococcus pyogenes in THY, M. luteus in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium) were inoculated into appropriate media (20% TSB, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaHCO3 for S. aureus LAC, RN4220 and S. epidermidis 1457 strains; TSB for S. epidermidis 12228; THY for S. pyogenes; LB for M. luteus) to achieve 2 × 107 cfu/ml and 90-μl aliquots were dispensed in microtiter plate wells. PSM stock solutions (640, 320, 160, 80, 40, 20, and 10 μm) were prepared by serial dilutions with PBS. 10 μl of PSM serial stock dilutions were added into each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cultures from the wells with no visible growth were spread on agar plates, and cfus were counted after overnight incubation at 37 °C. MBC was determined as the lowest concentration of PSM, at which >99% of inoculated cells were killed. To examine whether S. aureus strains produce the S. aureus lantibiotics Adm1 or Adm2, we investigated six strains representative of the major MRSA CC8 subclones (24Li M. Diep B.A. Villaruz A.E. Braughton K.R. Jiang X. DeLeo F.R. Chambers H.F. Lu Y. Otto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5883-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), all of which contain the adm system, and all S. aureus strains, whose genomes have been sequenced and contain the genetic information to produce the Adm lantibiotics. We extracted stationary growth phase culture filtrates with 1-butanol, a procedure known to enrich lantibiotics of the epidermin/gallidermin family (30Ottenwälder B. Kupke T. Brecht S. Gnau V. Metzger J. Jung G. Götz F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3894-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), determined antimicrobial activities on M. luteus agar plates (Fig. 1A) and applied the dried and redissolved butanol extracts to a μRPC C2/C18 ST 4.6/100 (GE Healthcare) reversed phase HPLC column. The column was run on an HPLC system coupled to an Ion Trap mass spectrometer with ESI. We analyzed the entire elution range (0–100% acetonitrile) for m/z values corresponding to those expected for Adm1 and Adm2. In the elution ion chromatograms of several strains, we detected peaks with m/z 1046.1 ((Adm2 + 2H+)/2) at elution times of ∼66 min (Fig. 1, B and C). The m/z 1046.1 peak was accompanied by the corresponding triple charged ion of m/z 698.2 ((Adm2 + 3H+)/3), indicative of a peptide with a calculated mass of 2090.1 Da (Fig. 1D). This mass is in very good agreement with the theoretical mass of Adm2 of 2091 Da and the experimental 2089.5 Da value determined by Daly et al. (13Daly K.M. Upton M. Sandiford S.K. Draper L.A. Wescombe P.A. Jack R.W. O'Connor P.M. Rossney A. Götz F. Hill C. Cotter P.D. Ross R.P. Tagg J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Of note, production of an antimicrobial substance as determined by the agar diffusion assay (Fig. 1A) correlated with presence of an m/z 1046.1 peak at ∼ 66 min. Additional, minor peaks of m/z 1046.1 found in some strains at other retention times were not accompanied by the corresponding triple-charged ion and are thus not related to a peptide with a mass of 2090 Da. Furthermore, we did not find ions related to the theoretical Adm1 peptide, in agreement with the observations by Daly et al. (13Daly K.M. Upton M. Sandiford S.K. Draper L.A. Wescombe P.A. Jack R.W. O'Connor P.M. Rossney A. Götz F. Hill C. Cotter P.D. Ross R.P. Tagg J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the antimicrobial activity corresponding to a peptide of ∼ 2090 Da eluting at ∼ 66 min represents the major antimicrobial activity in the S. aureus extracts and, at first, suggested that it is the Adm2 lantibiotic. As an alternative hypothesis, we examined whether the antimicrobial activity may be due to production of PSMs. To test whether PSMs may be involved in the antimicrobial activity of S. aureus strains, we tested 1-butanol extracts of S. aureus USA300 (LAC) wild-type and isogenic psm mutants on M. luteus and S. pyogenes test plates (Fig. 2A) and"

We demonstrate that the API2-MALT1 fusion oncoprotein created by the recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma induces proteolytic cleavage of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) at arginine 325. NIK cleavage requires the concerted actions of both fusion partners and generates a C-terminal NIK fragment that retains kinase activity and is resistant to proteasomal degradation. The resulting deregulated NIK activity is associated with constitutive noncanonical NF-κB signaling, enhanced B cell adhesion, and apoptosis resistance. Our study reveals the gain-of-function proteolytic activity of a fusion oncoprotein and highlights the importance of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in B lymphoproliferative disease."

https://openalex.org/W2073818639,"TRPM1 is the founding member of the melastatin subgroup of transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins, but it has not yet been firmly established that TRPM1 proteins form ion channels. Consequently, the biophysical and pharmacological properties of these proteins are largely unknown. Here we show that heterologous expression of TRPM1 proteins induces ionic conductances that can be activated by extracellular steroid application. However the current amplitudes observed were too small to enable a reliable biophysical characterization. We overcame this limitation by modifying TRPM1 channels in several independent ways that increased the similarity to the closely related TRPM3 channels. The resulting constructs produced considerably larger currents after overexpression. We also demonstrate that unmodified TRPM1 and TRPM3 proteins form functional heteromultimeric channels. With these approaches, we measured the divalent permeability profile and found that channels containing the pore of TRPM1 are inhibited by extracellular zinc ions at physiological concentrations, in contrast to channels containing only the pore of TRPM3. Applying these findings to pancreatic β cells, we found that TRPM1 proteins do not play a major role in steroid-activated currents of these cells. The inhibition of TRPM1 by zinc ions is primarily due to a short stretch of seven amino acids present only in the pore region of TRPM1 but not of TRPM3. Combined, our data demonstrate that TRPM1 proteins are bona fide ion-conducting plasma membrane channels. Their distinct biophysical properties allow a reliable identification of endogenous TRPM1-mediated currents. TRPM1 is the founding member of the melastatin subgroup of transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins, but it has not yet been firmly established that TRPM1 proteins form ion channels. Consequently, the biophysical and pharmacological properties of these proteins are largely unknown. Here we show that heterologous expression of TRPM1 proteins induces ionic conductances that can be activated by extracellular steroid application. However the current amplitudes observed were too small to enable a reliable biophysical characterization. We overcame this limitation by modifying TRPM1 channels in several independent ways that increased the similarity to the closely related TRPM3 channels. The resulting constructs produced considerably larger currents after overexpression. We also demonstrate that unmodified TRPM1 and TRPM3 proteins form functional heteromultimeric channels. With these approaches, we measured the divalent permeability profile and found that channels containing the pore of TRPM1 are inhibited by extracellular zinc ions at physiological concentrations, in contrast to channels containing only the pore of TRPM3. Applying these findings to pancreatic β cells, we found that TRPM1 proteins do not play a major role in steroid-activated currents of these cells. The inhibition of TRPM1 by zinc ions is primarily due to a short stretch of seven amino acids present only in the pore region of TRPM1 but not of TRPM3. Combined, our data demonstrate that TRPM1 proteins are bona fide ion-conducting plasma membrane channels. Their distinct biophysical properties allow a reliable identification of endogenous TRPM1-mediated currents. TRPM1 (Transient receptor potential melastatin 1) was identified in 1998 as a protein down-regulated in highly metastatic melanoma cells (1Duncan L.M. Deeds J. Hunter J. Shao J. Holmgren L.M. Woolf E.A. Tepper R.I. Shyjan A.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1515-1520PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, it has been established that the expression level of TRPM1 is a clinically useful prognostic marker after diagnosis of melanoma (2Duncan L.M. Deeds J. Cronin F.E. Donovan M. Sober A.J.

Pathol. 2009; 22: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In melanocytes, TRPM1 expression is necessary for the function of endogenous nonselective cation channels with constitutive activity, because experimentally down-regulating TRPM1 expression diminished these currents (5Oancea E. Vriens J. Brauchi S. Jun J. Splawski I. Clapham D.E. Science Signal. 2009; 2: ra21Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, TRPM1 has also been implicated in an entirely different disease, congenital stationary night blindness. Initially, it was found that TRPM1 mRNA levels are severely down-regulated in horses with this condition (6Bellone R.R. Brooks S.A. Sandmeyer L. Murphy B.A. Forsyth G. Archer S. Bailey E. Grahn B. Genetics. 2008; 179: 1861-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This has since been extended by showing that TRPM1-deficient mice also have severe visual impairments (7Morgans C.W. Zhang J. Jeffrey B.G. Nelson S.M. Burke N.S. Duvoisin R.M. Brown R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19174-19178Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Koike C. Obara T. Uriu Y.

In ON-bipolar cells, glutamate released from rod photoreceptor cells activates mGluR6 metabotropic glutamate receptors (16Nakajima Y. Iwakabe H. Akazawa C. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S.

TRPM1 proteins are necessary for this transduction pathway to work. In TRPM1-deficient mice, the constitutively active currents are not observed, and no response can be obtained from rod ON-bipolar cells with the appropriate glutamatergic stimulation (7Morgans C.W. Zhang J. Jeffrey B.G. Nelson S.M. Burke N.S. Duvoisin R.M. Brown R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19174-19178Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Koike C. Obara T. Uriu Y.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6088-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Based on these results and because of the vast amount of accumulated knowledge that shows that the majority of TRP proteins forms nonselective cation channels (23Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Nilius B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 685-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), it was suggested that TRPM1 proteins actually form the pore of the transduction channel in rod ON-bipolar cells. In agreement with this, Koike et al. (8Koike C. Obara T. Uriu Y. Numata T. Sanuki R. Miyata K. Koyasu T. Ueno S. Funabiki K. Tani A. Ueda H. Kondo M. Mori Y. Tachibana M. Furukawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of TRPM1 proteins in CHO cells induces a constitutively active conductance. Others have not found any evidence for spontaneous currents after heterologous overexpression of TRPM1 but found increased nonselective currents when overexpressing TRPM1 in melanocytes that, however, also express these proteins endogenously (5Oancea E. Vriens J. Brauchi S. Jun J. Splawski I. Clapham D.E. Science Signal. 2009; 2: ra21Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the currents observed after overexpression were very small and sometimes were only measured under highly artificial ionic conditions (8Koike C. Obara T. Uriu Y. Numata T. Sanuki R. Miyata K. Koyasu T. Ueno S. Funabiki K. Tani A. Ueda H. Kondo M. Mori Y. Tachibana M. Furukawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether overexpressed TRPM1 proteins do really form plasma membrane channels. An alternative explanation for the reported data is that overexpression of TRPM1 proteins might, in some cases, lead to the up-regulation of another, unrelated channel protein. Furthermore, in melanocytes and bipolar cells, it might be possible that TRPM1 does not participate in forming an ion-conducting pore, but that it is simply necessary for the function of the observed nonselective ionic conductances, for example by being a compulsory accessory subunit. To answer this important question, a detailed description of the functional characteristics, including the biophysical and pharmacological properties of heterologously expressed TRPM1 channels, would be desirable. However, because of the aforementioned difficulties in studying overexpressed TRPM1 channels, this information has so far not been forthcoming. In this study, we provide very strong evidence that TRPM1 proteins are capable of forming ion-conducting channels in the plasma membrane. By utilizing several strategies to increase the current amplitude through the pore of TRPM1, we were able to characterize this pore, revealing differences to the pore of the most closely related channel TRPM3 (24Oberwinkler J. Phillipp S.E. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2007; 179: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), especially with respect to the action of Zn2+ ions. HEK293 and a HEK293-derived cell line stably transfected with Myc-TRPM3α2-EYFP were cultured as described (25Oberwinkler J. Lis A. Giehl K.M. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22540-22548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We also followed the previously published procedures to isolate and culture mouse (C57BL/6N) pancreatic islet cells (26Wagner T.F. Loch S. Lambert S. Straub I. Mannebach S. Mathar I. Düfer M. Lis A. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. Oberwinkler J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We identified pancreatic β cells by their response to pregnenolone sulfate (26Wagner T.F. Loch S. Lambert S. Straub I. Mannebach S. Mathar I. Düfer M. Lis A. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. Oberwinkler J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). COS cells were cultured in the same conditions as HEK293 cells but using DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS as medium. Point mutations were generated in a similar way as described previously (27Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar) using circular, double-stranded plasmid DNA templates, appropriate primers, and the Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs). All of the mutants and chimeras were based on the N-terminally Myc-tagged cDNA of TRPM1Δ1066–1071 (accession number AJ867483) encoding 1622 amino acid residues (28Lis A. Wissenbach U. Philipp S.E. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To obtain TRPM1Δex11 (see Fig. 1B), two PmeI restriction sites were introduced into the TRPM1 cDNA, and a PmeI fragment (nucleotides 1319–1508) was replaced with the phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-TTG GCC CAC ACT GGC CGG T-3′ and 5′-ACC GGC CAG TGTG GGC CAA-3′, which were hybridized with each other, leading to a TRPM1 construct missing exactly exon 11 (Pro-446 to Trp-502). To delete the motif comprising seven amino acids from the TRPM1 pore (LYAMEIN motif; see Fig. 1A), single PmeI and SmaI restriction sites were introduced into the TRPM1 cDNA. The PmeI/SmaI fragment (nucleotides 3179–3225) was subsequently exchanged by the phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-TTG CAG ACC AGA TAG ACC CTC CTT GT-3′ and 5′-ACA AGG AGG GTC TAT CTG GTC TGC AA-3′ that were hybridized with each other. Similarly, the introduction of the LYAMEIN motif into the TRPM3 pore (variant α2; Ref. 25Oberwinkler J. Lis A. Giehl K.M. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22540-22548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; accession number AJ544535) was achieved by introducing single ClaI and SmaI restrictions sites into the TRPM3 cDNA and replacing a ClaI/SmaI fragment (nucleotides 3189–3217) by the phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-CGA TCT CTA TGC CAT GGA AAT CAA CCC TCC CTG TGG ACA GAA TGA GAC CC-3′ and 5′-GGG TCT CATT CTG TCC ACA GGG AGG GTT GAT TTC CAT GGC ATA GAG AT-3′, again hybridized before ligation. Chimeras of TRPM1 and TRPM3 were generated by introducing silent HpaI restriction sites (Fig. 1A), which were identified with the aid of the “silent” program included in the European Molecular Biology software suite (29Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6541) Google Scholar) and subsequent swapping of fragments. All of the modified constructs were verified by sequencing of both strands. For heterologous overexpression, the wild type and mutant cDNAs were introduced into the bicistronic vector pCAGGSM2-IRES-GFP (30Warnat J. Philipp S. Zimmer S. Flockerzi V. Cavalié A. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that carried an adapted multiple cloning site and had its HpaI restriction sites removed. For FRET measurements, DNA fragments encoding TRPM1 (AJ867482) and TRPM3 (AJ544532), each carrying a Myc epitope at their N terminus, were introduced into the SmaI sites of the vectors pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1. The resulting constructs allowed expression of the following fusion proteins: Myc-TRPM1-ECFP, Myc-TRPM1-EYFP, Myc-TRPM3-ECFP, and Myc-TRPM3-EYFP. We used the standard whole cell patch-clamp technique (31Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) and applied voltage ramps (from −115 to +85 mV) at a rate of ∼1/s from a holding potential of −15 mV on stably or transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) and had resistances of 2.5–5 mΩ in standard bath solution. Polyfect (Qiagen) was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer for transient transfections. When co-transfecting TRPM1 and TRPM3 for electrophysiological experiments, we used a plasmid ratio of 3:1 to reduce the formation of TRPM3 homomultimeric channels except where explicitly stated otherwise. Typically, 24 h after transfection, the cells were split and reseeded in culture dishes to reduce cell density. Single cells not in contact with neighboring cells were used 10–96 h after transfection. The composition of the intracellular (pipette) solution was 80–90 mm CsAsp, 45 mm CsCl, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm BAPTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH (adding ∼60 mm Cs+ to the solution), and the osmolality was adjusted to values within the range of 305–320 mosm. The standard bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. A pH of 7.2 was obtained with NaOH (2–5 mm). The liquid junction potential between the pipette solution and the standard bath solution (15 mV) was corrected for. Pregnenolone sulfate (from 50 mm stock in Me2SO) and ZnCl2 (0.001–1 mm) were added to yield the final concentrations as indicated. The solution containing 120 mm Ca2+ was composed of 120 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 16 mm d-glucose. Approximately 3 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine was used to adjust the pH to 7.2. The solutions containing 10 mm of a divalent cation was composed of 10 mm XCl2 (where X represents the divalent cation in question), 10 mm HEPES, and 265–290 mm d-glucose or mannitol. N-Methyl-d-glucamine (1–10 mm) was used to adjust the pH to 7.2 or to 7.0–7.1 in case of Zn2+ (to avoid precipitation). All of the extracellular solutions had an osmolality of 320–335 mosm, adjusted with d-glucose. Solution exchange was performed with a custom-build gravity-driven system with a small dead space. The data were analyzed offline by extracting the current amplitudes at +80 and −80 mV. Statistical tests were performed with Excel or GraphPad prism (version 3.0). For Ca2+ imaging, the cells were loaded for 30 min with 5 μm of the AM-ester of Fura-2 (Sigma). The procedures for measuring the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 340 nm and 380 nm were standard and described in detail previously (26Wagner T.F. Loch S. Lambert S. Straub I. Mannebach S. Mathar I. Düfer M. Lis A. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. Oberwinkler J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We used Student's t test, when appropriate with Bonferroni correction, or analysis of variance with Newman-Keul's post test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant and are denoted with a single asterisk (*). p < 0.01 is shown with two asterisks (**), and triple asterisks (***) indicate p < 0.001. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described (32Philipp S. Strauss B. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Mery L. Flockerzi V. Hoth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26629-26638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Four dishes (diameter, 3 cm) of HEK293 cells stably transfected with TRPM3 and grown to 70–80% confluence were each transfected with 3 μg of pCAGGS-IRES-GFP constructs encoding mouse TRPM1. The cells were washed twice 48 h after transfection with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Igepal (Sigma), 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm benzamidine, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenanthroline, and 0.9 μm iodacetamide), and homogenized at 4 °C by forcing through a 27-gauge cannula. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. As a measure for the amount of proteins introduced into immunoprecipitation (input), 180 of the solubilized proteins was directly denaturated by adding loading buffer (120 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerine, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol). 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) equilibrated three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were incubated with solubilized proteins for 2 h and centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g to remove proteins that interact nonspecifically with the Sepharose. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TRPM3 antibodies (25Oberwinkler J. Lis A. Giehl K.M. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22540-22548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or anti-TRPM1 antibodies (directed against the C terminus of TRPM1, accession numbers NP_001034193, residues 1602–1622) for 4 h at 4 °C under continuous shaking. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by incubation with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h, centrifuged, and washed four times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Complexes bound to protein G-Sepharose were dissolved by incubation in 50 μl of loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged briefly at 12,000 × g, and each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed as described (25Oberwinkler J. Lis A. Giehl K.M. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22540-22548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using anti-TRPM1- and anti-TRPM3 antibodies and corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. The labeled proteins were visualized using the Renaissance Western lightning chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer). Static FRET was measured as donor recovery during acceptor bleach. As donor we used eCFP 5The abbreviations used are: eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PS, pregnenolone sulfate; RI, rectification index. and as acceptor we used eYFP, each fused to the C terminus of the channel protein of interest. In co-transfections for FRET measurements, we transfected three times more DNA of the CFP-containing vector than of the YFP containing vector to minimize the fraction of multimeric channels containing only YFP and no CFP. Fluorescence of transfected live cells (in standard bath solution) was excited with light from a xenon light bulb that passed through a monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany), a dual pass excitation filter, and a dichroic mirror with two reflective wavelength ranges (both optical components from the “51017” CFP/YFP set, Chroma). We used a 40× (NA = 1.3) oil immersion objective on a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope. The recorded area was limited with the viewfinder device (TILL Photonics) to a rectangle that contained a single cell. The emitted light was split by a second dichroic mirror (50% at 505 nm) in two channels that were each equipped with a emission filter (470/30 nm and 535/30 nm). The light intensity was measured by two photodiodes (TILL Photonics), and the analog signals were digitized with an EPC 10 (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). The software Patchmaster controlled the monochromator, the shutter, and the data acquisition. The stimulus protocol consisted of repeated pairs of light flashes (50 ms) at 435 and 500 nm. After measuring 10 pairs (to determine the baseline), another 50 pairs of light flashes were applied, with the shutter opened for 5 s after each pair of light flashes to bleach the acceptor (enhanced YFP) with light of 480 nm. After finishing this protocol, the microscope stage was moved slightly to move the cell out of the field of view, and the background was measured for both excitation wavelengths. The data were analyzed with the aid of custom software written in Matlab. After background subtraction, the stability of the baseline recordings (first 10 measured values) was assessed, and only cells with good baseline stability were analyzed further. The FRET efficiency was calculated individually for each cell according to the formula given in Ref. 33Amiri H. Schultz G. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. To test whether TRPM1 proteins form functional ion channels, we overexpressed TRPM1 proteins in HEK293 cells and measured the membrane currents with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Under our standard recording conditions, we did not observe constitutively active conductances in transfected cells, in agreement with a previous report (5Oancea E. Vriens J. Brauchi S. Jun J. Splawski I. Clapham D.E. Science Signal. 2009; 2: ra21Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We recently described that pregnenolone sulfate (PS) strongly activates heterologously and endogenously expressed TRPM3 channels (26Wagner T.F. Loch S. Lambert S. Straub I. Mannebach S. Mathar I. Düfer M. Lis A. Flockerzi V. Philipp S.E. Oberwinkler J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Because TRPM3 is the closest relative to TRPM1 (34Lee N. Chen J. Sun L. Wu S. Gray K.R. Rich A. Huang M. Lin J.H. Feder J.N. Janovitz E.B. Levesque P.C. Blanar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we tested whether PS was also capable of activating TRPM1 proteins. Indeed, we observed a reversible increase in inward and outward current upon application of PS in cells transfected with TRPM1 but not in control cells (Fig. 2, A, G, and H). However, the observed current densities were very small and were only marginally larger when we applied an increased PS concentration (100 μm; Fig. 2G). Furthermore, the current amplitudes were variable across different transfections. We considered these current amplitudes too small for a meaningful biophysical analysis. Additionally, these very small amplitudes raise doubts regarding whether the observed currents indeed flow through pores formed by TRPM1 proteins, because it is conceivable that overexpressing TRPM1 proteins might lead to altered expression of other channel-forming proteins. We devised three independent experimental strategies to augment the current amplitudes through putative TRPM1 channels. First we reasoned that it may be possible, given the close sequence homology between TRPM1 and TRPM3 in the pore region (Fig. 1A), to transplant the pore region of TRPM1 into TRPM3 proteins and vice versa. We were surprised to find that both chimeric proteins constructed accordingly (M1-M3-M1 and M3-M1-M3; supplemental Fig. S1) reliably supported large PS-induced currents after overexpression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). This finding opened the possibility of studying the properties of the TRPM1 pore. However, the approach taken suffers from the drawback that the backbone of TRPM3 possibly influences the properties of the TRPM1 pore. However, the use of the construct M1-M3-M1 (TRPM3 pore inserted into TRPM1) as control allowed estimation of the impact of the pore transplantation on the biophysical properties of the already well characterized TRPM3 pore. In the second approach, we identified an exon (exon 11) that is present in all TRPM1 cDNA clones but has no corresponding homologous region neither in TRPM3 nor in any other TRPM channel (Fig. 1B). It encodes 57 amino acids in the N-terminal cytosolic region of TRPM1. Reasoning that the region encoded by exon 11 may reduce the current amplitude, we constructed TRPM1Δex11 that lacked exon 11 (Fig. 1B). When overexpressing TRPM1Δex11, we observed PS-induced current amplitudes that were on average 6.9 times larger than those obtained by overexpressing wild type TRPM1 (Fig. 2, B and H). The advantage of this approach, therefore, appears to be that the TRPM1 protein was much less altered compared with our first approach and not changed at all in the transmembrane region. The disadvantage of this approach was that the current amplitudes were still relatively small. In our final approach, we considered the propensity of TRP channels to form heteromultimers (35Schaefer M. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 451: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that has also been observed in TRPM6 and TRPM7 (36Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C.

We therefore co-expressed TRPM1 and TRPM3 with a cDNA ratio of 3:1, to avoid the formation of significant amounts of TRPM3 homomultimeric channels. In cells co-expressing TRPM1 and TRPM3, we recorded large PS-induced currents that had conspicuously larger inward currents than those obtained from cells expressing TRPM3 alone (Fig. 2, E and F). Indeed, quantitative inspection of the rectification properties of the I/V curves from all constructs revealed that channels with the pore region of TRPM1 had significantly larger relative inward c"

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a capsulated gram-negative pathogen. It is an important cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. Evidence indicates that K. pneumoniae infections are characterized by a lack of an early inflammatory response. Data from our laboratory indicate that K. pneumoniae CPS helps to suppress the host inflammatory response. However, it is unknown whether K. pneumoniae employs additional factors to modulate host inflammatory responses. Here, we report that K. pneumoniae OmpA is important for immune evasion in vitro and in vivo. Infection of A549 and normal human bronchial cells with 52OmpA2, an ompA mutant, increased the levels of IL-8. 52145-Δwca(K2)ompA, which does not express CPS and ompA, induced the highest levels of IL-8. Both mutants could be complemented. In vivo, 52OmpA2 induced higher levels of tnfα, kc, and il6 than the wild type. ompA mutants activated NF-κB, and the phosphorylation of p38, p44/42, and JNK MAPKs and IL-8 induction was via NF-κB-dependent and p38- and p44/42-dependent pathways. 52OmpA2 engaged TLR2 and -4 to activate NF-κB, whereas 52145-Δwca(K2)ompA activated not only TLR2 and TLR4 but also NOD1. Finally, we demonstrate that the ompA mutant is attenuated in the pneumonia mouse model. The results of this study indicate that K. pneumoniae OmpA contributes to attenuate airway cell responses. This may facilitate pathogen survival in the hostile environment of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2003888853,"All mammals have 50-100 μM mannose in their blood. However, the source of the dynamic pool of mannose in blood is unknown. Most of it is thought to be derived from glucose in the cells. We studied mannose uptake and release by various cell types. Interestingly, our results show that mannose taken up by the cells through transporters is handled differently from the mannose released within the cells due to glycan processing of protein-bound oligosaccharides. Although more than 95% of incoming mannose is catabolized, most of the mannose released by intracellular processing is expelled from the cells as free mannose predominantly via a nocodazole-sensitive sugar transporter. Under physiological conditions, incoming mannose is more accessible to hexokinase, whereas mannose released within the cells is protected from HK and therefore has a different fate. Our data also suggest that generation of free mannose due to the processing of glycoconjugates composed of glucose-derived mannose and its efflux from the cells can account for most of the mannose found in blood and its steady state maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2154642413,"Chondrosarcoma is a type of highly malignant tumor with a potent capacity to invade locally and cause distant metastasis. Chondrosarcoma shows a predilection for metastasis to the lungs. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that is associated with the disease status and outcomes of cancers. However, the effect of IL-6 on the migration activity of human chondrosarcoma cells is mostly unknown. Here, we found that IL-6 increased the migration and expression of MMP-13 in human chondrosarcoma cells. We also found that human chondrosarcoma tissues had significant expression of IL-6, which was higher than that in normal cartilage. IL-6-mediated migration and MMP-13 up-regulation were attenuated by anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, Ras, Raf-1, and a MEK inhibitor. Activation of the Ras, Raf-1, MEK, ERK, and NF-κB signaling pathways after IL-6 treatment was demonstrated, and IL-6-induced MMP-13 expression and migration activity were inhibited by the specific inhibitor and mutant Ras, Raf-1, MEK, ERK, and NF-κB cascades. In addition, migration-prone sublines demonstrated that cells with increasing migration ability had greater expression of IL-6 and MMP-13. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-6 and IL-6 receptor interaction enhances migration of chondrosarcoma through an increase in MMP-13 production."
https://openalex.org/W2072887422,"The effect of environmental change on ecosystems is mediated by species interactions. Environmental change may remove or add species and shift life-history events, altering which species interact at a given time. However, environmental change may also reconfigure multispecies interactions when both species composition and phenology remain intact. In a Caribbean island system, a major manifestation of environmental change is seaweed deposition, which has been linked to eutrophication, overfishing, and hurricanes. Here, we show in a whole-island field experiment that without seaweed two predators--lizards and ants--had a substantially greater-than-additive effect on herbivory. When seaweed was added to mimic deposition by hurricanes, no interactive predator effect occurred. Thus environmental change can substantially restructure food-web interactions, complicating efforts to predict anthropogenic changes in ecosystem processes."

We have recently obtained EM projection images of lipid-bound Pgp without nucleotide and transport substrate that showed the two halves of the transporter separated by a central cavity (Lee, J.

Two other cysteine pairs (K615C/S1276C and A627C/K1260C) also formed a disulfide but to a lesser extent, and the cross-linked form of these two mutants had lower drug-stimulated ATPase activity.

In bacteria, ABC transporters can function in the import of nutrients or export of toxic molecules, whereas in eukaryotes, transport occurs exclusively in the direction of export (1Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 2Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The 48 ABC transporters encoded by the human genome are responsible for the transport of structurally diverse compounds such as bile acids, carbohydrates, nucleosides, sterols, peptides, inorganic ions, and environmental toxins (3Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important member of the mammalian ABC transporter family is P-glycoprotein, a glycosylated 170-kDa plasma membrane protein that is involved in the export of a large variety of structurally unrelated organic molecules (4Gottesman M.M. Ling V. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1, and MDR1) is expressed in tissues that function in detoxification such as the liver, placenta, and blood-brain barrier. In certain cancers, a high level expression of Pgp (along with other ABC transporters such as ABCG2 and MRP1) in the plasma membrane can result in the failure of chemotherapy by preventing the mostly hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs from accumulating in the cell thus lowering drug efficacy (5Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4485) Google Scholar, 6Sharom F.J. Pharmacogenomics. 2008; 9: 105-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar).Most eukaryotic ABC transporters, including Pgp, are expressed as single polypeptides organized in four domains, two transmembrane domains (TMDs) composed of six α-helices each and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). In Pgp, the four domains are arranged in the order N-TMD1-NBD1-TMD2-NBD2-C with a ∼60-amino acid-long linker connecting the C-terminal end of NBD1 with the N terminus of TMD2 (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). To carry out productive MgATP hydrolysis coupled to drug transport, the two NBDs have to interact in a head-to-tail fashion, thereby sequestering the nucleotide(s) at the NBD1-NBD2 interface. In this so-called “sandwich” configuration, the nucleotide is interacting with the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of one NBD and the ABC signature motif (LSGGQ) of the other NBD and vice versa (8Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of transport substrate occurs in an amphipathic cavity that is formed by the two TMDs toward the cytoplasmic side of the transporter (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The drug-binding cavity can accommodate a large variety of structurally unrelated molecules and exhibits distinct (but overlapping) binding regions for different subsets of compounds.Despite ongoing effort, the mechanism by which drug transport from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane is coupled to the hydrolysis of one or two molecules of ATP is still not fully understood. Several models have been proposed based on a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical and biophysical experiments involving transport assays, trapping of catalytic intermediates using inorganic vanadate (Vi) or fluoroaluminate with spin-labeled ATP, and photo affinity labeling with 8-azido nucleotide analogues (9Urbatsch I.L.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14010-14119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the two NBDs act in a cooperative manner in that by mutating of a catalytically essential residue in only one of the two NBDs resulted in nearly complete loss of drug stimulated ATPase activity. However, other aspects of the mechanism such as the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed for each transport event and whether the NBDs must completely dissociate to enable nucleotide and/or drug binding remain controversial.Here, we have addressed the question as to whether the two NBDs of Pgp have to come apart for binding of bulky drug molecules as postulated based on the recent x-ray crystal structure of Pgp (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The introduction of two cysteine residues near the C-terminal ends of the N- and C-terminal NBDs of mouse Pgp lead to spontaneous formation of a disulfide bond. The cross-linked Pgp displayed limited impairment of drug-stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity, indicating that the C-terminal ends of the NBDs can remain in close proximity to one another during the catalytic cycle.DISCUSSIONOver the past decade, x-ray crystal structures of several full-length ABC transporters that were crystallized under different substrate conditions have been solved. The structures revealed that ABC transporters can adopt so called out- and inward facing conformations in which the NBDs are either found to interact intimately in a head-to-tail fashion (nucleotide-bound MalFGK2 (22Oldham M.L.

Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) and MsbA (21Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar)) or to be more open (nucleotide-free MsbA (21Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), MalFGK2 (27Khare D. Oldham M.L. Orelle C. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Molecular Cell. 2009; 33: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and ModBC (23Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar)). In two of the structures, both from importers, the interaction of the NBDs is maintained by a closely interacting C-terminal α helix, as in case of ModBC, or an extra domain, as in case of MalFGK2. Disulfide cross-linking the extra domains in MalK had no effect on ATPase and maltose transport activity, indicating that at least for this bacterial importer, the NBDs can stay together during the catalytic cycle (28Samanta S. Ayvaz T. Reyes M. Shuman H.A. Chen J. Davidson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35265-35271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the bacterial exporters Sav1866 and MsbA as well as mammalian Pgp seem to lack a structural element that could hold the NBDs together near their C-terminal ends in the absence of nucleotide, and it is possible that the lack of such feature may be in part responsible for the wide open conformation observed in the crystal structure of E. coli MsbA (21Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar).Of course, it should be noted not only that the crystal structures represent static images of highly dynamic transporters but also that the apo forms themselves may not represent physiologically relevant conformations given cytoplasmic MgATP concentrations. The question therefore arises as to how much the two NBDs can or must move in relation to each other during the catalytic cycle.In the crystal structure of nucleotide free Pgp, a 20 Å separation is seen between the two NBDs for both the “apo” and drug-bound transporter (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). However, because larger drug molecules did not appear to bind to Pgp that was crystallized in the absence of drug, the authors of the study speculated that an even greater separation of the NBDs (as seen in apo-MsbA from E. coli (21Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar)) may be required for binding of bulky transport substrates (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence in support of such a mechanism had been reported from cross-linking experiments that involved disulfide bond formation between cysteines in the P-loop and/or ABC signature motifs (18Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Loo T.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In one study, it was shown that one of the naturally occurring cysteines in the P-loops (of e.g. NBD1) and a cysteine introduced into the adjacent ABC signature motif (NBD2) could form a disulfide bond (19Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and that binding of large transport substrates, such as cyclosporin A, slowed down disulfide formation (20Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). On the other hand, disulfide bond formation was also observed between the cysteines in both P-loops (18Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and taken together, these cross-link experiments not only suggested that the NBDs of Pgp have to come apart to bind bulky substrates, but also that the NBDs have to be quite flexible as the two P-loops in crystal structures of the nucleotide bound NBD sandwich are ∼30 Å apart (e.g. ADP-bound Sav1866 or AMPPNP-bound MsbA). However, as the cysteines involved in these cross-link experiments were part of the catalytic sites and therefore likely affected nucleotide binding, the inhibitory effect of the cross-links on ATPase activities were difficult to interpret in terms of the question as to how much NBD motion is required for catalysis.The only structural information for nucleotide-bound Pgp comes from EM of two-dimensional crystals. EM projection images of two-dimensional crystals of lipid bilayer reconstituted mouse and human Pgp showed the two halves of the transporter in close proximity with a central stain-filled cavity (29Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), much like the cavity seen in the crystal structure (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). When adding nucleotides in presence or absence of transport substrate to the lipid bilayer bound two-dimensional crystals of Pgp, the two halves of the transporter appeared to get closer together, closing the central cavity seen in the apo images (29Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol.

Substrate-dependent structural changes were also observed in images of two-dimensional crystals of detergent solubilized hamster Pgp (31Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and taken together, the EM data suggest that substrate binding to apo-Pgp involves notable motion of the NBDs, consistent with the earlier disulfide cross-linking studies (18Urbatsch I.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).However, contrary to a mechanism involving complete dissociation of the NBDs, there is biochemical evidence that suggests that the NBDs remain closely associated during steady state turnover, with release of ADP and phosphate and subsequent binding of MgATP at one catalytic site while the second site has nucleotide occluded (tightly bound) (11Sauna Z.E. Kim I.W. Nandigama K. Kopp S. Chiba P. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13787-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Siarheyeva A. Liu R. Sharom F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7575-7586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A more or less tight association of the NBDs during steady state turnover is also more easily rationalized in terms of the observed cooperativity of the two active sites of Pgp (32Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).Alternatively, if the NBDs do not remain in close contact as seen in the apo crystal structures of ModBC, MsbA and Pgp, then it is possible that the NBDs rapidly sample different conformations until MgATP binding to both NBDs results in the closed sandwich configuration followed by hydrolysis of one or both ATP molecules, product release and NBD dissociation. Interestingly, Loo et al. (33Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 395: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have recently shown that cross-linking of the TMDs at the cytoplasmic side results in a 3-fold increase of basal ATPase activity without affecting drug-stimulated ATPase to a significant degree. It is possible that restricting the motion of the NBDs near their N-terminal ends results in a greater probability of generating the ATP-bound sandwich configuration, which in turn may explain the increase in basal activity (33Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Interestingly, cross-linked AS retained significant drug stimulated ATPase activity for most of the drugs tested, including verapamil, paclitaxel, and the largest molecule assayed, cyclosporin A. This suggests that binding of these drugs does not require an opening of the NBDs beyond what is seen in the crystal structure of the apo- and drug-bound transporter (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). However, for two of the drugs tested, vinblastine and colchicine, little to no activation was observed, and it cannot be ruled out that binding and/or ATPase activation of some drug molecules requires a motion (e.g. twisting) of the TMDs and/or NBDs that may be restricted in the cross-linked enzyme.Cysteine pairs KS and AK, even though at greater distance based on the crystal structure compared with AS, are still able to cross-link with 60–80% efficiency, consistent with highly dynamic NBDs as mentioned above. On the other hand, basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activity as well as the ability to efficiently trap vanadate are significantly impaired in cross-linked mutants KS and AK compared with AS, suggesting that the cross-link in these two mutants locks the two NBDs in a configuration that is unfavorable for NBD cooperativity and maximum turnover.Taken together, our findings support recent models in which the NBDs remain in close association during steady state turnover due to occluded nucleotide at one catalytic site. In addition, the data suggest that the conformation of Pgp as seen in the crystal structure is competent for productive binding of some drugs, including large molecules such as cyclosporin A. Other transport substrates such as colchicine and vinblastine may require a conformation different from the one seen in the crystal structure but it appears that the size of the transport substrate alone may not be the sole determining factor in this process. IntroductionATP binding cassette (ABC) 2The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; Pgp, P-glycoprotein; DM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; fwd, forward; rev, reverse; KS, K615C/S1276C; AK, A627C/K1260C; AS, A627C/S1276C; TMD, transmembrane domain; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; CL, cysteine-less. transporters constitute a superfamily of membrane proteins that couple the hydrolysis of MgATP to substrate translocation across a lipid bilayer. In bacteria, ABC transporters can function in the import of nutrients or export of toxic molecules, whereas in eukaryotes, transport occurs exclusively in the direction of export (1Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 2Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The 48 ABC transporters encoded by the human genome are responsible for the transport of structurally diverse compounds such as bile acids, carbohydrates, nucleosides, sterols, peptides, inorganic ions, and environmental toxins (3Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important member of the mammalian ABC transporter family is P-glycoprotein, a glycosylated 170-kDa plasma membrane protein that is involved in the export of a large variety of structurally unrelated organic molecules (4Gottesman M.M. Ling V. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1, and MDR1) is expressed in tissues that function in detoxification such as the liver, placenta, and blood-brain barrier. In certain cancers, a high level expression of Pgp (along with other ABC transporters such as ABCG2 and MRP1) in the plasma membrane can result in the failure of chemotherapy by preventing the mostly hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs from accumulating in the cell thus lowering drug efficacy (5Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4485) Google Scholar, 6Sharom F.J. Pharmacogenomics. 2008; 9: 105-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar).Most eukaryotic ABC transporters, including Pgp, are expressed as single polypeptides organized in four domains, two transmembrane domains (TMDs) composed of six α-helices each and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). In Pgp, the four domains are arranged in the order N-TMD1-NBD1-TMD2-NBD2-C with a ∼60-amino acid-long linker connecting the C-terminal end of NBD1 with the N terminus of TMD2 (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). To carry out productive MgATP hydrolysis coupled to drug transport, the two NBDs have to interact in a head-to-tail fashion, thereby sequestering the nucleotide(s) at the NBD1-NBD2 interface. In this so-called “sandwich” configuration, the nucleotide is interacting with the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of one NBD and the ABC signature motif (LSGGQ) of the other NBD and vice versa (8Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of transport substrate occurs in an amphipathic cavity that is formed by the two TMDs toward the cytoplasmic side of the transporter (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The drug-binding cavity can accommodate a large variety of structurally unrelated molecules and exhibits distinct (but overlapping) binding regions for different subsets of compounds.Despite ongoing effort, the mechanism by which drug transport from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane is coupled to the hydrolysis of one or two molecules of ATP is still not fully understood. Several models have been proposed based on a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical and biophysical experiments involving transport assays, trapping of catalytic intermediates using inorganic vanadate (Vi) or fluoroaluminate with spin-labeled ATP, and photo affinity labeling with 8-azido nucleotide analogues (9Urbatsch I.L.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14010-14119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the two NBDs act in a cooperative manner in that by mutating of a catalytically essential residue in only one of the two NBDs resulted in nearly complete loss of drug stimulated ATPase activity. However, other aspects of the mechanism such as the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed for each transport event and whether the NBDs must completely dissociate to enable nucleotide and/or drug binding remain controversial.Here, we have addressed the question as to whether the two NBDs of Pgp have to come apart for binding of bulky drug molecules as postulated based on the recent x-ray crystal structure of Pgp (7Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). The introduction of two cysteine residues near the C-terminal ends of the N- and C-terminal NBDs of mouse Pgp lead to spontaneous formation of a disulfide bond. The cross-linked Pgp displayed limited impairment of drug-stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity, indicating that the C-terminal ends of the NBDs can remain in close proximity to one another during the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1996088977,"Pancreatic β-cell-restricted expression of insulin is established through several critical cis-regulatory elements located in the insulin gene promoter region. The principal cis elements are A-boxes, E1, and C1/RIPE3b. The β-cell-enriched transcription factors Pdx1 and Beta2 bind to the A-boxes and E1 element, respectively. A β-cell-specific trans-acting factor binding to C1/RIPE3b (termed RIPE3b1 activator) was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and has been identified as MafA, a member of the Maf family of basic leucine zipper (bZip) proteins. Here, ATF2, a member of the ATF/CREB family of basic leucine zipper proteins, was identified as a component of the RIPE3b1 activator. ATF2 alone was unable to bind to the C1/RIPE3b element but acquired binding capacity upon complex formation with MafA. ATF2 also interacted with Pdx1 and Beta2, and co-expression of ATF2, MafA, Pdx1, and Beta2 resulted in a synergistic activation of the insulin promoter. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse pancreas tissue sections showed that ATF2 is enriched in islet endocrine cells, including β-cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of MafA or ATF2 in the MIN6 β-cell line resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous levels of insulin mRNA. These data indicate that ATF2 is an essential component of the positive regulators of the insulin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2059433050,"Hsp90 populates distinct open and closed conformations mediated by transient N-terminal dimerization. To investigate the mechanistic role of these large conformational changes, we designed Hsp90 with an N-terminal coiled-coil to clamp the termini together and enforce N-domain proximity. Biophysical analyses demonstrate that the coiled-coil effectively maintains N-domain proximity in the absence of ATP, a condition that favors the open state of Hsp90. Enforcing N-domain proximity results in increased ATPase activity, indicating that N-terminal dimerization is a rate-limiting step that is sped-up with the coiled-coil due to increased effective N-domain concentration. The relative difference in ATPase activity between coil-Hsp90 and wt was reduced in the presence of both an ATPase activating (Aha1) and an inhibiting (Sba1) co-chaperone. As both of these co-chaperones bind preferentially to N-terminally dimerized Hsp90, the buffering effect of these co-chaperones demonstrates the biochemical relevance of Hsp90 conformational properties in addition to N-terminal dimerization. Enforcing N-domain proximity is compatible with viability in yeast, underlining the mechanistic relevance of Hsp90 conformational changes that are less dramatic than the transition between fully open and closed."
https://openalex.org/W2039811720,"The Drosophila protein Sex Comb on Midleg (Scm) is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG), a set of transcriptional repressors that maintain silencing of homeotic genes during development. Recent findings have identified PcG proteins both as targets for modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein and as catalytic components of the SUMO conjugation pathway. We have found that the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 binds to Scm and that this interaction, which requires the Scm C-terminal sterile α motif (SAM) domain, is crucial for the efficient sumoylation of Scm. Scm is associated with the major Polycomb response element (PRE) of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), and efficient PRE recruitment requires an intact Scm SAM domain. Global reduction of sumoylation augments binding of Scm to the PRE. This is likely to be a direct effect of Scm sumoylation because mutations in the SUMO acceptor sites in Scm enhance its recruitment to the PRE, whereas translational fusion of SUMO to the Scm N terminus interferes with this recruitment. In the metathorax, Ubx expression promotes haltere formation and suppresses wing development. When SUMO levels are reduced, we observe decreased expression of Ubx and partial haltere-to-wing transformation phenotypes. These observations suggest that SUMO negatively regulates Scm function by impeding its recruitment to the Ubx major PRE."
https://openalex.org/W1965238242,"To generate and maintain epithelial cell polarity, specific sorting of proteins into vesicles destined for the apical and basolateral domain is required. Syntaxin 3 and 4 are apical and basolateral SNARE proteins important for the specificity of vesicle fusion at the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains, respectively, but how these proteins are specifically targeted to these domains themselves is unclear. Munc18/SM proteins are potential regulators of this process. Like syntaxins, they are crucial for exocytosis and vesicle fusion. However, how munc18c and syntaxin 4 regulate the function of each other is unclear. Here, we investigated the requirement of syntaxin 4 in the delivery of basolateral membrane and secretory proteins, the basolateral targeting of syntaxin 4, and the role of munc18c in this targeting. Depletion of syntaxin 4 resulted in significant reduction of basolateral targeting, suggesting no compensation by other syntaxin forms. Mutational analysis identified amino acids Leu-25 and to a lesser extent Val-26 as essential for correct localization of syntaxin 4. Recently, it was shown that the N-terminal peptide of syntaxin 4 is involved in binding to munc18c. A mutation in this region that affects munc18c binding shows that munc18c binding is required for stabilization of syntaxin 4 at the plasma membrane but not for its correct targeting. We conclude that the N terminus serves two functions in membrane targeting. First, it harbors the sorting motif, which targets syntaxin 4 basolaterally in a munc18c-independent manner and second, it allows for munc18c binding, which stabilizes the protein in a munc18c-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1985472467,"Myosin VI is unique in its directionality among myosin superfamily members and also displays a slow and strain-dependent rate of ATP binding that allows for gating between its heads. In this study we demonstrate that leucine 310 is positioned by a class VI-specific insert, insert-1, so as to account for the selective hindrance of ATP versus ADP binding. Mutation of leucine 310 to glycine removes all influence of insert-1 on ATP binding. Furthermore, by analyzing myosin VI structures with either leucine 310 substituted to a glycine or complete removal of insert-1, we conclude that nucleotides may initially bind to myosin by their purine rings before docking their phosphate moieties. Otherwise, insert-1 could not exert a differential influence on ATP versus ADP binding.

Otherwise, insert-1 could not exert a differential influence on ATP versus ADP binding. Myosin VI is the only myosin superfamily member that has been shown to traffic toward the minus (pointed) end of actin filaments (1Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This unique directionality is made possible due to a myosin VI class-specific structural element that is known as insert-2 and enables myosin VI to perform unique cellular functions (2Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This insert wraps around the myosin VI converter and binds a calmodulin via an unusual calmodulin binding motif (3Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A.

As in the case of the plus-end directed processive dimer of myosin Va (8Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism of how this is accomplished differs between myosin V and VI, necessitated by their opposite directionalities. In the case of myosin V, intramolecular strain greatly decreases the rate of dissociation of MgADP from the lead head (8Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas in the case of myosin VI, ADP dissociation is unaffected, but ATP binding is greatly slowed on the lead head, preventing its detachment (12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Based on the structure of myosin VI (3Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), it appeared that another myosin VI class-specific insert, insert-1, is responsible for impeding ATP binding. Indeed, even in the absence of strain, binding of ATP to monomeric myosin VI is at least an order of magnitude slower than binding to myosin V (3Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and removal of the 26-residue insert increased the rate of ATP binding (3Ménétrey J.

The mechanism of how this is achieved was not entirely clear, although we postulated that insert-1 positioned the side chain of leucine 310 physically in the way so that it impeded ATP but not ADP entry into the pocket. In this study we examine if positioning of leucine 310 does indeed provide steric hindrance for ATP binding and is in fact the mechanism by which myosin VI gating is achieved. Although we have examined the effects of insert-1 on nucleotide binding to myosin VI in the presence of actin, we had not previously examined the impact of insert-1 in the absence of actin. We do so in this study to enable interpretation of myosin VI structures with and without either insert-1 or mutation of leucine 310 to glycine. A series of truncations of porcine myosin VI cDNA were generated. C-terminal truncations were made corresponding to amino acids 816 (wild type MDins2, Δ-insert-1 MDins2 (in which residues Cys-278 to Ala-303 have been deleted), and L310G mutant of MDins2) and 839 (S1). Each of these had a FLAG tag (encoding DYKDDDDK) appended via a glycine to either the N terminus (MDins2) or the C terminus (S1) to facilitate purification. As previously described (13De La Cruz E.M.

The crystals were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution complemented with 20% of ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of myosin VI Δ-insert-1 MDins2 were grown using reservoir solution (containing 10.8% PEG 8000, 50 mm MES, pH 6.75, 175 mm ammonium sulfate, 3% isopropyl alcohol, 3% tert-butyl alcohol, and 4 mm EGTA) and a stock solution of Δ-insert-1 myosin VI at 18 mg/ml. The protein/precipitant drops were microseeded the next day by streak-seeding from previous crystallizations, and crystals appeared overnight. The crystals were cryo-protected by soaking in 15% PEG 8000, 50 mm MES, pH 6.75, 175 mm ammonium sulfate, 4 mm EGTA, and 30% glycerol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Soleil synchrotron radiation source, Beamline Proxima 1, or the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline ID-29. The data were processed using the XDS program suite (18Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar, 19Diederichs K. McSweeney S. Ravelli R.B.G.

The structural basis for this hypothesis comes from the nucleotide-free structure of the wild type myosin VI MDins2 fragment truncated at residue 816 (PDB code 2BKH) (3Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, leucine 310 can be seen to protrude into the nucleotide binding pocket of myosin VI as a result of the insertion of insert-1. To ascertain the impact of substitution of Leu-310 to glycine or the complete removal of insert-1 on the conformation of the rigor state of myosin VI (state in which ATP must enter to dissociate myosin from actin), we solved two new structures in the rigor-like state, one with insert-1 deleted and the other with leucine 310 substituted to glycine. Note, as shown in Fig. 2B, wherein the structure of the motor domain with insert-1 deleted is depicted, this leucine is not in fact a part of insert-1 but is repositioned by the presence of insert-1. For the L310G mutation, the structure of the myosin VI motor (Fig. 2C) reveals that insert-1 is in the identical conformation as in the wild type motor. The only difference is that there is no longer a leucine side chain protruding into the nucleotide pocket. Comparisons of the structures of myosin VI with that of other myosins such as myosin V show that the presence of insert-1 does not influence the conformation of any of the elements of the upper 50 kDa (U50) subdomain. In the Δ-insert-1 structure (residues Cys-278 to Ala-303 deleted), removal of the insert also has no consequence in the conformation of the rest of the U50 subdomain, although several interactions that this insert makes with the rest of the subdomain are lost in the mutant (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the interactions that the beginning of the loop in which insert-1 is found makes with an important linker of the U50 subdomain (residues Leu-229—Asn-244) are lost in the Δ-insert-1 structure, suggesting that the dynamics of the linker may differ in this mutant compared with either wild type myosin VI or the L310G mutant (Fig. 3). This U50 linker may influence the rearrangements of the so-called transducer region (22Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) upon nucleotide binding and dissociation. It is connected to the last strand of the seven-stranded central β-sheet of the molecule, which undergoes twisting upon nucleotide binding and dissociation (see Fig. 3 and “Discussion”). As shown in Fig. 4A, substitution of leucine 310 with a glycine resulted in increased actin-activated ATPase activity for the dimeric HMM construct (zippered double-headed molecule truncated at arginine 994 (12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). As also shown in Fig. 4, the single-headed S1 construct had a slight increase in steady state activity when leucine 310 was mutated to glycine. The net result was that the activity per head of the S1 and HMM L310G mutant constructs was nearly identical. This is in sharp contrast to the wild type constructs (Fig. 4B) in which the HMM has approximately half the activity per head as compared with the S1, indicative of gating. Multiple preparations (four) gave average Vmax and KATPase values for the single- and double-headed myosin VI L310G mutants that were similar (10.3 ± 0.4 versus 10.5 ± 0.7 s−1head−1, respectively), confirming a lack of gating between the heads. The average KATPase values differed for the single- and double-headed constructs (8.5 ± 0.3 and 4.8 ± 0.8 μm, respectively), with the higher apparent actin affinity (KATPase) indicative of cooperative actin binding in the two-headed molecule. In contrast, the average Vmax for multiple preparations (four) of the single- and double-headed wild type myosin VI differed by ∼2-fold, indicating the presence of gating in the dimeric construct. For the single-headed myosin VI, the average Vmax was 6.8 ± 0.2 versus 3.1 ± 0.5 s−1head−1 for the dimer, with average KATPase values of 8.3 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. Thus, leucine 310 is sufficient to confer gating in myosin VI if positioned properly by the remainder of insert-1. To avoid the complications of the influence of intramolecular strain on rate constants (12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and to facilitate interpretation of the unstrained structures, we focused the transient kinetic analyses in this study on single-headed (S1) constructs. These constructs contained all of the myosin VI motor and terminated immediately after the short myosin VI lever arm containing two bound calmodulin molecules. Transient kinetic properties of the wild type, L310G, and Δ-insert-1 single-headed constructs were determined using the kinetic scheme (Scheme 1) below. The resulting data are summarized in TABLE 1, TABLE 2. As summarized in Table 1, the Vmax of the steady state actin-activated ATPase activity is higher for the insert-1 deletion than for the L310G mutant, which in turn is slightly higher than wild type. As shown in Table 1, the increase in the steady state actin-activated ATPase of the L310G and Δ-insert-1 mutants is due to an increase in the rate of ADP dissociation from the actomyosin VI complex (k+5′), which is the rate-limiting step in the actin-activated ATPase cycle for myosin VI (13De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Also note that the KATPase is similar for the single-headed wild type and L310G mutant constructs, but it is much lower for the single-headed Δ-insert-1 mutant. This likely indicates that a kinetic step(s) other than nucleotide binding and release are altered by complete removal of insert-1 (likely k+4′). Because gating is achieved by preventing ATP-induced dissociation of the lead head from actin, we examined the impact of leucine 310 on ATP-induced actin dissociation. This involved determining the rate of transition from strong to weak actin binding (K1′k+2′), as monitored by pyrene actin fluorescence (23Geeves M.A. Jeffries T.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, removal of insert-1 increases the rate of ATP-induced dissociation by 10-fold, consistent with our earlier reports (3Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also shown in Table 1 is that mutation of leucine 310 to glycine results in the same 10-fold increase in this rate. This reveals that leucine 310 was indeed the primary modulator of the rate of ATP binding and complex dissociation. We next characterized the impact of the leucine 310 and insert-1 on nucleotide binding in the absence of actin. We wanted to establish whether or not either leucine 310 or insert-1 confer nucleotide binding selectivity in the absence of actin. This is necessary to interpret the high resolution structures of wild type and mutant myosin VI motors as representative of the state that myosin VI populates on actin. Binding and release of ADP and binding of ATP were, thus, determined, and the resulting data are summarized in Table 2. The examination of ATP binding kinetics determined by mantATP binding to myosin VI without actin (K1′k+2′) revealed that leucine 310, even in the absence of actin, is the primary modulator of the rate of ATP binding. The rates of ATP binding were similar for the L310G mutant or the insert-1 deletion in the absence of actin and ∼10-fold higher than the wild type construct. In contrast, ADP binding to myosin VI in the absence of actin (k−5′) was unaffected by deletion of insert-1 or the L310G mutation. ADP dissociation (k+5′) was slightly affected (∼2-fold faster than wild type) with the L310G mutation, and the opposite effect (nearly 3-fold slowing) was observed upon removal of insert-1. In the presence of actin (Table 1), insert-1 has a small influence on the ADP binding kinetics. Binding of MgADP to the actomyosin VI complex (k−5′) was about 1.5-fold faster with either the L310G or deletion of insert-1 mutants. In contrast to the situation in the absence of actin in which removal of insert-1 slows ADP dissociation, this rate is faster for both mutants bound to actin. It was increased ∼1.5-fold in the L310G mutant and ∼2.5-fold with the deletion of insert-1 (Table 1). What is clear is that when myosin VI is either bound or not bound to actin, leucine 310 is positioned by insert-1 to selectively interfere with ATP binding, while having little or no effect on ADP binding. As we demonstrated previously (12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), intramolecular strain experienced by the heads of the HMM bound to actin causes the lead head to have a much slower rate of ATP-induced detachment than we see in the absence of strain. Also shown by Sweeney et al. (12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the rear head of the processive dimer has a rate of ATP-induced detachment from actin that is similar to that seen in the absence of strain (i.e. in the S1 construct (12Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). Based on the data of this study, it is likely that rearward strain on the lead head positions leucine 310 of insert-1 to provide increased steric hindrance for ATP entry as compared with its position in our single-headed constructs, as replacing leucine 310 with glycine totally abolishes gating (Fig. 4). Examination of the effects of ADP binding and dissociation revealed that both leucine 310 and the rest of insert-1 have distinct effects. ADP binding in the absence of actin is unaffected by either. ADP dissociation is slightly slowed by the presence of Leu-310 either in the presence or absence of actin, whereas the removal of all of insert-1 increases dissociation to a greater extent in the presence of actin but slows release in the absence of actin. This last result in particular suggests that beyond the steric effects of leucine 310, insert-1 also influences transitions between the states that bind and release MgADP in the presence and absence of actin. The states that bind MgADP are not equivalent depending on whether or not actin is present, which can explain how insert-1 can exert the opposite effect on ADP release. In the absence of actin, myosin binds ADP strongly in a state that is known as the post-rigor state (24Ménétrey J. Llinas P. Cicolari J. Squires G. Liu X. Li A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear what is the structural transition that releases MgADP from this state, but for myosin VI it is likely that it is a transition to the rigor-like state, which is the state in which myosin VI crystallizes in the absence of nucleotide (3Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A major difference in these two states is the twist of the β-sheet associated with the nucleotide binding pocket. The rigor position of the β-sheet represents an unstrained conformation, whereas the MgADP (or MgATP) post-rigor conformation is strained. A possible interpretation of these data is that insert-1 favors the rigor-like conformation of the β-sheet and disfavors the post-rigor conformation. Thus, removal of insert-1 stabilizes post-rigor, slowing ADP dissociation in the absence of actin. When bound to actin, ADP release occurs during an isomerization between a state that binds MgADP strongly and one that can bind ADP weakly (22Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25Rosenfeld S.S. Houdusse A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6072-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The state that binds ADP weakly is close to the rigor-like state with an unstrained conformation for the β-sheet. Although the nature of the β-sheet conformation in the strong MgADP, strong actin binding conformation is unknown, it must be different from either the rigor-like or post-rigor conformations for both the ADP and actin affinity to be strong. The rigor-like state has a low ADP affinity, whereas the post-rigor state binds actin weakly. Sequential distortion of this β-sheet may resemble the conformational changes visualized in the F1-ATPase in different biochemical states upon release of its products (26Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of the ADP dissociation data in Table 1 is that insert-1 favors the novel β-sheet conformation found in the strong ADP binding state on actin as compared with the rigor conformation, and thus, insert-1 slows ADP release from actomyosin VI. One cannot, however, simply postulate that insert-1 affects the rate of β-sheet transitions, as in the absence of actin it promotes ADP release, and in the presence of actin it slows ADP release. Thus, a second consequence of insert-1 on myosin VI kinetics is that it stabilizes the strong binding ADP state on actin, decreasing the rate of ADP release and increasing the duty ratio. Note that these observations mirror those from studies of the alternatively spliced exon 7 of Drosophila melanogaster myosin II (27Miller B.M. Bloemink M.J. Nyitrai M. Bernstein S.I. Geeves M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1051-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Those investigators demonstrated a similar influence of substitutions within the upper 50-kDa subdomain on nucleotide binding and release kinetics. The region coding for this alternative exon encompasses the region where insert-1 is found in myosin VI. The structures of the myosin VI mutants solved in this study suggest that insert-1 may influence the transitions necessary for binding and release of nucleotide in different ways. First, insert-1 may influence nucleotide binding and release via the direct interactions it makes with an important linker of the U50 subdomain (residues Leu-229–Asn–244) (see Fig. 3). Variability in the dynamics of this U50 linker could influence the transitions between states, as this U50 linker is found to play multiple roles in myosin. Its surface comprises part of the U50 side of the cleft that closes in rigor in the molecule. It also interacts with the Switch I element necessary for strong binding of Mg2+ and nucleotide, and it directly follows the last strand of the central β-sheet, which adopts different conformations upon nucleotide binding and release from myosin. It is also possible that to allow a novel β-sheet conformation, there must be movements within the upper 50-kDa subdomain that are also necessary for the formation of strong binding to actin with ADP bound (following phosphate release). In this regard, the interactions that insert-1 makes with the rest of the U50 subdomain could greatly influence the rearrangements necessary to populate the strong-ADP state. These considerations highlight a critical role for this insert-1 region in being part of the pathway of communication between the nucleotide binding site, the transducer, and the actin binding interface via rearrangements within the U50 subdomain. Consistent with this hypothesis, it is noteworthy that hypertrophy cardiomyopathy can be caused by β-cardiac myosin heavy chain mutations F312C (28Van Driest S.L. Jaeger M.A. Ommen S.R. Will M.L. Gersh B.J. Tajik A.J. Ackerman M.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 602-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and V320M (29Havndrup O. Bundgaard H. Andersen P.S. Allan Larsen L. Vuust J. Kjeldsen K. Christiansen M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These residues are equivalent to residues Tyr-273 and Phe-282 in myosin VI and Tyr-287 and Ile-296 in myosin V (see the residues in red in Fig. 3, C and D). Although Phe-282 interacts with Switch I, Tyr-273 is involved in internal interactions within the U50 subdomain and interacts with the U50 linker. To explain the effect of Leu-310 on ATP binding in the absence of actin, we studied the structures shown in Fig. 2 in more detail. As noted in the results, leucine 310 is the closest insert-1 residue to the nucleotide binding pocket. Removal of its side chain in the L310G mutant leads to a myosin that binds MgATP as fast as if all of insert-1 is removed. The structure of this mutant myosin in the nucleotide-free state shows that the insert-1 main chain conformation is not affected by the mutation (Fig. 2). Thus, one must conclude that it is the side chain of Leu-310 of insert-1 that is responsible for the large difference in MgATP binding kinetics. Without actin, the nucleotide-free myosin VI structure (rigor-like) shows that it has a more open front door than in the post-rigor conformation. It is clear, however, that the insert-1, in particular Leu-310, restricts the size of this front door in myosin VI compared with other myosins that do not have this insert. The selectivity of leucine 310 for ATP versus ADP binding has implications for how nucleotides can bind to myosin. It is generally assumed that the phosphates enter the phosphate tube and bind first; however, the narrowed phosphate tube of myosin VI may prevent that from occurring rapidly. The selective influence of leucine 310 on ATP suggests a second possible mechanism. The difference in the influence of insert-1 for the MgATP and MgADP kinetics indicates that nucleotide binding is likely to initially occur via the docking of the purine base to the N-terminal subdomain of myosin. This has previously been suggested by a scallop-striated muscle myosin II structure with ADP bound (30Risal D. Gourinath S. Himmel D.M. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8930-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which describes a conformation of the nucleotide that has different torsional angles between the purine base and the ribose and between the ribose and the C5′ of ADP as shown in Figs. 2C and 5. This structure suggests that the nucleotide can bind to myosin via the purine base interactions only and likely undergoes a number of conformations when partially bound to myosin. Note that this structure (30Risal D. Gourinath S. Himmel D.M. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8930-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) had a sulfate ion bound to the P-loop, however, so whether the nucleotide binds first via the purine base interactions could not be deduced from these data. What is clear is that the side chain of Leu-310 greatly reduces the opening of the nucleotide binding site and restricts the number of conformations the nucleotide may adopt to enter the site if it would first bind via the phosphate moiety (Fig. 5A). Note, however, that this should affect both ADP and ATP binding kinetics similarly. The phosphate moieties bind to the P-loop, which is found at the bottom of the pocket opening. The γ-phosphate of ATP occupies the deepest site, whereas the position for the β- and α-phosphates are identical in ADP and ATP once they are docked into the pocket and associated with the P-loop of myosin. The rest of the nucleotide would be positioned similarly for ADP and ATP, and thus, one should not expect any difference on the influence of insert-1 in the binding kinetics of these two nucleotides in a scheme in which the phosphates dock first. This study, thus, supports that nucleotide binding occurs by first docking the purine moiety of the nucleotide (Fig. 5B). The nucleotide-bound myosin structures and, in particular the ADP bound scallop structure mentioned above, show that this purine moiety is likely to interact with a pocket in the N-terminal subdomain composed of residues Asn-98—Tyr-107 and Gly-156—Phe-163. Most of these interactions are hydrophobic and hold the purine moiety of the nucleotide. Of note, a hydrogen bond involving Tyr-107 is conserved in all myosins and helps correctly position the purine moiety. Docking nucleotide in the nucleotide-free (rigor-like) structure via the purine moiety shows that the diphosphate moiety of ADP can rotate and explore different conformations with minimal hindrance from leucine 310 of insert-1, in agreement with the observation that insert-1 only minimally influences the binding of ADP in myosin VI. In contrast, the triphosphate moiety of ATP is longer and rigidified by the binding of Mg2+ between the β- and γ-phosphate. Thus, collision with the side chain of leucine 310 of insert-1 upon rotation of the triphosphate moiety will occur, whereas the purine ring is docked, accounting for the reduction in the rate of binding of MgATP to myosin VI (Fig. 5, B and C). Although the structures obtained in this study do provide a mechanism to explain the differential ability of ATP and ADP to bind in the absence of strain, they do not reveal the position of insert-1 and, importantly, of Leu-310, in the presence of intramolecular strain, as would be experienced by the lead head of a processive myosin VI dimer. It is also true that we have no idea of how strain is communicated to the nucleotide binding pocket of a plus-end directed motor, such as myosin V, in a manner that greatly slows nucleotide release (8Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat.

Our hypothesis is that strain in the myosin VI motor must be interpreted in a different manner than for myosin V, as the strain on the lead head of myosin VI is applied in the reverse direction as compared with myosin V. Based on single molecule experiments, we recently proposed a model in which intramolecular strain prevents the converter subdomain of the lead head of a myosin VI dimer from undergoing its rearrangement to its rigor conformation until the trailing head detaches from actin (31Reifenberger J.G.

The implication of this model is that preventing the converter rearrangement somehow positions the subdomains of the motor such that Leu-310 creates an even greater barrier to ATP binding (but not to ADP binding) than we see in our current structures."
