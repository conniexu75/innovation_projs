https://openalex.org/W2133019124,"Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is an early and critical feature of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta generation depends on proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two unknown proteases: beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. These proteases are prime therapeutic targets. A transmembrane aspartic protease with all the known characteristics of beta-secretase was cloned and characterized. Overexpression of this protease, termed BACE (for beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme) increased the amount of beta-secretase cleavage products, and these were cleaved exactly and only at known beta-secretase positions. Antisense inhibition of endogenous BACE messenger RNA decreased the amount of beta-secretase cleavage products, and purified BACE protein cleaved APP-derived substrates with the same sequence specificity as beta-secretase. Finally, the expression pattern and subcellular localization of BACE were consistent with that expected for beta-secretase. Future development of BACE inhibitors may prove beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2084887961,"Cryptochrome (CRY), a photoreceptor for the circadian clock in Drosophila, binds to the clock component TIM in a light-dependent fashion and blocks its function. In mammals, genetic evidence suggests a role for CRYs within the clock, distinct from hypothetical photoreceptor functions. Mammalian CRY1 and CRY2 are here shown to act as light-independent inhibitors of CLOCK-BMAL1, the activator driving Per1 transcription. CRY1 or CRY2 (or both) showed light-independent interactions with CLOCK and BMAL1, as well as with PER1, PER2, and TIM. Thus, mammalian CRYs act as light-independent components of the circadian clock and probably regulate Per1 transcriptional cycling by contacting both the activator and its feedback inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1984059331,"The exuberant growth of neurites during development becomes markedly reduced as cortical neurons mature. In vitro studies of neurons from mouse cerebral cortex revealed that contact-mediated Notch signaling regulates the capacity of neurons to extend and elaborate neurites. Up-regulation of Notch activity was concomitant with an increase in the number of interneuronal contacts and cessation of neurite growth. In neurons with low Notch activity, which readily extend neurites, up-regulation of Notch activity either inhibited extension or caused retraction of neurites. Conversely, in more mature neurons that had ceased their growth after establishing numerous connections and displayed high Notch activity, inhibition of Notch signaling promoted neurite extension. Thus, the formation of neuronal contacts results in activation of Notch receptors, leading to restriction of neuronal growth and a subsequent arrest in maturity."
https://openalex.org/W1971846249,"Smad proteins mediate transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling to regulate cell growth and differentiation. The SnoN oncoprotein was found to interact with Smad2 and Smad4 and to repress their abilities to activate transcription through recruitment of the transcriptional corepressor N-CoR. Immediately after TGF-β stimulation, SnoN is rapidly degraded by the nuclear accumulation of Smad3, allowing the activation of TGF-β target genes. By 2 hours, TGF-β induces a marked increase in SnoN expression, resulting in termination of Smad-mediated transactivation. Thus, SnoN maintains the repressed state of TGF-β–responsive genes in the absence of ligand and participates in negative feedback regulation of TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2014764883,"During mammalian development, electrical activity promotes the calcium-dependent survival of neurons that have made appropriate synaptic connections. However, the mechanisms by which calcium mediates neuronal survival during development are not well characterized. A transcription-dependent mechanism was identified by which calcium influx into neurons promoted cell survival. The transcription factor MEF2 was selectively expressed in newly generated postmitotic neurons and was required for the survival of these neurons. Calcium influx into cerebellar granule neurons led to activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activation of MEF2. Once activated, MEF2 regulated neuronal survival by stimulating MEF2-dependent gene transcription. These findings demonstrate that MEF2 is a calcium-regulated transcription factor and define a function for MEF2 during nervous system development that is distinct from previously well-characterized functions of MEF2 during muscle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1840564118,"We analyzed the synaptic physiology of unc-13 mutants in the nematode C. elegans. Mutants of unc-13 had normal nervous system architecture, and the densities of synapses and postsynaptic receptors were normal at the neuromuscular junction. However, the number of synaptic vesicles at neuromuscular junctions was two- to threefold greater in unc-13 mutants than in wild-type animals. Most importantly, evoked release at both GABAergic and cholinergic synapses was almost absent in unc-13 null alleles, as determined by whole-cell, voltage-clamp techniques. Although mutant synapses had morphologically docked vesicles, these vesicles were not competent for release as assayed by spontaneous release in calcium-free solution or by the application of hyperosmotic saline. These experiments support models in which UNC-13 mediates either fusion of vesicles during exocytosis or priming of vesicles for fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1999252429,"A solution of cadmium selenide nanocrystals was used to print inorganic thin-film transistors with field effect mobilities up to 1 square centimeter per volt second. This mobility is an order of magnitude larger than those reported for printed organic transistors. A field effect was achieved by developing a synthesis that yielded discretely sized nanocrystals less than 2 nanometers in size, which were free of intimately bound organic capping groups. The resulting nanocrystal solution exhibited low-temperature grain growth, which formed single crystal areas encompassing hundreds of nanocrystals. This process suggests a route to inexpensive, all-printed, high-quality inorganic logic on plastic substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2118967648,"Drosophila Clock (dClk) is rhythmically expressed, with peaks in mRNA and protein (dCLK) abundance early in the morning. dClk mRNA cycling is shown here to be regulated by PERIOD-TIMELESS (PER-TIM)-mediated release of dCLK- and CYCLE (CYC)-dependent repression. Lack of both PER-TIM derepression and dCLK-CYC repression results in high levels of dClk mRNA, which implies that a separate dClk activator is present. These results demonstrate that the Drosophila circadian feedback loop is composed of two interlocked negative feedback loops: a per-tim loop, which is activated by dCLK-CYC and repressed by PER-TIM, and a dClk loop, which is repressed by dCLK-CYC and derepressed by PER-TIM."

https://openalex.org/W2079388247,"Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by members of the NO synthase (NOS) family. Recently the existence of a mitochondrial NOS (mtNOS), its Ca2+ dependence, and its relevance for mitochondrial bioenergetics was reported (Ghafourifar, P., and Richter, C. (1997) FEBS Lett. 418, 291–296; Giulivi, C., Poderoso, J. J., and Boveris, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11038–11043). Here we report on the possible involvement of mtNOS in apoptosis. We show that uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria triggers mtNOS activity and causes the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria in a Bcl-2-sensitive manner. mtNOS-induced cytochrome c release was paralleled by increased lipid peroxidation. The release of cytochrome c as well as increase in lipid peroxidation were prevented by NOS inhibitors, a superoxide dismutase mimic, and a peroxynitrite scavenger. We show that mtNOS-induced cytochromec release is not mediated via the mitochondrial permeability transition pore because the release was aggravated by cyclosporin A and abolished by blockade of mitochondrial calcium uptake by ruthenium red. We conclude that, upon Ca2+-induced mtNOS activation, peroxynitrite is formed within mitochondria, which causes the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria, and we propose a mechanism by which elevated Ca2+ levels induce apoptosis.

The most-cited and best understood physiological target for NO is the heme-containing protein, soluble guanylyl cyclase (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). However, at physiological concentrations, NO also binds to another hemoprotein, cytochrome oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and thereby controls cellular functions via reversible inhibition of respiration (reviewed in Ref. 2Ghafourifar P. Richter C. Wagner E. From Symbiosis to Eukaryotism-Endocytobiology VII. Geneva University Press, 1999: 503-516Google Scholar).

In 1997, we reported for the first time on the presence of a constitutively expressed and continuously active NOS in mitochondria (mtNOS), its localization in the inner mitochondrial membrane, its Ca2+ dependence, and that the enzyme exerts substantial control over mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Soon thereafter the presence of mtNOS and its localization were confirmed, and the enzyme was enriched and shown to cross-react with antibodies directed against inducible NOS (5Giulivi C.

Mitochondria are essential for at least certain forms of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 6Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, cytochrome c, a mitochondrial protein that is part of the respiratory chain, triggers apoptosis once it is dislocated from the organelle. It is now well accepted that many factors drive cells into apoptotic deathvia mitochondrial cytochrome c release. NO reacts with O2− to produce the powerful oxidizing agent, peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Recently many studies focused on the role of NO and ONOO− in apoptosis (7Lin K.T. Xue J.Y. Nomen M. Spur B. Wong P.Y.K. J. Biol.

An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ level caused by, e.g. glutamate receptor stimulation, is apoptogenic (reviewed in Ref. 11McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Many recent reports show that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is an essential step in Ca2+-induced apoptosis (12Stout A. Raphael H.M.

This kind of programmed cell death is accompanied by increased NOS activity (12Stout A. Raphael H.M. Kanterewicz B.I. Klann E. Reynolds I.J. Nat.

Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Mitochondria produce NO in a Ca2+-dependent manner (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and are a rich source of O2−. Therefore, intramitochondrial Ca2+-dependent ONOO− formation seems likely. Here we show that upon Ca2+ uptake by isolated mitochondria, mtNOS is stimulated and cytochrome c is released in a Bcl-2-sensitive manner. We provide evidence that the observed cytochrome c release is due to intramitochondrial ONOO− formation because it is prevented by NOS inhibitors, an SOD mimic, and an ONOO−scavenger. We suggest that Ca2+-induced apoptosis is at least partly mediated via mtNOS. N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl) acetamidine (1400W), and manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Läufelfingen, Switzerland).

The protein content of mitochondria and the mitochondrial supernatants were determined by the Biuret method with bovine serum albumin as standard. Freshly isolated mitochondria (50 mg of protein/ml) were incubated at 4 °C in 0.1m HEPES buffer, pH 7.1, containing protease inhibitors: aprotinin, pepstatin A, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin (2 μg/ml each).

Mitochondrial respiration was then supported by 0.8 mm K+-succinate in the presence of 5 μm rotenone for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were spun at 100,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C.

Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.1, at room temperature. Oxygen consumption was measured under continuous stirring with a Clarke-type electrode, as described (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) was measured in an Aminco DW-2A spectrophotometer at 511–533 nm in the presence of 10 μmsafranin as described (18Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O.

This panel also shows that Bcl-2 prevents mtNOS-induced cytochrome c release, which indicates that the release is not because of a general mitochondrial damage followed by a nonspecific protein release, but it is a specific phenomenon relevant to apoptosis.

Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The reaction of NO and O2− with the rate constant of 1.9 × 1010m−1 s−1 (27Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) is one of the fastest reactions known in biology. Mitochondria produce NO in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and they are well known sources of O2− radicals. Intramitochondrial Ca2+-dependent ONOO− formation is, therefore, very likely. Fig.1 A shows that mtNOS-induced cytochromec release is prevented by the SOD mimic, MnTBAP, as well as by the ONOO− scavenger, urate. This finding strongly suggests that ONOO− is indeed formed within mitochondria and that it releases mitochondrial cytochrome c. This may explain the mechanism by which an elevated Ca2+ level induces apoptosis in a manner that requires mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and is prevented by inhibiting NOS activity, lowering O2− level, and scavenging ONOO−. It is known that ONOO− induces LPO (10Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Hutchins J.B. Mattson M.P. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) it is known that cytochrome c release is the cause and not the consequence of reactive oxygen species formation in mitochondria. We have recently confirmed this finding by showing that the decreased mitochondrial O2 consumption, ΔΨ and Ca2+ retention, consequent to ceramide-induced mitochondrial cytochrome c loss, are recovered by addition of exogenous cytochrome c (18Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Rocha S. Pruschy M. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has also been reported that both the shape and the volume alterations of mitochondria because of cytochrome c loss are reversible (31Martinou I. Desagher S. Eskes R. Antonsson B. André E. Fakan S. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Upon release of cytochrome c from its native location within the hierarchically arranged mitochondrial respiratory complexes III and IV, complex III remains mostly reduced, and therefore, electrons become available for O2− formation. Prevention by Bcl-2 of cytochrome c release retains the possibility for electrons to flow from complex III to cytochromec, and from there to complex IV and, consequently, decreases the availability of electrons for the formation of O2−, one of the two precursors of ONOO−. In the experiments reported above, Ca2+,l-arginine, and BH4 were provided to mitochondria. Fig. 1 B shows that Ca2+ per se is sufficient to trigger cytochrome c release in anl-NMMA and Bcl-2 sensitive manner and Fig. 1C shows that the effect of Ca2+ is concentration-dependent. It is not surprising that Ca2+ per se is sufficient for mtNOS-induced cytochrome c release, because other substrate/cofactors seem to be available in mitochondria in adequate concentrations. Intramitochondrial concentrations ofl-arginine (32Dolinska M. Albrecht J. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and NADPH (33Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 200-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are in the mmrange. FAD and FMN are components of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II and, therefore, present in mitochondria (34Darley-Usmar V. Ragan I. Smith P. Wilson M. Darley-Usmar V. Schapira A.H.V. Mitochondria: DNA, Proteins, and Diseases. Portland Press, UK1994: 1-25Google Scholar). There is also evidence for the presence of BH4 (35Rembold H. Buff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and calmodulin (36Hatase O. Doi A. Itano T. Matsui H. Ohmura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Itano T. Matsui H. Doi A. Ohmura Y. Hatase O. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 787-792PubMed Google Scholar) in mitochondria. To establish that the observed cytochrome c release requires the uptake of Ca2+ into the mitochondria, we used specific mitochondrial release and uptake blockers. Fig. 1 C shows that sequestration of Ca2+ within mitochondria by CSA, a compound known to block the specific mitochondrial Ca2+release pathway (38Richter C. Theus M. Schlegel J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), aggravates mtNOS-induced cytochrome crelease in an l-NMMA-sensitive manner. CSA is also reported to be a closure of the nonspecific solute transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which is considered to be the reason for many features of apoptosis including cytochrome c release (reviewed in Ref. 39Hirsch T. Marzo I. Kroemer G. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because CSA further increases the release of cytochrome cinduced by mtNOS stimulation (Fig. 1 C), we conclude that mtNOS-induced cytochrome c release is not mediated via the mitochondrial permeability transition. Blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by RR prevents Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 1 D). This finding is compatible with reports by other investigators that RR prevents apoptosis induced by elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels (12Stout A. Raphael H.M. Kanterewicz B.I. Klann E. Reynolds I.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar,14Kruman I.I. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 40Baek J.H. Lee Y.S.

Neurol. 1998; 154: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Also, when mitochondria were de-energized by antimycin A plus oligomycin or by omitting succinate and therefore did not take up Ca2+, mtNOS activity was decreased (Fig.3 A) and cytochromec release was prevented (Fig. 1 D). This finding also confirms recent reports (18Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Rocha S. Pruschy M. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 31Martinou I. Desagher S. Eskes R. Antonsson B. André E. Fakan S. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that cytochrome c is not detached from the mitochondrial inner membrane because of a fall in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, e.g. upon uptake of Ca2+. To address the mechanism by which Bcl-2 prevents mtNOS-induced cytochrome c release, we measured mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (dual wavelength spectroscopy using Arsenazo III as the probe) (18Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Rocha S. Pruschy M. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and observed that Bcl-2 does not decrease mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (not shown). Additionally, we measured mtNOS activity and observed that Bcl-2 does not decrease it (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B shows that Ca2+-induced decreased mitochondrial O2consumption is prevented by l-NMMA, but not by Bcl-2. Also Fig. 3 C shows that uptake of Ca2+ by respiring mitochondria causes a drastic fall in ΔΨ that is greatly prevented by l-NMMA but not Bcl-2. These findings demonstrate that decreased O2 consumption and ΔΨ induced by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is because of NO formation by mtNOS, and not cytochrome c release, and that prevention by Bcl-2 of mtNOS-induced cytochrome c release is not because of a decreased mtNOS activity. In contrast, mitochondrial de-energization by antimycin A prevents mtNOS-induced cytochromec release (Fig. 1 D) because of a drastic decrease in mtNOS activity (Fig. 3 A). Altogether, these results show that uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria followed by mtNOS stimulation causes mitochondrial cytochrome c release and increased LPO, and provide evidence that these events are mediated via intramitochondrial ONOO− formation. We propose that mtNOS plays a hitherto undetected role in apoptosis induced by elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels.

In the present experiments, we studied the LQT mutation N470D heterologously expressed in a mammalian cell line. This mutation, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, has been reported to generate HERG current with reduced amplitude (30% of wild type) and altered voltage dependence of activation (10Sanguinetti M.C.

We found that the protein trafficking of N470D mutant is highly temperature-sensitive. In addition, we showed that the defective protein trafficking can be corrected by drugs that selectively block HERG channels. long QT syndrome chromosome 7-linked form of LQT The HERG N470D mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of wild type HERG cDNA using the GeneEditor in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). Stable transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells with HERG wild type and N470D cDNA was carried out using a LipofectAMINE method (11Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C except where noted when the temperature was 27 °C. Membrane currents were recorded in the whole cell configuration using suction pipettes as described previously (11Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys.

Cells were superfused with HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution containing (in mm) 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, with NaOH). The internal pipette solution contained (in mm) 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 Mg-ATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2, with KOH).

The membrane proteins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with an anti-HERG antibody at room temperature overnight, and the antibody was detected with an ECL detection kit (11Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z.

Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (400 μCi/ml) for a 1-h pulse and then chased with 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine for time periods up to 24 h. At different time intervals, the cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-HERG antibody. The specificity of the anti-HERG antibody was described previously (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As shown in the voltage clamp records in Fig. 1 A, when we stably expressed the N470D mutation in a mammalian cell line (HEK293) cultured at 37 °C, almost no HERG current was generated. When the culture temperature was reduced to 27 °C for 24 h before the study, HERG current amplitude markedly increased. The peak outward current present at the end of 4-s-long steps to −20 mV was 375 ± 66 pA (n = 5 cells) compared with 43 ± 8 pA (n = 8 cells, p < 0.05) for cells cultured at 37 °C, showing that functional expression of N470D mutant current is temperature-sensitive. The half-maximal activation voltage (V12) for the N470D channel at 27 °C was −39.4 ± 1.1 mV with a slope factor of 6.8 ± 0.2. The V12 is ∼25 mV negative to that observed in wild type channels (11Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which agrees with previous findings obtained inXenopus oocytes (10Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows an immunoblot analysis of HERG protein for the N470D mutant. We have previously shown that wild type HERG channel protein expressed in HEK293 cells consists of two forms on immunoblot analysis: a 135-kDa band representing the core-glycosylated, immature form of the channel protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum; and a 155-kDa band representing the fully glycosylated, mature form of the channel protein located in the plasma membrane (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). For the N470D mutant, when cells were cultured at 37 °C the immunoblot analysis showed the 135-kDa immature form. When cells had been cultured at 27 °C for 24 h, the 155-kDa mature form of the channel protein also was present. Thus, the N470D mutant protein is trafficking-deficient in cells cultured at physiological temperature, whereas the channel protein traffics to the plasma membrane to produce functional channels at reduced temperature. Specific substrates and drugs have recently been shown in a P-glycoprotein mutagenesis model to correct defective protein trafficking (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether drugs that bind with high affinity to HERG channels can improve the trafficking of the N470D LQT2 mutant protein. Fig. 2 Ashows immunoblot analyses on HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type HERG or N470D mutant channels. The cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 5 μm E-4031, a methanesulfonanilide antiarrhythmic drug that selectively binds to HERG channels and blocks HERG current (8Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 11Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). For wild type HERG, both the 135- and 155-kDa protein bands were present, and E-4031 had no effect on them. For the N470D mutant cultured in the absence of E-4031, the immunoblot analysis shows that protein was again expressed almost entirely as the 135-kDa immature form. In contrast, when cells were cultured for 24 h in 5 μm E-4031, the 155-kDa band was increased. These data suggest that processing of the core-glycosylated, immature form to the fully glycosylated, mature form of the channel protein was restored by E-4031. We also studied the H1-receptor antagonist astemizole and the prokinetic compound cisapride, which block HERG channels with high affinity (13Mohammad S. Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2534-H2538PubMed Google Scholar, 14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Both drugs (5 μm) corrected the trafficking defect of N470D mutant protein on immunoblot analyses similar to the findings with E-4031 (data not shown). High concentrations of low molecular weight compounds such as glycerol also have been shown to improve protein trafficking (15Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 16Brown C.R. HongBrown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress & Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Culturing the N470D expressing cells in glycerol (10%, ∼1 m) for 24 h increased the 155-kDa band on the immunoblot analysis, but the effect was less than that obtained with E-4031 (data not shown). The time course and concentration dependence of E-4031 on the processing of the mature band are shown in Fig. 2, B andC. In Fig. 2 B, the increase of the 155-kDa band reached a maximum by 8 h of culture in E-4031. In Fig. 2 C, the 155-kDa band was increased with 0.5 μmE-4031 and reached a maximum in 5 μm E-4031. The above results suggest that E-4031 increases the mature form of N470D mutant channel protein in the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we studied functional expression of HERG current following 24 h of culture in 5 μm E-4031. The cells were switched to E-4031-free culture medium for 1 h to remove the drug before patch clamp study. Fig. 3 A shows example voltage clamp records. Under control conditions, current for the N470D mutant was minimal. For cells cultured in E-4031, HERG current amplitude was markedly increased. Fig. 3 B shows averaged I-V plots for HERG current present at the end of 4-s-long steps to different voltages. Following culture in E-4031, HERG current activated at voltages positive to −70 mV with a V12 of −40.4 ± 1.2 mV (slope factor of 6.7 ± 0.4); maximum current was reached at −20 mV, and at more positive voltages HERG current decreased consistent with rapid inactivation (17Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). To test whether E-4031 exerted its effect by post-translational modification, a pulse-chase analysis was performed on the N470D mutant as shown in Fig. 4. In this experiment cells were first metabolically labeled during a 1-h pulse and were chased with unlabeled methionine and cysteine for times between 2 and 24 h in the absence (Fig. 4 A) or presence (Fig. 4 B) of 5 μm E-4031. In the absence of E-4031, the metabolically labeled 135-kDa band was not converted to the mature form of the protein during the chase, but rather it disappeared within 24 h. With E-4031 present during the chase, the 135-kDa band was partially converted to the 155-kDa form of the protein. These findings suggest that E-4031 acts post-translationally, presumably by stabilizing the N470D protein in a conformation that permits its trafficking to the plasma membrane. Abnormal trafficking of mutant protein has been increasingly recognized as a mechanism for inherited human diseases (18Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

The retention of mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum results in reduction in the delivery of HERG channels to the plasma membrane and the generation of the LQT phenotype. Our finding that expression is highly temperature-sensitive provides a mechanism for the poor correlation reported between the clinical severity of the long QT syndrome phenotype and the loss of function of underlying HERG mutations studied at room temperature (27Priori S.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) reported a P-glycoprotein model for studying the protein trafficking of non-disease-causing point mutations. They found that several drug substrates in micromolar concentrations were able to act as chemical chaperones for the processing of misfolded P-glycoprotein to the plasma membrane. In the present work we show the correction of a protein trafficking defect in an inherited human disease, LQT, by low concentrations of drugs known to selectively bind to HERG channels. The drug effect occurred rapidly by a post-translational mechanism and restored the functional expression of large amplitude HERG current. Thus, our results suggest that drugs binding with high affinity to HERG channels may act as chemical chaperones to promote proper protein folding or assembly in a conformation that permits trafficking to the plasma membrane. The finding that three different drugs known to cause high affinity block of HERG channels correct the trafficking defect in the N470D mutant provides support for their specific interaction with a receptor on the channel protein and not through a separate regulatory pathway. Clearly, additional studies are required to identify the biochemical and structural mechanisms underlying these observations. An important question is whether the ligand-receptor interactions that modulate the trafficking of mutated HERG channel protein can be dissociated from the ligand-receptor interactions that mediate drug block of HERG channel current. If this dissociation can be achieved, our findings have potential implications as a therapeutic approach to correcting HERG protein trafficking defects in some LQT2 mutations in patients. These findings potentially establish a new paradigm for the regulation of ion channels and cell excitability that may impact diseases in cardiac, neuronal, and epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2078850134,"T cell receptor (TCR)-induced apoptosis of thymocytes is mediated by calcium-dependent expression of the steroid receptors Nur77 and Nor1. Nur77 expression is controlled by the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), but how MEF2 is activated by calcium signaling is still obscure. Cabin1, a calcineurin inhibitor, was found to regulate MEF2. MEF2 was normally sequestered by Cabin1 in a transcriptionally inactive state. TCR engagement led to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration and the dissociation of MEF2 from Cabin1, as a result of competitive binding of activated calmodulin to Cabin1. The interplay between Cabin1, MEF2, and calmodulin defines a distinct signaling pathway from the TCR to the Nur77 promoter during T cell apoptosis."

Many AAA enzymes disassemble stable protein-protein complexes, but their mechanisms are not well understood. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay demonstrated that the p60 subunit of katanin oligomerized in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- and microtubule-dependent manner. Oligomerization increased the affinity of katanin for microtubules and stimulated its ATPase activity. After hydrolysis of ATP, microtubule-bound katanin oligomers disassembled microtubules and then dissociated into free katanin monomers. Coupling a nucleotide-dependent oligomerization cycle to the disassembly of a target protein complex may be a general feature of ATP-hydrolyzing AAA domains."

Neuropept. 1996; 30: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a neuropeptide with prothoracicostatic activity has not yet been identified in insects. In this paper, we report the results of purification and sequence analysis of a prothoracicostatic peptide (PTSP) from the larval brain of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, and its physiological functions. A racial hybrid, C145 × N140, of B. mori was used. Larvae were reared at 25 ± 1 °C under a photoperiodic regime of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness on a standard artificial diet (Nippon Nosan Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan). Larvae were selected by age. A sample was tested for the presence of prothoracicostatic activity by testing whether it inhibited ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the PG of larvae in an in vitro assay combined with ecdysteroid RIA. The bioassay was a modification of the method of Bollenbacher and Granger (14Bollenbacher W.E. Granger N. Kerkut G. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 7. 1985: 109-151Google Scholar). Briefly, the left and right PGs of a fifth instar B. mori larva were dissected and placed in Ringer's solution (0.75% NaCl, w/v). The left and right PGs were preincubated separately in 20 μl of Grace's insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) in a covered microtiter plate well at 26 °C for 30 min. The test sample was then added to the medium of the left PG. The left PG (“experimental” condition) and right PG (“control” condition) were further incubated in the covered microtiter plate wells at 26 °C for 3 h, at which time methanol was added to stop the ecdysone synthesis. The left and right PGs were removed from their respective media, and part of each medium was taken and lyophilized. The amount of ecdysteroids secreted by the PG into the medium was determined by ecdysteroid RIA as described below. An inhibition ratio was calculated for the left and right PGs of each larva with the formula, {1 − (amount of ecdysteroid in experimental/amount of ecdysteroid in control)} × 100. Student's t test was used to evaluate the significance of the difference in the biological response to the treatment. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The ecdysteroid RIA was performed as described by Takedaet al. (15Takeda S. Kiuchi M. Ueda S. Bull. Seric. Exp. Sta. 1986; 30: 361-374Google Scholar). The cross-reactivity ratio between ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone is 1:2.5 (15Takeda S. Kiuchi M. Ueda S. Bull. Seric. Exp. Sta. 1986; 30: 361-374Google Scholar). The results are expressed as ecdysone equivalents. Approximately 2,000 brains (100 brains/batch) were dissected from B. mori larvae on day 2 or 3 of the fifth instar and stored in a precooled 90:9:1 mixture of methanol/water/acetic acid. The brains were homogenized with an ultrasonicator at room temperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was re-extracted twice. The methanol in the supernatant was allowed to evaporate, and the remaining aqueous residue was re-extracted with the same volume of ethyl acetate andn-hexane as the aqueous residue, to remove the bulk of the lipids. After the organic solvent layer was decanted, the aqueous solution was diluted 5-fold with aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Diluted solution containing roughly 500 brains was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), which had previously been treated with acetonitrile/TFA and which had afterward been rinsed with aqueous 0.1% TFA. The cartridge was then eluted with 5 ml each of water and 13, 35, and 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Prothoracicostatic activity was detected in the 35% acetonitrile fraction. Four of these Sep-Pak separations were required to process all of the brain material. We isolated the prothoracicostatic peptide from the 35% acetonitrile fraction using a protocol which included four reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) procedures using a Hitachi HPLC L-7100 instrument (Hitachi, Hitachi City, Japan). In subsequent steps, an increasing number of brain equivalents (10, 15, 20, and 40 brain equivalents per PG in steps 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) was used in the assays due to loss of material during purification. Pegasil-300 octadecylsilyl column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Senshu Kagaku Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used. The 35% acetonitrile Sep-Pak fraction (2,000 brain equivalents) was evaporated to reduce the concentration of acetonitrile, diluted 5-fold with aqueous 0.1% TFA and then loaded onto the Pegasil-300 column through a pump. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% TFA over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and subjected to the in vitro bioassay. Prothoracicostatic activity was detected in Fraction 29, and this fraction was used for further purification. Vydac C4column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, The Separations Group, Inc., Hesperia, CA) was used. Pooled Fraction 29 from the first HPLC separation was dried to a small volume, dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1% TFA in water, and loaded onto the second column. The column was eluted with 15% acetonitrile for 5 min, followed by a gradient of 15–30% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over the next 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and each fraction was subjected to the in vitro bioassay. Prothoracicostatic activity was consistently detected in Fraction 11. Vydac C18column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, The Separations Group, Inc.) was used. Fraction 11 from the second HPLC separation was dried to a small volume, dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1% TFA in water, and loaded onto the third column. The column was eluted in a gradient of 15–30% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% TFA over 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected manually and assayed for prothoracicostatic activity. Vydac C4column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) was used. Prothoracicostatic material from the third step (the fraction between 24.6 and 25.8 min) was dried to a small volume, dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1% TFA in water and loaded onto the C4 column. The column was eluted in a gradient of 10–20% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% TFA over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Individual peaks were collected manually and assayed for prothoracicostatic activity. An aliquot of the purified peptide was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (Voyager Biospectrometry Workstations, PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). The acceleration voltage was set to 11.25 kV in the linear mode. A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in water/acetonitrile (6:4) was used as the matrix. The spectrum was the average of 256 single-shot spectra. An aliquot of the biologically active fraction (about 30 pmol) from the final HPLC separation was loaded onto a LF3000 Protein Sequencer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The amino acid sequence was analyzed by automated Edman degradation. A peptide of the C-terminal amide of Bom-PTSP was synthesized on a 9050 Plus Pepsynthesizer System (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions. The crude synthetic peptide was purified by HPLC to a purity exceeding 95%. One of the pair of PGs of a larva was incubated in medium containing various concentrations of the synthetic Bom-PTSP peptide, whereas the other PG was incubated in medium that lacked Bom-PTSP to study the inhibitory effect of Bom-PTSP on ecdysteroidogenesis. Recombinant Bombyx PTTH was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by the method described by Ishibashi et al. (16Ishibashi J. Kataoka H. Isogai A. Kawakami A. Saegusa H. Yagi Y. Mizoguchi A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5912-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which involves two ion exchange chromatography steps followed by reversed-phase HPLC. One of the pair of PGs of a larva was incubated in medium containing various concentrations of PTTH and synthetic Bom-PTSP peptide, whereas the other PG was incubated in medium that contained neither PTTH nor Bom-PTSP to study the effect of combined PTTH and Bom-PTSP treatment on ecdysteroidogenesis. Fractions that had been eluted with 35% acetonitrile from the C18 Sep-Pak cartridge showed strong prothoracicostatic activity in the in vitro bioassay, which was completely eliminated by Pronase treatment (data not shown); this indicated that the biological material is a peptide. Therefore, we combined these fractions and applied them to reversed-phase HPLC. In the first HPLC, prothoracicostatic activity was detected in Fraction 29 (28.4% acetonitrile) (Fig.1 A). The second and third HPLC runs each yielded one major peak with prothoracicostatic activity, in Fraction 11 (16.7% acetonitrile) and Fraction 26 (24.8 to 25.8 min, 23.4% acetonitrile), respectively (Fig. 1, B andC). A single, apparently homogeneous peak showing prothoracicostatic activity, which was eluted at 23.05 min with 15.7% acetonitrile, was manually collected from the final HPLC (Fig.1 D). This peptide with prothoracicostatic activity was named Bom-PTSP. The molecular mass of the purified peptide was determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Anm/z of 1089.78 ([M+H]+) was obtained. Automated Edman degradation of the purified peptide in a protein sequencer showed that its primary structure is a nonapeptide with the sequence Ala-Trp-Gln-Asp-Leu-Asn-Ser-Ala-Trp, which corresponds to a calculated m/z of 1089.50 ([M+H]+) for an amidated peptide. This agrees well with the mass analysis data. We calculated that the four-step purification protocol of the 2000 B. mori larval brains yielded approximately 200 pmol of pure Bom-PTSP. A synthetic peptide of Bom-PTSP was prepared as a C-terminal amide and purified by HPLC. That the synthesized peptide is identical with the native peptide was confirmed by coelution with the native peptide on RP-HPLC, automated Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. These results indicate that the amidated peptide is the naturally occurring form of the peptide inB. mori larvae (data not shown). Various concentrations of the synthetic peptide were subjected to thein vitro bioassay, and a dose response curve was constructed. As a quantitative measure of the level of prothoracicostatic activity, the prothoracicostatic effect of the peptide was expressed as an inhibition ratio, similar to the activation ratio used for in vitro PTTH measurement (14Bollenbacher W.E. Granger N. Kerkut G. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 7. 1985: 109-151Google Scholar). Bom-PTSP inhibited ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the PG in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2). A concentration of 1 × 10−10m of Bom-PTSP significantly inhibited ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the PG of day 8 fifth instar larvae, 1 day after spinning. Maximal inhibition (56%) was achieved with 1 × 10−7m Bom-PTSP, and half-maximal inhibition (which differs from 50% inhibition because ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the PG could not be completely inhibited) was reached at a concentration of approximately 5 × 10−9m. The level of prothoracicostatic activity of the synthetic peptide was equivalent to that of the purified natural product at each concentration as assessed by the in vitrobioassay, confirming that the synthetic and natural peptides are identical. The inhibitory effect of synthetic Bom-PTSP on ecdysteroid synthesis in PGs that were obtained from B. mori at different stages in the fifth instar (days 3, 5, 8, and 9), was studied. Activated PGs secreted a large amount of ecdysone and were more sensitive to Bom-PTSP than the PGs of larvae in the feeding stage. That is, Bom-PTSP at a concentration of between 1 × 10−9 and 1 × 10−7msignificantly inhibited ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG of larvae in the spinning stage (days 8 and 9) (up to 70% inhibition), whereas Bom-PTSP at a concentration of 1 × 10−7m significantly inhibited ecdysone biosynthesis in the PG of larvae in the feeding stage (days 3 and 5) (Fig.3). The combined effect of synthetic Bom-PTSP and recombinant Bombyx PTTH on ecdysteroid synthesis in the PG was examined. PGs were dissected from day 3 fifth instar larvae. The PGs of a larva were preincubated in Grace's medium for 30 min and then transferred to fresh medium containing Bom-PTSP (1 × 10−7m) and/or PTTH (1 × 10−9m) for further incubation for 3 h. PTTH significantly up-regulated ecdysone production in PGs (1.16 ± 0.41 ng/PG for experimental; 0.05 ± 0.02 ng/PG for controls). Bom-PTSP did not significantly reduce ecdysone production when applied alone (0.02 ± 0.01 ng/PG for experimental; 0.03 ± 0.01 ng/PG for controls). In the presence of both PTTH and Bom-PTSP, however, the level of ecdysone production in PGs was nearly the same as that in the controls (0.05 ± 0.03 ng/PG for experimental; 0.04 ± 0.01 ng/PG for controls) (Fig.4). These data indicate that Bom-PTSP and PTTH have opposing effects on ecdysteroidogenesis.

Bom-PTSP, a neuropeptide that inhibits ecdysteroidogenesis in the PG of B. mori, was isolated from 2,000 B. morilarval brains using a protocol that included four RP-HPLC procedures. The results of a sequence homology search indicated that Bom-PTSP does not have sequence similarity with the molt-inhibiting hormones of crustaceans (13Chung J.S. Wilkinson M.C. Webster S.G. Neuropept. 1996; 30: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) nor with Neb-TMOF, a prothoracicostatic peptide that had been isolated from the ovary of the gray fleshfly, N. bullata (17Bylemans D. Borovsky D. Hunt D.F. Shabanowitz J. Grauwels L. De Loof A. Regul. Pept. 1994; 50: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To our surprise, Bom-PTSP has the same amino acid sequence as Mas-MIP I, a myoinhibitory peptide that was isolated from the nerve cord of the adult tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta(18Blackburn M.B. Wagner R.M. Kochansky J.P. Harrison D.J. Thomas- Laemont P. Raina A.K. Regul. Pept. 1995; 57: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and is highly homologous to Lom-MIP, the first insect peptide of the MIP family that was isolated from Locusta migratoria(19Schoofs L. Holman G.M. Hayas T.K. Nachman R.J. De Loof A. Regul. Pept. 1991; 36: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When applied to isolated ilea (anterior hindgut) of adultM. sexta, Mas-MIP I reduces the rate of peristalsis entirely. Therefore, it was suggested that Mas-MIP plays a role in increasing the transit time of the gut content, as well as in digestive processes or excretion (18Blackburn M.B. Wagner R.M. Kochansky J.P. Harrison D.J. Thomas- Laemont P. Raina A.K. Regul. Pept. 1995; 57: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the effect of Mas-MIP I on ecdysteroidogenesis in M. sexta has not been reported, and no additional information on the cellular localization of Mas-MIP I is available. Bom-PTSP also shows high sequence homology with a group of allatostatins, Grb-AST-B (Fig. 5). Grb-AST-B that were isolated from the brain of the adult cricket,G. bimaculatus, inhibit juvenile hormone biosynthesis (20Lorenz M.W. Kellner R. Hoffmann K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21103-21108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Grb-AST-B1 of G. bimaculatus has been shown to inhibit ovarian ecdysteroidogenesis in an in vitro study (21Lorenz J.I. Lorenz M.W. Hoffman K.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1997; 94: 369-379Google Scholar) and to decrease the ecdysteroid titer in an in vivo study (12Lorenz M.W. Lorenz J.I. Treiblmayr K. Hoffmann K.-H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 38: 32-43Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar); this evidence indicates that this peptide is multifunctional inG. bimaculatus. Bom-PTSP also shares sequence similarity with the highly conserved N-terminal region of galanins (Refs. 22Bersani M. Johnsen A.H. Hojrup P. Dunning B.E. Andereasen J.J. Hoplst J.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and23Tatemoto K. Rökaeus Å. Jörnvall H. McDonald T.J. Mutt V. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar and Fig. 5), a family of vertebrate neuropeptides that has an inhibitory and hyperpolarizing action on numerous hormone-secreting cells (24López F.J.

Galanin has been shown to inhibit corticosterone secretion after injection into the paraventricular nucleus (25Tempel D.L. Leibowits S.F. Brain Res. 1990; 88: 353-357Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that a galanin-like neuropeptide is involved in suppressing steroidogenesis in insects. The physiological role that Bom-PTSP plays in controlling insect development is not yet clear. We demonstrated that Bom-PTSP inhibits ecdysteroidogenesis, and this suggests that this peptide plays a role in decreasing the ecdysteroid titer that is responsible for controlling insect development. PTTH significantly enhanced ecdysteroidogenesis in the PG of day 3 fifth instar larvae in vitro, whereas Bom-PTSP almost completely inhibited PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroid biosynthesis (Fig. 4). This suggests that Bom-PTSP may play a role in keeping the ecdysteroid titer low in larvae during the feeding stage. Bom-PTSP inhibited ecdysteroidogenesis in the PG of larvae in the spinning stage to a greater extent than in the PG of larvae in the feeding stage (Fig. 3), which suggests that Bom-PTSP plays a role in PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis rather than in basal ecdysteroidogenesis. Therefore, this peptide may be involved in shutting down ecdysteroid biosynthesis. The biosynthesis and release of ecdysone are mainly controlled by PTTH in insects (3Kawakami A. Kataoka H. Oka T. Mizoguchi A. Kimura-Kawakami M. Adachi T. Iwami M. Nagasawa H. Suzuki A. Ishizaki H. Science. 1990; 247: 1333-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and by molt-inhibiting hormone in crustaceans (13Chung J.S. Wilkinson M.C. Webster S.G. Neuropept. 1996; 30: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our discovery of Bom-PTSP provides a new perspective on the regulation of the biosynthesis and release of ecdysteroids and raises an important question as to the functional relationship between Bom-PTSP and PTTH. Our results, however, strongly support our working hypothesis that both activating and inhibiting factors are involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis and release of ecdysteroids in insects. The integration of these opposing factors in steroidogenic tissue leads to the complex secretory pattern observed in vivo. We thank Professor J. Koolman (Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Phillips-University Marburg, Germany) for reading the manuscript critically and Drs. J. Ishibashi and H. Saito (National Institute of Sericultural and Entomological Science, Japan) for technical support with the peptide analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2147000895,"The magnetotelluric component of the Mantle Electromagnetic and Tomography (MELT) Experiment measured the electrical resistivity structure of the mantle beneath the fast-spreading southern East Pacific Rise (EPR). The data reveal an asymmetric resistivity structure, with lower resistivity to the west of the ridge. The uppermost 100 kilometers of mantle immediately to the east of the ridge is consistent with a dry olivine resistivity structure indicating a mantle depleted of melt and volatiles. Mantle resistivities to the west of the ridge are consistent with a low-melt fraction (about 1 to 2 percent interconnected melt) distributed over a broad region and extending to depths of about 150 kilometers. The asymmetry in resistivity structure may be the result of asymmetric spreading rates and a westward migration of the ridge axis and suggests distinct styles of melt formation and delivery in the mantle beneath the two plates."

Sequence analysis has revealed that the NH2 terminus of ATM contains an LXCXE motif (amino acids 115–119) (Fig. 1 a). We therefore investigated whether ATM also interacts with HDAC1. We have now shown that the two proteins indeed interact both in vitro and in vivo and that the extent of the association in vivo is increased by exposure of the cells to ionizing radiation. Human normal (MRC5CV1) and AT (AT5BIVA, AT4BIVA, and AT3BIVA) fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to 20 Gy of γ-radiation (J. L. Shepherd Mark I Radiator) with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 3.83 Gy min−1 and were harvested at various intervals thereafter. An expression vector encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing residues 1–300 of ATM (GST-ATM(1–300)) was generated by inserting the corresponding polymerase chain reaction-generatedBamHI-EcoRI fragment of human ATM cDNA (2Savitsky K.

A cDNA encoding a mutant fusion protein (GST-ATM(C117F)) in which Cys117 of the LXCXE motif of ATM was replaced by phenylalanine was generated from GST-ATM(1–300) cDNA with the use of a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

After extensive washing of the beads, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and either autoradiography or immunoblot analysis with antibodies to HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (5Lee S.J. Dimtchev A. Lavin M.F. Dritschilo A. Jung M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the concentration of protein was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The extracts (1 mg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies to HDAC1 in a final volume of 20 μl of TNN buffer. After the addition of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (5Lee S.J.

[3H]Acetyllysine-labeled histones were isolated from HeLa cells as described (29Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the labeled histones (12,000 cpm) in a final volume of 100 μl containing HDAC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). The reaction was then terminated, and released acetate was assayed. Assays were also performed with precipitates of nuclear extracts prepared with either GST fusion protein-coated beads or antibodies to ATM (Calbiochem); the beads and immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40) before the assay. All samples were assayed in duplicate. To investigate whether ATM interacts with HDAC1, we performedin vitro protein-protein binding assays. In vitrotranslated 35S-labeled HDAC1 was incubated with beads coated with a bacterially produced GST fusion protein containing residues 1–300 of ATM. Beads coated with GST or with a GST fusion protein containing the NF-κB inhibitor protein IκBα were used as controls. The 35S-labeled HDAC1 bound to the beads coated with GST-ATM(1–300) but not to those coated with GST or GST-IκBα (Fig. 1 b). To assess further the specificity of this interaction, we generated the mutant protein GST-ATM(C117F), in which Cys117 of the LXCXE motif of ATM was replaced by phenylalanine with the use of site-directed mutagenesis (24Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The extent of the interaction of GST-ATM(C117F) with HDAC1 was greatly reduced relative to that observed with GST-ATM(1–300). The electrophoretic mobilities of the wild-type and mutant GST-ATM proteins differed slightly, possibly because of a conformational change induced by the mutation. Together, these data suggest that the LXCXE motif of ATM is required for binding of the protein to HDAC1. We next determined whether the interaction between ATM and HDAC1 contributes to the cellular response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. Normal human fibroblasts (MRC5CV1) were exposed to 20 Gy of γ-radiation, and after various intervals, nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to the in vitro binding assay with beads coated with GST-ATM(1–300). Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to HDAC1 of proteins that bound to the beads revealed that HDAC1 present in the nuclear extracts bound to GST-ATM(1–300) (Fig.2 a). The amount of HDAC1 bound to GST-ATM(1–300) was maximal 30 min after irradiation and then gradually decreased to basal levels over the next ∼3 h. HDAC1 in nuclear extracts did not bind to beads coated with GST alone (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates prepared from the nuclear extracts with antibodies to HDAC1 also contained ATM (Fig. 2 b). The amount of ATM present in the immunoprecipitates was maximal between 30 and 60 min after irradiation and had returned to basal levels by 3 h. The amount of HDAC1 in the immunoprecipitates was not substantially affected by ionizing radiation. The interaction between ATM and HDAC1 was not detected by immunoprecipitation analysis in AT5BIVA (Fig.2 c) or in AT3BIVA or AT4BIVA (data not shown) cell lines, all of which are derived from AT patients; these cells express HDAC1 at levels similar to MRC5CV1 cells (Fig. 2 d). Immunoprecipitates obtained from MRC5CV1 cells with antibodies to IgG as a control did not contain ATM (data not shown). These results demonstrate that ATM associates with HDAC1 in vivo and that the extent of this association is increased by exposure of cells to ionizing radiation. The ATM-like proteins pAF400, Tra1, and TRRAP associate with histone acetylase protein complexes (14Vassilev A. Yamauchi J. Kotani T. Prives C. Avantaggiati M.L. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Mol.

To investigate the effect of ionizing radiation on histone acetylase and deacetylase activities, we first monitored the amount of acetylated histone H4, by immunoblot analysis of acid-soluble proteins after irradiation of MRC5CV1 cells. The abundance of acetylated histone H4 was reduced by 80 and 91% at 30 and 60 min after irradiation before recovering to 47% of pretreatment levels at 3 h (Fig.3 a). Equal loading was confirmed by Ponceau staining of the membrane (data not shown). In contrast, the amount of acetylated histone H4 was markedly increased by treating cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We also measured the effect of ionizing radiation on histone deacetylase activity in both MRC5CV1 and AT cells. The amount of deacetylase activity in MRC5CV1 cells was increased within 30 min of irradiation and thereafter gradually decreased to basal levels by 3 h after treatment (Fig. 3 b). The deacetylase activity of AT5BIVA cells was not affected by ionizing radiation. Thus, the radiation-induced decrease in the amount of acetylated histone H4 correlated with the increase in deacetylase activity in MRC5CV1 cells. To determine whether the HDAC1 associated with ATM exhibits histone deacetylase activity, we incubated nuclear extracts of MRC5CV1 cells with beads coated with GST-ATM(1–300) and then assayed the bead-associated proteins for deacetylase activity. Such beads showed a high level of deacetylase activity, which was inhibited by treatment with TSA (Fig. 4 a). Beads coated with GST, GST-IκBα, or GST-ATM(C117F) retained much less histone deacetylase activity after incubation with MRC5CV1 nuclear extracts than did GST-ATM(1–300)-coated beads. Furthermore, the amount of ATM-associated histone deacetylase activity was increased 30 min after exposure of MRC5CV1 cells to ionizing radiation, as revealed by GST-ATM(1–300) precipitation and immunoprecipitation assays (Fig.4 b); immunoprecipitates prepared with an irrelevant antibody did not exhibit histone deacetylase activity (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate that ATM associates with HDAC1in vivo, that the resulting complex exhibits histone deacetylase activity, and that the extent of this association is increased in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Although whether the mechanism by which ATM affects the acetylation state of the histone is related to chromatin is the subject of further investigations, the present results reveal a new role for ATM in the cellular response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. Our data with AT cells indicate that mutations in the ATM gene affect the interaction between ATM and HDAC1 and thereby prevent the increase in histone deactylase activity apparent in normal cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. This observation is consistent with previous studies (6Oleinick N.L. Balasubramaniam U. Xue L. Chiu S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Guo C.Y.

Therefore, it is also possible that AT cells show an increased susceptibility to radiation-induced DNA damage because of the dysfunction of ATM as a regulator of DNA packaging into chromatin and a monitor of chromosomal integrity.

Site 1 (CCPs 1–3) alone mediated the decay acceleration of the classical and alternative pathway C3 convertases.

This interaction involves CR1 on the uninfected cells and varies with expression of CR1-related blood group antigens. The complement cascade requires stringent control. The C3 and C5 convertases are inhibited by proteins encoded by the regulators of complement activation (RCA) gene family (17Liszewski M.K. Farries T.C. Lublin D.M. Rooney I.A. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 201-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor H and C4b binding protein are fluid phase regulators present in plasma, whereas membrane cofactor protein (CD46) and decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) are ubiquitously expressed membrane inhibitors. RCA proteins accelerate the dissociation of C3 and C5 convertases (decay accelerating activity (DAA)) and/or serve as cofactors for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b (cofactor activity (CA)). CR1 is the most versatile member of this group. It possesses DAA and CA and inhibits C3 and C5 convertases of both the classical and alternative pathways (CP and AP, respectively). Moreover, it is unique among the cofactor proteins in that through its cofactor activity it generates C3d, which serves as a ligand for complement receptor type 2. A recombinant, soluble form of CR1 (sCR1) inhibits self-destructive C activation in immune complex-mediated syndromes, ischemia/reperfusion injury (18Weisman H.F. Bartow T. Leppo M.K. Marsh Jr., H.C.

Like all members of the RCA family, CR1 is composed of the ∼60-amino acid-long repeating units called complement control protein repeats (CCPs) or short consensus repeats. Of the 30 CCPs in CR1, the first 28 can be organized, based on internal homology, into four long homologous repeats (LHRs), A–D, each composed of seven CCPs (21Klickstein L.B. Wong W.W. Smith J.A.

The amino acid sequences of CCPs 1 and 2 are 39% different from their counterparts in site 2 (CCPs 8 and 9 or CCPs 15 and 16). On the other hand, the amino acid sequences of the third CCP in each site (CCPs 3, 10, and 17) are nearly identical. Consequently, variation in the initial two CCPs determines the functional differences between the sites. Using homologous substitution mutagenesis, amino acids important for ligand binding and for CA in site 1 and in site 2 were identified (24Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In this investigation, our goal was to localize site(s) for DAA and to identify peptides and amino acids critical for this regulatory activity. All constructs were expressed as secreted proteins and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (27Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were then assessed for iC3/C4b binding ability and for DAA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were subcloned in vector pCR™II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), sequenced, and cut with the appropriate enzyme for cloning in the expression vector to generate the constructs shown in Fig. 1. Amino acid substitutions were made by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) without subcloning. LHR A contains CCPs 1–7 (i.e. amino acids 1–449 (27Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol.

ΔCCP 3, lacking amino acids 123–194, was produced from LHR A by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the Double Take™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). CR1-4(8,9), described earlier (27Krych M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was derived from CR1–4 (CCP 1–8 and one-half of CCP 9) by changing amino acids of CCPs 1 and 2 to those of CCPs 8 and 9, respectively. LHR B was then generated by converting CCP 3 to CCP 10 (mutation T132A) and by replacing Gly450 (the fourth position downstream of the last Cys in CCP 7) with a stop codon (28Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since CCPs 4–7 are identical to CCPs 11–14, the protein encoded by this cDNA is identical to CCPs 8–14 (i.e. LHR B (residues 451–899)). The construction of LHR C, which contains CCPs 15–21, (i.e. amino acids 898–1353) has been described (28Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). LHR D+ (amino acids 1348–1928) contains LHR D (CCPs 22–28) followed by CCPs 29 and 30. CR1 cDNA in AprM8 obtained from Lloyd Klickstein (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) served as a template for PCR amplification of the signal peptide and of LHR D+. The 5′-primer for amplification of the signal peptide, ATATACAGATCTATGGGAGCCTCTTCTCCAAGA, contains aBglII site (underlined) for cloning into pSG5. The 3′-primer, CGGATCCCCATGCAACAGGCAGTGCAAGCAGCACCACAACTGCTAGCAGA, destroys an internal BamHI site by a silent mutation and generates the terminal BamHI site (underlined) by another silent mutation for ligation to LHR D+. Six more silent mutations interrupt GC-rich stretches. The 5′-primer for the amplification of LHR D+, ACATAGGATCCGTTCGTGCTGGTC, incorporates codons for six out of eight amino acids between the last Cys of CCP 21 and the first Cys of CCP 22. The BamHI site (underlined) was created by a silent mutation for ligation to the signal peptide. The 3′-primer for amplification of LHR D+, TATATAAGATCTTTATGCACGAGAGGTACATTT, replaces His1929 (the fifth position downstream of the last Cys in CCP 30) with a stop codon followed by a BglII site (underlined) for cloning into pSG5. Each PCR product was cut from pCR™II vector with BamHI and BglII. The signal peptide and LHR D+ were then ligated through theBamHI site, and the ligation product was cloned into theBglII site of pSG5. The sequence of LHR D+contained an ATT coding for Ile1835 instead of the reported ACT coding for Thr1835 (21Klickstein L.B. Wong W.W. Smith J.A. Weis J.H. Wilson J.G. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1095-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). ATT was present in the PCR product and in the original template. LHR A in CR1-4 and LHR B in CR1-4(8,9) are followed by CCP 8 (identical to CCP 15) and the first half of CCP 9 (identical to the homologous part of CCP 16). The latter contains a unique PflMI site. CR1-4 and CR1-4(8,9) were linearized at this site to generate the amino-terminal portion of LHR AC and LHR BC, respectively, extending to the PflMI site in CCP 16. The remaining part of LHR C, namely to the end of CCP 21, was amplified using CR1 cDNA as a template. The 5′-primer, GATCCAGTGAATGGCATGG, includes a PflMI site (underlined) in CCP 16. The 3′-primer,CCATTCACTGGTTAACCAGCACGAACAGAAAGTTC, replaces Gly1353 (the seventh position downstream of the last Cys of CCP 21) with a stop codon followed by a PflMI site (underlined). The PCR product, cut from pCRTMII withPflMI, was ligated to PflMI-linearized CR1-4 and to CR1-4(8,9), generating LHR AC and LHR BC, respectively. CR1-4 was used as a template for the PCR amplification of CCPs 1–4. The 5′-primer, ATATAGATCTCAGGTCATTGTTCCA, contains a BglII site (underlined) for cloning into pSG5. The 3′-primer, ATATATCCTAGGCGTGAGCAGCTTGGTAG, anneals to the end of CCP 4 and includes amino acids 253 and 254 after the last Cys of CCP 4. The AvrII site (underlined), generated by two silent mutations, facilitated ligation to CCP 15. LHR C served as a template for the PCR amplification of CCP 15–18. The 5′-primer, CGCTGTGGAATCCTAGGTCACTGTCAAGCCCCA, includes amino acids 899–901 preceding the first Cys of CCP 15. The AvrII site (underlined) was created by two silent mutations for ligation to CCP 4. The 3′-primer, CTAGTCGTAAGATCTTTACCTGGAGCAGCTTGG, replaces Val1155 (the third position after the last Cys in CCP 18) with a stop codon and contains a BglII site (underlined). The two PCR products were cut from pCR™II with BglII andAvrII. CCP 15–18 was then ligated to CCP 1–4 through theAvrII site, generating a cDNA for the construct CCP 1–4,15–18. CCP 1–4,15–21 (amino acids 1–254 followed by amino acids 899–1353) was constructed by deleting CCP 5–7 from LHR AC. This was accomplished by replacing the sequence between the two HindIII sites in LHR AC, one in CCP 4 and the other in CCP 18, with the sequence present between the same HindIII sites in CCP 1–4,15–18. The strategy for homologous substitution mutagenesis in CCPs 1 and 2 has been described (28Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and is summarized in Fig. 4. The new mutants, 13a–d, 9a, 9b, 6c, and 10a11c, are derived from LHR A and are in the expression vector pSG5. The other mutants represented in Fig. 4 have been described (24Krych M. Hourcade D.

Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To generate C3b dimers, C3 (2 mg) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7 was treated with 20 μg of trypsin (Sigma) for 3 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cross-linking through the free sulfhydryl group generated by breaking the thioester bond was then performed for 3 days at 4 °C using 15 μl of 0.34 mmbismaleimidohexane (Pierce) dissolved in methanol. With this procedure, the yield was over 50%. If, however, as recommended by the manufacturer, bismaleimidohexane was dissolved in Me2SO, the yield of C3b dimers did not exceed 10%. The dimers were purified by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK 4000SW column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The dimers were 95% pure based on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Plasmids containing cDNAs encoding CR1 derivatives were transfected into COS 7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, the cells were washed and incubated in Opti-MEM I medium in the absence of serum to avoid possible DAA from the C4b binding protein and factor H in bovine serum. After a 2- or 3-day incubation, supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Protein levels were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (27Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D.

Instead of reporting the fraction of a CR1 derivative that bound to iC3- or C4b-Sepharose, binding of the mutant proteins was expressed relative to the parental protein LHR A. A 100% value was assigned to the fraction of LHR A that bound to C4b- or iC3-Sepharose. Alternative pathway factors B, D, and P; classical complement pathway components C1, C2, C4, and C3; terminal components C5–C9; and antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA) were obtained from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). The assay was performed in isotonic veronal-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm veronal (pH 7.35), 71 mmNaCl, 139 mm dextrose, 0.15 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% gelatin (DGVB2+) (31Cervoni F. Oglesby T.J. Fenichel P. Dohr G. Rossi B. Atkinson J.P. Hsi B.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 939-948PubMed Google Scholar). Three ml of washed EA (2.5 × 108/ml) were incubated with C1 (6 μg diluted in 3 ml) at 30 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 3 ml of DGVB2+, and 10 μg of C4 in 1.5 ml of buffer was added. After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended to 3 ml. One ml of these EAC14 cells was incubated with 0.5 μg of C2 diluted in 1 ml for 4 min at room temperature. To prepare the C5 convertase, EAC14 cells were incubated with 0.5 μg of C2 and with 10 μg of C3 at room temperature for 4 min. The resulting EAC142 or EAC1423 cells were centrifuged, washed, resuspended in 1 ml, and used to assess DAA for the C3 convertase or the C5 convertase, respectively. Specifically, EAC142 cells (50 μl) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 50 μl of an inhibitor or with buffer and transferred to ice, and then 0.5 ml of C′-EDTA (a 20-fold dilution of guinea pig serum (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO) in 40 mm EDTA containing veronal buffered saline) was added. In the modified assay, C′-EDTA was replaced with 0.5 ml of buffer containing 500 ng of each terminal component (C5–C9), with or without C3. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C and centrifugation, the OD of the supernatant was read at 414 nm. The convertase was assembled using purified components (32Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19716-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). EAC14 cells (0.5 ml), prepared as above but at a concentration of 1.5 × 109/ml, were incubated with 0.225 μg of C2 and 50 μg of C3 for 30 min at 30 °C. After washing and resuspending in veronal-buffered saline containing 128 mmNaCl, 4.5 mm veronal (pH 7.35), 0.1% gelatin, and 10 mm Na2-EDTA, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to allow dissociation of C1 and C2. The resulting EAC43 cells were washed twice with the above buffer; washed twice with buffer (Mg2+-EGTA) containing 10 mmNa2-EGTA, 7 mm MgCl2, 115 mm dextrose, 0.83% gelatin, 59 mm NaCl, and 4.2 mm veronal (pH 7.35); and then resuspended in 6 ml of the same buffer. EAC43 cells (100 μl) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 5 ng of factor D, 45 ng of properdin, 1.5 ng of factor B, and 75 μl of inhibitor or Mg2+-EGTA. After adding 0.3 ml of C′-EDTA, hemolysis was estimated as for the classical pathway. In the modified assay, C′-EDTA was replaced with 300 μl of buffer containing 300 ng of each terminal component (C5–C9) with or without C3. For the C3 convertase decay accelerating assay (33Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Medof M.E. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), microtiter plates were coated overnight with 5 μg/ml C3b (Advanced Research Technologies) in phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Plates were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 ng of factor B, 1 ng of factor D, and 0.8 mm NiCl2 in 2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.4, containing 71 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20. Using this same buffer, sequential 1-h incubations were performed with 1–10 ng of a CR1 derivative, 0.129 μg of goat anti-human factor B antibody (Incstar, Stillwater, MN), and 100 μl of a 1:15,000 dilution of anti-goat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Color was developed withO-phenylenediamine. In this assay, DAF and factor H behave as expected as mediators of decay accelerating activity (see Ref. 33Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Medof M.E. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and we have detected C3a release using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech C3a des-Arg RIA kit. 2M. Krych-Goldberg, R. E. Hauhart, and J. P. Atkinson, unpublished data. For the C5 convertase assay, microtiter wells were coated (as above) with C3b dimers at 5 μg/ml. The assay was performed under conditions similar to those used for the C3 convertase except that the amounts of factor B and D were 20 and 2 ng, respectively. Characterization of the structural requirements for DAA proceeded in three steps: first, identification of the required LHR(s); second, localization of the necessary CCPs within an LHR; and, third, determination of critical peptides and individual amino acids within CCPs. DAA was analyzed for the CP and AP C3 and C5 convertases, and the activity of the constructs (illustrated in Fig.1) was compared. A hemolytic assay was employed in which the CP C3 convertase was formed using purified components, and the lytic sites were developed with C′-EDTA. The main site of DAA for the CP C3 convertase was in LHR A (Table I), which had 60% of the activity of sCR1. LHR B or C had approximately 110 the activity of sCR1. LHR D+ lacked detectable DAA.Table IDecay accelerating activity for the classical pathway C3 convertaseCR1 derivativeInhibitionaA dose-response curve was performed with sCR1 and with each derivative. 100% inhibition was assigned to sCR1.

Cellular intermediates were prepared using purified C1, C4, and C2, and lytic sites were developed with C′-EDTA. In contrast, if DAA for the AP was assessed by a similar hemolytic assay, LHR A had only 0.5% of the activity of sCR1 (TableII), while LHRs B, C, and D+had no detectable activity (even if the molar concentration of these proteins was 100-fold higher than sCR1). Mixing LHR A with LHR B or D+ did not result in activity above that of LHR A alone. These results were surprising because it was expected that, as for the CP C3 convertase, a single LHR would be capable of dissociating the AP C3 convertase. To further assess this issue, constructs bearing more than one LHR were evaluated (Table III). While LHR BC had barely detectable activity, LHR AC had DAA equal to 50% of the DAA of sCR1.Table IIDecay accelerating activity for the alternative pathway convertase in a hemolytic assayCR1 derivativeInhibitionaA dose-response curve was performed with sCR1 and with each derivative. 100% inhibition was assigned to sCR1.

https://openalex.org/W2049628560,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), frequently co-participants in inflammatory states, are two well recognized inhibitors of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Previous reports have concluded that the inhibitory effects of these two autacoids on pancreatic β cell function are not related because indomethacin, a potent prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, does not prevent IL-1β effects. However, indomethacin is not a specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and its other pharmacologic effects are likely to inhibit insulin secretion independently. Since we recently observed that IL-1β induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression and PGE2 synthesis in islet β cells, we have reassessed the possibility that PGE2 mediates IL-1β effects on β function. By using two cell lines (HIT-T15 and βHC13) as well as Wistar rat isolated pancreatic islets, we examined the ability of two COX-2-specific antagonists, NS-398 and SC-236, to prevent IL-1β inhibition of insulin secretion. Both drugs prevented IL-1β from inducing PGE2 synthesis and inhibiting insulin secretion; adding back exogenous PGE2 re-established inhibition of insulin secretion in the presence of IL-1β. We also found that EP3, the PGE2 receptor subtype whose post-receptor effect is to decrease adenylyl cyclase activity and, thereby, insulin secretion, is the dominant mRNA subtype expressed. We conclude that endogenous PGE2 mediates the inhibitory effects of exogenous IL-1β on β cell function.

These findings have been reinforced by studies in which inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, hence PGE2 synthesis, have augmented glucose-induced insulin secretion. The only discordant result in the latter category of studies has been observed when indomethacin was used as the cyclooxygenase inhibitor. This discrepant result can be attributed to other effects of indomethacin that would be expected to inhibit insulin secretion through adverse effects on exocytosis that are unrelated to its effects on prostaglandin synthesis (12Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 231-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). prostaglandin E2 Hank's balanced salt solution fetal bovine serum interleukin cyclooxygenase-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine 6-carboxyfluorescein Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been reported to have major inhibitory effects on β cell function, especially under conditions of high glucose concentrations and prolonged exposure to this cytokine (13Eizirik D.L.

This is an especially relevant observation because many reports suggest that IL-1β is an important force in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (17Helqvist S. Dan. Med. Bull. 1994; 41: 151-166PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Previously, studies have concluded that endogenous PGE2 does not play a participatory role in the adverse effects of IL-1β on β cell function (5Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6Sjoholm A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ironically, however, the drug that was chosen to test this hypothesis and found not to reverse IL-1β inhibitory effects on insulin secretion was indomethacin, which itself has independent inhibitory actions on β cell exocytosis (12Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 231-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been appreciated that the pancreatic islet, and β cells in particular, constitutively and dominantly express cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) rather than COX-1, a situation just the opposite of most mammalian cells (19Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Additionally, new drugs have become available that specifically inhibit COX-2 and consequently have replaced indomethacin as the model drug to examine the consequences of inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis (20Gierse J.K.

These new developments prompted us to re-examine the possible interrelationships between PGE2 and IL-1β as inhibitors of insulin secretion. Specifically, we asked the following: 1) whether IL-1β inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion comparably in β cell lines and isolated islets; 2) whether IL-1β effects on insulin secretion can be prevented by pretreatment of cells and islets with specific inhibitors of COX-2 activity; and 3) whether the dominant PGE2 receptor subtype in islets is one whose post-receptor action is likely to inhibit insulin secretion. We have found that two structurally unrelated specific inhibitors of COX-2 activity and PGE2 synthesis (NS-398 and SC-236) prevent IL-1β-induced inhibition of insulin secretion in β cell lines and isolated islets and that these preparations dominantly express the EP3 receptor subtype mRNA whose protein product would be predicted to decrease adenylyl cyclase activity and insulin secretion. HIT-T15 cells (passages 70–80) were grown in 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C, maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 11.1 mm glucose as described previously (22Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). βHC13 cells (passages 33–42) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 22.2 mm glucose. Before experiments, cells were subcultured in either RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% FBS, 0.2 mm glucose for 24 h. Pancreata from male Wistar rats were infused with 10 ml of a 0.09% collagenase type V (Sigma), 1% FBS, and 2 units/ml RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), pH 7.38. After surgical removal, the pancreas was incubated in the collagenase/HBSS solution for 20 min at 37 °C and then shaken for 15 min. Undigested tissue was removed using a 500-μm screen, and the recovered tissue was washed twice with ice-cold HBSS followed by centrifugation at 250 × gfor 4 min. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 35% bovine serum albumin, and islets were separated using a dextran gradient. Static insulin secretion in response to glucose was evaluated by plating cells (106cells per well) in a 12-well plate using medium containing 10% FBS (11.1 mm glucose for HIT cells and 22.2 mmglucose for βHC cells). The following day, cells were subcultured for 24 h in medium containing 0.2% FBS and IL-1β with or without drug (experimental medium). After the 24-h exposure to experimental medium, cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB (22Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) containing IL-1β with or without drug for 2 h at 37 °C to measure insulin secretion. Islets were exposed to experimental medium for 24 h beginning the day after isolation, and the static incubation was performed the following day for a duration of 1 h. Insulin levels in the KRB buffer samples collected from the static incubations with cells and islets were measured by either radioimmunoassay as described previously (22Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or by using a Sensitive Rat Insulin RIA kit (Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO). PGE2 levels present in KRB buffer collected after the static incubations were measured using an enzyme immunoassay obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was extracted according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). One-step RT-PCR was carried out using the Gold RT-PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer and an ABI Prism 770 sequence detector equipped with a thermocycler (Taqman™ technology) and a cooled CCD camera to detect fluorescence emission over a range of wavelengths (500–650 nm). Briefly, reverse transcription was first performed using specific oligonucleotides and the Multiscribe™ reverse transcriptase at 48 °C for 30 min. Samples were then PCR-amplified using GoldTaq™ polymerase and oligonucleotide primers for COX-2 , COX-1, EP3, and GAPDH (control for RNA quantity) described below for 40 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The Taqman™ technology used is based on the emission of a fluorescent signal from a reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein, FAM) linked to a quencher dye (6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine, TAMRA) and annealed to the template between both primers. Upon extension of the primers during PCR, the exonuclease activity of the polymerase releases the reporter dye from the quencher resulting in fluorescence emission. The emitted signal is detected over a range of wavelengths for each reaction at each cycle. This allows a complete curve of amplification over the course of 40 cycles to be established and the analysis to be carried out solely within the exponential range of amplification. Comparative analysis is then based upon the cycle number at which a significant increase in the amplification signal above base line is detected. Primer and probe sequences (5′-3′) are as follows:COX-1 probe, 6FAM-CCGCTTTGGCCTCGACAACTACCAGT-TAMRA;COX-1 forward primer, GCCAGAACCAGGGTGTCTGT; COX-1reverse primer, GTAGCCCGTGCGAGTACAATC; COX-2 probe, 6FAM-TCCATGGCCCAGTCCTCGGGT-TAMRA; COX-2 forward primer, CCAGCACTTCACCCATCAGTT; COX-2 reverse primer, AAGGCGCAGTTTATGTTGTCTGT; rat EP3 receptor probe, 6FAM-CCTAATCGCCGTTCGCCTGGC-TAMRA; rat EP3 receptor forward primer, AAAGGAGAAGGAGTGCAATTCCT; rat EP3 receptor reverse primer, AGGGATCCAAGATCTGGTTCAG; rat EP1 receptor probe, 6FAM-CAGGCCATGTGATCCCGGGC-TAMRA; rat EP1 receptor forward primer, CCTGCTTGCCATCGACCTA; rat EP1 receptor reverse primer, CAGTATACAGGCGAAGCACCAA; rat EP2 receptor probe, 6FAM-CGCACTGAGTGAGAAGAGACTGATGGCTG-TAMRA; rat EP2 receptor forward primer, CGGCAAAGGCTTGACAAGTT; rat EP2 receptor reverse primer, GCCTCAGTCGTTCTGGACCTA; rat EP4 receptor probe, 6FAM-TCTTGCCTCCGAGGCTGCTTTCAG-TAMRA; rat EP4 receptor forward primer, CCCTCCTATACCTGCCAGACCTA; rat EP4receptor reverse primer, CATGCGTACCTGGAAGCAAA. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. when applicable. Statistical comparisons were performed using analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post hoc test with a p < 0.05 considered as significant. The materials used were as follows: recombinant human IL-1β from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; PGE2, NS-398 from Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA; SC-236 from Monsanto Searle Co., Skokie, IL; and RT-PCR probes and primers from Perkin-Elmer. To determine the maximal effective concentration of IL-1β required to inhibit insulin secretion, HIT-T15 and βHC13 cells were exposed for 24 h to IL-1β at final concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 15 ng/ml. After the 24-h exposure, static incubations were done to measure glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Pre-exposure of both HIT-T15 and βHC13 cells to IL-1β for 24 h significantly decreased subsequent insulin secretion in response to maximal glucose stimulation (11.1 or 22.2 mmglucose, respectively, for HIT-T15 and βHC cells) (Fig.1). Maximal inhibition of insulin secretion required an IL-1β concentration of 5 ng/ml. To determine if the decrease in insulin secretion occurred concomitantly with an increase in PGE2 production following exposure to IL-1β, KRB buffer samples collected during the static incubations were also evaluated for PGE2 levels. Exposure to 5 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h increased PGE2 production significantly over control levels (Fig. 2). Concurrent treatment with either 0.01 mm NS-398 or 25 ng/ml SC-236 decreased PGE2 to levels not significantly different from control (Fig. 2). Similar to observations in experiments using the HIT and βHC cells, PGE2 production by islets increased significantly from control levels following exposure to IL-1β. Concurrent treatment with IL-1β and 0.01 mm NS-398 decreased levels (Fig. 2 legend). To determine if the IL-1β-dependent decrease in insulin secretion involved the activation of COX-2, cells were exposed to IL-1β and either 0.01 mm NS-398 or 25 ng/ml SC-236, both of which inhibit COX-2 specifically when these concentrations are used (20Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D. Rangwala S.H. Koboldt C.M. Seibert K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15810-15814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Both NS-398 and SC-236 prevented inhibition of insulin secretion by IL-1β (Fig.3). Add-back experiments with exogenous PGE2 (10−4m) to the cells treated with IL-1β and either NS-398 or SC-236 reproduced the inhibition of insulin secretion observed in cells treated with IL-1β alone (Fig.3). There were no nonspecific drug or vehicle effects at the concentrations used since treatment with either drug or vehicle (without IL-1β) did not inhibit insulin secretion. Indomethacin, the nonspecific COX inhibitor known to have more effect on COX-1 than COX-2, did not prevent inhibition of insulin secretion by IL-1β, as previously reported (6Sjoholm A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24McDaniel M.L. Kwon G. Hill J.R. Marshall C.A. Corbett J.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 24-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). To support the physiological importance of the results observed in the cell lines, the IL-1β effect and role of COX-2 on insulin secretion were evaluated with Wistar rat islets. IL-1β at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml was used because it consistently decreased insulin secretion in both the HIT and βHC cells without toxic or nonspecific effects. After 24 h of pre-exposure to IL-1β, insulin secretion in response to 22.2 mm glucose islets decreased significantly. Control islets secreted insulin at a rate of 1027 ± 178 microunits/ml, whereas insulin secretion from IL-1β-treated cells was significantly decreased to 184 ± 5 microunits/ml (p < 0.05 compared with control). Concurrent treatment with either 0.01 mm NS-398 or 25 ng/ml SC-236 blocked the IL-1β effect and restored insulin secretion to levels not significantly different from control. Pretreatment with indomethacin had no preventive effect on the IL-1β-dependent decrease in insulin secretion. Addition of exogenous PGE2 with IL-1β and either NS-398 or SC-236 caused decreases in insulin secretion (Fig.4). Insulin secretion was expressed as fold response instead of milliunits/ml to account for differences in islet mass on the different experiment days. As described previously with Syrian hamster islets, we found that the major isoform of COX expressed in Wistar rat islets is COX-2 with substantially less expression of COX-1 (Fig.5 A). The major PGE2 receptor subtype expressed was EP3, with lesser amounts of EP1, EP2, and EP4 also being detected (Fig. 5 B). RT-PCR analysis of epididymal fat isolated from the same animals also showed that EP3 was the most abundant receptor type expressed (data not shown). These observations correlated with those from rat studies performed by Boieet al. (25Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) using Northern analysis. These studies were designed to assess the hypothesis that endogenous PGE2 mediates the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on glucose-induced insulin secretion. We observed the following: exogenous IL-1β stimulated synthesis of endogenous PGE2and inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion from HIT-T15 and βHC13 cells as well as from Wistar rat isolated islets; two structurally unrelated inhibitors of COX-2 activity, NS-398 and SC-236, significantly decreased PGE2 production by the cell lines and islets; this blockade of PGE2 production prevented the inhibitory effect of exogenous IL-1β on insulin secretion and was re-established when exogenous PGE2 was provided; andEP3 gene receptor expression is significantly greater than the other three receptor subtypes in islets. These observations support the hypothesis that endogenous PGE2 mediated the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on β cell function. We have reported previously that treatment of pancreatic β cells with exogenous PGE2 causes a decrease in insulin secretionin vitro (1Robertson R.P. Tsai P. Little S.A. Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F.

Fujimoto W.Y. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 551-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fujimoto W.Y. Metz S.A. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) andin vivo (9Chen M.

Physiol. 1983; 245: E591-E597PubMed Google Scholar). The single exception to the latter generalization has been indomethacin. The discordance of the effects of indomethacin with other cyclooxygenase inhibitors has been attributed to non-cyclooxygenase-related drug effects of indomethacin that themselves would be predicted to decrease insulin secretion (12Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 231-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, by using Northern analysis and RT-PCR, we have reported that, unlike other cells and organelles, pancreatic β cells dominantly express COX-2 rather than COX-1 (19Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and that exogenous IL-1β stimulates islet COX-2 gene expression and PGE2 production (19Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The PGE2 levels reported in the current study are lower than those we reported earlier (19Sorli C.H. Zhang H.J. Armstrong M.B. Rajotte R.V. Maclouf J. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) due to differences in experimental conditions (incubation in KRB buffer without FBS in the current study versus incubation in cytokine-containing culture media and fetal bovine serum). This ability of IL-1β to inhibit insulin secretion and to stimulate synthesis of PGE2 sets up the prediction that the inhibitory effect of exogenous IL-1β on insulin secretion might be mediated by endogenous PGE2. However, two groups of investigators have previously assessed this hypothesis by examining whether indomethacin would prevent IL-1β inhibitory effects on the β cell. Since indomethacin failed to reverse the effects of IL-1β, they concluded that endogenous PGE2 does not mediate the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on insulin secretion (5Hughes J.H. Easom R.A. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6Sjoholm A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We confirmed this negative finding with indomethacin in our current studies. However, with the recent availability of specific inhibitors of COX-2 activity, it is now apparent that the previously published indomethacin experiments led to an erroneous conclusion, likely because of the independent effects of this drug to inhibit insulin secretion. Our add-back experiments with exogenous PGE2, which re-established the inhibitory action of IL-1β on insulin secretion, reinforce the hypothesis that endogenous PGE2 mediates the negative effects of IL-1β on β cell function. The current study also establishes that the dominant PGE2receptor subtype in the islet is EP3 whose post-receptor action is to decrease adenylyl cyclase activity. This novel observation is consistent with the concentration-dependent relationship between PGE2 concentrations and diminished cAMP accumulation in HIT cells we earlier reported (1Robertson R.P. Tsai P. Little S.A. Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Seaquist E.R. Walseth T.F. Nelson D.M. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used RT-PCR with probes and primers specific for the rat prostaglandin receptor subtypes to evaluate the expression levels of the four major subtypes in Wistar rat islets. We limited this part of our study to Wistar islets because neither the complete genomic sequence nor cDNA sequence for hamster receptor subtypes (HIT-T15 cells were derived from Syrian hamster) was available for design of the Taqman™ probes and primers. All the other EP receptor subtype genes (EP2, EP3, and EP4) were also expressed but to a lesser degree. As controls and as validation of the Taqman™ technology for the characterization of these receptor subtypes, the expression of each receptor subtype was also evaluated in non-islet tissues (data not shown) and found to be consistent with published reports. Although the expression of the EP receptor subtypes cannot be quantitatively compared due to the possible differences in the efficiency of RT-PCR using different probe and primer sets, the differences in the C t value between each subtype mRNA signifies 2n-fold difference in expression level withn being the difference between the C tvalues. A difference in C t of 3 would, therefore, designate an 8-fold difference in mRNA expression levels. These studies uniquely establish the important roles that COX-2 and endogenous PGE2 play in the mechanism of action leading to β cell dysfunction induced by IL-1β. This interrelationship raises the possibility of using COX-2-specific inhibitors for the prevention of β cell dysfunction under inflammatory conditions. In this regard, consideration of COX-2-based therapy for the disease of type 1 diabetes mellitus is especially intriguing since endogenous IL-1β, as well as other cytokines, have been reported to be major contributors to the β cell dysfunction and destruction that is associated with this form of diabetes (17Helqvist S.

Mechanisms of stress activation upstream of MEKK1 have not been precisely determined. Redox mechanisms involving sulfhydryls are likely because N-acetyl-cysteine at millimolar concentrations blocks stress signals. Because intracellular sulfhydryl concentrations can be regulated through redox cycling involving reactive quinones (1Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol.

Several quinone reductases are inhibited by dicoumarol, a coumarin derivative. Dicoumarol prevented SAPK activation in vivo by chemical cell stressors and also prevented SAPK activation induced by expression of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) receptor-associated protein TRAF2 but not by expression of truncated active MEKK1. Other coumarin derivatives failed to block SAPK activation, but other inhibitors of quinone reductases, particularly menadione, similarly blocked SAPK activation. Cells deficient in a major quinone reductase, NQO1, displayed hypersensitivity to dicoumarol stress inhibition, whereas SAPK in cells reconstituted with the NQO1 gene displayed relative dicoumarol resistance. Consistent with the proposed role of overlapping upstream signaling cascades in activation of NFκB, dicoumarol also blocked NFκB activation in primary macrophages stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide or TNFα. In addition, dicoumarol strongly potentiated TNFα-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, probably by blocking the anti-apoptotic effect of NFκB. The ability of dicoumarol to simultaneously inhibit SAPK and NFκB activation and to potentiate apoptotic cell death suggests that SAPK is not an obligate participant in apoptosis.

In the cell, reactive quinones are regulated by the enzymatic activity NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (formerly DT-diaphorase) (E.C. 1.6.99.2) (16Lind C. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Ernster L.

Like other coumarins, dicoumarol is used clinically to inhibit blood coagulation processes dependent on vitamin K, a biological quinone.Here we report evidence that inhibitors of quinone reductases can inhibit SAPK and NFκB signaling.

Polyclonal antisera detecting p65 and p50 amino termini was a gift from Nancy Rice, NCI, Frederick, MD.RESULTSTo determine whether quinone reductase inhibitors affect transmission of stress signals, we pretreated cultures of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with dicoumarol before stimulation with hyperosmotic sorbitol or anisomycin. Dicoumarol alone did not affect SAPK but completely blocked activation by osmotic shock and anisomycin in 293 cells (Fig. 1 A) and in Jurkat and resting peripheral T lymphocytes (data not shown and see below). Dicoumarol also blocked SAPK activation by UV irradiation and ceramide induced by treatment with sphingomyelinase (Fig.1 B). Warfarin and coumarin, agents that inhibit the vitamin K cycle like dicoumarol, did not inhibit SAPK activation (see TableI), suggesting that vitamin K metabolism is unrelated to stress signaling.Table IInhibition of SAPK by respiratory and redox-active chemicalsInhibitorConcentrationResidual SAPK Activity (±S.D.)CoumarinsDicoumarol300 μm0.08 ± 0.01Coumarin680 μm0.94 ± 0.06Warfarin300 μm1.22Dicoumarol 300 μm + warfarin300 μm0.09Warfarin (18 h)30 μm0.99Warfarin (18 h)300 μm0.80Mitochondrial inhibitorsAntimycin A20 ng/ml0.94 ± 0.1Dinitrophenol1 mm1.10 ± 0.12Hydroxymethylbenzoic acid100 μm0.87 ± 0.25Ascorbic acid2 mm1.06 ± 0.15Myxothiazole4 μg/ml0.73 ± 0.12Diphenyliodonium100 μm1.07 ± 0.17Cobalt chloride100 μm1.01 ± 0.03Sodium cyanide1 mm0.96 ± 0.06EnzymesCatalase100 μg/ml0.99 ± 0.27Superoxide dismutase500 U/ml0.97 ± 0.16MiscellaneousMethylarginine100 μm1.24 ± 0.41BAPTA 1 mm + EGTA 2 mm1.14 ± 0.42Sodium Azide100 μm0.91Sodium Azide1 mm0.873-Aminobenzamide100 μm0.96 ± 0.09Caffeine500 μm1.03 ± 0.01Me2SO1% v/v1.04 ± 0.04Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate3 mm1.16Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate0.3 mm1.12Quinone-relatedButylated hydroxyanisole100 μm1.48Butylated hydroxyanisole300 μm0.73 ± 0.02Butylated hydroxyanisole1 mm0.08Hydroquinone100 μm1.00Hydroquinone300 μm0.73 ± 0.01Hydroquinone1 mm0.01Menadione10 μm1.01Menadione50 μm0.33Menadione100 μm0.11Assay of hyperosmotic sorbitol stimulated SAPK in 293 cells treated with the indicated inhibitors. Except as noted, inhibitor pretreatment preceded stimulation with sorbitol by 10 min and were assayed for SAPK activity as described above 20 min following stimulation. Agents are grouped together under broad categories but typically have several known inhibitory roles. Inhibitory agents were compared with controls treated with the appropriate solvent. Averages and standard deviations were derived from assays in separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of SAPK activation by dicoumarol was dose-dependent (Fig. 2), with an IC50 between 19 and 38 μm in 293 cells. Dicoumarol blocked SAPK activation in response to expression of TRAF2, a TNFα receptor interacting protein that activates SAPK (15Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D. Woodgett J. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, dicoumarol was unable to block SAPK activation in response to expression of truncated active MEKK1, indicating that the point of dicoumarol inhibition of SAPK activation lies downstream of TRAF2 but upstream of MEKK1 in a poorly characterized segment of the stress-signaling cascade.Figure 2Concentration dependence of dicoumarol inhibition of SAPK . 293 cells were treated with serial dilutions of dicoumarol, and stimulated with sorbitol as described in Fig. 1. The IC50 of dicoumarol for SAPK inhibition is approximately 19–33 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3A, dicoumarol blocks SAPK activation at a point upstream of MEKK1 and downstream of TRAF2. 293 cells were transfected with empty pCMV plasmid (lanes 1 and2), TRAF2-CMV (lanes 3 and 4) or ΔMEKK-EE-CMV plasmid (lanes 5 and 6). Endogenous SAPK was assayed by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay. Dicoumarol reduced basal SAPK activity and TRAF2-stimulated activity but did not block SAPK activation in MEKK1 transfected cells. B, dicoumarol does not inhibit activation of SAPK by heat shock. Cells were stimulated with sorbitol or anisomycin as above or by incubating at 45 °C for 45 min (heat shock) The heat shock results represent a longer exposure of the same gel, because stimulation of SAPK by heat shock is comparatively weaker than the other stimuli. Dicoumarol failed to inhibit activation of SAPK by heat shock. C, dicoumarol does not block TPA activation of MAPK. HeLa cells (used because TPA poorly stimulated MAPK in 293 cells) were treated with 400 mm sorbitol (lanes 3 and 4) or with 1 μg/ml TPA (lanes 5 and6) for 20 min. Extracts were divided and assayed for SAPK activation (top) and MAPK activation using immune complex kinase assays and the indicated substrates. Dicoumarol reduced activation of both SAPK and MAPK by hypertonic sorbitol treatment (lane 4) but did not block stimulation of MAPK by TPA (lane 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to its ability to inhibit activation of SAPK by agents such as sorbitol and anisomycin, dicoumarol failed to inhibit activation of SAPK in response to heat shock (Fig. 3 B), which is believed to proceed by an alternate pathway (19Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The specificity of dicoumarol inhibition for stress signaling was demonstrated by its failure to inhibit activation of MAPK in CV1 cells in response to TPA (Fig.3 C). However dicoumarol did block MAPK activation resulting from osmotic shock, which likely proceeds via upstream pathways that overlap the SAPK signaling pathway, including the involvement of MEKK1 (20Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, dicoumarol inhibition is specific for stress-activated pathways and does not affect mitogenic signaling.To verify the importance of quinone reductases in stress signaling, we tested a subline of CHO fibroblasts (clone 77254) deficient in NQO1, one of the major cellular quinone reductases (21Gustafson D.L. Beall H.D. Bolton E.M. Ross D. Waldren C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 728-735PubMed Google Scholar). Although these cells are still capable of activating SAPK in response to hyperosmotic sorbitol, they have a reduced IC50 for dicoumarol inhibition of SAPK activation, about 5 μm (Fig.4 A). Reconstitution of NQO1 by stable expression of the NQO1 gene (21Gustafson D.L. Beall H.D. Bolton E.M. Ross D. Waldren C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 728-735PubMed Google Scholar) reduced the sensitivity of these cells to dicoumarol (Fig. 4 B). Thus, inhibition of SAPK activation by dicoumarol can be partly abrogated by expression of NQO1, genetically supporting a role for NQO1 and other quinone reductases in stress signaling.Figure 4Expression of the NQO1 gene reduces sensitivity to SAPK inhibition by dicoumarol. A, an NQO1-deficient subline of CHO cells is hypersensitive to dicoumarol inhibition of SAPK relative to 293 cells. Cultures received a 10-min pretreatment with varying concentrations of dicoumarol before 400 mm sorbitol treatment. SAPK was assayed as in Fig. 1.B, CHO-77254 cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding NQO1 regained resistance to higher levels of dicoumarol, assayed as in A. The IC50 of CHO-77254 was below 5 μm, whereas in the reconstituted cells the IC50 was between 10 and 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We tested whether other metabolic toxins and redox inhibitors might be able to inhibit SAPK activation (Table I). No inhibition of SAPK activation was seen with coumarin or warfarin anticoagulants, inhibitors of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, or extracellular superoxide dismutase or catalase, which reduce intracellular levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The vitamin K-related quinone menadione blocked SAPK activation with an IC50approximately the same as dicoumarol. Notably, menadione is an in vitro substrate of quinone reductases, and competitively inhibits these enzymes in vivo. Two other quinone-related compounds, hydroquinone and butylated hydroxyanisole, inhibited SAPK at lower efficiency, requiring very high concentrations to see a significant inhibition. Thus dicoumarol and menadione, followed by other quinones, were most effective at blocking SAPK activation. These inhibitor studies suggest a role for quinone reduction, rather than events such as oxidative phosphorylation, in stress signaling.These data suggest that dicoumarol inhibition of SAPK signaling may be related to a change in the state of quinone reduction in the cell. Specifically, inhibition of quinone reductases by dicoumarol would result in a decrease in the levels of reduced quinones in the cell. We examined whether replacing the reduced quinones would restore the ability of the cells to signal to SAPK (Fig.5). Although dicoumarol completely inhibited activation of SAPK in response to sorbitol (lane 4), the addition of increasing amounts of hydroquinone restored the SAPK activation in a dose-responsive manner (lanes 5–8). Treating the cells with hydroquinone alone had no effect on SAPK activity (lanes 9–12). These data suggest that the inhibition of SAPK activation by dicoumarol is due in large part to the decrease in reduced quinones that results from the inhibition of quinone reductases, supporting a role for quinone reduction in establishing an intracellular environment that is permissive for stress signaling.Figure 5Addition of hydroquinone overcomes dicoumarol inhibition of SAPK activation. CV-1 cells were pretreated for 10 min with dicoumarol and hydroquinone at the indicated concentrations, and then stimulated with 400 mm sorbitol for 20 min. SAPK activity was measured as in Fig. 1. Addition of hydroquinone restored SAPK activation in the presence of dicoumarol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We examined consequences of interfering with stress signaling using dicoumarol. Many stress stimuli, for example TNFα and LPS, activate both SAPK and the NFκB transcription factor. Recent findings have suggested that the upstream pathways leading to NFκB activation may significantly overlap with those for SAPK activation, including a role for MEKK1 in both signaling cascades (7Meyer C.F.

Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Dicoumarol blocked NFκB activation, indicated by the loss of NFκB-DNA binding activity induced by LPS or TNFα in human pulmonary alveolar macrophages (Fig.6 A).Figure 6A, dicoumarol inhibits activation of NFκB by TNFα or LPS. Primary human pulmonary macrophages were tested immediately upon isolation (lane 1) or after culture for 30 min (lanes 2–9). Mobility shifted complexes appeared following stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml) (lane 3) or TNFα (30 ng/ml) (lane 7). The shifted complexes were inhibited by pre-incubation with dicoumarol (lanes 4 and8). Participation of p50 and p65 NFκB proteins in the shifted complexes was demonstrated in LPS-stimulated extracts using anti-p50 and anti-p65 polyclonal antibodies (lanes 5 and6). A 30-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor blocked specific complexes (lane 9). B, dicoumarol synergizes with TNFα to induce apoptosis. HeLa cells were pretreated with 25 μm dicoumarol followed by 30 ng/ml TNFα for 8 h or individually as indicated. Cells were fixed with methanol, stained with propidium iodide, and assayed using flow cytometry for DNA content. The ordinate shows cell number normalized to the mode, the abscissa relative fluorescence. Apoptotic cells with lower than 2N DNA content were enumerated, as indicated near each panel. Dicoumarol increased the fraction of apoptotic cells in synergy with TNFα, as did the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NFκB activation inhibits TNFα induced apoptosis (9Beg A.A.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). Disruption of TNFα-induced gene expression by cycloheximide or actinomycin D synergizes with TNFα-induced apoptosis. Like cycloheximide, dicoumarol also potentiated apoptosis of HeLa cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 6 B). This synergism is likely a result of the inhibition of NFκB activation by dicoumarol and points to possible therapeutic uses for dicoumarol in synergism with this or other apoptosis-inducing agents. Importantly, the simultaneous inhibition of SAPK/JNK activation and potentiation of apoptosis demonstrates that SAPK/JNK activation is not a required event in the apoptotic response.Peripheral blood lymphocytes undergo DNA synthesis in response to the mitogen PHA. Pretreatment of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with hypertonic NaCl stimulated SAPK and blocked DNA synthesis in response to PHA (Table II). Pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with dicoumarol before hypertonic shock prevented SAPK activation and restored PHA-stimulated DNA synthesis. Thus, inhibition of PHA-induced cell cycle entry in response to hypertonic shock is a specific stress-induced effect rather than a nonspecific toxic effect. In future experiments, dicoumarol should similarly be useful for identifying other biologic consequences of stress signaling.Table IIDicoumarol reverses osmotic shock blockade of PHA activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cellsPretreatmentIncorporation of 3H-thymidine mean cpm + S.D.SAPK activity (Imager cpm)Without PHAWith PHANone597 ± 8025,158 ± 2,1653.82Hypertonic NaCl422 ± 1812,120 ± 99234.78Dicoumarol + Hypertonic NaCl344 ± 3724,847 ± 1,8133.07Resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells were pre-treated either with hypertonic saline (100 mm NaCl) for 30 min or with 300 μm dicoumarol for 10 min followed by 30 min in hypertonic saline. Lymphocytes were washed to remove stimulators and replaced in medium containing PHA. DNA synthesis during a period 24–48 h following PHA exposure was monitored by incorporation of 3H-thymidine, and the results of triplicate samples are shown. SAPK activity was assayed as in Fig. 1. Dicoumarol blocks both the osmotic shock activation of SAPK and prevents the reduction of PHA activation observed following osmotic shock. Similar results were observed in two other experiments. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate an obligate role for a dicoumarol-inhibitable activity in stress signaling at a point upstream of MEKK1, and downstream of osmotic shock, LPS, anisomycin, TNFα, and the TNFα receptor-associated protein TRAF2 (Fig. 7). In contrast, this dicoumarol sensitive activity appears dispensable for activation of SAPK by heat shock, which is thought to proceed via a distinct pathway. Our data supports the hypothesis that heat shock acts via an alternate pathway which does not share the apparent dependence on quinone reductase function.Figure 7Model for regulation of SAPK and NFκB activation by dicoumarol. Cytokine and physical stresses simultaneously activate apoptotic and survival pathways, resulting in variable cell response (death or survival) depending on context-specific variables. Proximal events in the “survival” pathway depend upon a regulated redox environment for an uncharacterized event distal to the function of TRAF2 but proximal to MEKK1. This event is regulated by disulfides (15Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D. Woodgett J. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and is also targeted by dicoumarol. The well established role of dicoumarol in inhibiting quinone reductases as well as the role of quinones in disulfide regulation via redox cycling suggest an important role for quinone reductases in maintaining the overall redox environment critical for transmission of stress signals. The “survival” pathway almost certainly involves new gene expression controlled by NFκB. The simultaneous inhibition of NFκB and SAPK activation pathways together with synergism with TNFα to produce apoptosis demonstrates that SAPK activation is not obligately required for apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quinone reductases likely provide an intracellular environment permissive to stress signaling rather than themselves being activated during the signaling. Inhibition of these quinone reductases by dicoumarol would interfere with this environment, and inhibit the ability of the cells to transmit stress signals. In support of this, replacing reduced quinones that are lost as a result of dicoumarol inhibition of quinone reductases restores the ability of the cells to signal to SAPK. These data suggest a role for quinone reduction in generating this permissive intracellular environment. Interestingly, very high concentrations of hydroquinone inhibit activation of SAPK in response to sorbitol, suggesting that there is a tightly regulated balance, where either too high or low levels of reduced quinones are detrimental to stress signal transmission.Cells lacking NQO1 display increased"

Of these, SUMO-1 (smallubiquitin-related modifier), human homologue of yeast Smt3 and also called UBL1, sentrin, PIC1, GMP1, or SMT3C, is capable of modifying a wide variety of cellular proteins, such as RanGAP1, a Ran-GTPase-activating protein (3Saitoh H.

Moreover, it has been reported that both SUMO-1 and Smt3 synthesized as proproteins are processed to generate the C-terminal glycine residue prior to its conjugation to appropriate target proteins (13Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the extra peptides to expose the C-terminal glycine residue should be essential for their ligation to target proteins through an isopeptide linkage, which is analogous to ubiquitinylation (14Hochstrasser M.

The enzyme(s) catalyzing the maturation of the SUMO-1 precursor, however, has not yet been reported in any mammalian cells and tissues. In this paper, we report that the soluble extract of bovine brain contains one major SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase that cleaves SUMO-1 from the SUMO-1 precursor (abbreviated pSUMO-1) fused with αNH-GSMHISPPEPESEEEEE-HYC (designated as pSUMO-1-gsPESTc). Intriguingly, the partially purified enzyme also shows isopeptidase activity capable of releasing SUMO-1 from a SUMO-1-RanGAP1 conjugate. Recently, it was reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a unique Smt3/SUMO-1 generating protease termed Ulp1 (Ubl-specific protease 1) which possesses both C-terminal processing and isopeptidase activities (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). However, the presently described 30-kDa SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase appears to differ from yeast Ulp1 or its structurally related putative yeast protease Ulp2/Smt4 with a predicted molecular mass of 72 or 117 kDa, respectively. The physiological significance of the newly identified SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase is discussed. Recombinant ubiquitin-PESTc was prepared as previously reported (17Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho J.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18773-18776Google Scholar). For the preparation of Ubl substrates, we used Ubl precursor forms with extension peptides (pUbl); i.e. SUMO-1-HSTV and NEDD8-LRQ fused with gsPESTc were constructed and abbreviated as pSUMO-1-gsPESTc and pNEDD8-gsPESTc, respectively. The DNA fragments encoding (ubiquitin or pUbl)-gsPESTc or SUMO-1(G97A)-gsPESTc, in which Gly at position 97 of the C-terminal end of the mature form of SUMO-1 was substituted with Ala and fused with gsPESTc, were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified recombinant proteins were radiolabeled with Na-125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. The specific activity of iodinated ubiquitin-PESTc and pUbl-gsPESTc was about 5 × 105cpm/μg protein. Ubiquitin or ubiquitin-related proteins fused with PESTc or gsPESTc (0.1–0.5 μg of 125I-labeled substrate or 4 μg of non-labeled substrate) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h for the125I-labeled substrate or 3 h for the non-labeled substrate in a total volume of 100 μl of reaction mixtures containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and a proper amount of SUMO-1 hydrolase. To validate the generation of SUMO-1 from the fusion protein, the reaction products were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by autoradiography or staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The intensity of the resulting bands was determined using a Fuji BAS-2500 Bio-imaging analyzer. GST-SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1 was synthesized using 75 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate as reported previously (18Saitoh H. Sparrow D. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Mohun T. Nishimoto T. Dasso M. Curr.

The glutathione beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were used for the assay immediately. For the detection of isopeptidase activity, 10 μl of the beads was incubated with 10 μl of each column fraction for varying times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of SDS-sample buffer. After 4–20% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried and the signals were detected by autoradiography. The conversion of SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1 conjugate to 35S-RanGAP1 was estimated by an imaging analyzer. Whole bovine brains were homogenized in three volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA and 1 mm DTT in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. This supernatant, but scarcely the particulate fraction, hydrolyzed125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc. The extracts also showed strong activity capable of cleaving 125I-ubiquitin-PESTc and125I-pNEDD8-gsPESTc. To analyze them, the cytosolic proteins (20 g of protein) were mixed with 850 ml of Q-Sepharose resin for 2 h at 4 °C. After the unabsorbed fraction was pooled, the resin was packed in a column, and proteins adsorbed on the resin were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl. The125I-ubiquitin-PESTc- and125I-pNEDD8-gsPESTc-degrading activities were eluted at several peaks (19Kawakami T. Suzuki T. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. Ichiyama A. Hirano H. Omata M. Tanaka K. J. Biochem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), but little or no125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc-degrading activity was detected in all of the column fractions eluted with the salt gradient. However, a strong activity against 125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc degradation together with considerable activities of125I-ubiquitin-PESTc and 125I-pNEDD8-gsPESTc degradations were observed in the flow-through fraction (data not shown). To separate the activities against the 125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc degrading enzyme in the flow-through fraction, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation was carried out (Fig. 1 A). Although a small amount of the degrading activity against125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc was detected in the 25–50% fraction, most of the activity was detected in the 50–75% fraction, (left panel). In contrast, the major degrading activities against125I-ubiquitin-PESTc (middle panel) and125I-pNEDD8-gsPESTc (right panel) were recovered in the 0–50% (NH4)2SO4 fraction. Thus, it is likely that the enzyme(s) responsible for the generation of SUMO-1 differs from those for releasing ubiquitin or NEDD8. The resulting 50–75% (NH4)2SO4 fraction was dialyzed against 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA, it (1.3 g) was divided into three pools, and each pool was applied onto an S-Sepharose column (70 ml) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins adsorbed on the resin were then eluted with 400 ml of a linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl. The 125I-pSUMO-gsPESTc degrading activities were eluted as a single peak around 0.25m NaCl concentration (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, most of the degrading activities of 125I-ubiquitin-PESTc and 125I-pNEDD8-gsPESTc were not bound to the S-Sepharose column. It is notable that SUMO-1 is conjugated to RanGAP1 for regulation of nuclear protein transportation (reviewed in Refs. 1Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and 3Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether the SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase has activity capable of releasing SUMO-1 from the SUMO-1-RanGAP1 conjugate. For this, we prepared GST-SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1 as a substrate and assayed SUMO-1 isopeptidase activity by measuring the release of 35S-RanGAP1 from the GST-SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1 conjugate. The obvious isopeptidase activity was found in the bovine brain extracts, and subsequent investigation revealed that most of the activities were not adsorbed on a Q-Sepharose column, although a weak activity was found to be bound loosely to the resin (data not shown). The flow-through fraction containing most of the activity was loaded on an S-Sepharose column, and proteins adsorbed on the resin were eluted as described in Fig.1 B. As shown in Fig. 1 C, two isopeptidase activities were eluted around 0.2 and 0.4 m NaCl concentrations. The former weak activity overlapped the125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc degrading activity, and the latter activity was estimated to be an apparent molecular size of over 80 kDa by subsequent molecular sieve chromatography (data not shown). In this work, we focused on the SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase to explore further biochemical properties. On each fractionation in S-Sepharose chromatography (Fig.1 B), the fractions with the highest activity against125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc degradation (shown by top bar) were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH. 6.8) containing 1 mm DTT. They were divided into seven pools and applied to a pre-packed hydroxylapatite column (bed volume, 10 ml) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 5 bed volumes of the buffer, the adsorbed materials were eluted with 120 ml of linear gradient of 0–0.3m potassium phosphate buffer (pH. 6.8). The125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc-degrading activity was recovered as a single peak at 0.15 m potassium phosphate concentration (Fig. 2 A). Subsequently, the peak fractions of the activity of each fractionation were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT, and applied on a Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (bed volume, 5 ml) in the same buffer. Proteins adsorbed on the resin were then eluted with 25 ml of a linear gradient of 0–1.2m NaCl. The 125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc-degrading activity was eluted as a single peak at 0.4 m NaCl concentration (Fig. 2 B). The fractions with the highest activity against 125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc degradation (shown bytop bar) were pooled and used for further analysis. For the first time, we examined the molecular mass of the enzyme by molecular sieve chromatography with a Superdex 200-pg column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The apparent molecular mass of the SUMO-1 hydrolase was estimated to be approximately 30 kDa (Fig.3). As shown in Fig.4A (left panel), the enzyme activity was almost completely inhibited byN-ethylmaleimide, but not by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride nor EDTA (the entire reaction mixture contains 1 mm EDTA), indicating that it is probably a thiol protease, like many deubiquitinylating enzymes reported so far (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). However, SUMO-1 hydrolase was not inhibited by ubiquitin-aldehyde (ubiquitin-CHO) known as a potent inhibitor of deubiquitinylating enzymes (20Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When the digestion products of pSUMO-1-gsPESTc were separated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by automated Edman degradation and mass spectrometry, the SUMO-1 hydrolase produced the HSTVGSMHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC peptide (data not shown). We also measured the cleavage of SUMO-1(G97A)-gsPESTc, in which Gly at position 97 of the C-terminal end of the mature form of SUMO-1 was replaced by Ala and fused with gsPESTc, by the partially purified enzyme. As shown in Fig.4 A (middle panel), SUMO-1(G97A)-gsPESTc was scarcely cleaved. These results indicate that the isolated SUMO-1 hydrolase is capable of hydrolyzing the precise site to produce mature SUMO-1, and thus it can act as a SUMO-1 processing enzyme. Moreover, SUMO-1 hydrolase rapidly degraded pSUMO-1-gsPESTc, but not ubiquitin-gsPESTc and pNEDD8-gsPESTc (Fig. 4 A, right panel), suggesting that the isolated enzyme is specific for the generation of SUMO-1. Taken together, this indicated that the isolated enzyme is the SUMO-1-specific protease.Figure 4Enzymatic properties of the isolated SUMO-1 hydrolase. A, after the partially purified enzyme (0.1 μg) was pre-incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of each compound at the indicated concentration, the resulting samples were assayed (left panel). Ubiquitin-PESTc, pNEDD8-gsPESTc (middle panel), or SUMO-1(G97A)-gsPESTc (right panel) was used as a substrate for the degrading assay. Theclosed and open triangles indicate where the substrates and their products migrated in the gels, respectively. Theplus and minus written below the gel represent the presence or absence of the enzyme, respectively, and thenumbers indicate the incubation time. B, isopeptidase activity on the SUMO-1-RanGAP1 conjugate by SUMO-1 hydrolase. Samples of each fraction eluted from the hydroxylapaptite column (see Fig. 2 A) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The assay for the release of the GST-SUMO-1 moiety from the GST-SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1 was carried out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether the presently described SUMO-1 hydrolase has de-conjugation activity. To test this activity, the column fractions eluted from hydroxylapapatite chromatography (see Fig. 2 A, note that a different preparation was used for this experiment) were incubated with GST-SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1, and then the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 B, cleaved products (70-kDa non-modified form) were detected in fractions 37–44 (lower panel). The fractions with high GST-SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1-cleaving activity were in fairly good agreement with those with125I-pSUMO-1-gsPESTc-degrading activity (upper panel). These results strongly indicate that SUMO-1 hydrolase has the SUMO-1-isopeptidase activity capable of releasing the SUMO-1 moiety from the SUMO-1-RanGAP1 conjugate. We previously reported that ubiquitin-PESTc acts as a substrate for the sensitive and quantitative assays of various deubiquitinylating enzymes (DUBs) and found a set of novel DUBs in the chicken skeletal muscle (17Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho J.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18773-18776Google Scholar) and bovine brain (19Kawakami T. Suzuki T. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. Ichiyama A. Hirano H. Omata M. Tanaka K. J. Biochem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we designed pSUMO-1-gsPESTc to look for a SUMO-1 hydrolase that cleaves the SUMO-1 moiety from the model substrate. The purified SUMO-1 hydrolase activity was inhibited by the sulfhydry1-blocking agentN-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that its intrinsic activity is catalyzed by a mechanism similar to other sulfhydry1 protease such as DUBs. However, the SUMO-1 hydrolase was not inhibited by ubiquitin-CHO and did not cleave ubiquitin-PESTc, indicating that this enzyme's role is specific to the SUMO-1 modifying pathway. During the preparation of this manuscript, Li and Hochstrasser (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) reported a new yeast protease, termed Ulp1, which is structurally unrelated to known DUBs. Ulp1 releases SUMO-1/Smt3 from SUMO-1-RanGAP1 and a precursor of Smt3, indicating that U1p1 has both Smt3 precursor processing and isopeptidase activities. U1p1 is a thiol enzyme, but it is not sensitive to ubiquitin-CHO nor has ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase activity. Because the catalytic properties of Ulp1 appear similar to those of the 30-kDa SUMO-1 hydrolase from bovine brain, one might predict that these two enzymes could be related to each other. Although we cannot rule out this possibility, our enzyme seems to differ from Ulp1, because the 30-kDa SUMO-1 hydrolase that we purified is significantly smaller than the 72-kDa of Ulp1. Moreover, we also detected chromatographically other distinct activities capable of cleaving SUMO-1 from SUMO-1-35S-RanGAP1 that was eluted at a different peak from the 30-kDa SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase on the Q-Sepharose and S-Sepharose chromatography. All our data indicate that the 30-kDa SUMO-1 C-terminal hydrolase is not a mammalian orthologue of yeast Ulp1 and that mammalian cells contain multiple SUMO-1 isopeptidases. Li and Hochstrasser (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) also found a putative 117-kDa protease named Ulp2 (equivalent to Smt4) in yeast genome, which is structurally related to Ulp1, although it is unknown whether Ulp2 has the SUMO-1 hydrolase/isopeptidase activities. Our computer-assisted homology analysis in a human cDNA data base reveals the existence of at least five different putative proteins having a conserved presumptive catalytic domain homologous to yeast Ulp1 and Ulp2 (not shown). This knowledge together with our present findings suggests that a family of SUMO-1 specific proteases that are structurally related are universally present in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells. In budding yeast, increasing evidence has indicated that Smt3 modification is involved in cell cycle control, especially in G2/M progression of the cell cycle (1Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The balance of Smt3 conjugation and deconjugation to the multiple proteins, such as Cdc3 (21Takahashi Y. Iwase M. Konishi M. Tanaka M. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), appears to be dynamically regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and both the processing and deconjugation activity of Ulp1 are indicated to be involved in the normal growth of budding yeast (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether the SUMO-1-modification fluctuates in the mammalian cell cycle and whether the 30-kDa SUMO-1 hydrolase is involved in this regulation. Recently, a growing number of proteins is found to be covalently modified and regulated by SUMO-1, but all of the proteins identified so far seem to use a single ligating pathway (9Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 10Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

If the modification of each protein is regulated, the deconjugation process catalyzed by multiple SUMO-1 isopeptidase seems to be important, even though how the presently described 30-kDa SUMO-1 hydrolase contributes to this process awaits future study. The cDNA cloning of this enzyme, which is in progress, would provide a useful tool for clarifying the physiological roles."

The data reported here document that the human AS gene is induced following activation of the UnfoldedResponse Pathway (UPR), also known as theEndoplasmic Reticulum StressResponse (ERSR) in mammals. Increased AS transcription occurs in response to glucose deprivation, tunicamycin, or azetidine-2-carboxylate, all known to activate the UPR/ERSR pathway. Previously identified ERSR target genes contain multiple copies of a single highly conserved cis-element. In contrast, the human AS gene does not contain the ERSR element, as it has been described for other responsive genes. Instead, AS induction requires an Sp1-like sequence, a sequence previously shown to be associated with amino acid control of transcription, and possibly, a third region containing no consensus sequences for known transcription factors. Oligonucleotides covering each of these regions form DNA-protein complexes in vitro, and for some the amount of these complexes is greater when nuclear extracts from glucose-starved cells are tested. These results document that a wider range of metabolic activities are activated by the UPR/ERSR pathway than previously recognized and that genomic elements other than those already described can serve to enhance transcription of specific target genes.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) are significantly different, although many, if not most, of the corresponding genes are targets for both. Given the observed increased transcription of the human AS gene following glucose deprivation (5Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that AS is a target gene of the UPR/ERSR. If AS is a UPR/ERSR target, transcription should be enhanced by recognized activators of the pathway, such as tunicamycin or Aze (15Li W.W. Hsiung Y.C. Zhou Y.H. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Northern analysis reported here indicates that either tunicamycin or Aze are as effective as glucose starvation in increasing AS mRNA content. Furthermore, tunicamycin was able to replace glucose deprivation as a way to activate the transcription of a reporter gene under the control of the AS 5′-flanking sequence. Thus, these data document that the AS gene is responsive to several known activators of the UPR/ERSR pathway. Electromobility shift analyses and promoter deletions within the proximal 200 bp of the human AS promoter indicate that there are distinct regions of sequence required for a maximal UPR/ERSR response by this gene. Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) as described (5Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S.

To test for induction of AS mRNA content, cells were incubated in glucose-free MEM, complete MEM medium, MEM containing 5 μg/ml tunicamycin, or MEM containing 5 mm Aze for 12–18 h, during which the media contained 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Total cellular RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis on a 1% agarose gel (5Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem.

Autoradiograms were quantified by densitometry after demonstrating that the absorbance units were within the linear range of the film. All experiments were repeated with independent RNA preparations to show reproducibility. HepG2 hepatoma cells were transfected with a reporter construct (p0GH), obtained from Nichols Institute Diagnostics, Inc. (San Juan Capistrano, CA) that contains the complete gene sequence for human growth hormone (GH), including a potential transcription initiator-like (Inr) sequence (17Bucher P. J. Mol.

With the exception of the promoter and the first nucleotide of the transcript, the entire GH genomic sequence is contained within the p0GH vector. The AS promoter sequences and the site-directed mutations were generated by PCR using primers based on sequence from a human genomic clone obtained and characterized by our laboratory. 2I. P.

Our sequence agrees with the sequence of the entire AS gene and its flanking regions obtained by sequencing of a PAC clone (clone DJ1090P18, GenBankTM accession number AC00536) and submitted to GenBank by R. Waterston as part of the Human Genome Project. A batch transfection technique was employed using HepG2 cells grown to about 75% confluence. A ratio of 10 μg of DNA per 60 μl of Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Germany) per 6.6 × 106cells/100-mm dish was constant in each transfection. A 10-μg aliquot of DNA was incubated with 60 μl of Superfect for 10 min at room temperature in MEM alone. The MEM was removed, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the transfection mixture for 3 h at 37 °C in 5.0 ml of MEM containing fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin, and antibiotics. After transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fresh culture medium was added, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. Each 100-mm dish of HepG2 cells was then split to four or five 60-mm dishes so that, within each experiment, cells incubated in either glucose-containing, glucose-free, or tunicamycin-containing medium came from the same transfected cell population. This procedure eliminates the concern about transfection efficiency between the experimental treatments. After another 24 h of culture, the cells were incubated for 12–18 h in the media, described in each figure legend, and then total cellular RNA was isolated. The transfection efficiency between dishes was measured by co-transfecting the pcDNA3.1 vector containing a lacZ insert behind the cytomegalovirus CMV promoter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, PA) and then monitoring lacZ mRNA expression by Northern analysis. The ability of the AS promoter fragments to promote transcription of the GH reporter gene also was evaluated by Northern analysis. More traditional enzymatic or protein reporter assays were not used to avoid potential confounding effects of glucose deprivation or tunicamycin treatment on general protein synthesis or turnover of the reporter protein. Mutagenesis of the AS sequence 5′-TATAA-3′ (−29 to −25) to 5′-ACTCA-3′ was accomplished using PCR as described by Ho et al. (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.G. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). For this four-base substitution, two primers (P2, P3) were prepared that were mismatched (shown with an underline) to the native sequence at the substituted block of bases (P2 = 5′-TGGCGCTGAGTCCGACCTGGCTCCTGTAACGC-3′, P3 = 5′-CAGGTCGGACTCAGCGCCAGCGGCCTCGCCGC-3′). Two additional primers were prepared that corresponded to the 5′-most (Primer 1) and 3′-most (Primer 4) sequences of the −173/+51 AS genomic sequence plus a BamHI restriction site (underlined) for subcloning (P1 = 5′-NNGGATCCCAAAAGAGCTCCTCCTTGCGC-3′, P4 = 5′-NNGGATCCTAAGCAGGTCAGGGTGATGTGGCGG-3′). Two PCR reactions (P1 + P2 and P3 + P4 were performed to generate the two overlapping products. The PCR amplicons were agarose gel-purified, and the two overlapping fragments were used as DNA templates for a second PCR reaction using P1 and P4 to amplify the entire −173/+51 sequence with the TATA substitution (designated −173/+51/*TATA in Fig.3 B). The PCR product was subcloned and transferred to theBamHI site of the GH expression vector (p0GH). The directionality and substitutions were checked by DNA sequencing. Total nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells incubated for 18 h in either complete MEM (+Glc) or in MEM lacking glucose (−Glc) (22Kerrigan L.A. Kadonaga J.T. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York City1994Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were radiolabeled by extension of overlapping ends with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (22Kerrigan L.A. Kadonaga J.T. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York City1994Google Scholar). A 5-μg aliquot of nuclear extract was preincubated for 10 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.05 mm EDTA, and, as indicated, 6 ng (100×) or 12 ng (200×) of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide. Then 0.06 ng of radiolabeled probe (10,000 dpm) was added and the incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and the results visualized by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated twice, and at least two independently prepared nuclear extracts were tested. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the human AS gene is a target for the UPR/ERSR pathway. The UPR/ERSR pathway is thought to be responsible for increased expression primarily of ER-bound proteins associated with protein processing, although a number of other potential target genes have been identified recently (23Wang X.-Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The identification of an amino acid biosynthetic activity such as AS would be unprecedented but perhaps would lead to new insights into this important cellular pathway and the role played by asparagine availability. Transcription of the human AS gene has recently been documented to be enhanced by glucose starvation (5Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test whether or not the AS gene responds to other recognized activators of the UPR/ERSR pathway, incubations were performed in the presence of tunicamycin or Aze (15Li W.W. Hsiung Y.C. Zhou Y.H. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,24Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (392) Google Scholar). When HepG2 cells were incubated in MEM medium lacking glucose or complete MEM containing 5 μg/ml tunicamycin or 5 mm Aze for 18 h, the cellular content of AS mRNA was increased significantly (Fig. 1 A). The response to glucose deprivation is consistent with our previous report (5Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and served, in this context, as a positive control. The Northern blots were stripped and reprobed with cDNAs specific for GRP78, which served as a positive control for the UPR/ERSR pathway, and for the ribosomal protein rpL7a, which served both as a negative control and to document equal loading between gel lanes (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether or not the induction by tunicamycin treatment and glucose deprivation were additive, HepG2 cells were incubated under each condition separately or in MEM medium both lacking glucose and containing tunicamycin (Fig. 1, B and C). When the cells were exposed to both conditions simultaneously, the degree of enhancement in AS mRNA was approximately the same as either condition alone (Fig. 1 C). These results support, but do not prove, the hypothesis that the two processes at least share a common step, if not identical mechanisms. Quantitation and reproducibility of the response to these UPR/ERSR activators was accomplished by treating three independent sets of cells, measuring the AS mRNA content by hybridization of a dot blot, and quantitating the results with a phosphoimager (Fig. 1 C). To establish that the observed increase in steady state AS mRNA content following tunicamycin treatment was transcriptionally mediated and to localize potential genomic cis-element regions, a transient transfection protocol was used. HepG2 cells were transfected with a reporter construct containing the entire genomic sequence for human GH (19Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) in conjunction with: 1) no promoter (p0GH), 2) the mouse MTT promoter (20Hamer D.H. Walling M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 273-288PubMed Google Scholar), or 3) specific fragments of the AS promoter (Fig.2 A). Transcription was significantly enhanced by glucose deprivation when 10 kilobase pairs of the human AS 5′-flanking sequence was present (data not shown), and when the AS sequence was progressively deleted to nt −3121/+51 or −615/+51, the high degree of glucose deprivation-induced activity was retained (Fig. 2 A). An additional series of 5′ deletions (−475/+51, −376/+51, −274/+51, −173/+51) documented that following glucose starvation, induction of transcription was maintained at the level of the −615/+51 construct (for an example of the −173/+51 construct, see Fig. 3), until the −72/+51 fragment was tested and shown to be inactive. To obtain supporting evidence that glucose removal was activating expression via the ERSR, the glucose-responsive −173/+51 AS fragment was shown to respond to tunicamycin treatment as well (Fig. 2 B). Co-transfection with a plasmid containing lacZ allowed the relative transfection efficiency between dishes to be monitored by probing the blots for lacZ mRNA. As noted above, with the batch transfection protocol used, the cells incubated in the presence or absence of glucose (or tunicamycin) arose from the same original transfected dish for each construct. Therefore, any differences observed for an individual construct (e.g.−173/+51 with or without tunicamycin in Fig. 2 B) may reflect a minor effect of the treatment on the cytomegalovirus promoter. Activation of the ERSR pathway was confirmed by reprobing the blots to measure the endogenous AS and GRP78 mRNA content. Equal loading of lanes was established by probing with the rpL7a cDNA. To further define the region encoding the ERSR responsive cis-elements, deletions were made to the −173/+51 bp sequence from both the 5′ and 3′ directions (Fig. 3). Deletion of the AS 5′ sequence from nt −173 to −111 had no effect on either basal or ERSR-mediated transcription. However, reduction of the sequence to nt −90 or less caused a decrease in transcription, consistent with the presence of an Sp1 consensus sequence located at nt −106 to −97 (25Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). Given that the genomic GH reporter sequence lacks only one nucleotide from the native transcript sequence (19Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and retains a Inr-like sequence that appears to serve as a transcription start site (17Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 18Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), 3′-deletions of the AS promoter were also possible (Fig. 3 B). Sequential removal of AS promoter sequence from the 3′ direction back to nt −34 resulted in a partial loss of basal transcription, but the ERSR-induced transcription remained evident (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these deletion studies indicate that, by transient transfection studies, the sequences required for effective expression of the AS gene following ERSR activation are contained within the −111 to −34 proximal promoter sequence. Interestingly, the TATA sequence (5′-TATAA-3′) at nt −29 to −25 appeared to be unnecessary for basal transcription, at least in the context of the GH reporter gene. To investigate further the functionality of this sequence in the context of the AS promoter, the AS sequence 5′-TATAA-3′ was mutated to 5′-ACTCA-3′ within the −173 to +51 construct (labeled −173/+51/*TATA in Fig. 3 B). Neither basal nor induced transcription was altered by mutation of the TATAA sequence, suggesting that this sequence is not functionally required for AS expression. Genes lacking a TATA box often use an Inr initiator element in conjunction with multiple Sp1 sites to localize the transcription start site (reviewed in Ref. 18Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The human AS has an Inr-like sequence (5′-TCAAGCT-3′) at the proposed major transcription start site (7Greco A. Gong S.S. Ittmann M. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although the functionality of this element in vivo has yet to be established. To test in vitro for protein binding to these AS promoter sequences, electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed (Fig.4). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells incubated for 18 h in complete MEM (+Glc) or MEM lacking glucose (−Glc) and incubated with each of three32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes that spanned most of the −111 to −34 region (see Fig.5). The −112/−91 oligonucleotide probe, designed to have 6 nt on each side of a consensus Sp1 sequence (nt −106 to −97) (25Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar), exhibited a single primary complex that could be blocked by an excess of cold competitor (Fig. 4). Preliminary experiments suggest that this band undergoes a so-called supershift when anti-Sp1 antibody is included in the incubation (data not shown). The relative amount of complex formed was the same or slightly greater when extracts from glucose-deprived cells were compared with those from glucose-fed cells.Figure 5Summary of promoter deletion analysis and location of the EMSA oligonucleotide probe sequences. The entire −173 to +51 sequence is illustrated and the −111 to −34 region necessary for maximal ERSR signal by the human AS gene isboxed. An arrow shows the published transcription start site (7Greco A. Gong S.S. Ittmann M. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the three oligonucleotides chosen for EMSA analysis (see Fig. 4) are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At nt −70 to −64, the human AS promoter contains a palindromic core sequence (5′-CATGATG-3′) that has been proposed to function as an amino acid response element (3Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide probe that contained nt −72 to −62 did not produce a product by EMSA. However, when the oligonucleotide length was increased to cover nt −79 to −53, two distinct complexes were formed. The upper complex was increased by more than 7-fold when extracts from glucose-deprived cells were used (Fig.4). The lower complex also increased in amount when the −Glc extracts were tested, but the change (3-fold) was less than that for the larger complex. Consistent with the block substitution by Guerrini et al. (3Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), who documented the amino acid response activity of this region, our data show that deletion of the seven nucleotides comprising the core sequence (5′-CATGATG-3′) from the −3121/+51 AS genomic fragment completely prevented the ERSR-dependent induction when tested by transient transfection.2 The deletion analysis suggested that sequences within nt −111 to −34 were necessary for activation of the AS gene by the ERSR pathway. The AS sequence from nt −49 to −30, on the top strand, contains the sequence 5′-CGTTACAGGAGCCAGGTCG-3′ which yields 3′-GCAAT-N9-CCAGC-5′ on the bottom strand, (see Fig. 5). This sequence is similar to the consensus ERSR element (5′-CCAAT-N9-CCACG-3′) proposed by Yoshida (13Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar) and Roy and Lee (14Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the location of the AS ERSRE-like sequence on the bottom strand and in the opposite orientation is unusual, relative to all previously described occurrences (13Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 14Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The 9-base pair spacer of AS also contains a GGC element which is observed in most of the ERSR elements identified previously (14Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide covering the −55 to −26 AS sequence formed two complexes (Fig. 4 B). The relative amount of the lower complex was unchanged by the medium glucose content, but formation of this complex exhibited sequence specificity given that self-inhibition was clearly evident, whereas an unrelated oligonucleotide sequence had no effect (Fig. 4 B). The presence of a 100-fold excess of the ERSRE sequence did not prevent formation of the complex, suggesting that the protein(s) bound to this region do not recognize this consensus sequence. Although the addition of a 100-fold excess of an oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus ERSRE element blocked the formation of the upper complex, an oligonucleotide containing an unrelated sequence was just as effective (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that formation of this minor complex is not sequence-specific. Therefore, although the deletion data indicates that the AS region between −34 and −52 is necessary for ERSR-dependent activation of the gene, identification of the specific nucleotides responsible must be confirmed by more extensive analysis. In summary, the data presented document transcriptional control of the human asparagine synthetase gene following activation of the UPR/ERSR pathway. This report is the first demonstration of a link between amino acid metabolism and the UPR/ERSR. The physiologic importance of asparagine biosynthesis to this signal transduction process remains open for investigation. Asparagine is the N-linked carbohydrate attachment site within ER-synthesized glycoproteins, so perhaps the UPR/ERSR activation of the AS gene is to ensure that asparagine limitation is not the cause of ER protein accumulation. Alternatively, both asparagine deprivation (6Patterson Jr., M.K. Maxwell M.D. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 1064-1067PubMed Google Scholar, 7Greco A. Gong S.S. Ittmann M. Basilico C. Mol. Cell.

Cell Res. 1995; 220: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and activation of the UPR/ERSR pathway (26Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X.Z. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar) have been linked to cell cycle arrest and initiation of apoptosis. If the original signals that arise from asparagine deprivation and the UPR/ERSR represent two completely independent events, induction of AS expression may be a cellular attempt to provide sufficient asparagine so as to eliminate limiting amounts of this amino acid as the cause of the apoptotic signal. Beyond documenting the novel observation that AS is a UPR/ERSR target, the data also provide evidence that the transcriptional elements required for control of some genes by the mammalian ERSR pathway is more complex than previously thought. Known ERSR target genes, such as the GRP family, appear to be fully activated by multiple copies of a single cis-element termed the ERSRE (13Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 14Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The observation that an Sp1 sequence (−106 to −97) is required for full induction of AS by the ERSR pathway is unprecedented. Interestingly, Sp1 also is reported to play a key role in regulating genes that are carbohydrate-responsive in the opposite direction, that is, that their expression is induced by the presence of glucose (27Schäfer D. Hamm-Künzelmann B. Brand K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second AS promoter region that is implicated by the present data contains a sequence previously reported to be necessary for the transcriptional response to amino acid starvation (3Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis shows that the core sequence (nt −70 to −64) also is necessary for activation of the AS gene by the UPR/ERSR pathway.2 Furthermore, the EMSA results of Fig. 4document that the region forms specific DNA-protein complexes in vitro for which the amount is greater when nuclear extracts from glucose-starved cells are tested. Additional research will be necessary to fully understand the dual role of this regulatory cis-element in the cellular response to both amino acid and glucose deprivation. Future genomic analyses, both in vitro and in vivo, will further define the specific nucleotides required for this interesting transcriptional activation of the human AS gene by the UPR/ERSR signal, whereas knockdown or knockout approaches will address the physiological role of asparagine biosynthesis in the pathway.

Here we have sought to determine whether anchorage regulation of the MAP kinase pathway is specific to the α chain subunit of the integrins employed during adhesion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) anchored via endogenous α2, α3, or α5 integrin subunits or NIH3T3 fibroblast cells lines anchored via ectopically expressed human integrin α2 or α5 subunits displayed comparable MAP kinase activation upon growth factor stimulation, regardless of the integrin α chain employed. In contrast, when either cell type was maintained in suspension, growth factor treatment inefficiently activated the MAP kinase pathway. The integrin-mediated enhancement of MAP kinase activation by growth factor correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase but was independent of Shc. These data indicate that integrin modulation of the MAP kinase pathway is supported by a variety of integrin complexes and imply that other pathways may be required for the previously reported α chain-specific effects on cell cycle regulation and cell differentiation.

The regulation of many cellular events is dependent upon the coordinated effects of cues from adhesive interactions with the extracellular matrix and the presence of circulating growth factors. For example, the anchorage dependence of cell growth has been recognized for many years, and anchorage is also a necessary component of differentiation and survival in many cell types. Recent studies have suggested that adhesion via integrin receptors is able to control growth factor signaling pathways and that this regulation may play a key role in adhesion-dependent cellular responses. Specifically, findings in fibroblasts have indicated that upon growth factor stimulation, cells adherent to the extracellular matrix component fibronectin show enhanced activation of the p42 and p44 forms of MAP 1The abbreviations used are:MAPmitogen-activated proteinFAKfocal adhesion kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminDMEMDulbecco's minimal essential mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1The abbreviations used are:MAPmitogen-activated proteinFAKfocal adhesion kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminDMEMDulbecco's minimal essential mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis kinase (1Lin T.H.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to this collaborative signaling, engagement of integrin receptors in the absence of growth factor causes a direct transient activation of MAP kinases (6Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H.

Integrin regulation of the MAP kinase pathway may provide insight into the mechanism of anchorage-dependent effects on cell cycle progression (10Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Upon activation, MAP kinases can translocate to the nucleus and regulate the activity of several transcription factors. These events ultimately impinge on the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases and their regulatory subunits, cyclins (11Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J.

However, the integrin subunit specificity of this effect remains unexplored. Several studies have shown important roles for the α chain of the integrin heterodimer in the regulation of differentiation, growth control, and apoptosis. For example, the decision of myoblasts to follow either a proliferative or differentiation pathway can be controlled by expression of α chains; exogenous expression of α5 promotes cell proliferation, whereas expression of α6 promotes differentiation (17Sastry S.K. Lakonishok M. Thomas D.A. Muschler J. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The proliferative mechanism is transmitted through increases in the cellular levels of the β1 subunit leading to enhanced MAP kinase activity and is also influenced by changes in the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion proteins (18Sastry S.K. Lakonishok M. Wu S. Truong T.Q. Huttenlocher A. Turner C.E. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1295-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In HUVECs and fibroblasts, a role and interesting mechanism for integrin α subunits in growth control has recently been proposed (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). HUVECs plated on fibronectin or vitronectin entered the S phase of the cell cycle in response to growth factors, whereas a low percentage of cells plated on laminin entered S phase, despite cell spreading (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Since α5β1, αvβ3, and α2β1 are the principal receptors responsible for binding to fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, respectively, these data suggest that progression through G1 is integrin α chain-specific. These findings correlate with direct signaling via integrins to MAP kinases; the integrins thought to be involved in this process are α5β1, αvβ3, and α1β1 but not α2β1, α3β1, or α6β1 (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In this model, the transmembrane protein caveolin serves as a link between certain integrins and the Src family kinase, Fyn, which in turn phosphorylates the adaptor molecule, Shc, to initiate the MAP kinase cascade (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 20Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Direct-mediated activation of MAP kinase via caveolin and Shc was found to be independent of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), in agreement with our observation using a different experimental strategy (21Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A further example of α chain specificity in controlling cellular responses is found in studies on extracellular matrix control of mammary epithelial cells. Signals mediated through α6 but not α2 integrins collaborate with insulin-dependent signals to suppress apoptosis in these cells (22Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that direct integrin-specific activation of the MAP kinase cascade via caveolin and Shc may contribute to cell cycle progression (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 20Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). By contrast, other studies have shown that activation of MAP kinases per se is not sufficient to permit cell cycle progression. Thus, constitutive activation of MAP kinase in suspended lung fibroblast cells by expression of an activable form of Raf does not lead to increased expression of cyclin D1 (23Le Gall M. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally, endothelial cells partially spread on low concentrations of fibronectin are blocked in the G1 phase of the cell cycle despite being able to respond to growth factors by activating MAP kinases (24Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).Evidently, there are several unresolved issues in the relationship between integrins, MAP kinase, and cell cycle control. We sought to investigate one of these issues, the involvement of specific α subunits in integrin collaboration with growth factors in the signaling to MAP kinases. Cells were attached via different α chains and were analyzed for the ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to activate MAP kinases. We observed that α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1integrins permitted efficient signaling to MAP kinases. These findings point toward the existence of integrin-specific events, other than control of growth factor signaling to MAP kinases, that are important in integrin effects on the cell cycle. Additionally, the ability of cells to respond to growth factor correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK but was independent of Shc. Thus, the mechanisms of two forms of integrin-mediated signals, direct and collaborative signaling to MAP kinase, show important differences.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructsHuman α5 cDNA, subcloned from pECEα5 (25Zhang Z.

Lee (Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina). Human α2 cDNA in the pSFneo vector was a gift from Dr. M. Hemler (26Chan B.M. Matsuura N. Takada Y. Zetter B.R. Hemler M.E. Science. 1991; 251: 1600-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).AntibodiesAnti-human integrin antibodies, P1E6 and P1D6 (Life Technologies, Inc.), were used to select cells expressing human α2 and α5, respectively. Anti-α3 antibody, P1B6, was used in cell attachment experiments. An anti-α2 cytoplasmic domain polyclonal antibody (27Tarone G. Russo M.A. Hirsch E. Odorisio T. Altruda F. Silengo L. Siracusa G. Development. 1993; 117: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a monoclonal anti-human α5(Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used for Western analysis. Anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 and anti-FAK clone 2A7 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and anti-FAK, clone 77, was from Transduction Laboratories. Shc was immunoprecipitated from cells with a polyclonal antibody (S1630) and visualized by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody (S14620), both from Transduction Laboratories.Cell Selection and CultureHUVECs were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and maintained according to the supplier's directions. Cells were used between passages 2 and 3. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with vectors expressing human α2 or human α5 subunits. Transfected cells were selected by capturing with magnetic beads (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) bound with species-specific antibodies (21Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cells underwent three rounds of antibody-mediated selection. NIH3T3 cells lines were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine calf serum and 500 μmG418.Flow CytometryCells (5 × 106) were detached using trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in PBS, 0.1% BSA for 45 min on ice, followed by washing in PBS, 0.1% BSA. Secondary antibody incubations using anti-mouse IgG coupled to phycoerythrin (Sigma) were carried out for 45 min on ice. After further washing, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS and analyzed for fluorescence using a Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA) flow cytometer.Preparation of Ligand-coated Dishes or FlasksAnti-mouse IgG-precoated MicroCellector flasks (Applied Immune Science, Santa Clara, CA) were incubated with anti-integrin antibodies (P1D6, P1E6, or P1B6 at 2 μl/ml) at 4 °C overnight. Tissue culture dishes were incubated with 20 μg/ml human fibronectin (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) at 4 °C overnight. The coated flasks and dishes were blocked with 2% BSA in DMEM for 1 h at room temperature prior to use.Cell Adherence and Preparation of Cell LysateFor experiments, confluent cells were serum-starved for 4–6 h before detachment by trypsin/EDTA; trypsin activity was subsequently neutralized with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were suspended in DMEM with 2% BSA (NIH3T3) or endothelial cell basal medium, 2% BSA (HUVECs) and incubated nonadherently at 37 °C for 45 min in a rotator to allow kinases to become quiescent. Cells were then plated onto antibody- or fibronectin-coated dishes or maintained in suspension and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Following incubations, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (6Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the lysates was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingFor immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were first incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose and then further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed 3 times with cold RIPA buffer and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to dissociate the proteins. For analysis by Western blotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS overnight at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with primary antibody (1 μg/ml) in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Active MAP kinase was detected using an antibody purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and total levels of MAP kinase were detected using Sc-94 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The membranes were washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugates (Calbiochem) for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was detected on Hyperfilm using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands from Western blots were quantified using a GS-670 model densitometer (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Kinase Reactionsp42 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated for in vitro kinase assays using the C-14 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold washing buffer (0.25 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml; NEN Life Science Products), and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, reactions were terminated upon the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and by boiling for 3 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were visualized using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager with Image-QuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).RESULTSRecent studies have proposed a role for the α chains of integrin receptors in the ability of cells to activate directly the p42 and p44 MAP kinases, permit cell cycle progression, and avoid apoptosis upon adhesion (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 20Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). However, direct integrin-mediated activation of MAP kinases is insufficient for cells to proceed through the cell cycle (19Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 29Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumemberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and the significance of integrin-mitogen collaboration for cell proliferation is still unclear. To explore these issues further, we investigated whether anchorage-modulated signaling to MAP kinases via receptor tyrosine kinases shows integrin α chain specificity.First, we analyzed the effect of cell anchorage via different integrin α chains in HUVECs. We have previously shown that in HUVECs, EGF signaling to MAP kinases is anchorage-dependent and that the expression levels of the α2 and α5subunits are very similar (5Short S.M. Talbott G.A. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To examine the integrin specificity of signaling, serum-starved HUVECs were either maintained in suspension or allowed to adhere to fibronectin, to an anti-α5 antibody (P1D6), or to an anti-α2 antibody (P1E6), before stimulation with EGF. Antibody-mediated attachment of HUVECs was ligand-specific; thus an irrelevant, anti-KT3 epitope tag mouse antibody did not allow attachment. HUVECs attached and spread on the antibody-coated plates almost to the same extent as cells adhering to fibronectin. Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes active forms of p42 and p44 MAP kinases showed that EGF efficiently activated MAP kinases in cells attached via both α2 and α5 integrins, but poorly activated MAP kinases in cells maintained in suspension (Fig.1 A). Importantly, the efficiency of signaling on antibody-coated surfaces was similar to that of cells plated on fibronectin (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by the use of in vitro MAP kinase assays using myelin basic protein as substrate (Fig. 1 B). In addition, cells attached via the α3 subunit also support efficient EGF signaling to MAP kinases (Fig. 1 C). These findings indicate that adhesion-dependent growth factor signaling is not specific to particular α chains in HUVECs.To examine further the effects of adhesion via different integrin α chains on signaling, NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing either human α2 (Huα2-NIH3T3) or α5integrins (Huα5-NIH3T3) were established. Expression of these subunits was confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies using human-specific antibodies (Fig.2 A). Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated cell surface expression of the appropriate human integrin α subunit in the Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 lines; the expression level in Huα2-NIH3T3 was slightly higher than in Huα5-NIH3T3 (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, these lines adhered specifically to dishes coated with antibodies that recognized the expressed human integrin subunit and not to plates coated with antibodies to the alternative subunit. These data indicate that the exogenously expressed integrin α subunits pair with endogenous β subunits and are expressed on the cell surface.Figure 2Expression of human α2 and α5 subunits in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with constructs expressing either the human α2 (Huα2) or human α5 receptor (Huα5). Cells expressing exogenous integrin subunits were selected and expanded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, human α2 and α5 subunits were immunoprecipitated (IP) from Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 cell lysates with P1E6 or P1D6 antibodies, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-α2 or anti-α5 antibodies. B,Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 were incubated with P1E6 or P1D6 antibodies. Antibody staining was analyzed by incubating with secondary antibody coupled to phycoerythrin and measured on a flow cytometer. The ordinate displays cell number, and the abscissa shows the relative fluorescence intensity on an arbitrary scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We analyzed integrin-growth factor collaboration upon engagement of different integrins in these NIH3T3 cell lines. Consistent with published findings in wild-type NIH3T3 cells (1Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), when cells were maintained in suspension or plated on fibronectin and stimulated with EGF, the Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 lines displayed anchorage-dependent signaling to MAP kinases (Figs. 3, A and B). Both the Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 lines adhered rapidly but spread poorly when cells were anchored appropriately via either anti-α2 or anti-α5antibody. EGF-mediated activation of MAP kinases was equivalently increased in both cell lines plated on the antibody-coated surfaces, above the level of activation in suspension. In both cell lines, the signaling on the antibody-coated surfaces was not as strong as signaling on a fibronectin-coated surfaces, likely representing a lesser degree of cortical actin cytoskeletal structure (4Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of active MAP kinase were quantified from four separate experiments and normalized for levels of total MAP kinase under each condition (Fig.3 C). Huα2-NIH3T3 plated on anti-α2 and Huα5-NIH3T3 adhering to anti-α5 gave 2.5- and 2.9-fold enhanced activation over cells treated with EGF in suspension, respectively (Fig.3 C). The comparable signaling when cells are attached via either α2β1 or α5β1 integrins again indicates a lack of α chain specificity in adhesion-dependent growth factor signaling.Figure 3Anchorage-dependent growth factor signaling to MAP kinases in NIH3T3 cells is α subunit-independent. Serum-starved Huα2-NIH3T3 (A) and Huα5-NIH3T3 (B) cell lines were detached and incubated non-adherently for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin (Fn) or anti-human α2 or α5 antibody (α2 or α5)-coated plates or maintained in suspension (Sus) for 2 h in serum-free conditions before treatment with the indicated concentrations of EGF for 5 min. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer and analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with antibodies to active MAP kinases and total levels of MAP kinases. C,bands from Western blots from active and total MAP kinase were quantified using a GS-670 model densitometer. Immunoreactivity for active MAP kinase was normalized for the amount of total MAP kinase for each condition and expressed as a value relative to the value for EGF stimulation in fibronectin adherent cells. Shown is the average and standard deviation from four separate experiments. The enhanced MAP kinase activity in EGF-treated cells adherent to anti-α chain antibodies over cells stimulated in suspension is statistically significant (*p < 0.05) in both Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we performed experiments designed to provide insight into the mechanistic details of integrin-dependent signaling provided by anchorage to these function-blocking antibodies. We correlated our findings with the effects on two proteins that have been implicated in integrin-mediated signal transduction, FAK and Shc. FAK was immunoprecipitated from HUVECs that were plated on anti-α2, anti-α5, or fibronectin for 2 h or maintained in suspension and then in some cases stimulated with EGF. FAK was highly phosphorylated to equivalent levels in HUVECs plated on anti-α2, anti-α5, or fibronectin but not in cells maintained in suspension (Fig.4 A). EGF treatment did not alter FAK tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Additionally, FAK was immunoprecipitated from Huα2-NIH3T3 and Huα5-NIH3T3 cell lysates that were plated on anti-α2, anti-α5, or fibronectin or maintained in suspension. FAK was highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when either Huα2-NIH3T3 or Huα5-NIH3T3 cells adhered to fibronectin but not when cells were maintained in suspension (Fig. 4 B). However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was reduced when cells were plated on antibody-coated surfaces, compared with fibronectin, consistent with the lesser degree of spreading observed. We have previously shown that EGF stimulation of NIH3T3 does not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation state of FAK (21Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the degree of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with the level of collaboration between integrins and growth factors in the signaling to MAP kinases.Figure 4Anchorage-dependent signaling to MAP kinase"

When 3T3-L1 cells are subjected to hyperosmotic stress, γ-PAK is activated by a two-step mechanism involving translocation to the particulate fraction and activation of the protein kinase in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-dependent manner (8Roig J. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (abstr.): 1579Google Scholar). γ-PAK involvement in cell cycle regulation is supported by data showing that the protein kinase phosphorylates and regulates Raf-1 (14King A.J. Sun H.

Agents that induce DNA damage such as ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet light (UV), or chemotherapeutic drugs such as cis-platinum(II)diammine dichloride (cisplatin) or cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC) lead to activation of the DNA repair machinery of the cell and of different signaling pathways that transiently inhibit the cell cycle. This cytostatic response allows DNA repair prior to cell division (15Bernhard E.J. Maity A. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1995; 34: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Woloschak G.E. Koval T.M. Stress-inducible Processes in Higher Eukaryotic Cells.

It is shown that γ-PAK is activated in response to IR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. UV and the DNA-damaging drugs cisplatin and AraC also activate γ-PAK, suggesting that different types of DNA damage trigger the activation of the protein kinase. The possible relationship between the observed γ-PAK activation and its described cytostatic properties is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCell culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher Scientific.Cell Culture and Treatment3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. U937 leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing cells were irradiated in a 137Cs γ irradiator (MARK I; J. L. Shepherd & Associates, San Fernando, CA) at dose rates of 352 Gy/min (for 100 Gy dose), 116 Gy/min (for 5 Gy dose), or 39.8 Gy/min (for 1 Gy dose). Control cells were treated exactly without irradiation. The DNA-damaging drugs AraC and cisplatin were added to the culture medium for the indicated times at a concentration of 50 μm. UV irradiation was carried out in a UV cross-linker (FB-UVXL-1000; Fisher); the culture medium was removed during irradiation. Control cells were treated exactly the same without irradiation. Cells were incubated for the indicated times, harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. When indicated, the cells were preincubated for 15 min with 100 μmgenistein or 200 nm wortmannin (stock solutions in Me2SO) before treatment. Control cells were mock-treated with Me2SO.Preparation of Total ExtractsCells were thawed in 0.5 ml of freshly prepared lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 nm okadaic acid) and protease inhibitors (40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) plus 1% Nonidet P-40. After 10 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. More than 95% of the γ-PAK was extracted as determined by Western blotting.Assay of γ-PAK and α-PAK Activity After Immunoprecipitationγ-PAK activity was assayed using histone 4 as substrate, after immunoprecipitation of the protein kinase with anti-γ-PAK N19 antibody. α-PAK activity was measured with myelin basic protein as substrate after immunoprecipitation with anti-α-PAK N20 antibody. The radioactivity incorporated into the protein substrates was quantified using a PhosphorImager system.JNK Activity AssayJNK activity was determined after precipitation of the protein kinase with glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads prepared as described (19Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo examine whether γ-PAK activity was affected by IR, exponentially growing 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts and U937 human leukemia cells were exposed to 5 and 100 Gy of γ-radiation using a137Cs source. After irradiation, the cells were incubated for 120 min in a CO2 incubator, and lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. γ-PAK activity was determined following immunoprecipitation of the protein kinase from cell extracts with histone 4 as substrate. Fig.1 A shows that 120 min after irradiation, γ-PAK activity in 3T3-L1 cells was increased about 2-fold at doses of 5 and 100 Gy. In U937 cells, a dose of 100 Gy induced a 4–5-fold increase in γ-PAK activity, whereas 5 Gy had no observable effect. As U937 cells undergo rapid apoptosis in response to IR, 3T3-L1 cells were chosen as a model for this study.The observed increase in γ-PAK activity in response to IR was both dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 1 B) with significant stimulation of activity observed at 30 min with doses of 1, 5, and 100 Gy, suggesting a physiologically modulated response. Maximum stimulation was observed 120 min after irradiation, as longer incubation times after irradiation did not result in further increase of γ-PAK activity (data not shown).When immunoprecipitates of γ-PAK were analyzed by Western blotting, the same amount of γ-PAK was detected in control and irradiated cells (Fig. 1 C, left panel), indicating a stimulation of γ-PAK activity in irradiated cells. This was supported further by the use of an anti-γ-PAK antibody (RR-1), which reacted preferentially with the regulatory domain (6Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) of highly autophosphorylated active γ-PAK. 3A. Gatti and J. A. Traugh, unpublished results. Although in response to IR no changes in total γ-PAK protein were detected with the N19 antibody (which recognizes both active and inactive γ-PAK), a higher level of γ-PAK immunoreactivity was observed with the RR-1 antibody in irradiated cells as compared with control cells (Fig.1 C, right panel). This indicated that IR stimulated γ-PAK autophosphorylation and activation.Doses of 1 and 5 Gy of IR resulted in a temporal slowing of the growth of 3T3-L1 cells; for doses of 20 and 100 Gy, the cells stopped dividing and accumulated in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. None of the doses of IR used in the experiments induced significant apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells, even 48-h post-irradiation. Accordingly, no γ-PAK activation by caspase cleavage was observed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against either the C or the N terminus of γ-PAK (data not shown).Although the primary cellular effect of IR is the induction of double strand DNA breaks, it also causes other changes (16Woloschak G.E. Koval T.M. Stress-inducible Processes in Higher Eukaryotic Cells. Plenum Press, New York1997: 185-219Crossref Google Scholar). To examine if DNA damage was the trigger for γ-PAK activation in response to IR, 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with two different DNA-damaging drugs or irradiated with increasing doses of UV, and γ-PAK activity was determined with histone 4 as substrate after immunoprecipitation. Cisplatin, which produces interstrand cross-links in the DNA (20Sherman S.E. Lippard S.J. J. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1153-1181Crossref Scopus (974) Google Scholar), was a potent activator of γ-PAK, with a 2.5- and 5-fold stimulation of activity after incubation for 30 and 120 min, respectively (Fig. 2). The antimetabolite AraC, which is incorporated into the DNA and produces termination of DNA synthesis (21Kufe D.W. Munroe D. Herrick D. Egan E. Spriggs D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 128-134PubMed Google Scholar), activated γ-PAK around 2.5-fold at both 30 and 120 min of incubation. UV, which induces mainly pyrimidine dimers in the DNA (18Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), activated γ-PAK up to 3-fold 120 min after irradiation at 80 J/m2, whereas 10 J/m2 had no effect on the protein kinase activity (Fig. 2). Neither DNA-damaging drugs nor UV resulted in cleavage of γ-PAK by caspase, as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, different types of DNA damage result in activation of γ-PAK, supporting the idea that DNA damage is the trigger of γ-PAK activation in response to IR.Figure 2Effects of UV radiation and the DNA-damaging drugs cisplatin and AraC on the activity of γ-PAK. 3T3-L1 cells were treated as described and γ-PAK activity was measured after immunoprecipitation using histone 4 as substrate. Right, histone 4 phosphorylated by γ-PAK immunoprecipitated from nontreated control cells (C), cells incubated with 50 μm cisplatin or AraC for 120 min (CisP, AraC), and cells irradiated with the indicated doses of UV and incubated for 120 min (UV).

Short incubation times were used to avoid a direct effect of wortmannin or genistein on γ-PAK activity. A significant inhibition of γ-PAK activation by IR (5 Gy) was observed when genistein or wortmannin were present (60 and 90%, respectively). Genistein and wortmannin also abolished activation of γ-PAK by AraC (65 and 100%, respectively). The PI3-kinase inhibitor Ly 294002 also inhibited γ-PAK activation by IR or AraC (data not shown), further supporting the involvement of PI3-kinase activity in the activation of γ-PAK. Cisplatin activation of γ-PAK was not affected by wortmannin and only slightly affected by genistein, whereas neither compound inhibited activation of γ-PAK by UV.Figure 3Effects of genistein and wortmannin on activation of γ-PAK by IR and other DNA-damaging agents. γ-PAK activity was determined with histone 4 as substrate after immunoprecipitation from 3T3-L1 cells.G, cells preincubated for 15 min with 100 μmgenistein; W, cells preincubated for 15 min with 200 nm wortmannin. IR, 5 Gy of IR, 30 min of incubation after irradiation; CisP, AraC, 50 μm cisplatin or AraC for 30 min; UV, 80 J/m2 of UV, 1 h of incubation after irradiation. The average value for three independent experiments ± S.E. is shown. Significant differences between control cells and cells treated with genistein or wortmannin are marked as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fact that both genistein and wortmannin interfered with the activation of γ-PAK by IR and AraC indicated that tyrosine kinase and PI3-kinase activity are essential upstream activators of γ-PAK in response to these DNA-damaging treatments. In contrast, UV and cisplatin activation of γ-PAK is independent of tyrosine kinase and PI3-kinase activity. This suggests the involvement of more than one pathway in the control of γ-PAK activity in response to different types of DNA damage.To determine whether γ-PAK activation in response to DNA damage was a general feature of other members of the PAK family, α-PAK activity was assayed after immunoprecipitation from control and treated 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 4 A). No activation of α-PAK in response to IR or AraC was observed, indicating that α-PAK and γ-PAK were differentially regulated. In contrast, α-PAK was activated 2.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively, by cisplatin and UV.Figure 4Effects of IR on α-PAK and JNK activity.

Thus, we examined whether JNK was activated in response to the different DNA-damaging treatments that were able to activate γ-PAK. No activation of JNK was observed in 3T3-L1 cells 120 min after irradiation with doses of 1, 5, or 100 Gy of IR, as determined by phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 4 B). Longer incubation times after irradiation (up to 6 h) did not induce JNK activation (data not shown). The DNA-damaging drugs cisplatin and AraC also failed to activate JNK significantly; in contrast, JNK was activated by UV (80 J/m2) in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 4 B). The data is consistent with results previously reported for NIH 3T3 cells, wherein IR doses up to 100 Gy failed to activate JNK, although inducing c-Abl activation or p53 accumulation (27Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in 3T3-L1 cells, stress-inducing agents like the drugs anisomycin and arsenite are able to activate JNK without any observable effect on γ-PAK activity (data not shown).DISCUSSIONγ-PAK is activated up to 5-fold during the early response to IR in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and U937 leukemia cells. This activation is time- and dose-dependent, and correlates with an increase in the amount of phosphorylated γ-PAK present in the cells. Caspase cleavage is not involved in the observed activation of γ-PAK, because no fragments of γ-PAK are detected by Western blotting. γ-PAK activation by IR is dependent on tyrosine kinase and PI3-kinase activity, as shown by use of the inhibitors genistein and wortmannin. A direct involvement of PI3-kinase (perhaps through activation of Cdc42) in the response to IR cannot entirely be ruled out, but wortmannin could also act through inhibition of the PI3-kinase-related enzymes DNA-dependent protein kinase or ATM. These protein kinases are known to have a central role in the early response to agents that induce DNA damage, such as IR (18Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other candidates for upstream activators of γ-PAK are the tyrosine kinases c-Abl and Lyn, which have been shown to be activated in response to IR (28Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 29Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because γ-PAK activation in vitro requires autophosphorylation of both the regulatory and catalytic domains of the enzyme (30Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Tuazon P.T. Chinwah M. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17024-17029Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Tuazon P.T. Roig J. Gatti A. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: A1490Google Scholar), the data suggest that autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases may be involved in activationin vivo.γ-PAK is activated in response to different types of DNA damage such as double strand breaks (IR), interstrand links (cisplatin), chain termination (AraC), and pyrimidine dimer formation (UV). Like IR, AraC activation of γ-PAK is dependent on PI3-kinase and tyrosine kinase activities; in contrast, activation by cisplatin and UV is not. This suggests that γ-PAK activity can be regulated by at least two different signaling pathways; one activated by IR and AraC, which requires PI3-kinase and tyrosine kinase activity, and another pathway activated by cisplatin and UV, which is not significantly affected by wortmannin and genistein. The data are consistent with the present knowledge of the response to DNA damage in mammalian cells, where IR and UV are known to activate different signaling pathways; the response to IR is dependent on the PI3-kinase-related enzymes DNA-dependent protein kinase and ATM, whereas the pathway activated by UV is not dependent on PI3-kinase-related enzymes (18Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Note that IR and AraC also activate the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, which is not activated by UV (27Liu Z.G.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7586-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Because all the studied DNA-damaging treatments stimulate γ-PAK activity, γ-PAK activation may be a common event in the cellular response to DNA damage. In eukaryotic cells, all types of DNA damage result in delayed progression through the cell cycle, with the G2/M transition checkpoint playing a major role in preventing cell division (15Bernhard E.J. Maity A. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1995; 34: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Rhind N. Russell P. Curr. Opin.

We propose that γ-PAK activation in response to IR and other DNA-damaging treatments is related to the cytostatic properties of the kinase and is part of the common cytostatic response activated by different types of DNA damage.Currently γ-PAK is the only mammalian PAK that, like the yeast PAK homologue Ste20, has been related to cell cycle arrest (7Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). α-PAK is not activated by IR or treatment with AraC, but it is activated by UV and cisplatin. Thus, the two different members of the PAK family can be activated by specific DNA-damaging agents, but activation of α-PAK is not a general response to DNA damage, as is γ-PAK activation. In contrast to γ-PAK, JNK is activated primarily by UV.This is the first time that members of the Ste20/PAK family of protein kinases have been shown to be involved in the cellular response to irradiation or treatment with DNA-damaging drugs. It is suggested that γ-PAK activation by IR and DNA damage is important in the cytostatic response elicited by these agents, as γ-PAK has been shown previously to induce cytostasis (7Rooney R.D.

It interacts with SH2-containing proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, Crk-II, and CrkL. In this study, we transfected IRS-4 in mouse NIH-3T3 cells that overexpress IGF-I receptors. Clones expressing IRS-4 showed enhanced cellular proliferation when cells were cultured in 1% fetal bovine serum without added IGF-I. Addition of IGF-I enhanced cellular proliferation in cells overexpressing the IGF-I receptor alone but had an even greater proliferative effect in cells overexpressing both the IGF-I receptors and IRS-4. When etoposide and methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), both DNA damaging agents, were added to the cells, they uniformly induced cell cycle arrest. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated that the arrest of the cell cycle occurred at the G1 checkpoint, and furthermore no significant degree of apoptosis was demonstrated with the use of either agent. In cells, overexpressing IGF-I receptors alone, IGF-I addition enhanced cellular proliferation, even in the presence of etoposide and MMS. In cells overexpressing IGF-I receptors and IRS-4, the effect of IGF-I in overcoming the cell cycle arrest was even more pronounced.

In cells overexpressing IGF-I receptors and IRS-4, the effect of IGF-I in overcoming the cell cycle arrest was even more pronounced. These results suggest that IRS-4 is implicated in the IGF-I receptor mitogenic signaling pathway.

Following ligand binding to their respective receptors, each hormone induces autophosphorylation of the receptor followed by activation of the tyrosine kinase activity inherent to these receptors.

Phosphorylated tyrosine residues in these molecules bind to the SH2 domains in other molecules, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling cascades. There are four members in the IRS family of proteins (IRS 1–4). IRS-1 contains about 20 tyrosine residues that form binding sites for molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, Nck and SH-PTP2, when phosphorylated (1Sun X.J. Rothenberg P.

This apparent redundancy in the IRS family of proteins is off-set by specificity in tissue and cellular distribution as well as unique features in each molecule that affect the interaction with upstream and downstream proteins. For example, there are differences in the domain that interacts with the insulin receptor in IRS-1 and IRS-2 (1Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A.

The lack of phenotype in the IRS-3 gene-deleted mice may be due to redundancy by the expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2. In the case of IRS-4, the absence of a phenotype is not too surprising since its expression in mice is so low (12Fantin V.R. Lavan B.E. Wang Q. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Keller S.R.

Using this system, we studied the effect of the expression of IRS-4 on IGF-I-induced cellular proliferation and the ability of IGF-I to overcome cell cycle arrest.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of IRS-4 Expression VectorhIRS-4 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using total RNA from HEK 293 cells as a template. Strategy and primers are described elsewhere. 2M. Karas, A. Koval, T., Chanturiya, and D. Le Roith, manuscript in preparation.Full-length IRS-4 cDNA was sub-cloned into the pCEFL hemagglutinin eukaryotic expression vector kindly provided by S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The construct was sequenced in full to ensure in-frame ligation. In addition, the sub-cloned IRS-4 cDNA was completely identical to the previously published IRS-4 sequence (4Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Kato H. Roberts C.T.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Life Technologies). The NWTB3 cell line established in this laboratory overexpresses the IGF-I receptor (∼ 4 × 105 receptors per cell). The IRS-4 expression vector was cotransfected with the pIRES1hygvector (CLONTECH) for colony selection. The ratio of pcDNA3.1·IRS4 to pIRES1hyg was 20:1, and the total DNA used per transfection was 6.3 μg. The pIRES1hyg vector alone was transfected into NWTB3 cells to generate the control cell lines. After 48 h of transfection, cells were digested with 0.05% Trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution and transferred to 150-mm tissue culture plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% FBS, 0.5 g/liter G418 and 0.2 g/liter hygromycin B. After selection for 2∼3 weeks, the colonies were picked and cultured for several weeks.The stable cell lines were screened by Western blot using a polyclonal anti-IRS-4 antibody (C-16) developed against1242DFARRDNQFDSPKRGR1257 region of the IRS-4 molecule. Cells were grown on 100-mm plates in the medium described above. Confluent cells were lysed in 0.6-ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated for three times for 5 s each, then centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was separated, and the total protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). IRS-4 and IGF-I receptor levels were detected in 20 μg of cell lysate by Western blot using an antibody against the IGF-I receptor β-subunit (IGF-IRβ C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an IRS-4 antibody.Cell ProliferationThe cell proliferation assay was performed using the CyQUANT Cell Proliferation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and HTS 7000 Bio Assay reader (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The NBS4 (cells overexpressing IGF-I receptors and IRS-4) and control cell lines (overexpressing only IGF-I receptors) were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. When flasks became confluent, cells were digested and counted using a Hemacytometer. Cells were seeded on 96-well Costar Cluster plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in 200 μl of DMEM medium with 10% FBS. For the standard curve, the cell number at baseline ranged from 2,500 to 40,000 per well. For the proliferation assay, cell number was 4,000 per well. After 16 h of incubation, medium was changed to DMEM with 1% FBS. For IGF-I stimulation, 50 nm human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) was added to the medium. For determining the cell cycle arrest induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and ES, 0.3 mm MMS and 0.25 μm ES were added to the medium, respectively, with or without 50 nmIGF-I. MMS is an SN2 type alkylating agent that predominantly methylates nitrogen atoms in purines. Among the methylated bases 3meA and 3meG are highly mutagenic and toxic. The excision of these lesions leads to the formation of apurinic (AP) sites and subsequently to AT→TA or GC→TA transversions. MMS induces activation of G1 checkpoint. Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor inducing cell cycle arrest (usually G2-M though some reports show also G1 arrest) or apoptosis when applied in high concentrations. The cells were incubated for an additional 5 days. Every 24 h the medium from one plate was aspirated, and then the plate was stored at −70 °C until all plates had been processed. The cells were then lysed with the lysis buffer from the CyQUANT kit. The fluorescence intensity of the DNA binding dye was measured using an HTS 7000 microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm.Flow CytometryAll analyses were carried out on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest Software (both from Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells were collected and washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, fixed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol, 30% saline buffer and stored at −20°C until analysis, when they were washed twice with PBS followed by incubation for 40 min in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 μg of RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at room temperature. Twenty μg of propidium iodide (Sigma) were added, and the suspension was incubated in the dark at room temperature for an additional 15 min, following which DNA staining was determined by flow cytometry.RESULTSOverexpression of IRS-4 in NBS4 Cell LineThe IRS-4 expression vector, pcDNA3.1·IRS4, containing the full-length of IRS-4 cDNA was transfected into the NWTB3 cell line (18Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts C.T.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) overexpressing human IGF-I receptors. After G418 and hygromycin B antibiotic selection, stable cell lines were established and designated as NBS4 (IGFIR plus IRS-4). To check protein expression level, lysates were prepared from NBS4 and control cells (IGFIR only) and were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with either anti-IGF-I receptor β-subunit antibody or anti-IRS-4 antibody. Fig. 1 shows the overexpression of both IRS-4 and IGF-I receptor in NBS4 cell lines. The IGF-I receptor typically appears as two bands, 90 and 200 kDa, which represent the β-subunit and its precursor, respectively (Fig. 1, panel A). IRS-4 runs as a 160-kDa band (Fig. 1, panel B). The control cells studied overexpress the IGF-I receptor but express very little endogenous IRS-4.IRS-4 Enhances IGF-I-stimulated Cell GrowthTo examine the effects of IRS-4 on cell growth, cell proliferation assays were carried out in the stable cell lines. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of rhIGF-I. Two NBS-4 cell lines were tested (clones 1 and 2). Only one example of the control cells studied is shown. The results are shown in Fig. 2 (panel A). Under basal conditions, i.e. using 1% FBS, both NBS-4 cell lines grew faster than the control cell line. For example, by 120 h of incubation, the number of control cells (C) increased 2.6 times, from a basal of 2,700 to 7,000. Cell number for NBS-4 clone 1 increased 3.6-fold, from a basal of 3,800 to 13,800, and clone 2 increased 7.1-fold, from a basal value of 3,600 to 25,500. Following 50 nm IGF-I stimulation, NBS-4 cells grew even faster than control cells. At 120 h of incubation, the number of control cells increased 5.7-fold, from a basal of 2,700 to 15,300. The NBS-4 clone 1 grew 10.9-fold, from a basal of 3,800 to 41,600, and clone 2 increased 13.7-fold, from a basal of 3,600 to 49,300. When the results (-fold increase of 120 h over basal level) of three independent experiments were combined and expressed as mean ± S.D. (panel B), IRS-4-expressing cells enhanced the increase in cell number significantly when compared with control cells both in the absence and presence of IGF-I (p < 0.05).Figure 2The effects of IRS-4 on IGF-I-stimulated cell growth. The cell proliferation assay was carried out using the CyQUANT Cell Proliferation kit. The NBS4 and control cells were seeded on 96-well Costar Cluster plates in 200 μl of DMEM medium with 10% FBS. After 16 h of incubation, medium was changed to DMEM with 1% FBS in the absence or presence of 50 nm human IGF-I (rhIGF-I). The cells were incubated for the indicated time and then lysed with the lysis buffer. The fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured using an HTS 7000 microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm.

Cell growth inhibitory effects of 0.3 mm MMS and 0.25 μm etoposide were not accompanied by apoptotic cell death as was evaluated by the absence of DNA fragmentation in treated cells (Fig. 3) but caused cell cycle arrest in G1 (data not shown). In contrast, strong apoptosis was demonstrated when both control and IRS-4-overexpressing cells were treated with high doses of 1 mm MMS and 10 μm etoposide.Figure 3MMS and etoposide treatment cause cell cycle arrest at low concentrations and cell death at very high concentrations. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 16 h of incubation, medium was changed to DMEM with 1% FBS, and cells were treated as indicated.

Fig. 4 shows that cells grew more slowly in the presence of MMS and ES than under normal conditions (compare results to Fig. 2). Again, both NBS-4 cell lines grew faster than the control cell line. At 120 h of incubation with MMS (Fig. 4, left panel, A) in the absence of IGF-I stimulation, the control cells grew 1.8-fold from 2,800 to 5,000. The NBS-4 clone 1 cells grew 2.6-fold, from 3,900 to 10,300, and clone 2 increased 3.7-fold, from 3,600 to 13,400. Following 50 nmIGF-I stimulation, the control cells grew 2.8-fold from 2,800 to 7,700. The NBS-4 clone 1 cells grew 6.7-fold, from 3,900 to 26,000, and clone 2 cells grew 6.7-fold, from 3,600 to 24,100. The results for ES (right panel, A) are similar to MMS. When the results (-fold increase of 120 h over basal level) of three independent experiments were combined and expressed as mean ± S.D. (panel B), IRS-4-expressing cells enhanced the increase in cell number significantly when compared with control cells both in the absence and presence of IGF-I (p < 0.05). These results indicate that IRS-4 enhances the ability of the cell to overcome cell cycle arrest induced by MMS and ES, in the presence or absence of IGF-I.Figure 4The effects of IRS-4 on MMS - and ES-induced cell cycle arrest. The experiments were performed as described in Fig. 2 except the addition of 0.3 mm MMS (left panel) and 0.25 μm of ES (right panel) to the medium, respectively, in the absence or presence of 50 nm IGF-I. ○, control cells, with added IGF-I; ●, control cells, without added IGF-I; ▿, clone 1 with added IGF-I; ▾, clone 1 without added IGF-I; ■, clone 2 with added IGF-I; ▪, clone 2 without added IGF-I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both control and IRS-4-overexpressing cells demonstrated low level of basal proliferation in the presence of MMS, as indicated by the low percentage of cells in S phase. IGF-I treatment was able to rescue this cell growth arrest in clone 1 as shown by an increase in S phase from 4 to 11% (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained for ES treatment (data not shown). These findings further support the results from the cell proliferation experiments with MMS and ES.Figure 5Cell cycle arrest by 0.3 mm of MMS and rescue by IGF-I . Cell were plated in 60-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

Subsequently numerous substrates of the insulin and IGF-I receptor have been identified, and the family of IRS molecules have enlarged. These protein substrates play key roles in signal transduction from the insulin and IGF-I receptors. In addition, IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been shown, at least in cell culture systems, to also play a role in signal transduction from many cytokine receptors including receptors for growth hormone and some interleukins (2Sun X.J.

Paul W.E. Pierce J.H. Stem Cells ( Dayton ). 1995; 13: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IRS-1 and IRS-2 interact with the NPX(p)Y motif in the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin and IGF-I receptors and potentially with the tyrosine kinase region (20Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All four IRS molecules have conserved plextrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains at their amino-terminal ends (1Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 2Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G.J. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21403-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The PH domain is apparently necessary for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation by the receptors even though this region of the IRS molecules do not appear to interact directly with the receptors. The PTB domains of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3, on the other hand, interact with the NPX(p)Y motif of both receptors. IRS-4 has conserved PH and PTB domains similar to those present in the other IRS molecules although their functions have not yet been evaluated. C-terminal to the PH and PTB domains are the SAIN domains (21Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers M.G.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), one in IRS-1 and two in IRS-2. The SAIN domains are non-PTB domains, which are also important for the interaction with the receptors. There is little conservation between the SAIN domains of the various IRS molecules.The C-terminal region of the IRS molecules contain multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. The tyrosine residues are in motifs that are expected to bind to proteins containing SH2 domains including PI3K, Grb2, and the tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 and phospholipase Cγ. While the C-terminal regions of the IRS molecules are poorly conserved, many of the tyrosine phosphorylation motifs in the C-terminal region are conserved. Indeed there are 20 in both IRS-1 and IRS-2, and about 12 in IRS-4. Many of these potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites are in YXXM motifs that bind to the SH2 domains of PI3-kinase. Other sites in IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-4 are expected to bind Grb2, SH-PTP2, and phospholipase Cγ. Thus studies have shown that IRS-1 binds PI3K, Grb2, and SH-PTP2, as well as Nck and Fyn, whereas IRS-2 associates with PI3K and Grb2. IRS-3 is a much smaller molecule than the others and binds PI3K, SH-PTP2 and only slightly with Grb2 (8Xu P. Jacobs A.R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15262-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Current research continues to identify the roles of individual IRS molecules in the signaling cascades of these receptors. The biological responses mediated by IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been extensively studied (22Ito T. Sasaki Y. Wands J.R. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, IRS-2 has similar in vitroeffects as for IRS-1, but IRS-2 gene-deleted mice showed insulin resistance and a diabetic phenotype (10Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J.

These results were interpreted as suggesting that in vivo IRS-1 may be responsible for IGF-I receptor signaling and IRS-2 responsible for insulin receptor signaling.

The enhancement of exocytosis was apparent after 12 h of hypoxia and was maximal at 24 h. Elevated levels of secretion were due to the emergence of a Ca2+ influx pathway that persisted during complete blockade of known voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Secretion triggered by this Ca2+ influx was severely reduced by known inhibitors of Alzheimer's amyloid β-peptides (AβPs), including an N terminus-directed monoclonal antibody. The enhancing effect on secretion of chronic hypoxia was mimicked closely by direct application of AβP to cells under normoxic conditions, although the effects of AβP were more rapid at onset, being maximal after only 6 h. The present results suggest that prolonged hypoxia can induce formation of Ca2+-permeable AβP channels and that such induction can lead directly to excessive neurosecretion.

This is a potential contributory factor to AβP pathophysiology following cerebral ischemia. Dementias in general and Alzheimer's disease in particular are more prevalent following periods of cerebral ischemia caused by cardiovascular dysfunctions such as stroke (1Tatemichi T.K. Paik M.

Ischemia is a complex condition, causing perturbations in several parameters that are essential to neuronal survival such as lack of substrates, accumulation of metabolic products, acidosis, and reduction of oxygen levels. However, the specific contributions of each of these factors to cellular dysfunction and death are presently unknown. A fundamental feature of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of fibrillar deposits consisting of amyloid β-peptides (AβPs) 1The abbreviations used are:AβPsamyloid β-peptidesAPPamyloid precursor proteinPBSphosphate-buffered saline (reviewed in Ref.4Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). AβPs are 40–42-amino acid peptides and are cleavage products derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) (5Glenner G.G.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). APP is one of only a few gene products whose expression is increased following a period of cerebral ischemia (7Kogure K. Kato H. Stroke. 1993; 24: 2121-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Koistinaho J. Pyykonen I. Keinanen R. Hokfelt T. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2727-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since APP is generally perceived to be neuroprotective, this increased expression of APP can be considered a defense mechanism against ischemia. However, increased APP levels seen in ischemia would also permit increased formation of AβPs, which cause neuronal damage and death (4Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar); and indeed, AβP production is increased following both mild and severe ischemia (9Yokota M. Saido T.C. Tani E. Yamaura I. Minami N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Jendroska K. Hoffmann O.M. Patt S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 826: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, a clear link exists between ischemic insult and elevation of damaging AβP levels. However, it remains completely unknown how ischemia might increase AβP levels, and the mechanism(s) by which AβPs cause cellular dysfunction and death remain speculative. amyloid β-peptides amyloid precursor protein phosphate-buffered saline Reduction of available O2 (hypoxia) is a key feature of ischemia. Hypoxia is known to exert a diverse range of responses in cells, each of which serves a specific physiological purpose (11Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 76: 839-885Crossref Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Acute hypoxia can evoke extremely rapid responses such as selective, membrane-delimited inhibition of ion channels (12Lopez-Barneo J. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 133-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Peers C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prolonged (chronic) hypoxia can alter gene expression and so, for example, permit increased production of erythropoietin (14Jelkmann W. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 449-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) or, in electrically excitable cells, tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis (15Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F.

In this study, we have utilized the catecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell to investigate the effects of both acute and chronic hypoxia on exocytosis, as determined in real time using amperometry (17Chow R.H. Von Ruden L. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-275Google Scholar). PC12 cells represent a well defined, model excitable cell system, which has been used extensively to study the effects of both acute and chronic hypoxia on various cellular processes, including ion channel activity and gene expression (16Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol.

PC12 cells have also been extensively characterized as a model system for studying exocytosis (21Kasai H. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 88-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our recent work has demonstrated that acute hypoxia evokes catecholamine release from PC12 cells by causing membrane depolarization and subsequent Ca2+ influx, primarily through N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (20Taylor S.C. Peers C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chronic mild hypoxia (10% O2 for 24 h) enhances this secretory response of PC12 cells to acute hypoxia (22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enhancement is in part due to increased expression of O2-sensitive K+ channels that influence membrane potential, but is also due to the emergence of a Ca2+ influx pathway that is resistant to known blockers of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present study was aimed at identifying this induced Ca2+ influx pathway, and our results indicate that chronic hypoxia increases evoked exocytosis by increasing the production of AβPs that form Ca2+-permeable membrane channels that are tightly coupled to exocytosis. Given the known increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease following ischemia as described above, these findings are likely to be of widespread importance in understanding causes and effects of increased dementias following ischemic insult. PC12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured as described previously (20Taylor S.C. Peers C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium (containing l-glutamine) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco, Paisley, Strathclyde, United Kingdom). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air, passaged every 7 days, and used for up to 20 passages. Cells used for experiments were transferred to smaller flasks in 10 ml of medium, to which was added 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma, Poole, UK; from a stock solution of 1 mm in ultrapure water), and were cultured for a further 72–96 h to enrich catecholamine stores (23Tischler A.S. Perlman R.L. Morse G.M. Sheard B.E. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells exposed to chronic hypoxia were treated identically, except that for 6–24 h prior to experiments, they were transferred to a humidified incubator equilibrated with 10% O2, 5% CO2, and 85% N2. Following this period in chronic hypoxia, cells were exposed to room air for no longer than 1 h before experimentation. Each experimental day, PC12 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and allowed to adhere for ∼1 h under either normoxic or hypoxic (10% O2) conditions, as required. Fragments of coverslip were then transferred to a recording chamber (volume of 80 μl), which was continually perfused under gravity (flow rate of 1–2 ml/min) with a solution of 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4; osmolarity adjusted to 300 mosm with sucrose, 21–24 °C). Ca2+-free solutions contained 1 mm EGTA and no added CaCl2. All drugs were applied in the perfusate except Congo red and the 3D6 antibody. Congo red was added to cells in culture for the final 3–4 h before plating. The 3D6 antibody was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in standard extracellular perfusate, and cells were exposed to this solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Exposure of cells to antibody-free perfusate under the same conditions was without effect on the ability of cells to secrete catecholamines in response to depolarization (data not shown). Hypoxic solutions were obtained by continually bubbling one or more of the reservoirs supplying the recording chamber with N2 as required. Hypoxic reservoirs were pre-equilibrated with N2 for at least 30 min before experiments. Carbon fiber microelectrodes (proCFE, Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) with a diameter of 5 μm were positioned adjacent to individual PC12 cells using a Narishige MX-2 micromanipulator and were polarized to +800 mV to allow oxidation of released catecholamine. Resulting currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (with extended voltage range), filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 2 kHz before computer storage. All acquisition was performed using a Digidata 1200 interface and Fetchex software from the pClamp 6.0.3 suite (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The same equipment was also used to monitorPO2 levels in the recording chamber, except that the polarity of the microelectrode was reversed to −800 mV (24Mojet M.H. Mills E. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1997; 504: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The time course of fall in PO2 in the recording chamber was highly reproducible and was stable after 1 min (between 17 and 23 mm Hg), and analysis of the effects of acute hypoxia was conducted 90 s after exchange to hypoxic perfusate. Unless otherwise stated, each experiment consisted of current recordings of a control period during which cells were perfused only with normoxic external medium. This was then exchanged for a test solution, and amperometric signals were recorded for a further period of 1–4 min. Catecholamine secretion was apparent as discrete spike-like events, each corresponding to the released contents of a single vesicle of catecholamine (17Chow R.H. Von Ruden L. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-275Google Scholar, 25Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kwagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.J. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). We did not distinguish between dopamine and noradrenaline, both known to be released from PC12 cells (26Kumar G.K. Overholt J.L. Bright G.R. Hui K.Y. Lu H. Gratzl M. Prabhakar N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1592-C1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); but secretory events were never seen unless the electrode was polarized and adjacent to a cell. Quantification of release was achieved by determining spike number or frequency using the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft Inc., Leonia, NJ). This allowed visual inspection of each event so that artifacts (due, for example, to solution switches) could be rejected from analysis. Results are presented as individual examples or means ± S.E., and statistical comparisons were made using unpaired Student's t test. To monitor [Ca2+]i, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (21–24 °C) in control perfusate solution containing 4 μm Fura-2/AM. Cells were then placed in a perfusion chamber exactly as described for amperometric recordings, and changes in [Ca2+]i were indicated by the fluorescence emitted at 510 nm due to alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm, using a Joyce-Loebl PhoCal apparatus (Applied Imaging Inc., Rochester, NY). Data are presented as ratio signals. Immunofluorescent labeling with the 3D6 antibody was performed with cells plated onto coverslips and subjected to normoxic or hypoxic conditions as described above. Cells were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min and then rinsed thoroughly in several changes of 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) over a period of 2 h. The coverslips were incubated with the 3D6 antibody (diluted to 0.5 or 2.0 μg/ml in PBS) in 24-well microtitration plates on a shaker for 18 h at 4 °C. After two 10-min rinses in PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h in a 1:200 dilution of Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). After two additional 10-min rinses in PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto glass microscope slides with glycerol/PBS, and the edges of the coverslips were fixed with clear nail polish. The cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope using a No. 10 (fluorescein) filter set. Photographs were taken using an Eastman Kodak MDS120 digital camera system. Exposure of PC12 cells to elevated extracellular [K+] (50 mm) evoked quantal catecholamine secretion, which was apparent as transient oxidative currents detected with a carbon fiber microelectrode (Fig.1 A). Release evoked by 50 mm K+ has previously been shown to be due to membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (20Taylor S.C. Peers C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Zhu W.H. Conforti L. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Millhorn D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C658-C665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and so could be completely inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or by application of the nonselective inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Cd2+ (Fig. 1 A). When cells were cultured in an environment of reduced O2 (10% instead of the normal 21%) for 24 h, secretion evoked by the same stimulus (50 mm K+) was significantly enhanced (Fig. 1 B), from an average exocytotic frequency of 0.83 ± 0.12 Hz (n = 26 cells) observed in control cells to 1.93 ± 0.16 Hz (n = 19; p < 0.001, unpaired t test). In both control cells (n = 70) and cells maintained in chronic hypoxia (n = 75), no secretion was detected until the cells were exposed to 50 mm K+ (data not shown). These findings for the effects of chronic hypoxia to enhance K+-evoked secretion are extremely similar to our previously reported effects of chronic hypoxia on the secretory responses to acute hypoxia (22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enhancement of evoked secretion from cells cultured under chronically hypoxic conditions remained entirely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ since removal of Ca2+ from the perfusate (replaced with 1 mm EGTA) caused complete cessation of exocytosis (Fig. 1 B, upper trace, representative of recordings from nine cells). However, Cd2+ (200 μm) was unable to prevent fully the secretory response to 50 mm K+ (Fig.1 B, lower trace, representative of 19 cells). In the presence of 200 μm Cd2+, secretion was significantly reduced (p < 0.002) to 0.72 ± 0.11 Hz. Thus, a period of chronic hypoxia induced an enhanced secretory response from PC12 cells that was entirely Ca2+-dependent, but ∼37% of which was resistant to Cd2+ (i.e. was not mediated by Ca2+ influx through known voltage-gated Ca2+channels). A Cd2+-resistant Ca2+ entry pathway induced by 24 h of hypoxia was also indicated by microfluorometric recordings, as shown in Fig. 2. For control cells (Fig. 2 A), bath application of solution containing 50 mm K+ caused a rapid and reversible rise of [Ca2+]i that could be attributed to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels since it was completely abolished by 200 μm Cd2+ (co-applied as indicated by thehorizontal bars in Fig. 2). By contrast, rises of [Ca2+]i measured in chronically hypoxic PC12 cells could only be reduced by ∼60% in the presence of 200 μm Cd2+ (Fig. 2 B). Mean changes in [Ca2+]i evoked by 50 mmK+ in control (open bars) and chronically hypoxic (closed bars) PC12 cells are summarized in Fig.2 C. To characterize further the Cd2+-resistant Ca2+influx pathway coupled to secretion that was apparent after chronic hypoxia, we tested the effects of other known blockers of Ca2+ influx pathways in cells previously maintained in hypoxia for 24 h. We have previously found that Cd2+-resistant secretion evoked in these cells by acute hypoxia could be significantly reduced by inorganic cations (22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These cations (Zn2+ and La3+) also reduced Cd2+-resistant secretion evoked by 50 mmK+ in chronically hypoxic PC12 cells (Fig.3). Furthermore, Cd2+-resistant release evoked by 50 mmK+ was also inhibited by Congo red (Fig. 3). Both Congo red and Zn2+ have been shown previously to inhibit AβP-mediated Ca2+ fluxes (29Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 30Rhee S.K. Quist A.P. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13379-13382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting the surprising possibility that a 24-h period of hypoxia induced formation of Ca2+-permeable AβP channels that coupled closely to exocytosis. In further support of this, we found that exposure of cells to a monoclonal antibody (3D6) raised against the extracellularly located N′ terminus of AβP, anti-AβP-(1–5) (30Rhee S.K. Quist A.P. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13379-13382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H.

A. 1997; 94: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), for 1 h at 37 °C also significantly suppressed the Cd2+-resistant component of the secretory response (Fig.3). Similar inhibition of Cd2+-resistant secretion evoked in response to acute hypoxia (PO2 ∼ 20 mm Hg) was also found with Congo red and the 3D6 antibody (data not shown). Immunocytochemical labeling of cells with the 3D6 antibody demonstrated specific binding of this antibody to cells previously exposed to chronic hypoxia for 24 h (Fig.4 A). This was seen as diffuse fluorescence over most of the surface area of each cell. This was a consistent pattern of labeling in all cells examined (>100) at both concentrations of the antibody tested (0.5 and 2.0 μg/ml), and this is exemplified by comparison of the phase-contrast image of the same cells (Fig. 4 B). Fluorescent labeling was detectable only at very low levels in the normoxic cells processed under identical conditions (Fig. 4 C; phase-contrast view of the same image shown in Fig. 4 D). If chronic hypoxia did indeed induce formation of AβP channels that coupled to exocytosis, we anticipated that direct application of AβPs to normoxically cultured cells would mimic the effects of chronic hypoxia. Therefore, in a separate series of experiments, we exposed cells to 100 nm AβP-(1–40) for 24 h under normoxic conditions (21% O2). These AβP-treated cells secreted catecholamines in response to both acute hypoxia and raised K+ levels (Fig.5 A). Like both control and chronically hypoxic cells, they showed no spontaneous exocytosis under normoxic, non-depolarizing conditions (n = 47 cells; data not shown). Secretion evoked by either 50 mmK+ or acute hypoxia was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than in control cells (TableI) and was wholly dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and a substantial fraction was resistant to Cd2+ (Fig. 5 A; see also TableI); such effects of AβP treatment were extremely similar, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to the effects of chronic hypoxia (see above). Furthermore, the Cd2+-resistant component of the secretory response displayed the same sensitivity to other blockers as was observed in cells kept chronically hypoxic for 24 h, including the 3D6 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5 B). These findings strongly support the idea that chronic hypoxia appeared to induce formation of AβPs tightly coupled to exocytosis.Table IEffects of β-amyloid treatment on secretory responses and their modulation by Ca2+ removal or application of Cd2−Stimulus[Ca2+]o[Cd2+]oExocytotic frequencyNo. of cells testedmmmmHzFor β-amyloid-treated cellsAcute hypoxia2.501.05 ± 0.128Acute hypoxia0007Acute hypoxia2.50.20.46 ± 0.09ap < 0.003 versus respective controls.650 mm K+2.502.92 ± 0.41950 mmK+000850 mm K+2.50.20.82 ± 0.07bp < 0.0001 versus respective controls.9Cells were exposed for 21–26 h to 100 nm AβP-(1–40) under normoxic conditions.

The mean ± S.E. exocytotic frequency, evoked by acute hypoxia (PO2 ∼20 mm Hg) or 50 mm K+, was determined from the number of cells indicated. The incomplete inhibition of secretion caused by Ca2+ in AβP-treated cells was statistically significant (see Footnotes a and b). Fig. 6 illustrates the time course of emergence of Cd2+-resistant, K+-evoked secretion in cells either kept chronically hypoxic (open circles) or exposed to 100 nm AβP-(1–40) (closed circles). It is clear from this figure that exposure to hypoxia for up to 6 h was without effect on the secretory responses to 50 mm K+ (closed circles). Thereafter, the Cd2+-resistant component of secretion increased steeply for cells exposed to chronic hypoxia for between 12 and 24 h. This component of the secretory response then declined gradually following 30–48 h of exposure to hypoxia. These findings indicate that enhancement of secretion caused by the ability of hypoxia to induce Cd2+-resistant, Ca2+-dependent secretion was transient in nature and was maximal after 24 h of chronic hypoxia. By contrast, in cells treated with AβP-(1–40), Cd2+-resistant secretion was apparent even after 1 h of treatment, was maximal at 6 h, and remained approximately constant for up to 24 h, after which time point there was a gradual decline in this component of secretion. Thus, there was a clear lag in the emergence of Cd2+-resistant, K+-evoked secretion induced by hypoxia as compared with AβP-(1–40)-treated cells. Prolonged periods of hypoxia are well known to alter gene expression and hence functional expression of numerous proteins (11Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 76: 839-885Crossref Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Several groups have documented altered levels of ion channel expression (particularly K+ channel expression) following periods of chronic hypoxia in tissues such as pulmonary vascular smooth muscle (32Smirnov S.V. Robertson T.P. Ward J.P.T. Aaronson P.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H365-H370PubMed Google Scholar) and the carotid body (33Wyatt C.N. Wright C. Bee D. Peers C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we investigated the effects of prolonged hypoxia on the secretory responses of PC12 cells to both acute hypoxia and raised extracellular [K+] since these cells have been used extensively as a model system for studying the effects of chronic hypoxia on gene expression (16Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F.

( Lond. ). 1997; 502: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As anticipated from these previous studies, we found that PC12 cells released more vesicles of catecholamine when stimulated by either acute hypoxia or exposure to tetraethylammonium (via blockade of O2-sensitive K+ channels) and that each vesicle contained greater amounts of catecholamine (22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) due to increased levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (16Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What was completely unexpected, however, was the emergence of a Ca2+ influx pathway coupled to secretion that was not attributable to any of the known voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (L-, N-, or P/Q-type (34Liu H. Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7557-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) present in PC12 cells (28Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This study provides compelling evidence that this pathway is due at least in part to Ca2+-permeable channels formed by AβPs. Thus, in the presence of a supramaximal concentration of Cd2+ to block voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, residual secretion (constituting ∼37% of total secretion in response to 50 mm K+), arising from Ca2+influx as indicated by microfluorometric recordings (Fig. 2), was further reduced by known blockers of AβPs, including Zn2+, Congo red, and the 3D6 monoclonal antibody (Fig.3). AβPs are neurotoxic products associated with Alzheimer's disease (4Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying neuronal toxicity caused by AβPs are complex and remain to be fully resolved, although most evidence indicates that toxicity involves AβP disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (4Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 35Fraser S.P. Suh Y.-H. Djamgoz M.B.A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There is also strong evidence that toxicity is oxidative and involves free radical damage (36Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar, 37Schubert D. Behl C. Lesley R. Brack A. Dargusch R. Sagara Y. Kimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1989-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 38Behl C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). An alternative (or perhaps additional) hypothesis indicates that AβPs disrupt intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by forming Zn2+-sensitive, Ca2+-permeable channels (39Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,40Kawahara M. Arispe N. Kuroda Y. Rojas E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Such an effect may account for increased central synaptic activity. Indeed, enhancement of long-term potentiation and elevated glutamate release have been demonstrated in hippocampal neurons exposed to AβPs in vitro (41Arias C. Arrieta I. Tapia R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 42Wu J. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 284: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is possible that hypoxic induction of AβPs enhanced secretion by altering the activity of native voltage-gated Ca2+channels, acting in a manner comparable to an auxiliary subunit (43Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, we consider this unlikely; Cd2+ is a Ca2+ channel pore blocker (i.e. it binds to similar regions within the pore-forming α subunit of Ca2+channels), and it is highly unlikely that interaction of AβPs with native Ca2+ channels could cause conformational changes that would render the pore Cd2+-insensitive, yet more permeable to Ca2+ (to allow greater influx to account for greater secretory responses). We have not addressed the possibility that AβPs could also act intracellularly to modulate secretory responses, and such studies are worthy of future investigation. The simplest interpretation of our present findings, particularly in light of the knowledge that AβPs have been demonstrated to form Ca2+ permeable channels in membranes (see above), is that chronic hypoxia causes formation, in the plasma membrane, of Ca2+-permeable AβP channels, which permit Ca2+ entry sufficient to trigger exocytosis. This interpretation also raises the further question of gating: following chronic hypoxia or direct application of AβPs to PC12 cells, there was no detectable basal secretion, and cells required stimulation (by either acute hypoxia or 50 mm K+) before enhanced secretion was observed, indicating that this Ca2+influx pathway was voltage-dependent. This finding contrasts with studies in which AβPs were inserted into planar lipid bilayers: the channels formed did not display marked voltage dependence (39Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We cannot account for this discrepancy at present, but it should be noted that L-type Ca2+ channels (which always display strong voltage dependence in cells), when purified and inserted into lipid bilayers, also display very little voltage dependence over a wide range of potentials (44Pelzer D. Grant A.O. Cavalie A. Pelzer S. Sieber M. Hofman F. Tautwein W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 138-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, marked functional differences in channel activity when observed in lipid bilayers compared with cell membranes are to be expected. It is noteworthy that the known blockers of AβPs failed to inhibit completely the Cd2+-resistant secretion in cells previously exposed to chronic hypoxia (Fig. 3). This suggests that formation of Ca2+-permeable AβP channels might not account fully for the Cd2+-resistant Ca2+ influx pathway. Interestingly, these blockers also failed to inhibit fully the Cd2+-resistant secretion observed in cells pretreated with AβP-(1–40) (Fig. 5). We cannot at present account for this incomplete blockade. Nevertheless, our present findings indicate that AβPs provide a Ca2+ influx pathway that can specifically trigger exocytosis. It should be noted that only Ca2+influx specifically through N-type voltage-gated Ca2+channels, but not L- or P/Q-type channels, influences depolarization-evoked exocytosis in control PC12 cells (20Taylor S.C. Peers C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Taylor S.C. Peers C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility of an intimate association of AβPs with vesicle docking/fusion sites in a manner that may compare with the interaction of known voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and synaptic proteins (43Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Most important, we have demonstrated that reduced O2 levels alone can induce formation of AβP-mediated Ca2+ influx. As described in the Introduction, AβPs are the cleavage products derived from amyloid precursor protein (5Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 6Masters C.L. Multhaup G. Simms G. Pottgiesser J. Martins R.N. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), and levels of this precursor have been shown to increase following ischemia (9Yokota M. Saido T.C. Tani E. Yamaura I. Minami N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Jendroska K. Hoffmann O.M. Patt S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 826: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The enhanced Ca2+influx reported here may therefore be an important contributory factor to the increased incidence of dementias and amyloid deposition following cerebral ischemia, leading to neurotoxicity through excessive transmitter release.

(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17901–17909). The mechanism of PKC action and the location of the PKC target site are not known. Moreover, uncertainties in the genomic sequence of the N-terminal region of α1Cleave open the question of the presence of RH-type N terminus in L-type channels in mammalian tissues. Here, we demonstrate the presence of α1C protein containing an RH-type initial N-terminal segment in rat heart and brain by using a newly prepared polyclonal antibody. Using deletion mutants of α1C expressed inXenopus oocytes, we further narrowed down the part of the N terminus crucial for both inhibitory gating and for PKC effect to the first 20 amino acid residues, and we identify the first 5 aa as an important determinant of PKC action and of N-terminal effect on gating. The absence of serines and threonines in the first 5 aa and the absence of phosphorylation by PKC of a glutathioneS-transferase-fusion protein containing the initial segment suggest that the effect of PKC does not arise through a direct phosphorylation of this segment. We propose that PKC acts by attenuating the inhibitory action of the N terminus via phosphorylation of a remote site, in the channel or in an auxiliary protein, that interacts with the initial segment of the N terminus.

Voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels regulate contraction of cardiac and smooth muscle and excitability and gene expression in the brain (2Snutch T.P. Reiner P.B. Curr. Opin.

The existence of several cDNA isoforms and the genomic sequence of the α1C DNA suggest the presence of splice variants of RNA and thus of several isoforms of the α1Cprotein (6Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T.

The initial 46 aa of the N terminus of rabbit heart (RH) α1Care crucial for PKC modulation (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cytosolic N-terminal part of RH α1C is 154 aa long. Deletion of the first 40 aa or more causes a 5–10-fold increase in the current via RH-type Ca2+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,31Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). This is a result of a change in channel gating because the truncation causes an increase in open probability, without increasing the amount of α1C protein in the plasma membrane (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These and additional findings led us to propose that the N terminus of α1C acts as an inhibitory gate, and its removal enhances channel activation; PKC increases the current by attenuating the inhibitory action of the N terminus (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is not known whether PKC phosphorylates the N terminus. Despite the importance of the first 46 aa of the RH-type N terminus, its presence in L-type channel proteins in vivo remains uncertain. The only other cDNA of α1C containing a stretch encoding this protein sequence is that cloned from rat aorta and heart (6Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that these variations correspond to splice variants of the α1C gene (7Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but even this is not certain. The structure of the genomic DNA of human α1C has not been fully resolved in this region; none of the known exons correspond to the RH-type N terminus (8Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study that utilized an RNase protection assay showed that RNA of the RH-type initial segment is predominant in human heart (35Yang Y. Chen X. Houser S.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A431Google Scholar). These discrepancies make it important to clarify whether L-type Ca2+ channel isoforms with the RH-type N terminus are common in mammalian tissues. Here we demonstrate the abundance of the RH-type N terminus in rat heart and brain and map the segment critical for PKC modulation and for inhibition of gating to the very beginning of the N terminus. Our results strongly suggest that PKC effect is not mediated by phosphorylation of this initial segment. cDNAs and RNAs of RH α1C and α2/δ were as described (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y.

The cDNA constructs of the GST fusion proteins of the whole N terminus (N1–154) and of the loop I-II were described previously (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol.

The cDNAs for N47–154 and N87–154 (encoding the corresponding α1Csegments) were made by a PCR procedure and inserted intoEcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and thus linked in-frame to GST. N1–46(S44A), with serine 44 replaced by alanine, and a cDNA for N(neuronal)1–124, encoding aa 1–124 of rat brain rbCII α1C isoform (7Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M.

All PCR products were sequenced at the Tel Aviv University Sequencing Facility. Fusion proteins were generated by transformation into Escherichia coli strain BL-21 (Stratagene) followed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside and affinity purification with GST beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with 15 or 20 mm reduced glutathione. In the preparation of N1–46(S44A), protease inhibitors were used: aprotinin (10 μg/ml), benzamidine (5 mm), Pefabloc SC (0.2 mm), and EDTA (1 mm). N1–46(S44A) was additionally dialyzed to 0.1 mammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, aliquoted, and lyophilized. Materials and enzymes for molecular biology were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Promega, or MBI Fermentas. Xenopus laevis frogs were maintained and dissected as described (37Shistik E.

Oocytes were injected with equal amounts (by weight) of the mRNAs of α1C or its mutants, of α2/δ, and, in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 F, of β2A (2.5 ng for electrophysiological, 5 ng for biochemical experiments) and incubated for 3–5 days at 20–22 °C in NDE96 solution (96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm Na-pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Whole cell currents were recorded using the Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in a solution containing 40 mmBa(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.5 with methanesulfonic acid (37Shistik E.

Stimulation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). Ba2+ currents were measured by a 200-ms step to 20 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. To study the effect of PMA (10 nm; Sigma), the voltage pulses were delivered every 10–20 s (see Ref. 1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar for details of PMA use). Card-I and Card-C antibodies were kindly provided by M. M. Hosey (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) (38Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A new antibody (Card-N) was raised against the GST fusion protein N1–46(S44A). Two New Zealand female rabbits were immunized with 0.3 mg of N1–46(S44A) in complete Freund's adjuvant, and reimmunized monthly with 0.2 mg of N1–46(S44A) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Blood samples were taken 10 days after the immunization. The specific antibodies in the sera were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on immobilized N1–46(S44A), in the presence of excess of soluble GST (20 μg/ml). The reacting sera were chosen for antibody purification. Immobilized N1–46S44A, GST, and E. coli lysate were prepared using Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Crude IgG fraction was prepared from the serum by 50% saturation (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and dialyzed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To eliminate anti-GST antibodies, the IgG fraction was incubated with GST beads (Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The bound material was eluted with 4.5m MgCl2. The procedure was repeated with the unbound material several times until no antibodies were eluted from GST beads. To eliminate antibodies against possible contaminating bacterial proteins, the same procedure was performed with immobilized heat-shocked E. coli lysate proteins. The unbound material was applied to N1–46S44A-GST beads (Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad), incubated 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and eluted with 3.5 m MgCl2. The eluted antibodies were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% NaN3. Immunochemistry was performed as described (37Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with mRNAs and incubated in NDE solution containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3–4 days at 22 °C. 5 oocytes were homogenized, and proteins were solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Tissues from 3-week old Wistar rats were frozen in liquid N2, crushed while frozen, and homogenized on ice in a buffer (0.32m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris) containing the Roche Molecular Biochemicals protease inhibitor mixture. Crude membranes were prepared by centrifugations at 4 °C (two times at 1100 × g for 10 min to remove the debris and the nuclei, and then for 1 h at 100,000 × g) and resuspension of the pellet in the above buffer. The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford assay. The membranes were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein samples (35 μg per lane) were separated on 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting with the various antisera at the following dilutions: Card-C, 1:1000; Card-I, 1:375; Card-N, 1:750 or 1:1000. The filters were visualized using the SuperSignal Substrate kit (Pierce). The procedure was as described by Kozasa and Gilman (39Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 8 μg of each GST-fusion protein were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 1 μl of α-, β-, γ-PKC mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 125 μm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol), 10 μg/ml phosphatidylserine-diolein (Sigma), 0.05% CHAPS. The products were precipitated in 3 volumes of ethanol at −20° for 1 h. 32P-radiolabeled fusion proteins were separated on an 8% acrylamide Laemmli gel containing 0.1% SDS, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. A polyclonal antibody (Card-N) directed against a GST fusion protein of the first 46 aa of the RH-type α1C N terminus was raised in rabbit (since a GST-fusion construct containing the WT 46 aa of RH α1C appeared to degrade in the course of bacterial synthesis, Card-N was actually raised against a more stable fusion protein, N1–46(S44A), in which serine 44 was mutated to alanine). Card-N was compared with two previously characterized antibodies, Card-I (against residues 812–929 of the II-III domain linker) and Card-C (against residues 2156–2169 in the end of the C terminus) (37Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Card-N immunoprecipitated the WT RH α1C protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Fig.1 A, lane 2), but not the truncated mutant missing the first 46 aa, α1CΔN2–46 (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Card-I and Card-C immunoprecipitated both the WT α1C and α1CΔN2–46 (Fig. 1,A and B); the level of expression of the full-length α1C was higher than that of α1CΔN2–46 (Fig. 1 B), as reported previously (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Card-C precipitated the WT channel more efficiently than Card-N (Fig. 1 A). No35S-labeled α1C was detected in oocytes that were not injected with RNA by any of the antibodies (Fig. 1,A and B). The fact that bands of the same size of WT α1C are detected by antibodies directed to the extreme N and C termini and a mid-portion of the channel supports the notion (37Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that the oocyte expresses the whole-length protein not truncated at any of its termini. Notably, under the conditions used here, the WT α1C protein runs on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as an ∼207-kDa band, as reported previously in the oocytes (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the calculated molecular mass of this protein is ∼242 kDa (36Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), the error (underestimate) of its size is about 35 kDa. The underestimation may result from the established fact that hydrophobic proteins tend to run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels faster than standard, water-soluble molecular mass markers (40Takagi T. Adv. Electrophoresis. 1991; 4: 391-406Google Scholar). Western blots of rat ventricle membranes with Card-N revealed a major band at ∼207 kDa and a minor band at ∼160 kDa; labeling of both bands was completely suppressed in the presence of the N1–46(S44A) GST-fusion protein against which the antibody was raised (Fig. 1 C). This result confirms the specificity of Card-N and demonstrates, for the first time on the protein level, the presence of an RH-type initial segment in the N terminus of α1C in the rat heart. Western blots of rat heart (ventricle), brain, and liver were done with all three antibodies (Fig. 1 D). Card-C antibody detected an ∼207-kDa band in the ventricle. A higher, ∼240-kDa band was observed in all tissues. However, we cannot discard the possibility that this labeling is nonspecific because this band was not detected by the other two antibodies. The Card-I and Card-N antibodies detected the ∼207-kDa band in ventricle and in the brain, although labeling with Card-I was weak. This may be because of sequence divergence between the rabbit cardiac α1C and isoforms of rat brain channel that show variability in the loop II-III (41Khan I. Ahmad S. Thomas N. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 45: 895-904PubMed Google Scholar). With Card-N, the intensity of this band varied in different blots, and in some instances it was even stronger in the brain than in the ventricle (data not shown). Because brain α1C was not detected by Card-C but detected by Card-N, the very end of the C terminus in a majority of brain α1C protein may be missing or different from the cardiac one. An additional band at ∼160 kDa was detected in the liver by Card-I and Card-N but not by Card-C; Card-N detected a similar band in the ventricle. These results support the notion (42Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that only a small percentage of the L-type channel in the heart is truncated at the end of its C terminus (see also Ref. 43Yoshida A. Takahashi M. Nishimura S. Takeshima H. Kokubun S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The actual size of the truncated protein is probably higher than 160 kDa because of the underestimation of the size by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in our conditions. Because α1C RNA has been found in whole liver but not in hepatocytes (44Brereton H.M. Harland M.L. Froscio M. Petronijevic T. Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the ∼160-kDa protein may be present in nonhepatocyte tissues, e.g. in the blood vessels. The main conclusion of this part of the study is that α1Cprotein containing the RH-type N terminus is present in rat heart and brain, and the L-type Ca2+ current in these tissues can be expected to be stimulated by PKC. The variability of PKC effects on neuronal L-type channels (23Yang J. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 10: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Kleppisch T. Klinz F.J.

Pitler T.A. Alger B.E. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4069-4078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may result from the presence of different isoforms of α1C in different neuronal cell types. Deletion of the first 46 aa residues of the α1C, which are unique to the RH-type N terminus (Fig. 2 A), increases the Ca2+ channel current and also eliminates the PKC-induced augmentation (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The effects of deletions shorter than 40 aa have not been studied (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 45Wei X. Pan S. Lang W. Kim H. Schneider T. Perez Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27106-27111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To narrow down the segment crucial for PKC effect, we have prepared three additional deletion mutants: α1CΔN2–5, α1CΔN2–20, and α1CΔN2–25, lacking aa 2–5, 2–20, and 2–25, accordingly. All truncated channels produced whole-cell currents 3–10-fold larger than WT in >5 oocyte batches. For a quantitative comparison, RNAs of WT and of four deletion mutants were prepared on the same day, in parallel, and injected (together with α2/δ subunit) into oocytes of the same donor. Fig.2 B shows that deletion of the first 20 aa was sufficient to cause a maximal current increase, similar to that produced by the deletion of 46 or 139 aa. Deletion of aa 2–5 also significantly (p < 0.01) increased the current but less well than of 20 or more aa. Because coexpression of the β2A subunit increased WT currents better than those of N-terminal truncation mutants α1CΔN2–46 and α1CΔN2–139, we proposed that part of β2A-induced enhancement is because of an allosteric hindrance of the N-terminal inhibition of gating (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 F shows that the enhancement of peak currents of α1CΔN2–5and α1CΔN2–20 caused by coexpression of β2A is also weaker than that of the WT channels; this was observed at all voltages. Thus, the first 20 aa are crucial for the inhibitory effect of the N terminus on L-type channel gating and on its interaction with β2A, and the first 5 aa constitute an important component. Fig. 2 shows representative current traces (Fig. 2 C) and time course of the effect of the phorbol ester PMA (Fig. 2 D) in oocytes expressing WT, ΔN2–5, or ΔN2–20 α1C (with the α2/δ subunit). Two oocyte batches in which the WT channel showed high sensitivity to PMA, and the Ca2+ channel current was increased 1.6–4-fold (summarized in Fig. 2 E), have been used in these experiments. The removal of aa 2–5 reduced the PMA effect by more than 90%; the remaining increase (13 ± 4.4%; mean ± S.E.) was small but statistically significant (p < 0.02). Channels lacking the first 20 aa were insensitive to PMA (6.4 ± 8.1%). Thus, the first 5 aa are very important, and the first 20 aa are crucial for the PKC effect. Based on effects of PKC activators and inhibitors, the effect of PMA is expected to result from a PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation (21Bourinet E. Fournier F. Lory P. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because none of the first 5 aa of α1C are serines or threonines (Fig. 2 A), it is not possible that PKC directly phosphorylates this segment. None of the residues in the first 20 aa is a consensus PKC site, but a cryptic site (T10 or S18) might be a target for PKC. Therefore, we have examined in vitro phosphorylation by purified PKC of GST-fusion proteins of segments of the N terminus: N1–46(S44A), N1–154 (the whole N terminus), N47–154, and N84–154. As controls, we used GST and the GST fusion proteins of the loop I-II of RH α1C and of the N terminus of the rat brain α1C, N(neuronal)1–124. Fig.3 shows that N1–154 and N47–154 were strongly phosphorylated; weaker signals were observed in N87–154 and in N(neuronal)1–124. GST alone, N1–46(S44A), and loop I-II were not phosphorylated. Thus, the first 20 aa, contained within the GST fusion protein N1–46(S44A), are not phosphorylated under these conditions, whereas other parts of the N terminus are. The physiological significance of the phosphorylation of these distal parts of the N terminus is unclear at present. In summary, our results demonstrate the presence of α1Cprotein isoform(s) containing an RH-type N terminus in rat heart (ventricle) and brain. Further, we have demonstrated that the initial 20 amino acids are crucial both for the inhibitory gating by the N terminus, the allosteric interaction of the N terminus with the β subunit, and for the PKC effect. Removal of the first 5 aa already strongly hampers the inhibitory function of the N terminus and almost fully abolishes the PKC effect. The correlation between the location of residues crucial for these two functions supports the hypothesis (1Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that PKC exerts its stimulating action by attenuating the inhibition imposed on the channel by the N terminus. Determination of the mechanism of PKC action is a challenge for the future. Our data suggest that the effect of PKC is not attained by a direct phosphorylation of the initial 20 aa of the N terminus. This conclusion is supported both by the amino acid composition of this segment, especially of the first 5 aa crucial for PKC action, and by the absence of phosphorylation of the GST fusion protein containing the initial segment. What can be the mechanism of PKC action? There are at least two possibilities. PKC may phosphorylate a site at α1C which is remote from the initial N-terminal segment but interacts with it directly or allosterically. If such interaction is permissive for N-terminal effect on gating (inhibition), phosphorylation by PKC may weaken the inhibition. Another possibility is that PKC phosphorylates an auxiliary protein, yet unidentified, which either aids the N-terminal inhibition (and the phosphorylation obstructs this effect), or attenuates the N-terminal inhibition when phosphorylated by PKC.

This result was achieved by combining an arginine shift mutation (Y225R/R386A) with a conservative substitution of a substrate-binding residue (R292K). In the wild-type enzyme, Arg386 interacts with the α-carboxylate group of the substrate and is one of the four residues that are invariant in all aminotransferases; Tyr225 is in its vicinity, forming a hydrogen bond with O-3′ of the cofactor; and Arg292interacts with the distal carboxylate group of the substrate. In the triple-mutant enzyme, k cat′ for β-decarboxylation of l-aspartate was 0.08 s−1, whereas k cat′ for transamination was decreased to 0.01 s−1. AspAT was thus converted into an l-aspartate β-decarboxylase that catalyzes transamination as a side reaction. The major pathway of β-decarboxylation directly produces l-alanine without intermediary formation of pyruvate. The various single- or double-mutant AspATs corresponding to the triple-mutant enzyme showed, with the exception of AspAT Y225R/R386A, no measurable or only very low β-decarboxylase activity. The arginine shift mutation Y225R/R386A elicits β-decarboxylase activity, whereas the R292K substitution suppresses transaminase activity. The reaction specificity of the triple-mutant enzyme is thus achieved in the same way as that of wild-type pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes in general and possibly of many other enzymes, i.e. by accelerating the specific reaction and suppressing potential side reactions.

In the engineering of protein catalysts with new functional properties, the modification of existing enzymes provides an alternative to the production of catalytic antibodies or, in a more distant future, the de novo design of enzymes. Enzyme engineering may be expected to contribute to elucidating both the structural basis of the functional properties and the course of the molecular evolution. Several attempts to change the substrate specificity of an enzyme by substitution of the substrate-binding residues have succeeded (Refs. 1Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Freeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H.

A change in the reaction specificity may be claimed if a new catalytic activity not inherent in the wild-type enzyme is generated and the original activity of the wild-type enzyme is suppressed to a level significantly below that of the new activity. aspartate aminotransferase pyridoxal 5′-phosphate PLP (vitamin B6)-dependent enzyme pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate The pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes (B6 enzymes) catalyze numerous reactions in the metabolism of amino acids. The B6 enzymes are of multiple evolutionary origin and constitute a few families of homologous proteins of which the α-family is by far the largest (11Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The enzyme members of the α-family, which includes AspAT, not only possess similar protein scaffolds, but most of them also share the first two steps of the reaction pathway (for a succinct introduction into PLP-dependent reaction pathways, see Ref. 12Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1977: 444-461Google Scholar). The amino group of the incoming substrate replaces the ε-amino group of the active-site lysine residue, the internal aldimine 1 (see Scheme FS1), thus being followed by the external aldimine intermediate2, which is then deprotonated at C-α to give the quinonoid intermediate 3. Only in the subsequent step do the reaction pathways of the different B6 enzymes diverge, leading to racemization, transamination, β- and γ-elimination and replacement. It seems therefore feasible to make the quinonoid intermediate3 in a given enzyme adopt an alternative reaction course by substituting few critical active-site residues. Aspartate aminotransferase is the most extensively studied B6 enzyme. The homodimeric enzyme (2 × 400 amino acid residues) catalyzes the reversible transfer of the amino group of aspartate or glutamate to the cognate oxo acids. A detailed mechanism of action has been derived from combined biochemical and crystallographic data (13Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we have generatedl-aspartate β-decarboxylase activity in AspAT ofEscherichia coli by introducing a double active-site mutation (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). AspAT Y225R/R386A β-decarboxylatedl-aspartate to l-alanine withk cat′ = 0.08 s−1, i.e.1330-fold faster than the wild-type enzyme. However, transaminase activity, despite a decrease by 3 orders of magnitude, still exceeded β-decarboxylase activity by a factor of 2.5. Here we searched for a third mutation that, if introduced into AspAT Y225R/R386A, would decrease further transaminase activity without affecting β-decarboxylase activity. The only mutation among many tested that brought about this effect was the replacement of the second active-site arginine residue, i.e. Arg292 (a residue of the adjacent subunit of the AspAT homodimer) with lysine. In the wild-type enzyme, Arg292 binds the distal carboxylate group of the substrate (Fig. 1). The single R292K mutation had been previously found to decrease transaminase activity to 0.2% of that of the wild-type enzyme (15Vacca R.A. Giannattasio S. Graber R. Sandmeier E. Marra E. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 21932-21937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the triple-mutant enzyme, β-decarboxylase activity indeed exceeded transaminase activity by a factor of 8. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type aspC gene of E. coli inserted into the BS M13 vector (16Malcolm B.A. Kirsch J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was performed with the mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad. The mutations were confirmed by determination of the nucleotide sequences. The mutated DNAs were expressed in the AspAT-deficientE. coli strain TY103 (17Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Hiromi K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6079-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the expression vector pKDHE19 (18Kamitori S. Hirotsu K. Higuchi T. Kondo K. Inoue K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Higuchi Y. Yasuoka N. Kusunoki M. Matsuura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 101: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified with previously described chromatographic procedures. Fractions containing pure AspAT were pooled, concentrated, and reconstituted with coenzyme as described (19Vacca R.A. Christen P. Malashkevich V.N. Jansonius J.N. Sandmeier E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified enzymes in the PLP form was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the molar absorption coefficient of the subunit, ε = 4.7 × 104m−1 cm−1 (20Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters for aminotransferase activities of AspAT mutants and the wild-type enzyme were measured in a coupled assay with malate dehydrogenase containing 40 mml-aspartate plus 20 mm 2-oxoglutarate as substrates for the wild-type enzyme and 100 mml-aspartate plus 50 mm2-oxoglutarate for the mutant enzymes. The values ofk cat refer to subunit concentrations. TheK m′ values for l-aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate were measured at fixed concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate (50 mm) and l-aspartate (200 mm), respectively. For measuring the consumption and production of oxo acids, the enzymes (0.45 mm, subunit concentration) were incubated with 200 mml-aspartate and 8 mm oxalacetate in 250 mm 4-methylmorpholine (pH 7.5) at 25 °C. Samples (40 μl) were deproteinized at different time intervals with 1m perchloric acid (final concentration) and neutralized with potassium hydroxide. Oxalacetate and pyruvate were determined separately by consumption of NADH in the presence of malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively. The β-decarboxylation of oxalacetate in the absence of enzyme (t½ = 60 min under the conditions detailed in the legend of Fig. 2 with 0.45 mm PLP added) was neglected in the calculations of k cat for the different enzyme variants. AspATs were incubated with amino acid and their cognate oxo acid in 250 mm 4-methylmorpholine (pH 7.5). High buffer concentrations are needed in the assays because CO2 is released in the β-decarboxylation reaction. The β-decarboxylase activity of the two mutant enzymes is sensitive to pH; a deviation by 0.5 from the optimum at pH 7.5 decreases the activity by 50% (data not shown). After addition of 0.5 μmol of l-valine as internal standard, 20-μl deproteinized samples of the reaction mixture were derivatized with 2-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide (Marfey's reagent) and analyzed as described previously (15Vacca R.A.

Biochem. 1988; 175: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the determination of the rates of desulfination ofl-cysteine sulfinate, the enzymes (0.45 mm, subunit concentration) were incubated with 100 mml-cysteinesulfinic acid and 50 mm2-oxoglutarate in 200 mm 4-methylmorpholine (pH 7.5) at 25 °C, and the production of alanine was measured as described above. To check which pathway of β-elimination the enzymes were following (see Scheme FS1), the same experiments were performed in the presence of 45 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 50 mmNADH to trap any pyruvate produced by hydrolysis of the ketimine intermediate 9 (see Scheme FS1). Transamination ofl-cysteine sulfinate was quantified by the increase in the concentration of l-glutamate produced by the reaction of the PMP form of the enzyme with oxoglutarate. Crystals of AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A were grown with the hanging drop technique. A solution containing 15 mg/ml protein, 2 mm5′-phosphopyridoxyl l-aspartate (13Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol.

Crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.2 × 0.4 × 1.5 mm in ∼4 weeks. Nucleation and crystal growth proved more problematic than in the case of wild-type AspAT, probably indicating a less stable conformation of the protein. As found before for crystals of wild-type and mutant E. coli AspATs (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J.

Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.16 Å, using a MARresearch imaging plate mounted on a modified Elliott GX20 rotating copper anode generator. Raw data were processed with MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G.V. MOSFLM Users Guide. Medical Research Council-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge1994Google Scholar). Images were scaled with SCALA and AGROVATA and reduced to structure factors with TRUNCATE from the CCP4 Program Suite (24CCP4 Program Suite: Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). A total of 170,054 measured reflections were merged together withR sym = 0.082 to give rise to the data set of 50,068 independent reflections, which is 87.7% complete to 2.16-Å resolution. The structure of the 5′-phosphopyridoxyl aspartate complex of AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (24CCP4 Program Suite: Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr.

The root mean square deviations of the bond lengths, bond angles, and planes from the ideal values were 0.011 Å, 1.35°, and 0.01 Å, respectively. The simulations of the quinonoid intermediates 3 (see Scheme FS1) were performed as described previously (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cell multipole method (26Greengard L. Rokhlin V.I. J. Comp. Physiol. 1987; 73: 325-330Crossref Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) was used instead of a cutoff for the nonbonded interactions. The modeled structure of the triple-mutant enzyme was obtained by the replacement of Arg292 with a lysine residue in the double-mutant crystal structure. The systems were relaxed by 4000 steps of energy minimization. The amino acid residues and water molecules beyond a distance of 11 Å from the coenzyme-substrate adduct were kept fixed during the following 100 ps of simulation at 300 K. The introduction of the additional mutation R292K into AspAT Y225R/R386A did not affect its l-aspartate β-decarboxylase activity (Fig. 2); the k catand K m′ values of the triple- and double-mutant enzymes are the same (Table I). Two different pathways to produce l-alanine froml-aspartate are possible, i.e. direct β-decarboxylation of l-aspartate (7 →8 → 1 in SchemeFS1) or β-decarboxylation coupled with transamination (7 → 9 → 5), producing pyruvate, which, by transamination, may be converted tol-alanine. To determine the partition ratio of the two pathways, the consumption of oxalacetate (consumed in the reaction with the PMP form of the enzyme 5 to produce the PLP form1 and l-aspartate) and the production of pyruvate in the presence of l-aspartate and oxalacetate (conditions as described in the legend to Fig. 2) were followed in parallel with the β-decarboxylation of l-aspartate (TableII). Both AspAT Y225R/R386A and AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A produced pyruvate with a k catof only 0.01 s−1, corresponding to a partition ratio (7 → 8 versus 7 →9) of 8. In the wild-type enzyme, production of pyruvate by far exceeded that of l-alanine. Probably, most of thel-alanine produced by the wild-type enzyme was formed by transamination of pyruvate.Table IKinetic parameters for β-decarboxylase and transaminase activities of wild-type and mutant AspATsAspATβ-Decarboxylation k catTransamination k catK m(Asp)′K m(OG)′aOG, 2-oxoglutarate; ND, not determined; BD, below detection limit.s−1s−1mmmmY225R/R292K/R386A0.080.018.80.8Y225R/R292E/R386A0.0055 × 10−5NDNDY225R/R292V/R386A 8 × 10−40.0516.80.36Y225R/R292Y/R386ABD0.02520014Y225R/R386A0.080.198.30.8R292K/R386A7.5 × 10−40.094140.25Y225RBD0.450.83bFrom Ref. 27.0.36bFrom Ref. 27.R292K1.8 × 10−30.5cFrom Ref. 15.14cFrom Ref. 15.2.7cFrom Ref. 15.R386ABD0.33155Wild-type6 × 10−5 dMost of the l-alanine produced in the presence of the wild-type enzyme is probably due to transamination of pyruvate formed by β-decarboxylation of oxalacetate.1801.20.2The β-decarboxylase assay was carried out in 200 mml-aspartate plus 8 mm oxalacetate in 250 mm 4-methylmorpholine (pH 7.5).

Because the transaminase activity of AspAT Y225R/R292E/R386A was too low to be analyzed with a coupled assay, the transformation of the PLP form of the enzyme into the PMP form upon addition of 100 mml-aspartate was followed spectrophotometrically instead.

Transamination of l-cysteine sulfinate was measured by the amount of l-glutamate produced in the regeneration of the PLP form from the PMP form of the enzyme (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Replacement of Arg292 in AspAT Y225R/R386A with a glutamate or valine residue led to 16- and 100-fold decreases ink cat for β-decarboxylation, respectively (Table I). Arg292 was substituted with glutamate to introduce a negative charge that might destabilize the β-carboxylate group (29Leussing D.L. Raghavan N.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 5635-5643Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar,30Hurley J.H. Remington S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4769-4773Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and thus enhance β-decarboxylation. If the ratio of β-decarboxylase to transaminase activity is considered rather than the absolute k cat value, AspAT Y225R/R292E/R386A is indeed a more specific l-aspartate β-decarboxylase than its counterpart with the R292K substitution, its β-decarboxylase activity being 100 times higher than its transaminase activity (TableI). Replacement of Arg292 with tyrosine eliminated the positive charge, whereas the phenolic hydroxy group could still form a hydrogen bond with the β-carboxylate group of the substrate and thus maintain the binding function. However, AspAT Y225R/R292Y/R386A proved to have very low affinity for the substrates and no measurable β-decarboxylase activity. The replacement of Arg292 with lysine, glutamate, valine, or tyrosine in AspAT Y225R/R386A led to a further marked decrease in k cat for transamination (Table I). However, only with the R292K substitution as the third mutation was β-decarboxylase activity maintained. TheK m values for dicarboxylic substrates of the single-, double-, and triple-mutant enzymes are invariably higher than those of the wild-type enzyme, with the exception of the single Y225R mutation, which has been reported to decrease the K mvalues for C4 and C5 dicarboxylic substrates (14Graber R.

In AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A in particular, theK m values for l-aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate are, as in the Y225R/R386A double-mutant enzyme, seven and four times higher, respectively, than in the wild-type enzyme. AspAT Y225R/R292E/R386A was also tested for activity towardl-lysine, l-arginine, andl-ornithine. A very slow transamination reaction ofl-lysine with an initial rate of 0.001 s−1could be detected. Such an effect of a negative charge at position 292 has been reported previously (33Cronin C.N. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Hwang J.K.

Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, no reaction of l-lysine with the wild-type enzyme was observed. None of the mutant enzymes showed any measurable reaction other than transamination toward d/l-glutamate,d-aspartate, l-tyrosine, orl-serine and their cognate oxo acids. Wild-type AspAT catalyzed the transamination of l-cysteine sulfinate at a very high rate. As a side reaction, elimination of sulfinate produced l-alanine (Table II). Both AspAT Y225R/R386A and AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A showed a reaction specificity that was inverse to that of the wild-type enzyme, desulfination ofl-cysteine sulfinate being by an order of magnitude faster than its transamination reaction. The double mutation increased desulfination activity 3-fold and decreased transaminase activity toward l-cysteine sulfinate by 4 orders of magnitude. The introduction of the third mutation (R292K) reduced both desulfination and the transamination activity of the double-mutant enzyme by an order of magnitude. Lactate dehydrogenase plus NADH had no effect on k cat of desulfination by the wild-type and mutant AspATs, indicating that l-alanine is produced by direct desulfination of l-cysteine sulfinate rather than through formation of pyruvate followed by transamination. The 5′-phosphopyridoxyl aspartate complex of the triple-mutant enzyme (Y225R/R292K/R386A) was found in the open conformation (Fig. 1). In the wild-type enzyme, binding of dicarboxylic substrates or inhibitors induces the closed conformation of the enzyme, in which water molecules are excluded from the vicinity of the Schiff base (13Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The open conformation of the triple-mutant enzyme allows water molecules to enter the active site in the presence of the substrate analog. Lys258, which is responsible in the wild-type enzyme (13Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) for the deprotonation at C-α and reprotonation at C-4′ of the coenzyme (Scheme FS1), has moved away from its position near these atoms, where a water molecule is now found. The amino group of Lys258 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to Arg225. Lys292 does not interact with the distal carboxylate group of the aspartate moiety; it forms a hydrogen bond with Ser296 instead, whereas a water molecule occupies its original position. The electron density of the aspartate moiety is highly disordered due to the lack of Arg292 and Arg386, which are key residues for substrate binding in the wild-type enzyme. Nevertheless, the coenzyme-substrate adduct maintains a conformation that allows elimination of the proton at C-α, the C-α–H bond together with the imine nitrogen staying in a plane orthogonal to the plane defined by the coenzyme ring (13Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 36Dunathan H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In the simulation of the external aldimine intermediate based on the crystal structure of AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A (Fig. 1), Lys258 did not displace the intervening water molecule and approach C-α. This situation most probably is due to a crystal artifact as it would correspond to a catalytically inactive enzyme. The dynamics calculations for the quinonoid intermediate of the triple-mutant enzyme were therefore based on the crystal structure of AspAT Y225R/R386A (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in which Arg292 had been replaced with a lysine residue. In this case, Lys258 stayed close enough to C-α and C-4′ for acting as the acid-base group in the tautomerization from aldimine 2to ketimine 4. In the molecular dynamics simulation of the quinonoid intermediate of AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A, as in those of AspAT Y225R/R386A, a hydrogen bond between Arg225 and the imine nitrogen atom is formed (Fig. 3). During the simulation, this hydrogen bond exists only 5% of the time in AspAT Y225R, whereas it is present 35% of the time in the double- and triple-mutant enzymes. In all AspATs containing the Y225R mutation, the proximity of the positively charged guanidinium group repulses the protonated Lys258. Its longer distance from C-4′ of the coenzyme hinders reprotonation of that atom and might underlie the decrease in transaminase activity. In the simulated structures of the quinonoid intermediate of the wild-type enzyme, Lys258remains positioned above the imine nitrogen at almost equal distance from C-α and C-4′. The triple mutation Y225R/R292K/R386A brings about a switch in the reaction specificity of E. coli AspAT. The conjoint R386A and Y225R substitutions enhance the very low l-aspartate β-decarboxylase activity of the wild-type enzyme and decrease transaminase activity. Measurements of the activity of the pertinent single- and double-mutant enzymes other than Y225R/R386A confirmed that the increase in β-decarboxylase activity strictly depends on the combined effects of the R386A and Y225R substitutions (Table I). This double mutation amounts to a shift of an arginine residue from position 386 to position 225. The third mutation, replacement of Arg292with lysine, selectively lowers transaminase activity to one-eighth of β-decarboxylase activity. Together, the three mutations increase the ratio of β-decarboxylase to transaminase activity >25 million-fold. Molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and triple-mutant enzymes based on crystal structures suggested, as previously for the double-mutant enzyme, that Arg225 makes, in addition to the hydrogen bond with O-3′ of the coenzyme, a second hydrogen bond with the imine nitrogen of the quinonoid intermediate. In the wild-type enzyme, the imine nitrogen is not engaged in a hydrogen bond, whereas O-3′ forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr225. The single Y225R mutation is apparently not sufficient to give rise to the formation of a hydrogen bond from Arg225 to the imine nitrogen atom (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mutation has been found to decrease the pK a of the internal aldimine from 6.8 in the wild-type enzyme to 6.2 due to a strong hydrogen bond of Arg225 with O-3′ (27Inoue K. Kuramitsu S. Okamoto A. Hirotsu K. Higuchi T. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which pulls electrons out of the π-system extending from the pyridine ring of PLP to the aldimine bond. The imine nitrogen might thus become a too weak nucleophile to accept a hydrogen bond from Arg225. The replacement of Arg386 by an alanine residue has been reported previously to disrupt the hydrogen-bonding network Arg386 → Asn194 → O-3′ (37Yano T. Mizuni T. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1810-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and thus to allow the electrons of O-3′ to flow into the π-system. As a consequence, the imine nitrogen in the double-mutant enzyme might engage in a hydrogen bond with Arg225. A similar effect of the Y225R/R386A mutations might be operative in the quinonoid intermediate (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The O-3′–Arg225 and imine nitrogen–Arg225hydrogen bonds may be assumed to reinforce the electron sink capacity of the π-system of imine and the cofactor pyridine ring to such an extent that, even after deprotonation at C-α, it remains effective enough to stabilize carbanion 6 (Scheme FS1), produced by β-decarboxylation. Other factors that might favor β-decarboxylation, such as the angle of the C-β–C-γ bond relative to the coenzyme-imine π-system (36Dunathan H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and negative electrostatic potentials around the β-carboxylate group that might promote electron delocalization (38Gallagher T. Snell E.E. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12737-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could not be verified; neither the bond angles nor the electrostatic potentials in AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A were significantly different from those in the wild-type enzyme. The decrease in transaminase activity observed in both AspAT Y225R/R386A and AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A might be due to the repulsion between Lys258 and Arg225 impairing the reprotonation of the quinonoid intermediate 3 at C-4′. A possible explanation for the further decrease brought about by the third mutation (R292K) is provided by the recent crystallographic analysis of three reaction intermediates of the wild-type enzyme7 that has shown a water molecule to be positioned near C-α in the ketimine intermediate 4; this water molecule is supposed to effect the hydrolysis of the ketimine. 2V. N. Malashkevich and J. N. Jansonius, unpublished data. Its nucleophilicity might be enhanced by a hydrogen-bonding network comprising Tyr70, Lys258, and Gly38. The effect of these interactions is maximal if the active site is in the closed conformation because the rotation of the small domain brings Gly38 into a position where it can take part in this network. The wild-type enzyme assumes the closed conformation on binding a dicarboxylic amino or oxo acid to the two active-site arginine residues, Arg292 and Arg386. By interacting with the substrate, the two arginines are pulled toward each other, inducing the domain movement (13Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 22Jäger J. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 39Picot D. Sandmeier E. Thaller C. Vincent M.G. Christen P. Jansonius J.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A, the mutation of both arginine residues prevents the enzyme from adopting a closed conformation (Fig. 1), with the consequence that the water molecule might not be reactive enough to attack C-α. In AspAT Y225R/R386A, with only one substrate-binding arginine missing, the syncatalytic closure of the active-site cleft is partially retained (14Graber R. Kasper P. Malashkevich V.N. Sandmeier E. Berger P. Gehring H. Jansonius J.N. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The importance of the domain movement for the reactivity of the catalytic water molecule in the hydrolysis of the ketimine intermediate might also explain the reaction pathway of both β-decarboxylation and β-desulfination. The amino acid l-cysteine sulfinate is a dianion like aspartate and is a physiologic substrate for AspAT (40Parsons B. Rainbow T.C. Brain Res. 1984; 294: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,41Weinstein C.L. Haschemeyer R.H. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16568-16579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction specificity of both AspAT Y225R/R386A and AspAT Y225R/R292K/R386A toward l-cysteine sulfinate is inverse to that of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzymes desulfinate this substrate faster than they undergo the transamination reaction with it. Nevertheless, similar to the wild-type enzyme and in analogy to the β-decarboxylation reaction with aspartate, they preferentially reprotonate carbanion 7 (Scheme FS1) at C-α rather than C-4′ and produce l-alanine (7 → 8 →1) rather than pyruvate (7 → 9 →5). Conceivably, upon loss of the negatively charged β-substituent, the active site assumes the open conformation. Thus, the frequency of ketimine hydrolysis is decreased, and the partition ratio is shifted in favor of reprotonation at C-α, resulting in the production of l-alanine. The starting point of this work was a study of the molecular evolution of B6 enzymes (11Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Within a given family, in particular in the large α-family, a clear temporal sequence of different phases in the functional specialization is evident. The common ancestor enzyme, apparently an unspecific all-rounder catalyst, first diverged into reaction-specific protoenzymes, which then diverged further and acquired substrate specificity. The last phase for most B6enzymes was the neutral evolution concomitant with speciation. 3Mehta, P. K., and Christen, P. (2000) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., in press. The conjoint substitution of three active-site residues that converted AspAT into anl-aspartate β-decarboxylase seems to simulate the processes that, in the first phase of molecular evolution, might have led to reaction-specific B6 enzymes by accelerating the specific reaction and suppressing potential side reactions. To the best of our knowledge, such a clear change in reaction specificity with a remarkably high new activity (k cat = 0.08 s−1) has as yet only been reported for papain that was converted into a peptide-nitrile hydratase by a single amino acid substitution at the active site (10Dufour E. Storer A.C. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16382-16388Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Two features of the procedure used in this study for changing the reaction specificity might be generally applicable to B6enzymes and perhaps certain other enzymes as well. 1) The double mutation Y225R/R386A shifts an arginine residue from its wild-type position to another position in its immediate vicinity. Such charge-shifting double mutations may be expected not to disturb greatly the topochemistry of the active site, but to alter the electron repartition at the reaction center. 2) Arginine residues are the preferred binding groups for anionic substrates in enzymes (15Vacca R.A. Giannattasio S. Graber R. Sandmeier E. Marra E. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (, and references cited therein): 21932-21937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Their conservative substitution by lysine, which is slightly shorter and engages in fewer hydrogen bonds, may be expected to change the mode of binding of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2124207551,"Abstract Transcriptional regulation by transforming growth factor-β and activin is mediated by interaction of Smad2 and Smad3 with specific transcription factors and/or DNA elements. However, Smad3 behaves differently from Smad2 in regulating transcription by a winged-helix transcription factor, FAST-2, on an activin-responsive element (ARE) in the Xenopus Mix.2 promoter. Smad3 alone was able to stimulate the ARE through FAST-2, but inhibited the ARE transactivation mediated by Smad2/Smad4 following receptor activation. We characterized the functional domains that are involved in these two activities of Smad3. Deletion of the MH1 domain as well as mutations of four lysine residues in the MH1 domain abrogated the inhibitory activity of Smad3, but did not compromise the self-stimulatory function. In contrast, deletion of the MH2 domain or a point mutation of glycine 379 within this domain obliterated the self-stimulatory activity of Smad3, but not the inhibitory activity. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we found that Smad3 was able to associate with the FAST-2·ARE complex and that this association was dependent on FAST-2. In addition, Smad3 was not able to directly bind the ARE in a DNase I protection assay, in which FAST-2 binds the ARE around a motif (TGTGTATT) previously characterized to associate with the human FAST-1 protein. Interestingly, Smad4 was also able to directly associate with the FAST-2·ARE complex through binding with FAST-2. In a gel shift assay, the association of FAST-2 with Smad4 was mutually exclusive from the association with Smad3. Taken together, these data indicate that Smad3 exerts the inhibitory activity by competitive association with FAST-2."
https://openalex.org/W2137980457,"We have examined the pre-steady state reduction kinetics of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochromebc 1 complex by menaquinol in the presence and absence of endogenous ubiquinone to elucidate the mechanism of triphasic cytochrome b reduction. With cytochromebc 1 complex from wild type yeast, cytochromeb reduction was triphasic, consisting of a rapid partial reduction phase, an apparent partial reoxidation phase, and a slow rereduction phase. Absorbance spectra taken by rapid scanning spectroscopy at 1-ms intervals before, during, and after the apparent reoxidation phase showed that this was caused by a bona fide reoxidation of cytochrome b and not by any negative spectral contribution from cytochromec 1. With cytochrome bc 1complex from a yeast mutant that cannot synthesize ubiquinone, cytochrome b reduction by either menaquinol or ubiquinol was rapid and monophasic. Addition of ubiquinone restored triphasic cytochrome b reduction, and the duration of the reoxidation phase increased as the ubiquinone concentration increased. When reduction of the cytochrome bc 1 complex through center P was blocked, cytochrome b reduction through center N was biphasic and was slowed by the addition of exogenous ubiquinone. These results show that ubiquinone residing at center N in the oxidized cytochrome bc 1 complex is responsible for the triphasic reduction of cytochrome b."
https://openalex.org/W1969847793,"A minor population of <i>Escherichia coli</i> contains retro-elements called retrons, which encode reverse transcriptases (RT) to synthesize peculiar satellite DNAs called multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). These RTs recognize specific RNA structures in their individual primer-template RNAs to initiate cDNA synthesis from the 2′-OH group of a specific internal G residue (branching G residue). The resulting products (msDNA) consist of RNA and single-stranded DNA, sharing hardly any sequence homology. Here, we investigated how RT-Ec86 recognizes the specific RNA structure in its primer-template RNA. On the basis of structural comparison with HIV-1 RT, domain exchanges were carried out between two <i>E. coli</i> RTs, RT-Ec86 and RT-Ec73. RT-Ec86 (320 residues) and RT-Ec73 (316 residues) share only 71 identical residues (22%). From the analysis of 10 such constructs, the C-terminal 91-residue sequence of RT-Ec86 was found to be essential for the recognition of the unique stem-loop structure and the branching G residue in the primer-template RNA for retron-Ec86. Using the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method with RT-Ec86 and primer RNAs containing random sequences, the identical stem-loop structure (including the 3-U loop) to that found in the retron-Ec86 primer-template RNA was enriched. In addition, the highly conserved 4-base sequence (UAGC), including the branching G residue, was also enriched. These results indicate that the highly diverse C-terminal region recognizes specific stem-loop structures and the branching G residue located upstream of the stem-loop structure. The present results with seemingly primitive RNA-dependent DNA polymerases provide insight into the mechanisms for specific protein RNA recognition."

Although usually not considered part of a signal transduction pathway, the effect of biotin was mimicked in a non-additive fashion by the second-messenger 8-bromo-cGMP. This finding suggested that biotin maintained an intracellular cGMP level via activation of the membrane-associated guanylate cyclase (1Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot and polysome analysis showed that the effect of 8-bromo-cGMP addition on ASGR synthesis was at the translational level (1Stockert R.J. Paietta E. Racevskis J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery of the ASGR mRNA in the ribonucleoprotein fraction during biotin deprivation suggested that intracellular levels of cGMP might play a significant role in the initiation phase of translation. The bimodal polysome distribution of ASGR mRNA was characteristic of a class of mRNAs that were inefficiently translated (9Walden W.E. Thach R.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2033-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that mRNAs in these functionally distinct fractions differ structurally or though interactive proteins associated with their untranslated region (UTR) (10Meyuhas O. Thompson E.A. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of COS-7 cells with various deletion constructs of the cDNA encoding the ASGR H2b subunit localized the cGMP responsive cis-acting element to a 187-nucleotide fragment of the 5′-UTR (11Stockert R.J. Ren Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Inhibition of gel retardation with a nested set of RNAs limited the cognate sequence to 37 nucleotides encompassing two regions of potential secondary structure. In the present study, a coatomer protein, COPI, comprising seven unrelated subunits was identified as the trans-acting factor bound to the 5′-UTR responsible for the translational regulation of ASGR. This finding opens the novel possibility that membrane-bound proteins when in the free state may play a different regulatory role. Human liver cytosol was isolated from perfused human liver stored at −80 °C. The liver was thawed and homogenized on ice in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (buffer A). Homogenate was clarified for 30 min at 15,000 × g at 8 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer D). Dialyzed supernatant clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g, 4 °C was designated S-100. S-100 adjusted to 0.3m KCl was loaded onto a 5-ml Bio-Rad Mono-Q column and washed with 0.3 m KCl in buffer D until theA 280 was below 0.05. Proteins were eluted with a 0.3–0.6 m KCl linear gradient in buffer D. Two peaks containing RNA binding activity, as measured by dot blot, eluted at 0.358 and 0.385 m KCl were concentrated on Amicon Centricon Plus 30, 30-kDa cut-off spin filters. Proteins within each peak were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein recovered from the SDS-PAGE was sequenced in the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. [α-32P]CTP-labeled RNA transcripts of high specific activity (>108 cpm/58 g of RNA) were synthesized from a Sma-1 linearized pGEM4Z plasmid containing a 187-base pair fragment of the ASGR H2b-subunit 5′-untranslated region. Promega's Riboprobe System-SP6 was used according to the manufacturer's directions. Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin 30 columns were used to remove unincorporated nucleotides.

For either probe, nitrocellulose from the overnight transfer or dot blot was preincubated in 12 mm Hepes-KOH, pH7.9, 15 mm KCl, 0.2 μm dithiothreitol, partially purified yeast core RNA (0.2 58 g/ml), and 15% glycerol (buffer C) for 10 min at room temperature. The appropriate RNA probe was added in buffer C and continuously agitated for 20 min at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was washed three times in buffer C over a 30-min period and developed by either chemiluminescence or autoradiography (13Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol.

Primary antibody was applied in fresh TTBS at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature with constant agitation. The nitrocellulose was washed three times in TTBS over a 30-min period. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody was added at 1:2500 dilution in fresh blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with constant agitation.

Samples were loaded on a 6% low cross-link 60:1 PAGE (pre-cooled to 10 °C and pre-run for 30 min at 75 V). The loaded gel was run at 75 V, 10 °C for 3 h in 0.5× Tris-buffered borate-EDTA, after which the gel was processed for autoradiography.

Unbound protein was removed by three successive washes with buffer D. Twenty-five μl of the antibody-protein A/G matrix was mixed with an equal volume of the S-100 fraction, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C with constant mixing for 3 h. The immunodepleted S-100 was recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and used immediately in translation inhibition studies. Protein concentration of the supernatant was assayed by bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). A dot blot assay in combination with a protein-specific gel retardation assay was developed to detect the presence and follow purification of the RNA-binding protein. It was assumed that the cGMP responsive trans-acting factor first detected in liver cell lines (HepG2 and HuH-7) would be present in normal human liver. Gel permeation chromatography of the human liver S-100 fraction on a Superose-6 preparative column resolved the RNA binding activity near the void volume. Calibration of the column indicated that the activity was recovered in a fraction with an apparent molecular mass of 670 kDa. Preliminary studies indicated that the RNA-binding protein activity present in the S-100 fraction eluted from a Mono-Q column at 0.4m KCl. Refinement of the KCl gradient resulted in the partial resolution of two protein peaks. The first peak eluted at 0.358m KCl and the second peak at 0.385 m KCl. Both peaks possessed active RNA-binding protein by the dot blot assay. Fractions with the highest apparent specific activity within each peak were pooled, concentrated by centrifugal filtration, and assessed for RNA binding activity by gel retardation. This assay was previously shown specific for this RNA fragment (11Stockert R.J. Ren Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Titration to determine the minimum amount of protein required for a positive gel shift indicated a 35- and 150-fold increase in specific RNA binding activity for pools 1 and 2, respectively, when compared with S-100. Pool 1 protein gave a shift similar to the original S-100 fraction, whereas the pool 2 protein caused a more pronounced shift (Fig.1). Resolution of the two pools on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE indicated that each was heterogeneous, containing at least six to nine major protein bands when visualized with Coomassie Blue stain. Northwestern analysis identified a protein within pool 2 with an apparent mass of 140 kDa as a potential RNA-binding protein (Fig. 2). This finding was consistent with our initial Northwestern analysis of the S-100 fraction. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides isolated from the SDS-PAGE-resolved band identified the 140-kDa protein as the α subunit of the coatomer protein, COPI. Western blot analysis confirmed the identification of this protein as α-COP (Fig. 2). β-COP, a second COPI subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa, was also identified in this fraction (Fig. 2). Western blot also indicated the presence of both COP1 subunits in the pool 1 fraction (data not shown). The presence of both α- and β-COP in the same protein fraction strongly suggested that the observed heterogeneity on SDS-PAGE was because of the dissociation of the COPI subunits. Indeed, the SDS-PAGE banding pattern of peak 2 was consistent with the reported subunit composition of COPI, a cytosolic complex of seven unrelated subunits (15Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Waters G.M. Serafini T. Rothman J. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Protein elution from the Mono-Q column with a linear KCl gradient, a central step in most protocols, designed to purify COPI (15Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Waters G.M. Serafini T. Rothman J. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), consistently yielded 600–800 μg of protein/1 g of cytosol. When compared with reported cytosolic concentrations (15Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Waters G.M. Serafini T. Rothman J. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), 2G. M. Waters (Princeton University), personal communication. this preparation of COPI would be on the order of 30–50% pure. To determine whether the entire COPI complex was indeed associated with the 5′-UTR, anti-β-COP and anti-α-COP antibodies were added to the gel retardation assay in an attempt to promote a supershift. The observed enhanced retardation of the radiolabeled 5′-UTR probe by either antibody strongly suggested that the entire coatomer complex was associated with the RNA (Fig. 3). Although it does not exclude the possibility that subcomplexes of COPI could associate with the 5′-UTR, as has been suggested for interaction with Golgi membranes (15Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), no subcomplex containing both α- and β-COP has ever been detected (17Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). From previous studies, it was evident that cells deprived of biotin or cGMP expressed higher levels of active RNA-binding protein (11Stockert R.J. Ren Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9161-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine whether this reflected a change in a single or multiple proteins in the S-100 fraction binding specifically to the ASGR mRNA, S-100 was immunodepleted of β-COP and associated proteins. Western blot analysis was unable to detect the presence of either α- or β-COP in the depleted S-100 (data not shown). Loss of gel shift capacity of the immunodepleted S-100 (Fig.4) strongly suggested that COPI was the sole protein in human liver cytosol specifically bound to the ASGR mRNA 5′-UTR. An in vitro translation assay was utilized to establish a causal relationship between the presence of COPI in S-100 and ASGR translation (Fig. 5). Capped ASGR mRNA was synthesized and translated in a wheat germ system to which an immunodepleted S-100 was added (see Fig. 4). Untreated S-100 or S-100 treated with the nonspecific antibody (anti-LDL) inhibited ASGR translation by 80%. In contrast, S-100 treated with anti-β-COPI inhibited translation by only 28%. Both antibody-treated S-100s exhibited an equal COPI-independent nonspecific inhibition (35%) when tested against Xenopus elongation factor 1-α capped mRNA (the positive control provided with the Ambion in vitro translation kit). These findings indicate that immunodepletion of β-COP results in a highly significant loss of specific inhibitory activity. Formation of COPI-coated vesicles in trans-Golgi network traffic has been well established, although the exact order of recruitment and composition of potential coatomer subcomplexes associated with Golgi membranes remains controversial (17Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Subunit heterogeneity due to post-translational modification of COPI proteins forming functionally distinct coatomer complexes has also been suggested (17Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7230-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Dissociation/reassociation experiments have indicated that various subcomplexes were formed in vitro; however, only those containing β-COP were capable of specific binding to Golgi membranes (15Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vivo pulse-chase and co-immunoprecipitation suggested that cytoplasmic COPI was rapidly formed from newly synthesized subunits and exists as a stable complex (18Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recently, the β′-COP subunit has been identified as a receptor for activated protein kinase C in cardiac myocytes (20Csukai M. Chen C. De Matteiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although this demonstrates an ambifunctional role for the β′ subunit, the absence of β-COP co-localization with this kinase receptor suggested that β′-COP was not associated with the entire coatomer complex. This finding opens the possibility that individual coatomer subunits might function independently. In the present study, Northwestern analysis of the SDS-PAGE-resolved, partially purified COPI coatomer suggested that α-COP was the most likely candidate for RNA recognition (Fig. 2). However, this result does not exclude the possibility of a coatomer accessory protein as the primary respondent to intracellular cGMP. Antibody-induced supershift and immunodepletion strongly indicated that β-COP was also part of the binding complex (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Until an intermediate α/β subcomplex has been confirmed in vitro or in vivo(15Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) we must assume that the entire COPI complex binds to the 5′-UTR. These results suggest that COPI is the cGMP-responsive protein; however, the effects of cGMP on COPI are not known, and future experiments will be required to establish a direct link between COPI and cGMP action."
https://openalex.org/W2025921726,"Abstract The mechanism of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium is explored by determining the effects of pH, of temperature, and of isotopic substitution on the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reaction of l-serine with indole to form l-tryptophan. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters indicates that three ionizing groups are involved in substrate binding and catalysis with pK a1 = 6.5, pK a2 = 7.3, and pK a3 = 8.2–9. A significant primary isotope effect (∼3.5) on V and V/K is observed at low pH (pH 7), but not at high pH (pH 9), indicating that the base that accepts the α-proton (βLys-87) is protonated at low pH, slowing the abstraction of the α-proton and making this step at least partially rate-limiting. pK a2 is assigned to βLys-87 on the basis of the kinetic isotope effect results and of the observation that the competitive inhibitors glycine and oxindolyl-l-alanine display single pK ivalues of 7.3. The residue with this pK a(βLys-87) must be unprotonated for binding glycine or oxindolyl-l-alanine, and, by inference,l-serine. Investigations of the temperature dependence of the pK a values support the assignment of pK a2 to βLys-87 and suggest that the ionizing residue with pK a1 could be a carboxylate, possibly βAsp-305, and that the residue associated with a conformational change at pK a3 may be βLys-167. The occurrence of a closed to open conformational conversion at high pH is supported by investigations of the effects of pH on reaction specificity and on the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates."
