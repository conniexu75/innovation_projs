https://openalex.org/W2032046006,"Understanding of the reactivity of organic molecules in hot water is developing from studies aimed at explaining how organic matter (kerogen) forms in natural environments and then breaks down into energy source materials. In natural systems where kerogens are depolymerized, hot water is ubiquitous and usually contains salt and minerals. Reactions such as ionic condensation, cleavage, and hydrolysis are facilitated by changes in the chemical and physical properties of water as temperature increases. These changes make the solvent properties of water at high temperature similar to those of polar organic solvents at room temperature, thus facilitating reactions with organic compounds. An understanding of aqueous organic chemistry may lead to potential applications in areas as diverse as the recycling of plastics, the synthesis of chemicals, and coal liquefaction."

The layer spacings measured by tunneling microscopy are 20% larger than those measured previously on bulk material by x-ray diffraction. The structure of the adsorbed molecules is quite different from that of the bulk."
https://openalex.org/W2048960899,"The vast Wrangellia terrane of Alaska and British Columbia is an accreted oceanic plateau with Triassic strata that contain a 3- to 6-kilometers thick flood basalt, bounded above and below by marine sedimentary rocks. This enormous outpouring of basalt was preceded by rapid uplift and was followed by gradual subsidence of the plateau. The uplift and basalt eruptions occurred in less than ∼5 million years, and were not accompanied by significant extension or rifting of the lithosphere. This sequence of events is predicted by a mantle plume initiation, or plume head, model that has recently been developed to explain continental flood volcanism. Evidence suggests that other large oceanic basalt plateaus, such as the Ontong-Java, Kerguelen, and Caribbean, were formed as the initial outbursts of the Louisville Ridge, Kerguelen, and Galapagos hot spots, respectively. Such events may play an important role in the creation and development of both oceanic and continental crust."

https://openalex.org/W2034887752,"In ionic crystals of the form M(+)X(-), certain covalently bonded anion groups X(-) are particularly associated with instability. The heavier metal cations M(+) enhance this. Very sensitive explosives occur within the extended azide family, where X(-) = CNO(-), N(3)(-), NCO(-), or NCS(-) (an isoelectronic set of unsaturated linear triatomic anions). Another such family are the globular oxyanions X(-) = ClO(2)(-), ClO(3)(-), ClO(4)(-), NO(3)(-), and MnO(4)(-). Mishandling of NH(4)NO(3) or NH(4)ClO(4) has caused major disasters. An irreversible cyclic mechanism is proposed for such decomposition, involving mechanoelectronic band-gap excitation and coalescence of X with X(-). From an intracrystalline ion-molecule collision complex, the singly charged dianion X(2)(-), exothermic reactions proceed with high yield."

An examination is made here of the causes of (i) some continuing failures in integrating research information with decision-making and (ii) some notable successes of the past two decades in matching research capabilities with policy needs. Six recommendations are made to facilitate and further the progress that has recently been achieved."

https://openalex.org/W4242719071,"The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature desires to draw attention to an error in the material it recently issued with respect to proposals submitted to the Commission for the suspension of the Règles Internationales (Science, November 21, 1947, pp. 487-488). On page 488 (item 11), it was erroneously stated that one of the proposals was for the validation of the name Raphistoma Rafinesque, 1815 (Pisces). The application in question was, in fact, that the Commission should suppress the above name and validate the name Raphistoma Hall, 1847 (Gastropoda). The Commission greatly regrets any inconvenience which may have been caused by the erroneous entry referred to above. (FRANCIS HEMMING, secretary to the Commission.)."
