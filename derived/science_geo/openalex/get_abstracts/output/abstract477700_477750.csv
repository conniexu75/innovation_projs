The messenger RNAs of higher eukaryotes are extensively modified with N6-methyladenosine, but the functional role of this modification has been unclear. Chuan He and colleagues now show that in human cells, these modified bases are recognized by a family of proteins, YTHDF2, not only in mRNAs, but also in a variety of non-coding RNAs. Once bound, these proteins mediate degradation of the RNA by targeting it to cellular RNA decay sites. In this way, the modification serves as a regulator of the RNA's lifetime. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal (non-cap) modification present in the messenger RNA of all higher eukaryotes1,2. Although essential to cell viability and development3,4,5, the exact role of m6A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m6A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m6A in basic biological functions and disease6,7,8. Here we show that m6A is selectively recognized by the human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) ‘reader’ protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies9. The carboxy-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2–mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m6A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2058277625,"The specificity of interferon effectors across an expanded range of viruses is studied, with results indicating that positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses are more susceptible to interferon-stimulated gene activity than negative-sense RNA or DNA viruses; in addition, the DNA sensor cGAS is shown to have an unappreciated role in RNA virus inhibition. This study reports the use of cell culture models to scan an extensive interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) library for activity against a broad spectrum of viruses. The scan reveals that positive-sense single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses are more susceptible to ISG activities than negative-sense ssRNA viruses or a DNA virus. The DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is shown to inhibit several RNA viruses. The authors also generated cGAS knockout mice and showed an in vivo requirement for cGAS in antiviral responses. The type I interferon (IFN) response protects cells from viral infection by inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode direct antiviral effectors1,2,3. Recent screening studies have begun to catalogue ISGs with antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, antiviral ISG specificity across multiple distinct classes of viruses remains largely unexplored. Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11 genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling. In vivo, genetic ablation of murine cGAS reveals its requirement in the antiviral response to two DNA viruses, and an unappreciated contribution to the innate control of an RNA virus. These studies uncover new paradigms for the preferential specificity of IFN-mediated antiviral pathways spanning several virus families."

(p. 1094 ) found that a specific metabolite of cholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), promoted tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models of mammary cancer by serving as a partial agonist for the estrogen receptor and the liver X receptor. The most aggressive human breast cancers were found to express the highest level of the enzyme that converts cholesterol to 27HC, suggesting that 27HC produced within tumors (in addition to circulating 27HC) may contribute to tumorigenesis."

Our data provide mechanistic insight into gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, using small-molecule high-throughput screening, we identify the MEF2C-PGC1α pathway as a therapeutic target to combat PD. Initial motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) result from loss of A9-type dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Considerable damage occurs before onset of clinical symptoms, making identification of early events a challenge. Although the cause of sporadic PD is not fully understood, various factors, including environmental toxins, have been implicated. Mitochondrial toxins have been identified in epidemiological studies as contributing to “sporadic” PD, and mitochondrial-based toxin models gained attention following the discovery of MPTP-induced Parkinsonism (Langston et al., 1983Langston J.W. Ballard P. Tetrud J.W. Irwin I. Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis.Science. 1983; 219: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Paraquat (PQ; 1, 1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium), a commonly used herbicide, shares structural similarity with MPP+, the active metabolite of MPTP. PQ crosses the blood-brain barrier, generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and causes loss of SNpc DA neurons in animal models (Shimizu et al., 2001Shimizu K. Ohtaki K. Matsubara K. Aoyama K. Uezono T. Saito O. Suno M. Ogawa K. Hayase N. Kimura K. Shiono H.

Nitric oxide in paraquat-mediated toxicity: A review.J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2010; 24: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additional pesticides, including the fungicide maneb (MB; manganese ethylnebisdithiocarbamate) and the insecticide rotenone, can induce neuronal death in PD models. Human epidemiological studies show association of PQ/MB exposure to development of PD (Costello et al., 2009Costello S. Cockburn M. Bronstein J. Zhang X. Ritz B. Parkinson’s disease and residential exposure to maneb and paraquat from agricultural applications in the central valley of California.Am. J. Epidemiol. 2009; 169: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and this combination causes PD in animal models (Thiruchelvam et al., 2000Thiruchelvam M.J. Richfield E.K. Baggs R.B. Tank A.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system as a preferential target of repeated exposures to combined paraquat and maneb: implications for Parkinson’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9207-9214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Though the contribution of pesticides to sporadic PD remains contentious, involvement of mitochondria is generally accepted. Thus, these toxins are used in disease models to induce mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction and related cell injury. In contrast to sporadic PD, rare familial forms are causally linked to genetic mutations that are either dominant (PARK3, LRRK2, UCH-L1, PARK13, and SNCA [encoding α-syn]) or recessive (Parkin, PINK1, FBXO7, PLA2G6, and PARK9). Some gene products, including α-syn, contribute to aggregate formation in PD, appearing as intracellular inclusions (Lewy bodies and neurites). PD-associated gene mutations have been used to generate animal models to study the molecular basis of PD pathogenesis. Two categories of cellular events have been uncovered in these studies: (1) protein misfolding, aggregation, and aberrant proteostasis and (2) mitochondrial damage with oxidative/nitrosative stress (Dauer and Przedborski, 2003Dauer W. Przedborski S. Parkinson’s disease: mechanisms and models.Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Identifying pathways that link these events could provide information regarding events that lead to death of SNpc DA neurons. Recently, nitrosative/oxidative stress was reported to lead to tyrosine nitration and methionine oxidation on α-syn, thus contributing to aggregation (Giasson et al., 2000Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Oxidation and nitration of α-synuclein and their implications in neurodegenerative diseases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 533: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Considering the association of mitochondrial toxins with PD, another key question concerns interactions between environmental and genetic factors in PD. In fact, animal models suggest that PQ/MB renders mutant A53T α-syn transgenic mice particularly vulnerable to PD-like pathology (Norris et al., 2007Norris E.H. Uryu K. Leight S. Giasson B.I. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Pesticide exposure exacerbates α-synucleinopathy in an A53T transgenic mouse model.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 658-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell-based studies on human tissue could potentially identify early molecular events linking environmental and genetic factors in PD. Recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology provide an opportunity to study these events in human context (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar, Saha and Jaenisch, 2009Saha K. Jaenisch R. Technical challenges in using human induced pluripotent stem cells to model disease.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Recently, this technology was used to generate hiPSC models of PD patients’ cells carrying disease-causing mutations (Nguyen et al., 2011Nguyen H.N. Byers B. Cord B. Shcheglovitov A. Byrne J. Gujar P. Kee K. Schüle B. Dolmetsch R.E. Langston W. et al.LRRK2 mutant iPSC-derived DA neurons demonstrate increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, Cooper et al., 2012Cooper O. Seo H. Andrabi S. Guardia-Laguarta C. Graziotto J. Sundberg M. McLean J.R. Carrillo-Reid L. Xie Z. Osborn T. et al.Pharmacological rescue of mitochondrial deficits in iPSC-derived neural cells from patients with familial Parkinson’s disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4: 141ra90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These models recapitulate key features of PD and validate the feasibility of using hiPSCs to model the disease. However, lack of genetically matched nondiseased controls makes interpretation of observed phenotypes difficult to attribute solely to the disease-causing mutation. This confounding variable must be overcome, as differences in genetic background between cell types may critically influence data interpretation. Moreover, the relevance of findings from the above studies to PD is further undermined by limited representation of A9-type DA neurons following differentiation of hiPSCs to neurons. Two recent events have allowed us to resolve the above issues. First, we generated isogenic stem cell models of PD (Soldner et al., 2011Soldner F. Laganière J. Cheng A.W. Hockemeyer D. Gao Q. Alagappan R. Khurana V. Golbe L.I. Myers R.H. Lindquist S. et al.Generation of isogenic pluripotent stem cells differing exclusively at two early onset Parkinson point mutations.Cell. 2011; 146: 318-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) in which we “correct” a SNCA-A53T mutation in patient-derived hiPSCs or “knock in” the same mutation in a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line. This results in two pairs of isogenic stem cells that differ exclusively at the SNCA locus that can be used to study PD. Second, nearly pure populations of A9-type DA neurons can now be generated from pluripotent cells (Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C. Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). By combining these two methods, we tested a “multi-hit” scenario whereby mitochondrial toxins and cellular genetic factors interact in PD pathology. We report here a molecular pathway whereby increased basal and mitochondrial toxin-induced nitrosative stress results in inhibition of transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) in A53T α-syn mutant A9 DA neurons (hNs) compared to corrected controls. We validate these findings using two distinct isogenic lines, representing both hiPSCs and hESCs, with disparate genetic backgrounds. Because MEF2C activity normally stimulates transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC1α), inhibition of MEF2C decreases this neuroprotective pathway. Disruption of the MEF2C-PGC1α pathway contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and culminates in apoptotic cell death. Our results identify redox-mediated protein posttranslational modifications, including S-nitrosylation and sulfonation of a critical cysteine residue in MEF2, as an early event contributing to neuronal damage in PD. Screening for small molecules that rescue neurons from these mitochondrial toxins, we validate the MEF2C-PGC1α pathway as a new drug target for PD. Using hiPSCs that allow comparison of the A53T α-syn mutation (A53T) with isogenic-corrected controls (Corr) (Soldner et al., 2011Soldner F. Laganière J. Cheng A.W. Hockemeyer D. Gao Q. Alagappan R. Khurana V. Golbe L.I. Myers R.H. Lindquist S. et al.Generation of isogenic pluripotent stem cells differing exclusively at two early onset Parkinson point mutations.Cell. 2011; 146: 318-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), we characterized the lineage progression of hiPSCs to dopaminergic (DA) neurons. To determine the impact of the A53T α-syn mutation on cellular pathology in PD, it was critical to generate the specific cell type affected in PD, A9 dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Using the protocol of Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C. Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, we differentiated hiPSC into A9 DA neurons with high efficiency (∼80% of total neurons) from both mutant A53T and corrected hiPSCs (Figures 1A–1E). Neurons progressed from hiPSCs to forkhead box A2 (FOXA2)+/LIM homeobox transcription factor 1α (LMX1A)+ or OTX2+ neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Next, upon terminal differentiation, they progressed to LMX1A+/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+, nuclear-receptor-related 1 protein (NURR1)+/TH+, or G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK2)+/TH+ neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). Electrophysiological characterization of hNs revealed voltage-dependent sodium currents (Figure 1C) and evoked action potentials (Figure 1D). Moreover, spontaneous, rapid (2–7 Hz) spikes, a hallmark of the A9 DA neuronal phenotype and consistent with the presence of CaV1.3 channels (Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C.

Electrophysiological parameters are listed in Table S1 available online. Additionally, we confirmed these results in a second set of isogenic PSC-derived neurons of disparate genetic background obtained from wild-type (WT) and A53T-mutated hESCs (Soldner et al., 2011Soldner F. Laganière J. Cheng A.W. Hockemeyer D. Gao Q. Alagappan R. Khurana V. Golbe L.I. Myers R.H.

A53T mutation induces α-syn aggregation into oligomeric β sheets, which result in deposition in Lewy bodies/neurites. We thus assessed whether basal synuclein pathology could be detected in A53T mutant hNs. Costaining for thioflavin T and total α-syn showed a dramatic increase in thioflavin T fluorescence that colocalized with α-syn in A53T hNs relative to corrected hNs, indicating accumulation of oligomerized α-syn (Figures 1F and 1G). We next confirmed Lewy body/neurite-like α-syn deposition using an alternative antibody approach to detect phosphorylation of α-syn on serine 129 (Wang et al., 2012Wang Y. Shi M. Chung K.A. Zabetian C.P. Leverenz J.B. Berg D. Srulijes K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Siderowf A.D. et al.Phosphorylated α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease. Sci.Transl. Med. 2012; 4: 121ra120Google Scholar). Antigenic labeling of α-syn phosphoserine (PS)-129 and ubiquitin again revealed Lewy neurite/body-like deposition in A53T, but not corrected hNs (Figures 1H and 1I). Immunoblots also showed elevated α-syn PS129 levels in A53T relative to corrected hNs (Figure S1E). Whereas α-syn protein levels were higher in A53T compared to control hNs from both isogenic lines (Figures S1E and S1F), allele-specific PCR revealed no difference in SNCA mRNA expression (Figures S1G–S1I). Additionally, qRT-PCR of hiPSC-derived A53T and corrected hNs revealed no quantitative difference in SNCA mRNA expression (1.0 versus 1.1 arbitrary units). Taken together with prior work, these data suggest that synuclein pathology is associated with increased α-syn stability in A53T hNs, similar to A53T α-syn mouse models and human PD brain (Li et al., 2004Li W. Lesuisse C. Xu Y. Troncoso J.C. Price D.L. Lee M.K. Stabilization of α-synuclein protein with aging and familial parkinson’s disease-linked A53T mutation.J.

Elevated tauopathy and α-synuclein pathology in postmortem Parkinson’s disease brains with and without dementia.Exp. Neurol. 2010; 225: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The presence of α-syn aggregates in A53T hNs under basal conditions led us to investigate other PD-relevant pathologies. For example, deficits in mitochondrial respiration are critically associated with neuronal dysfunction in PD. Therefore, we evaluated mitochondrial function in both A53T mutant and corrected hNs. Using the Seahorse platform to measure O2 consumption, we found a compromised maximal rate of mitochondrial respiration in A53T compared to corrected hNs (Figures 2A and 2B ), resulting in deficiency in spare respiratory capacity (50% versus 190% for A53T and corrected hNs, respectively). We thus assessed the ability of A53T mutant versus corrected hNs to respond to stress induced by mitochondrial toxins known to affect neuronal viability. Apoptosis was scored by TUNEL assay coupled with nuclear morphology or cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactivity. Choosing concentrations based on the EPA-reported lowest observable effect level (LOEL) (http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0183.htm), we determined the apoptotic index of the PD-associated pesticides PQ and MB alone and in combination, as well as that of rotenone in corrected and A53T mutant hNs (Figures 2C–2F, S2A, and S2B). These pesticides function in part by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I (PQ and rotenone) or III (MB) (Gomez et al., 2007Gomez C. Bandez M.J. Navarro A. Pesticides and impairment of mitochondrial function in relation with the parkinsonian syndrome.Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A53T mutant hNs relative to corrected control manifested increased susceptibility to toxin mediated-apoptosis. Interestingly, combined exposure of A53T mutant hNs to PQ/MB produced synergistic effects, decreasing the concentration of each toxin required to evoke death (Figures 2E and 2F). At 2.8 μM PQ and 1 μM MB, differential susceptibility to toxin-evoked death was observed between A53T mutant and corrected hNs. This differential susceptibility was also observed in hESC-derived WT and A53T mutant hNs (Figures S2C and S2D). Although α-syn expression and phosphorylation on serine 129 were greater in A53T hNs, mitochondrial toxins had no additional effect on α-syn expression or aberrant phosphorylation. We next sought to understand this differential susceptibly to mitochondrial toxins by profiling changes in gene expression to identify signaling pathway(s) that are aberrantly regulated in A53T mutant hNs versus corrected controls. We used global gene expression analysis via microarray to identify biological processes specifically altered under basal conditions in A53T versus corrected hNs (Figure 3A). Enrichment analysis based on Gene Ontology (GO) revealed a decrease in expression of prosurvival genes and genes associated with metabolic function (Figure S3A). Next, we screened regulatory networks of multiple transcription factors against our microarray data set to identify factors whose target gene sets were significantly altered (p < 0.05) in A53T hNs relative to corrected. Based on GO analysis, we prioritized transcription factors with known functions related to apoptosis (Figure 3B), cell survival (Figure 3C), and DA neuron-specific transcriptional regulation (Figure 3D). We found that transcription factors whose targets are involved in DA neuron regulation were highly enriched among downregulated genes in A53T hNs, with the prosurvival/neurogenic transcription factor MEF2 (Leifer et al., 1993Leifer D.

https://openalex.org/W2087267967,"Achieving the goal of malaria elimination will depend on targeting Plasmodium pathways essential across all life stages. Here we identify a lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase (PI(4)K), as the target of imidazopyrazines, a new antimalarial compound class that inhibits the intracellular development of multiple Plasmodium species at each stage of infection in the vertebrate host. Imidazopyrazines demonstrate potent preventive, therapeutic, and transmission-blocking activity in rodent malaria models, are active against blood-stage field isolates of the major human pathogens P. falciparum and P. vivax, and inhibit liver-stage hypnozoites in the simian parasite P. cynomolgi. We show that imidazopyrazines exert their effect through inhibitory interaction with the ATP-binding pocket of PI(4)K, altering the intracellular distribution of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Collectively, our data define PI(4)K as a key Plasmodium vulnerability, opening up new avenues of target-based discovery to identify drugs with an ideal activity profile for the prevention, treatment and elimination of malaria. The lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase (PI(4)K) is identified as a target of the imidazopyrazines, a new antimalarial compound class that can inhibit several Plasmodium species at each stage of the parasite life cycle; the imidazopyrazines exert their inhibitory action by interacting with the ATP-binding pocket of PI(4)K. To eliminate malaria completely it is necessary to cure an individual of all stages in the malaria parasite's life cycle including the symptomatic blood-stage infection and the preceding liver-stage infection (to prevent relapse) and also to block transmission to mosquitoes. Here Elizabeth Winzeler and colleagues identify phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase (PI(4)K) as a potential drug target that is essential to fatty acid metabolism in all stages of the Plasmodium parasite. The authors show that a family of compounds with an imidazopyrazine core, distinct from known antimalarials, inhibits PI(4)K and also inhibits the development of multiple Plasmodium species at each stage of the life cycle. Their analyses reveal that the imidazopyrazines interact with the ATP-binding pocket of PI(4)K, altering the intracellular distribution of phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate and interfering with cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1972928030,"A new approach to accurately determine mutation frequencies with RNA virus populations called circular sequencing (CirSeq) has been developed; a study of the genetic composition of populations of poliovirus shows the fitness landscape for each nucleotide variant in an evolving RNA virus. Raul Andino and colleagues report a new approach to the determination of mutation frequencies within RNA virus populations. The new technique, circular sequencing (CirSeq), uses circularized genomic RNA fragments to generate tandem repeats that then serve as substrates for next-generation sequencing. The authors use CirSeq to track the genetic composition of populations of poliovirus replicating in human cells in culture and uncover the mutational landscape of the population. The extent of change in mutation frequency for each variant over the course of passage in cell culture is a measure of the relative fitness of each variant, thereby delineating the fitness landscape for an evolving RNA virus. RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations1. It is thought that diversity and genetic structure of viral populations determine the rapid adaptation observed in RNA viruses2 and hence their pathogenesis3. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution has been limited by the inability to accurately describe the genetic structure of virus populations. Next-generation sequencing technologies generate data of sufficient depth to characterize virus populations, but are limited in their utility because most variants are present at very low frequencies and are thus indistinguishable from next-generation sequencing errors. Here we present an approach that reduces next-generation sequencing errors and allows the description of virus populations with unprecedented accuracy. Using this approach, we define the mutation rates of poliovirus and uncover the mutation landscape of the population. Furthermore, by monitoring changes in variant frequencies on serially passaged populations, we determined fitness values for thousands of mutations across the viral genome. Mapping of these fitness values onto three-dimensional structures of viral proteins offers a powerful approach for exploring structure–function relationships and potentially uncovering new functions. To our knowledge, our study provides the first single-nucleotide fitness landscape of an evolving RNA virus and establishes a general experimental platform for studying the genetic changes underlying the evolution of virus populations."

It is unknown, however, how extinction learning-induced changes in mPFC activity are relayed to target structures in the amygdala, resulting in diminished fear responses. Here, we show that fear extinction decreases the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission in projections from the mPFC to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), whereas inhibitory responses are not altered. In contrast, synaptic strength at direct mPFC inputs to intercalated neurons remains unchanged after extinction. Moreover, priming stimulation of mPFC projections induced heterosynaptic inhibition in auditory cortical inputs to the BLA. These synaptic mechanisms could contribute to the encoding of extinction memory by diminishing the ability of projections from the mPFC to drive BLA activity while retaining the ability of intercalated neurons to inhibit the output nuclei of the amygdala."

Here we reconstitute cohesin loading onto DNA using purified fission yeast cohesin and its loader complex, Mis4(Scc2)-Ssl3(Scc4) (Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene names appear throughout with their more commonly known Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterparts added in superscript). Incubation of cohesin with DNA leads to spontaneous topological loading, but this remains inefficient. The loader contacts cohesin at multiple sites around the ring circumference, including the hitherto enigmatic Psc3(Scc3) subunit, and stimulates cohesin's ATPase, resulting in efficient topological loading. The in vitro reconstitution of cohesin loading onto DNA provides mechanistic insight into the initial steps of the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and other chromosomal processes mediated by cohesin."

Tet1 is one of the ten-eleven translocation family proteins, which have the capacity to oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC), specifically expressed in reprogramming PGCs. Here we report that Tet1 has a critical role in the erasure of genomic imprinting. We show that despite their identical genotype, progenies derived from mating between Tet1 knockout males and wild-Peg10 and Peg3, which exhibit aberrant hypermethylation in the paternal allele of differential methylated regions (DMRs). RNA-seq reveals extensive dysregulation of imprinted genes in the next generation due to paternal loss of Tet1 function. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of embryonic day 13.5 PGCs and sperm of Tet1 knockout mice revealed hypermethylation of DMRs of imprinted genes in sperm, which can be traced back to PGCs. Analysis of the DNA methylation dynamics in reprogramming PGCs indicates that Tet1 functions to wipe out remaining methylation, including imprinted genes, at the late reprogramming stage. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the role of Tet1 in the erasure of paternal imprints in the female germ line. Thus, our study establishes a critical function of Tet1 in the erasure of genomic imprinting."
https://openalex.org/W1973943921,"Introduction Understanding how bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance grow in the presence of antibiotics is critical for predicting the spread and evolution of drug resistance. Because drugs inhibit cell growth and a cell’s growth state globally influences its gene expression, the expression of drug resistance is subject to an innate, growth-mediated feedback, leading to complex behaviors that affect both the characterization and the prevention of antibiotic resistance. We characterized the consequences of this feedback for the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Methods We studied the growth of Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics, by using both bulk and single-cell techniques. The growth of each strain was quantified in a broad range of drug concentrations by using time-lapse microscopy (to track the responses of individual cells to antibiotics inside a microfluidic chemostat) and by the enrichment of batch cultures for nongrowing cells. We formulated a quantitative phenomenological model to predict the growth rates of drug-resistant strains in the presence of drugs, based on the well-characterized biochemistry of drug and drug-resistance interactions and on bacterial growth laws that dictate relations between cell growth and gene expression. We tested the model predictions for various drugs and resistance mechanisms by constructing strains that constitutively express varying degrees of drug resistance. Results In strains expressing a moderate degree of drug resistance, growth rates dropped abruptly above a critical drug concentration, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), whose value increased linearly with the basal level of resistance expression (see figure below, panel A). Cells exhibited growth bistability over a broad range of drug concentrations below the MIC: Isogenic cells expressing drug resistance coexisted in growing and nongrowing states in a homogeneous environment (panel B). Our model accurately predicted the range of drug concentrations in which growth bistability occurred, as well as the growth rates of the growing subpopulation, without any ad hoc fitting parameters. These findings reveal a plateau-like fitness landscape (panel A), which can be used to study the evolution of drug resistance in environments with varying drug concentrations. Discussion The broad occurrence of growth bistability in drug-resistant bacteria challenges the common notions and measures of drug efficacy and resistance. And because growth bistability can arise without complex regulation when gene expression is coupled to the state of cell growth, similar physiological links may underlie the growth bistability implicated in causing bacterial persistence. The availability of quantitative, predictive models will facilitate the formulation of strategies to limit the efficacy and evolvability of drug resistance."

Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), more luminous than known stellar processes but less so than active galactic nuclei, are generally thought to be powered by either intermediate-mass black holes or smaller, stellar-mass black holes radiating at higher rates. Analysis of the optical spectra of M 101 ULX-1, a variable source in the nearby spiral galaxy M 101, suggests that matters may be more complicated. The luminosity of the source at the time of discovery was within the range expected for a ULX harbouring an intermediate-mass black hole. But the optical spectra reported here are consistent with the presence of a stellar-mass black hole, probably with a mass of 20–30 solar masses. The authors suggest that M 101 ULX-1 is driven by a black hole accreting gas from the wind of a companion star, a mechanism that had previously been rejected on the grounds that it was thought too slow for the purpose. There are two proposed explanations for ultraluminous X-ray sources1,2 (ULXs) with luminosities in excess of 1039 erg s−1. They could be intermediate-mass black holes (more than 100–1,000 solar masses, ) radiating at sub-maximal (sub-Eddington) rates, as in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries but with larger, cooler accretion disks3,4,5. Alternatively, they could be stellar-mass black holes radiating at Eddington or super-Eddington rates2,6. On its discovery, M 101 ULX-14,7 had a luminosity of 3 × 1039 erg s−1 and a supersoft thermal disk spectrum with an exceptionally low temperature—uncomplicated by photons energized by a corona of hot electrons—more consistent with the expected appearance of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole3,4. Here we report optical spectroscopic monitoring of M 101 ULX-1. We confirm the previous suggestion8 that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star, and reveal that the orbital period is 8.2 days. The black hole has a minimum mass of 5 , and more probably a mass of 20 −30 , but we argue that it is very unlikely to be an intermediate-mass black hole. Therefore, its exceptionally soft spectra at high Eddington ratios violate the expectations for accretion onto stellar-mass black holes9,10,11. Accretion must occur from captured stellar wind, which has hitherto been thought to be so inefficient that it could not power an ultraluminous source12,13."

https://openalex.org/W1971760965,"After biosynthesis, an evolutionarily conserved acyl chain remodeling process generates a final highly homogeneous and yet tissue-specific molecular form of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin. Hence, cardiolipin molecules in different organisms, and even different tissues within the same organism, contain a distinct collection of attached acyl chains. This observation is the basis for the widely accepted paradigm that the acyl chain composition of cardiolipin is matched to the unique mitochondrial demands of a tissue. For this hypothesis to be correct, cardiolipin molecules with different acyl chain compositions should have distinct functional capacities, and cardiolipin that has been remodeled should promote cardiolipin-dependent mitochondrial processes better than its unremodeled form. However, functional disparities between different molecular forms of cardiolipin have never been established. Here, we interrogate this simple but crucial prediction utilizing the best available model to do so, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, we compare the ability of unremodeled and remodeled cardiolipin, which differ markedly in their acyl chain composition, to support mitochondrial activities known to require cardiolipin. Surprisingly, defined changes in the acyl chain composition of cardiolipin do not alter either mitochondrial morphology or oxidative phosphorylation. Importantly, preventing cardiolipin remodeling initiation in yeast lacking TAZ1, an ortholog of the causative gene in Barth syndrome, ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, our data do not support the prevailing hypothesis that unremodeled cardiolipin is functionally distinct from remodeled cardiolipin, at least for the functions examined, suggesting alternative physiological roles for this conserved pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2105972705,"Cycles of electron capture and β− decay involving neutron-rich nuclei at a typical depth of about 150 metres are found to cool the outer crust of a neutron star by emitting neutrinos while also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the deeper crust; this mechanism has been studied in other astrophysical environments, but has not hitherto been considered in neutron stars. It has been suggested that the heated crust of a neutron star — its outermost kilometre — influences observable phenomena at shallower depths. Hendrik Schatz et al. have now identified a novel cooling process taking place at the relatively shallow depth of 150 metres in the crust of a neutron star, in which nuclei continuously decay and re-form through cycles of electron-capture and β−-decay, emitting neutrinos in the process. This 'Urca' mechanism has been seen in other bodies such as white dwarfs, but has not been previously linked to neutron stars. This thermal decoupling implies that X-ray bursts and other surface phenomena are largely independent of the strength of deep crustal heating. The temperature in the crust of an accreting neutron star, which comprises its outermost kilometre, is set by heating from nuclear reactions at large densities1,2,3,4, neutrino cooling5,6 and heat transport from the interior7,8,9,10,11. The heated crust has been thought to affect observable phenomena at shallower depths, such as thermonuclear bursts in the accreted envelope10,11. Here we report that cycles of electron capture and its inverse, β− decay, involving neutron-rich nuclei at a typical depth of about 150 metres, cool the outer neutron star crust by emitting neutrinos while also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the deeper crust. This ‘Urca’ mechanism12 has been studied in the context of white dwarfs13 and type Ia supernovae14,15, but hitherto was not considered in neutron stars, because previous models1,2 computed the crust reactions using a zero-temperature approximation and assumed that only a single nuclear species was present at any given depth. The thermal decoupling means that X-ray bursts and other surface phenomena are largely independent of the strength of deep crustal heating. The unexpectedly short recurrence times, of the order of years, observed for very energetic thermonuclear superbursts16 are therefore not an indicator of a hot crust, but may point instead to an unknown local heating mechanism near the neutron star surface."
https://openalex.org/W1972903141,"'Pre-leukaemic' mutations are thought to promote clonal expansion of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by increasing self-renewal and competitiveness; however, mutations that increase HSC proliferation tend to reduce competitiveness and self-renewal potential, raising the question of how a mutant HSC can sustainably outcompete wild-type HSCs. Activating mutations in NRAS are prevalent in human myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukaemia. Here we show that a single allele of oncogenic Nras(G12D) increases HSC proliferation but also increases reconstituting and self-renewal potential upon serial transplantation in irradiated mice, all prior to leukaemia initiation. Nras(G12D) also confers long-term self-renewal potential to multipotent progenitors. To explore the mechanism by which Nras(G12D) promotes HSC proliferation and self-renewal, we assessed cell-cycle kinetics using H2B-GFP label retention and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Nras(G12D) had a bimodal effect on HSCs, increasing the frequency with which some HSCs divide and reducing the frequency with which others divide. This mirrored bimodal effects on reconstituting potential, as rarely dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs outcompeted wild-type HSCs, whereas frequently dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs did not. Nras(G12D) caused these effects by promoting STAT5 signalling, inducing different transcriptional responses in different subsets of HSCs. One signal can therefore increase HSC proliferation, competitiveness and self-renewal through bimodal effects on HSC gene expression, cycling and reconstituting potential."

Despite immense chemical diversity of known TAS2R14 ligands, novel ligands and previously unknown polypharmacology of drugs were unraveled by in vitro screening of computational predictions. This enables rational repurposing of traditional and standard drugs for bitter taste signaling modulation for therapeutic indications.—Levit, A., Nowak, S., Peters, M., Wiener, A., Meyerhof, W., Behrens, M., Niv, M.

https://openalex.org/W2079698011,"Triiodothyronine (T3) regulates key metabolic processes in the liver through the thyroid hormone receptor, TRβ1. However, the number of known target genes directly regulated by TRβ1 is limited, and the mechanisms by which positive and especially negative transcriptional regulation occur are not well understood. To characterize the TRβ1 cistrome in vivo, we expressed a biotinylated TRβ1 in hypo- and hyperthyroid mouse livers, used ChIP-seq to identify genomic TRβ1 targets, and correlated these data with gene expression changes. As with other nuclear receptors, the majority of TRβ1 binding sites were not in proximal promoters but in the gene body of known genes. Remarkably, T3 can dictate changes in TRβ1 binding, with strong correlation to T3-induced gene expression changes, suggesting that differential TRβ1 binding regulates transcriptional outcome. Additionally, DR-4 and DR-0 motifs were significantly enriched at binding sites where T3 induced an increase or decrease in TRβ1 binding, respectively, leading to either positive or negative regulation by T3. Taken together, the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by TRβ1 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2128361103,"Unlike formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), FPR2/ALX (FPR2) interacts with peptides of diverse sequences but has low affinity for the Escherichia coli-derived chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF). Using computer modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we investigated the structural requirements for FPR2 to interact with formyl peptides of different length and composition. In calcium flux assay, the N-formyl group of these peptides is necessary for activation of both FPR2 and FPR1, whereas the composition of the C-terminal amino acids appears more important for FPR2 than FPR1. FPR2 interacts better with pentapeptides (fMLFII, fMLFIK) than tetrapeptides (fMLFK, fMLFW) and tripeptide (fMLF) but only weakly with peptides carrying negative charges at the C terminus (e.g. fMLFE). In contrast, FPR1 is less sensitive to negative charges at the C terminus. A CXCR4-based homology model of FPR1 and FPR2 suggested that Asp-281(7.32) is crucial for the interaction of FPR2 with certain formyl peptides as its negative charge may be repulsive with the terminal COO- group of fMLF and negatively charged Glu in fMLFE. Asp-281(7.32) might also form a stable interaction with the positively charged Lys in fMLFK. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to remove the negative charge at position 281 in FPR2. The D281(7.32)G mutant showed improved affinity for fMLFE and fMLF and reduced affinity for fMLFK compared with wild type FPR2. These results indicate that different structural determinants are used by FPR1 and FPR2 to interact with formyl peptides."

HER2 stimulates breast tumorigenesis via a number of intracellular signaling molecules, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK.S100A14,one member of the S100 protein family, is significantly associated with outcome of breast cancer patients. Here, for the first time, we show that S100A14 and HER2 are coexpressed in invasive breast cancer specimens,andthere is a significant correlation between the expression levels of the two proteins by immunohistochemistry. S100A14 and HER2 are colocalized in plasma membrane of breast cancer tissue cells and breast cancer cell lines BT474 and SK-BR3. We demonstrate that S100A14 binds directly to HER2 by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. Further study shows that residues 956–1154 of the HER2 intracellular domain and residue 83 of S100A14 are essential for the two proteins binding.Moreover,we observe a decrease of HER2 phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and HER2-stimulated cell proliferation in S100A14-silenced MCF-7, BT474, and SK-BR3 cells. Our findings suggest that S100A14 functions as a modulator of HER2 signaling and provide mechanistic evidence for its role in breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2087179464,"Multisensory plasticity enables us to dynamically adapt sensory cues to one another and to the environment. Without external feedback, ""unsupervised"" multisensory calibration reduces cue conflict in a manner largely independent of cue reliability. But environmental feedback regarding cue accuracy (""supervised"") also affects calibration. Here we measured the combined influence of cue accuracy and cue reliability on supervised multisensory calibration, using discrepant visual and vestibular motion stimuli. When the less reliable cue was inaccurate, it alone got calibrated. However, when the more reliable cue was inaccurate, cues were yoked and calibrated together in the same direction. Strikingly, the less reliable cue shifted away from external feedback, becoming less accurate. A computational model in which supervised and unsupervised calibration work in parallel, where the former only relies on the multisensory percept, but the latter can calibrate cues individually, accounts for the observed behavior. In combination, they could ultimately achieve the optimal solution of both external accuracy and internal consistency."

Here, we show that PPARγ also binds to enhancers already active in preadipocytes as evidenced by an active chromatin state including lower DNA methylation levels despite higher CpG content. These constitutive enhancers are linked to genes involved in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway that are transcriptionally induced during adipogenesis but to a lower extent than lipid metabolism genes, because of stronger basal expression levels in preadipocytes. This is consistent with the sequential involvement of hormonal sensitivity and lipid handling during adipocyte maturation and correlates with the chromatin structure dynamics at constitutive and activated enhancers. Interestingly, constitutive enhancers are evolutionary conserved and can be activated in other tissues, in contrast to enhancers controlling lipid handling genes whose activation is more restricted to adipocytes.

To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the BL-dependent activation of the kinase, the photochemistry, kinase activity, and molecular structure were studied with the phot of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Full-length and LOV2-KD samples of C. reinhardtii phot showed cyclic photoreaction characteristics with the activation of LOV- and BL-dependent kinase. Truncation of LOV1 decreased the photosensitivity of the kinase activation, which was well explained by the fact that the signaling state lasted for a shorter period of time compared with that of the phot.

https://openalex.org/W2022200344,"In a previous study, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Gp78 by RNAi high-throughput screening as a gene whose depletion restricted enterovirus infection. In the current study, we show that Gp78, which localizes to the ER-mitochondria interface, is a regulator of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) antiviral signaling. We show that depletion of Gp78 results in a robust decrease of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection and a corresponding enhancement of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Mechanistically, we show that Gp78 modulates type I IFN induction by altering both the expression and signaling of the mitochondria-localized RLR adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). Expression of mutants of Gp78 that abolish its E3 ubiquitin ligase and its participation in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) lost their ability to degrade MAVS, but surprisingly maintained their ability to repress RLR signaling. In contrast, Gp78 lacking its entire C terminus lost both its ability to degrade MAVS and repress RLR signaling. We show that Gp78 interacts with both the N- and C-terminal domains of MAVS via its C-terminal RING domain, and that this interaction is required to abrogate Gp78-mediated attenuation of MAVS signaling. Our data thus implicate two parallel pathways by which Gp78 regulates MAVS signaling; one pathway requires its E3 ubiquitin ligase and ERAD activity to directly degrade MAVS, whereas the other pathway occurs independently of these activities, but requires the Gp78 RING domain and occurs via a direct association between this region and MAVS."

https://openalex.org/W2075783807,"Peripheral nerve transection and neuroma-in-continuity injuries are associated with permanent functional deficits, often despite successful end-organ reinnervation. Axonal misdirection with non-specific reinnervation, frustrated regeneration and axonal attrition are believed to be among the anatomical substrates that underlie the poor functional recovery associated with these devastating injuries. Yet, functional deficits associated with axonal misdirection in experimental neuroma-in-continuity injuries have not yet been studied. We hypothesized that experimental neuroma-in-continuity injuries would result in motor axon misdirection and attrition with proportional persistent functional deficits. The femoral nerve misdirection model was exploited to assess major motor pathway misdirection and axonal attrition over a spectrum of experimental nerve injuries, with neuroma-in-continuity injuries simulated by the combination of compression and traction forces in 42 male rats. Sciatic nerve injuries were employed in an additional 42 rats, to evaluate the contribution of axonal misdirection to locomotor deficits by a ladder rung task up to 12 weeks. Retrograde motor neuron labeling techniques were utilized to determine the degree of axonal misdirection and attrition. Characteristic histological neuroma-in-continuity features were demonstrated in the neuroma-in-continuity groups and poor functional recovery was seen despite successful nerve regeneration and muscle reinnervation. Good positive and negative correlations were observed respectively between axonal misdirection (p<.0001, r2=.67), motor neuron counts (attrition) (p<.0001, r2=.69) and final functional deficits. We demonstrate prominent motor axon misdirection and attrition in neuroma-in-continuity and transection injuries of mixed motor nerves that contribute to the long-term functional deficits. Although widely accepted in theory, to our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence to convincingly demonstrate these correlations with data inclusive of the neuroma-in-continuity spectrum. This work emphasizes the need to focus on strategies that promote both robust and accurate nerve regeneration to optimize functional recovery. It also demonstrates that clinically relevant neuroma-in-continuity injuries can now also be subjected to experimental investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2054594974,"Forkhead-associated (FHA) and BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains are overrepresented in DNA damage and replication stress response proteins. They function primarily as phosphoepitope recognition modules but can also mediate non-canonical interactions. The latter are rare, and only a few have been studied at a molecular level. We have identified a crucial non-canonical interaction between the N-terminal FHA1 domain of the checkpoint effector kinase Rad53 and the BRCT domain of the regulatory subunit of the Dbf4-dependent kinase that is critical to suppress late origin firing and to stabilize stalled forks during replication stress. The Rad53-Dbf4 interaction is phosphorylation-independent and involves a novel non-canonical interface on the FHA1 domain. Mutations within this surface result in hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress. Importantly, this surface is not conserved in the FHA2 domain of Rad53, suggesting that the FHA domains of Rad53 gain specificity by engaging additional interaction interfaces beyond their phosphoepitope-binding site. In general, our results point to FHA domains functioning as complex logic gates rather than mere phosphoepitope-targeting modules."

Epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, are critical factors underlying differentiated phenotypes. We examined the dependency of matrix-induced fibroproliferation and SMC phenotype on DNA methyltransferases. The cooperativity of matrix with growth factors, cell density and hypoxia was also examined. Primary rat visceral SMC of early passage (0–2) were plated on native collagen or damaged/heat-denatured collagen. Hypoxia was induced with 3% O2 (balanced 5% CO2 and 95% N2) over 48 hours. Inhibitors were applied 2–3 hours after cells were plated on matrix, or immediately before hypoxia. Cells were fixed and stained for DNMT3A and smooth muscle actin (SMA) or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. Illumina 450 K array of CpG sites was performed on bisulfite-converted DNA from smooth muscle cells on damaged matrix vs native collagen. Matrix exquisitely regulates DNMT3A localization and expression, and influences differentiation in SMCs exposed to denatured matrix +/− hypoxia. Analysis of DNA methylation signatures showed that Matrix caused significant DNA methylation alterations in a discrete number of CpG sites proximal to genes related to SMC differentiation. Matrix has a profound effect on the regulation of SMC phenotype, which is associated with altered expression, localization of DNMTs and discrete changes DNA methylation."

In a previous study, we demonstrated that h2-calponin protein and mRNA was significantly decreased in NIH/3T3 cells when cytoskeleton tension was reduced after blebbstatin inhibition of myosin II motor function (14Hossain M.M. Smith P.G. Wu K. Jin J.P. Cytoskeletal tension regulates both expression and degradation of h2-calponin in lung alveolar cells.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15670-15683Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to the endogenous h2-calponin gene, transfective expression of h2-calponin cDNA under the control of CMV promoter was not regulated by mechanical tension (13Hossain M.M. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. Lin J.J. Jin J.P. h2-Calponin is regulated by mechanical tension and modifies the function of actin cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42442-42453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that transcriptional control is a primary regulation for the mechanoregulation of h2-calponin gene expression. The promoter of CNN2 gene therefore provides a novel experimental system to investigate how mechanical force signal is transduced in the regulation of gene transcription (23Shivashankar G.V. Mechanosignaling to the cell nucleus and gene regulation.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the transcriptional activity of h2-calponin gene promoter for its mechanoregulation. We cloned mouse genomic DNA containing the Cnn2 promoter, constructed reporter genes, and analyzed transcriptional activity in several mammalian cell types that express endogenous h2-calponin under mechanoregulation. Using cell culture substrate of different stiffness, transcriptional activities of truncation, deletion, and site-specific mutation promoter constructs were studied to identify an HES-1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) cis-regulatory element downstream of the Notch signaling pathway. As described previously, NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC CRL1658) were cultured in plastic dishes statically in an attached monolayer or under continuous vibration to prevent attachment to the dishes (26Hossain M.M. Hwang D.Y. Huang Q.Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.P. Developmentally regulated expression of calponin isoforms and the effect of h2-calponin on cell proliferation.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 days, the cells were washed with PBS, and total cellular protein was extracted for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (ATCC, CRL1573) and mouse fibroblast line NIH/3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (50 IU/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Monolayer cultures of cells at ∼70% confluence were trypsinized and passed at 1:10 ratio for use in experiments. Mouse skeletal myoblast line C2C12 (ATCC, CRL1772) was cultured with the same media conditions and trypsinized at ∼50% confluence to pass at 1:5 ratio for use in experiments. To examine the effect of substrate stiffness-dependent cytoskeleton tension on h2-calponin gene expression, HEK293, NIH/3T3, and C2C12 cells were seeded on a thin layer (45 × 50 mm, ∼100-μm thickness) of polyacrylamide gel of different stiffness. Hard (16% gel with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 19:1, Ef = ∼75 kilopascal) and soft (5% gel with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 500:3, Ef = ∼1 kilopascal) gel substrates were prepared and covalently coated with 0.2 mg/ml type I collagen as described previously (13Hossain M.M.

After 3 days of culture, the cells were harvested using a cell scraper, washed three times with PBS, and processed for analyses. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as previously described (13Hossain M.M. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. Lin J.J.

The monolayer cells were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS and analyzed using 12% gel in Laemmli buffer system with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to verify sample integrity and normalize protein concentration. Protein bands in unfixed duplicate gels were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting with a rabbit antiserum, RAH2, raised against mouse h2-calponin (26Hossain M.M. Hwang D.Y. Huang Q.Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.P. Developmentally regulated expression of calponin isoforms and the effect of h2-calponin on cell proliferation.Am. J. Physiol.

The calponin or HES-1 band recognized by the first antibody was revealed using alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chromogenic substrate reaction. From the screening of a mouse genomic library with a mouse h2-calponin cDNA probe as described previously (16Huang Q.Q. Hossain M.M. Wu K. Parai K. Pope R.M. Jin J.P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25887-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), lambda phage clones containing mouse Cnn2 gene (NC_000076.5) were isolated. A 5,058-bp BamHI restriction fragment containing the promoter of Cnn2 gene (−3,765 to +1,292) was subcloned into plasmid vectors. The region of −3,765 to +6 was further subcloned as a BamHI-SmaI fragment into the pcDNA3.1(+)/chloramphenical acetyltransferase (CAT) 3The abbreviations used are:CATchloramphenical acetyltransferaseDAPTN-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl esterEfelastic forcePEITCphenethyl isothiocyanateRXRvitamin D receptor/retinoic acid X receptor. plasmid vector (Invitrogen) to replace the CMV promoter in front of the CAT coding sequence. chloramphenical acetyltransferase N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester elastic force phenethyl isothiocyanate vitamin D receptor/retinoic acid X receptor. After demonstrating transcriptional activity of the −3.77-kb mouse Cnn2 promoter-CAT reporter construct, we constructed six 5′ serial truncation clones to map the cis-regulatory elements. As illustrated in Fig. 1, −2.12-kb (−2,115 to +6) and −0.61-kb (−611 to +6) clones were constructed from the −3.77-kb clone by restriction enzyme digestion-generated deletions. Four other 5′ truncation Cnn2 promoter constructs, −1.57 kb (−1,572 to +6), −1.38 kb (−1,380 to +6), −1.24 kb (−1,244 to +6), and −1.00 kb (−1,002 to +6), were constructed using PCR-generated DNA fragments from the −3.77-kb template. A common 3′ primer located in the CAT coding sequence was used to pair with different 5′ primers to generate these constructions. The primer pairs introduced a BamHI site at the 5′-end and a NotI restriction site at the 3′-end for unidirectional cloning of the PCR products into pcDNA3.1(+)/CAT reporter plasmid. A −1,572 to −1,380 internal deletion (−1.57-kb/−1.38-kb deletion) was constructed in the −2.12-kb Cnn2 promoter-reporter gene using recombinant PCR. Two oligonucleotide primers with complementary 5′ sequences were designed for use with flanking primers in the first PCR to amplify the −2,115 to −1,572 and −1,380 to +6 segments of the Cnn2 promoter (Fig. 1). A recombinant DNA fragment was generated by joining the two first PCR products in the second PCR. The internal deletion promoter construct was unidirectionally cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/CAT reporter plasmid as a BamHI-NotI fragment. The 5′ truncation and internal deletion constructs were verified by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 8 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 16 h. For each transfection, 0.04 pmol of the promoter-reporter plasmid was used with liposome reagent (Turbofect, Fermentas) at a 1:4 DNA/liposome (μg/μl) ratio. pEGFP-N1 plasmid encoding GFP under CMV promoter was co-transfected at a molar ratio of 1:20 versus the Cnn2 promoter construct to indicate the efficiency of transfection. DNA and liposome reagent were mixed in 100 μl of DMEM, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and added to the cell culture medium. After 6 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium for continuing culture of 24–30 h. NIH/3T3 and C2C12 cells were transfected similarly. 1 × 105 or 5 × 104 cells/well, respectively, were seeded in 12-well plates. 0.10 pmol of DNA was used for both NIH/3T3 and C2C12 cells at DNA/liposome ratios of 1:2 and 1:4, respectively (μg/μl). The cultures were examined using an inverted epifluorescence microscope for GFP-positive cells to evaluate the efficiency of transfection. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and lysed for use either directly or after short frozen storage at −80 °C in the quantification of reporter gene expression. For every promoter construct, three or more independent transfection experiments were performed to verify the results. To establish stable transfections, Cnn2 promoter-reporter plasmid DNA was linearized with restriction enzyme cleavage at the 5′ flanking BamHI (for the −1.57-, −1.38-, −1.24-, and −1.00-kb constructs) or AflII (for the −2.12-kb construct) site. 1 × 106 HEK293 cells were plated on a 100-mm dish for 16 h before the incubation with 0.2 μg of recombinant plasmid DNA mixed with 0.8 μl of liposome reagent for 6 h. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing G418 at a concentration predetermined to effectively kill untransfected cells in 2 weeks. Cultured in the selection medium for 10–14 days, single colonies of surviving and proliferating cells were picked manually as described previously (26Hossain M.M. Hwang D.Y. Huang Q.Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.P. Developmentally regulated expression of calponin isoforms and the effect of h2-calponin on cell proliferation.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), expanded, verified using PCR for the presence of the CAT reporter gene, examined using Western blot for the normal expression of endogenous h2-calponin, and studied for transcriptional activity of the Cnn2 promoter constructs. At least three original stable transfection clones expressing endogenous h2-calponin at a level similar to that of nontransfected control cells were studied for each promoter construct. To map the 5′-upstream region of Cnn2 promoter for cis-regulatory elements responsive to mechanoregulation, the stable transfected cell clones were cultured on polyacrylamide gel substrates of high or low stiffness as described above. After 72 h of culture, samples were collected to examine the expression of endogenous h2-calponin using Western blot and transcriptional activity of the Cnn2 promoter-reporter constructs. The results were summarized from at least three original stable transfection clones that have similar normal level expression of endogenous h2-calponin. CAT-ELISA was performed as previously described (27Huang Q.Q. Jin J.P. Preserved close linkage between the genes encoding troponin I and troponin T, reflecting an evolution of adapter proteins coupling the Ca2+ signaling of contractility.J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentration of cellular protein extracts was determined using Bradford assay and further normalized by SDS-PAGE gel densitometry. CAT expression of the Cnn2 promoter-reporter constructs was examined with a sandwich ELISA method using the reagent kit from Roche Applied Science. 100 μg of total protein extract of the transfected cells was dissolved in 100 μl of reaction buffer and loaded to each assay well of a 96-well plate. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h followed by standard ELISA steps, including washes, incubations with anti-CAT antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled second antibody, and substrate-enhancer reaction. A415 nm of each assay well was monitored at a series of time points with reference wavelength of 655 nm using an automated microplate reader (Bio-Rad Benchmark). Triplicate wells were examined for each sample. The transcriptional activity of the promoter-reporter constructs was normalized for transfection efficiency determined as the percentage of cells positive for the co-transfective expression of GFP. Absorbance data of soft gel cultures were compared with that of corresponding hard gel cultures to determine the percentage of down-regulation of each promoter construct. Bioinformatic analysis of transcription factor binding sites was performed using the Genomatix suite software (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich, Germany). The sequence of the −2.12-kb promoter segment of mouse Cnn2 gene was used as the target sequence for identification of putative transcription factor recognition sites using the MatInspector Version 8.0.5 program (28Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. MatInspector and beyond. Promoter analysis based on transcription factor binding sites.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The parameters used were the standard (0.75) core similarity and the optimized matrix similarity. Transcription factor binding sites found in the −1,572 to −1,380 and −1,380 to −1,244 regions were considered for potential correlation to mechanoregulation. A deletion from −1,438 to −1,423 was made in the −2.12-kb construct using recombinant PCR as described above for the −1.57 kb/−1.38 kb deletion. An HES-1 N-box mutation was made in the −2.12-kb construct using recombinant PCR, converting the −1,431 to −1,425 region of the Cnn2 promoter from CACGAG to TCTAGA (a new XbaI site was introduced for easy identification). K562 human myelogenous leukemia cells (ATCC, CCL-243) that were growing in culture nonadherently were employed to study the role of Notch signaling in regulating h2-calponin expression. The effects of a Notch inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), and a Notch activator, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), were examined. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/well in a 12-well culture plate in 1 ml of Iscove's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and various concentrations of the drug. The solvent control for DAPT was DMF at a concentration of 0.04%, and for PEITC was Me2SO at a concentration of 0.05%. Cells were cultured for 72 h, collected, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove the media. The cell pellets were washed with PBS for three times and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blotting as described above. Densitometry analysis of SDS gels and Western blots were performed using National Institutes of Health Image software (version 1.61) on digital images scanned at 600 dpi. The quantitative data are presented as means ± S.D. unless noted in the figure legend. Statistical analysis was done using the Microsoft Excel or Origin software. The significance of difference was established as p < 0.05.

Information on the financial burden for transportation during TB diagnosis and treatment was collected. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 26 TB patients were carried out to understand their perceptions of transportation subsidy initiative.The mean transportation cost of TB medical care was 97 CNY (70 CNY in median), varying from 0 to 700 CNY. About 51% of the patients spent more than 10 CNY per round trip to the TB dispensary. Of the 429 TB patients investigated, 139 had received transportation subsidies after getting TB diagnosis; 15/139 (10.9%) showed dissatisfaction, mainly because the subsidy amount being insufficient. The income of patients receiving transportation subsidies was significantly lower than those not receiving the subsidies (p<0.05). The impression that an appropriate transportation subsidy enables patients to complete the required visits during their TB treatment was obtained after observation of over 80% of the patients.The transportation subsidy plays an important role in reducing financial burden on poor TB patients for the completion of treatment. However, the coverage was limited and the amount of subsidy was not enough under the present policy. Considering the poverty of rural TB patients, a universal coverage and a rational amount of transportation subsidy should be proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2029872530,"eIF4B has been implicated in attachment of the 43 S preinitiation complex (PIC) to mRNAs and scanning to the start codon. We recently determined that the internal seven repeats (of ∼26 amino acids each) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF4B (yeIF4B) compose the region most critically required to enhance mRNA recruitment by 43 S PICs in vitro and stimulate general translation initiation in yeast. Moreover, although the N-terminal domain (NTD) of yeIF4B contributes to these activities, the RNA recognition motif is dispensable. We have now determined that only two of the seven internal repeats are sufficient for wild-type (WT) yeIF4B function in vivo when all other domains are intact. However, three or more repeats are needed in the absence of the NTD or when the functions of eIF4F components are compromised. We corroborated these observations in the reconstituted system by demonstrating that yeIF4B variants with only one or two repeats display substantial activity in promoting mRNA recruitment by the PIC, whereas additional repeats are required at lower levels of eIF4A or when the NTD is missing. These findings indicate functional overlap among the 7-repeats and NTD domains of yeIF4B and eIF4A in mRNA recruitment. Interestingly, only three highly conserved positions in the 26-amino acid repeat are essential for function in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified conserved motifs in the NTD and demonstrate functional overlap of two such motifs. These results provide a comprehensive description of the critical sequence elements in yeIF4B that support eIF4F function in mRNA recruitment by the PIC."
https://openalex.org/W2065814168,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterized by injury, inflammation, and scarring of alveoli, leading to impaired function. The etiology of idiopathic forms of ILD is not understood, making them particularly difficult to study due to the lack of appropriate animal models. Consequently, few effective therapies have emerged. We developed an inbred mouse model of ILD using vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), the most common form of a transition metal found in cigarette smoke, fuel ash, mineral ores, and steel alloys. Pulmonary responses to V2O5, including dose-dependent increases in lung permeability, inflammation, collagen content, and dysfunction, were significantly greater in DBA/2J mice compared to C57BL/6J mice. Inflammatory and fibrotic responses persisted for 4 mo in DBA/2J mice, while limited responses in C57BL/6J mice resolved. We investigated the genetic basis for differential responses through genetic mapping of V2O5-induced lung collagen content in BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains and identified significant linkage on chromosome 4 with candidate genes that associate with V2O5-induced collagen content across the RI strains. Results suggest that V2O5 may induce pulmonary fibrosis through mechanisms distinct from those in other models of pulmonary fibrosis. These findings should further advance our understanding of mechanisms involved in ILD and thereby aid in identification of new therapeutic targets."

Although attempts to find the source of this statistic resulted in its description as “apocryphal” ( 1 ), most educators will agree that maintaining student interest during lecture is challenging, and dedicated readers of this series are well aware of the benefits of replacing lecture with inquiry-based instruction ( 2 ). Asking college students to design experiments to investigate human mate preference engages them in the process of science by appealing to their natural interest in the subject. The Evolution of Human Mate Preference module has been used in a lower-division majors' biology course at a community college. This multiday module gives students experience with researching the primary literature, formulating a testable hypothesis, conducting an experiment, analyzing data, and communicating ideas in a scientific paper or poster. Although some may argue that the development of these skills should begin at the upper division or graduate levels, lower-division students, when given frequent formative assessment and appropriate scaffolding ( 2 ), are quite successful with this module."
