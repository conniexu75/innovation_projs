https://openalex.org/W2031225004,"Quantifying the impact of heritable epigenetic variation on complex traits is an emerging challenge in population genetics. Here, we analyze a population of isogenic Arabidopsis lines that segregate experimentally induced DNA methylation changes at hundreds of regions across the genome. We demonstrate that several of these differentially methylated regions (DMRs) act as bona fide epigenetic quantitative trait loci (QTL epi ), accounting for 60 to 90% of the heritability for two complex traits, flowering time and primary root length. These QTL epi are reproducible and can be subjected to artificial selection. Many of the experimentally induced DMRs are also variable in natural populations of this species and may thus provide an epigenetic basis for Darwinian evolution independently of DNA sequence changes."

The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has multiple functions in flavivirus biology and is a target for vaccine development. Dimeric NS1 is essential for replication of the viral genome inside host cells, while hexameric NS1 is secreted and plays a role in evasion of the immune system. Akey et al. (p. 881 , published online 6 February; see the Perspective by Shi ) report crystal structures for full-length glycosylated NS1 from West Nile and dengue viruses. The structures show a hexamer comprised of three dimers. The structural analysis together with liposome and mutational studies identify a membrane interacting surface on one face of the dimer and an immune evasion surface on the other."

Present econophysics models are usually employed on presumed random networks of interacting agents, and only some macroscopic properties (e.g. the resulting wealth distribution) are compared to real-world data. In this paper, we analyze Bitcoin, which is a novel digital currency system, where the complete list of transactions is publicly available. Using this dataset, we reconstruct the network of transactions and extract the time and amount of each payment. We analyze the structure of the transaction network by measuring network characteristics over time, such as the degree distribution, degree correlations and clustering. We find that linear preferential attachment drives the growth of the network. We also study the dynamics taking place on the transaction network, i.e. the flow of money. We measure temporal patterns and the wealth accumulation. Investigating the microscopic statistics of money movement, we find that sublinear preferential attachment governs the evolution of the wealth distribution. We report a scaling law between the degree and wealth associated to individual nodes."

To determine if V1V2-specific Abs cross-react with V1V2 from different HIV-1 subtypes, if the nature of the V1V2 antigen used to asses cross-reactivity influenced infection risk, and to identify immune assays for upcoming HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials, new V1V2-scaffold antigens were designed and tested. Protein scaffold antigens carrying the V1V2 regions from HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D or CRF01_AE were assayed in pilot studies, and six were selected to assess cross-reactive Abs in the plasma from the original RV144 case-control cohort (41 infected vaccinees, 205 frequency-matched uninfected vaccinees, and 40 placebo recipients) using ELISA and a binding Ab multiplex assay. IgG levels to these antigens were assessed as correlates of risk in vaccine recipients using weighted logistic regression models. Levels of Abs reactive with subtype A, B, C and CRF01_AE V1V2-scaffold antigens were all significant inverse correlates of risk (p-values of 0.0008–0.05; estimated odds ratios of 0.53–0.68 per 1 standard deviation increase). Thus, levels of vaccine-induced IgG Abs recognizing V1V2 regions from multiple HIV-1 subtypes, and presented on different scaffolds, constitute inverse correlates of risk for HIV-1 infection in the RV144 vaccine trial. The V1V2 antigens provide a link between RV144 and upcoming HIV-1 vaccine trials, and identify reagents and methods for evaluating V1V2 Abs as possible correlates of protection against HIV-1 infection.

This CO molecule can undergo torsional vibrations, and a full understanding of the imaging mechanism requires a measure of this spring constant. Weymouth et al. (p. 1120 , published online 6 February; see the Perspective by Salmeron ) used lateral force microscopy, in which the tip vibrates laterally across the surface, to determine this torsional constant. The stiffness of the isolated CO molecules on the tip was much less than that for CO molecules adsorbed on planar surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2016224865,"The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is found in approximately half of all prostate cancers. The functional and prognostic significance of TMPRSS2-ERG is, however, not fully understood. Based on a historical watchful waiting cohort, an association between TMPRSS2-ERG, evaluated as positive immune staining, and shorter survival of prostate cancer patients was identified. Expression of ERG was also associated with clinical markers such as advanced tumor stage, high Gleason score, presence of metastasis and prognostic tumor cell markers such as high Ki67, pEGFR and pAkt. Novel associations between TMPRSS2-ERG and alterations in the tumor stroma, for example, increased vascular density, hyaluronan and PDGFRβ and decreased Caveolin-1, all known to be associated with an aggressive disease, were found. The present study suggests that the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene is associated with a more aggressive prostate cancer phenotype, supported by changes in the tumor stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2084367026,"Combining low cost wireless EEG sensors with smartphones offers novel opportunities for mobile brain imaging in an everyday context. We present a framework for building multi-platform, portable EEG applications with real-time 3D source reconstruction. The system - Smartphone Brain Scanner - combines an off-the-shelf neuroheadset or EEG cap with a smartphone or tablet, and as such represents the first fully mobile system for real-time 3D EEG imaging. We discuss the benefits and challenges of a fully portable system, including technical limitations as well as real-time reconstruction of 3D images of brain activity. We present examples of the brain activity captured in a simple experiment involving imagined finger tapping, showing that the acquired signal in a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained with standard EEG lab equipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using a off-the-shelf consumer neuroheadset is lower compared to that obtained using high density standard EEG equipment, we propose that mobile application development may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new opportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings."
https://openalex.org/W1964778231,"Genotype-phenotype (GP) maps specify how the random mutations that change genotypes generate variation by altering phenotypes, which, in turn, can trigger selection. Many GP maps share the following general properties: 1) The total number of genotypes N(G) is much larger than the number of selectable phenotypes; 2) Neutral exploration changes the variation that is accessible to the population; 3) The distribution of phenotype frequencies F(p)=N(p)/N(G), with N(p) the number of genotypes mapping onto phenotype p, is highly biased: the majority of genotypes map to only a small minority of the phenotypes. Here we explore how these properties affect the evolutionary dynamics of haploid Wright-Fisher models that are coupled to a random GP map or to a more complex RNA sequence to secondary structure map. For both maps the probability of a mutation leading to a phenotype p scales to first order as F(p), although for the RNA map there are further correlations as well. By using mean-field theory, supported by computer simulations, we show that the discovery time T(p) of a phenotype p similarly scales to first order as 1/F(p) for a wide range of population sizes and mutation rates in both the monomorphic and polymorphic regimes. These differences in the rate at which variation arises can vary over many orders of magnitude. Phenotypic variation with a larger F(p) is therefore be much more likely to arise than variation with a small F(p). We show, using the RNA model, that frequent phenotypes (with larger F(p)) can fix in a population even when alternative, but less frequent, phenotypes with much higher fitness are potentially accessible. In other words, if the fittest never 'arrive' on the timescales of evolutionary change, then they can't fix. We call this highly non-ergodic effect the 'arrival of the frequent'."
https://openalex.org/W2011526661,"The delivery of drugs to specific neural targets faces two fundamental problems: (1) most drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier, and (2) those that do, spread to the entire brain. To date, there exists only one non-invasive methodology with the potential to solve these problems: selective blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening using micro-bubble enhanced focused ultrasound. We have recently developed a single-element 500-kHz spherical transducer ultrasound setup for targeted BBB opening in the non-human primate that does not require simultaneous MRI monitoring. So far, however, the targeting accuracy that can be achieved with this system has not been quantified systematically. In this paper, the accuracy of this system was tested by targeting caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal ganglia in two macaque monkeys. The average lateral targeting error of the system was ∼2.5 mm while the axial targeting error, i.e., along the ultrasound path, was ∼1.5 mm. We have also developed a real-time treatment monitoring technique based on cavitation spectral analysis. This technique also allowed for delineation of a safe and reliable acoustic parameter window for BBB opening. In summary, the targeting accuracy of the system was deemed to be suitable to reliably open the BBB in specific sub-structures of the basal ganglia even in the absence of MRI-based verification of opening volume and position. This establishes the method and the system as a potentially highly useful tool for brain drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2040888474,"Schools are known to play a significant role in the spread of influenza. High vaccination coverage can reduce infectious disease spread within schools and the wider community through vaccine-induced immunity in vaccinated individuals and through the indirect effects afforded by herd immunity. In general, herd immunity is greatest when vaccination coverage is highest, but clusters of unvaccinated individuals can reduce herd immunity. Here, we empirically assess the extent of such clustering by measuring whether vaccinated individuals are randomly distributed or demonstrate positive assortativity across a United States high school contact network. Using computational models based on these empirical measurements, we further assess the impact of assortativity on influenza disease dynamics. We found that the contact network was positively assortative with respect to influenza vaccination: unvaccinated individuals tended to be in contact more often with other unvaccinated individuals than with vaccinated individuals, and these effects were most pronounced when we analyzed contact data collected over multiple days. Of note, unvaccinated males contributed substantially more than unvaccinated females towards the measured positive vaccination assortativity. Influenza simulation models using a positively assortative network resulted in larger average outbreak size, and outbreaks were more likely, compared to an otherwise identical network where vaccinated individuals were not clustered. These findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing heterogeneities in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake for prevention of large, protracted school-based outbreaks of influenza, in addition to continued efforts to increase overall vaccine coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2068983765,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise elsewhere in the embryo and migrate into developing gonadal ridges during embryonic development. In several model animals, formation and migration patterns of PGCs have been studied, and it is known that these patterns vary. Sturgeons (genus Acipenser) have great potential for comparative and evolutionary studies of development. Sturgeons belong to the super class Actinoptergii, and their developmental pattern is similar to that of amphibians, although their phylogenetic position is an out-group to teleost fishes. Here, we reveal an injection technique for sturgeon eggs allowing visualization of germplasm and PGCs. Using this technique, we demonstrate that the PGCs are generated at the vegetal pole of the egg and they migrate on the yolky cell mass toward the gonadal ridge. We also provide evidence showing that PGCs are specified by inheritance of maternally supplied germplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the migratory mechanism is well-conserved between sturgeon and other remotely related teleosts, such as goldfish, by a single PGCs transplantation (SPT) assay. The mode of PGCs specification in sturgeon is similar to that of anurans, but the migration pattern resembles that of teleosts."

https://openalex.org/W1970813865,"The use of endoscopic ultrasonography has allowed for improved detection and pathologic analysis of fine needle aspirate material for pancreatic lesion diagnosis. The molecular analysis of KRAS has further improved the clinical sensitivity of preoperative analysis. For this reason, the use of highly analytical sensitive and specific molecular tests in the analysis of material from fine needle aspirate specimens has become of great importance. In the present study, 60 specimens from endoscopic ultrasonography fine needle aspirate were analyzed for KRAS exon 2 and exon 3 mutations, using three different techniques: Sanger sequencing, allele specific locked nucleic acid PCR and Next Generation sequencing (454 GS-Junior, Roche). Moreover, KRAS was also tested in wild-type samples, starting from DNA obtained from cytological smears after pathological evaluation. Sanger sequencing showed a clinical sensitivity for the detection of the KRAS mutation of 42.1%, allele specific locked nucleic acid of 52.8% and Next Generation of 73.7%. In two wild-type cases the re-sequencing starting from selected material allowed to detect a KRAS mutation, increasing the clinical sensitivity of next generation sequencing to 78.95%. The present study demonstrated that the performance of molecular analysis could be improved by using highly analytical sensitive techniques. The Next Generation Sequencing allowed to increase the clinical sensitivity of the test without decreasing the specificity of the analysis. Moreover we observed that it could be useful to repeat the analysis starting from selectable material, such as cytological smears to avoid false negative results."

In the final stage of the complex reaction cascade, the so-called advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed, including proteins with various glycation structures. It has been suggested that some AGEs could have immunostimulatory effects. Here, we aimed to identify specific glycation structure(s) that could influence the T-cell immunogenicity and potential allergenicity of food allergens, using ovalbumin (OVA, an egg white allergen) as a model allergen. OVA was specifically modified with representative glycation structures: Nϵ-carboxymethyl lysine (CM-OVA), Nϵ-carboxyethyl lysine (CE-OVA), pyrraline (Pyr-OVA), or methylglyoxal-derived arginine derivatives (MGO-OVA). As well as AGE-OVA, a crude glycation product in thermal incubation of OVA with glucose, only Pyr-OVA, and not other modified OVAs, was efficiently taken up by bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells (BMDCs). The uptake of Pyr-OVA was reduced in scavenger receptor class A (SR-A)-deficient BMDCs, but not in cells treated with inhibitors of scavenger receptor class B, galectin-3, or blocking antibodies against CD36, suggesting that pyrraline binds to SR-A. Compared with other modified OVAs, Pyr-OVA induced higher activation of OVA-specific CD4+ T-cells in co-culture with BMDCs. Furthermore, compared with native OVA, AGE-OVA and Pyr-OVA induced higher IgE production in mice. Pyrraline could induce better allergen uptake by DCs via association with SR-A and subsequently enhance CD4+ T-cell activation and IgE production. Our findings help us to understand how Maillard reaction enhances the potential allergenicity of food allergens.

https://openalex.org/W2091800832,"The family of resistance gene analogues (RGAs) with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain accounts for the largest number of disease resistance genes and is one of the largest gene families in plants. We have identified 868 RGAs in the genome of the apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) cultivar 'Golden Delicious'. This represents 1.51% of the total number of predicted genes for this cultivar. Several evolutionary features are pronounced in M. domestica, including a high fraction (80%) of RGAs occurring in clusters. This suggests frequent tandem duplication and ectopic translocation events. Of the identified RGAs, 56% are located preferentially on six chromosomes (Chr 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 15), and 25% are located on Chr 2. TIR-NBS and non-TIR-NBS classes of RGAs are primarily exclusive of different chromosomes, and 99% of non-TIR-NBS RGAs are located on Chr 11. A phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted to study the evolution of RGAs in the Rosaceae family. More than 1400 RGAs were identified in six species based on their NBS domain, and a neighbor-joining analysis was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the protein sequences. Specific phylogenetic clades were found for RGAs of Malus, Fragaria, and Rosa, indicating genus-specific evolution of resistance genes. However, strikingly similar RGAs were shared in Malus, Pyrus, and Prunus, indicating high conservation of specific RGAs and suggesting a monophyletic origin of these three genera."
https://openalex.org/W1992891129,"Macrophages occur along a continuum of functional states between M1-type polarized macrophages with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity and M2-type polarized macrophages, which have been implicated to promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. Proangiogenic M2-type macrophages promote various pathologic conditions, including choroidal neovascularization in models of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or certain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Thus, a potential novel therapeutic approach to target pathological angiogenesis in these conditions would be to inhibit the polarization of macrophages toward the proangiogenic M2-type. However, no pharmacological inhibitors of M2-type macrophage polarization have been identified yet. Here we performed an unbiased pharmacological and small chemical screen to identify drugs that inhibit proangiogenic M2-type macrophage polarization and block pathologic macrophage-driven neovascularization. We identified the well tolerated and commonly used antibiotic doxycycline as a potent inhibitor of M2-type polarization of macrophages. Doxycycline inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, M2-type polarization of human and bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages without affecting cell viability. Furthermore, doxycycline inhibited M2-type macrophage polarization and subsequent neovascularization in vivo in a laser injury model of choroidal neovascularization. Thus, doxycycline could be used to enhance current antiangiogenic treatment approaches in various conditions that are promoted by proangiogenic M2-type macrophages, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration and certain cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2080629429,"Oxidative stress induces many serious reproductive diseases in female mammals and thus poses a serious threat to reproductive health. However, the relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS)—induced oxidative stress and follicular development, oocyte and embryo quality is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ovarian oxidative stress on the health of follicle and oocyte development. Female ICR mice were dosed with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) at three different concentrations (6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg) and saline (control) via continuous intraperitoneal injection for 7 days. The treatment with 12.5 mg/kg reduced the weight of mouse ovaries, and significantly increased ROS levels and the activities of antioxidant enzymes—total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) — in granulosa cells and ovarian tissues, but not in other tissues (brain, liver, kidney and spleen). The same treatment significantly increased the percentage of atretic large follicles, and reduced the number of large follicles, the number of ovulated oocytes, and the capacity for early embryonic development compared with controls. It also significantly decreased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax, while causing an increase in the mRNA expression of (SOD2, CAT and GPX) and ROS levels in granulosa cells. Collectively, these data indicate that 3-NPA induces granulosa cell apoptosis, large follicle atresia, and an increase of ROS levels in the ovary. Therefore, we have established an in vivo model of ovarian oxidative stress for studying the mechanism of resulting damage induced by free radicals and for the screening of novel antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1988263640,"The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1α is required for full hypoxic induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in skeletal muscle cells. Under normoxic conditions, PGC-1α also strongly induces mitochondrial biogenesis, but PGC-1α does not activate this program under hypoxic conditions. How this specificity is achieved is not known. We show here that hypoxia specifically induces alternatively spliced species encoding for truncated forms of PGC-1α: NT-PGC-1α and PGC-1α4. NT-PGC-1α strongly induces VEGF expression, whereas having little effect on mitochondrial genes. Conditioned medium from cells expressing NT-PGC-1α robustly induces endothelial migration and tube formation, hallmarks of angiogenesis. Transgenic expression of PGC-1α4 in skeletal muscle in mice induces angiogenesis in vivo. Finally, knockdown of these PGC-1α isoforms and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) abrogates the induction of VEGF in response to hypoxia. NT-PGC-1α and/or PGC-1α4 thus confer angiogenic specificity to the PGC-1α-mediated hypoxic response in skeletal muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042516658,"The reduction of functional β cell mass is a key feature of type 2 diabetes. Here, we studied metabolic functions and islet gene expression profiles of C57BL/6J mice with naturally occurring nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) deletion mutation, a widely used model of diet-induced obesity and diabetes. On high fat diet (HF), the mice developed obesity and hyperinsulinemia, while blood glucose levels were only mildly elevated indicating a substantial capacity to compensate for insulin resistance. The basal serum insulin levels were elevated in HF mice, but insulin secretion in response to glucose load was significantly blunted. Hyperinsulinemia in HF fed mice was associated with an increase in islet mass and size along with higher BrdU incorporation to β cells. The temporal profiles of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of isolated islets were comparable in HF and normal chow fed mice. Islets isolated from HF fed mice had elevated basal oxygen consumption per islet but failed to increase oxygen consumption further in response to glucose or carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). To obtain an unbiased assessment of metabolic pathways in islets, we performed microarray analysis comparing gene expression in islets from HF to normal chow-fed mice. A few genes, for example, those genes involved in the protection against oxidative stress (hypoxia upregulated protein 1) and Pgc1α were up-regulated in HF islets. In contrast, several genes in extracellular matrix and other pathways were suppressed in HF islets. These results indicate that islets from C57BL/6J mice with NNT deletion mutation develop structural, metabolic and gene expression features consistent with compensation and decompensation in response to HF diet."
https://openalex.org/W2017835473,"Menstrual blood has been introduced as an easily accessible and refreshing stem cell source with no ethical consideration. Although recent works have shown that menstrual blood stem cells (MenSCs) possess multi lineage differentiation capacity, their efficiency of hepatic differentiation in comparison to other stem cell resources has not been addressed so far. The aim of this study was to investigate hepatic differentiation capacity of MenSCs compared to bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) under protocols developed by different concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and oncostatin M (OSM) in combination with other components in serum supplemented or serum-free culture media. Such comparison was made after assessment of immunophenotye, trans-differentiation potential, immunogenicity and tumorigeicity of these cell types. The differential expression of mature hepatocyte markers such as albumin (ALB), cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), tyrosine aminotransferase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities (CYP7A1) at both mRNA and protein levels in differentiating MenSCs was significantly higher in upper concentration of HGF and OSM (P1) compared to lower concentration of these factors (P2). Moreover, omission of serum during differentiation process (P3) caused typical improvement in functions assigned to hepatocytes in differentiated MenSCs. While up-regulation level of ALB and CYP7A1 was higher in differentiated MenSCs compared to driven BMSCs, expression level of CK-18, detected level of produced ALB and glycogen accumulation were lower or not significantly different. Therefore, based on the overall comparable hepatic differentiation ability of MenSCs with BMSCs, and also accessibility, refreshing nature and lack of ethical issues of MenSCs, these cells could be suggested as an apt and safe alternative to BMSCs for future stem cell therapy of chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2120844362,"The mammalian spinal cord and medulla oblongata harbor unique neurons that remain in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-cNs). These neurons were shown recently to express a polycystin member of the TRP channels family (PKD2L1) that potentially acts as a chemo- or mechanoreceptor. Recent studies carried out in young rodents indicate that spinal CSF-cNs express immature neuronal markers that appear to persist even in adult cells. Nevertheless, little is known about the phenotype and morphological properties of medullar CSF-cNs. Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy techniques on tissues obtained from three-month old PKD2L1:EGFP transgenic mice, we analyzed the morphology, distribution, localization and phenotype of PKD2L1+ CSF-cNs around the brainstem and cervical spinal cord central canal. We show that PKD2L1+ CSF-cNs are GABAergic neurons with a subependymal localization, projecting a dendrite towards the central canal and an axon-like process running through the parenchyma. These neurons display a primary cilium on the soma and the dendritic process appears to bear ciliary-like structures in contact with the CSF. PKD2L1+ CSF-cNs present a conserved morphology along the length of the medullospinal central canal with a change in their density, localization and dendritic length according to the rostro-caudal axis. At adult stages, PKD2L1+ medullar CSF-cNs appear to remain in an intermediate state of maturation since they still exhibit characteristics of neuronal immaturity (DCX positive, neurofilament 160 kDa negative) along with the expression of a marker representative of neuronal maturation (NeuN). In addition, PKD2L1+ CSF-cNs express Nkx6.1, a homeodomain protein that enables the differentiation of ventral progenitors into somatic motoneurons and interneurons. The present study provides valuable information on the cellular properties of this peculiar neuronal population that will be crucial for understanding the physiological role of CSF-cNs in mammals and their link with the stem cells contained in the region surrounding the medullospinal central canal."

Spatial genetic diversity in wild barley was revealed by both nuclear- (2,505 SNP, 24 nSSR) and chloroplast-derived (5 cpSSR) markers in 256 widely-sampled geo-referenced accessions. Results were compared with MaxEnt-modelled geographic distributions under current, past (Last Glacial Maximum, LGM) and mid-term future (anthropogenic scenario A2, the 2080s) climates. Comparisons suggest large-scale post-LGM range expansion in Central Asia and relatively small, but statistically significant, reductions in range-wide genetic diversity under future climate. Our analyses support the utility of ecological niche modelling for locating genetic diversity hotspots and determine priority geographic areas for wild barley conservation under anthropogenic climate change. Similar research on other cereal crop progenitors could play an important role in tailoring conservation and crop improvement strategies to support future human food security."

The success or failure of controlling virus levels in untreated patients or those taking ART may be associated with treatment adherence, habits, correlated infections unrelated to HIV, cancer, immunosuppressive drugs; as well as socio-economic and psychosocial aspects and access to healthcare. The aim of the present study was to identify, using a multilevel model, the factors related to the variations of CD4 counts over time, in patients living with HIV.A cohort study was conducted with patients living with HIV, selected from July 2007 to December 2010. Patients were monitored from records of their first CD4 count after being diagnosed with HIV. A multilevel model with 3 levels of aggregation was applied to analyze the associations of predictor variables and the behavior of CD4 over time.A total of 1870 patients were enrolled. The mean number of CD4 at the beginning of the cohort was 393.1 cells/mm³, and there was a mean increase of 1.529 cells/mm³ per month. Patient's age, smoking, use of illicit drugs, hospital treatment, changing doctors and the use of ART, were factors that affected the kinetics of the CD4 count during the follow-up period.The results of this study indicated increased levels of CD4 over time in a cohort of patients living with HIV/AIDS and identified factors that may influence this increase and are liable to intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1986032999,"This study investigates the aerodynamics of the falcon Falco peregrinus while diving. During a dive peregrines can reach velocities of more than 320 km h−1. Unfortunately, in freely roaming falcons, these high velocities prohibit a precise determination of flight parameters such as velocity and acceleration as well as body shape and wing contour. Therefore, individual F. peregrinus were trained to dive in front of a vertical dam with a height of 60 m. The presence of a well-defined background allowed us to reconstruct the flight path and the body shape of the falcon during certain flight phases. Flight trajectories were obtained with a stereo high-speed camera system. In addition, body images of the falcon were taken from two perspectives with a high-resolution digital camera. The dam allowed us to match the high-resolution images obtained from the digital camera with the corresponding images taken with the high-speed cameras. Using these data we built a life-size model of F. peregrinus and used it to measure the drag and lift forces in a wind-tunnel. We compared these forces acting on the model with the data obtained from the 3-D flight path trajectory of the diving F. peregrinus. Visualizations of the flow in the wind-tunnel uncovered details of the flow structure around the falcon’s body, which suggests local regions with separation of flow. High-resolution pictures of the diving peregrine indicate that feathers pop-up in the equivalent regions, where flow separation in the model falcon occurred."

Regulatory aspects for the use of the vitamin in these roles are not known. Here we show that certain plants carry a pseudoenzyme (PDX1.2), which is involved in regulating vitamin B6 biosynthesis de novo under stress conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis PDX1.2 enhances the activity of its catalytic paralogs by forming a heterododecameric complex. PDX1.2 is strongly induced by heat as well as singlet oxygen stress, concomitant with an enhancement of vitamin B6 production. Analysis of pdx1.2 knockdown lines demonstrates that boosting vitamin B6 content is dependent on PDX1.2, revealing that this pseudoenzyme acts as a positive regulator of vitamin B6 biosynthesis during such stress conditions in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1968783529,"Clinical guidelines (CGs) are popular for healthcare decision making but their acceptability and use by healthcare providers is influenced by numerous factors. Some of these factors are professional-related, such as knowledge and perceptions of and attitudes toward CGs in general. The aim of our study was to evaluate attitudes and perceptions of Spanish physicians towards CGs.We coordinated six discussion groups with a total of 46 physicians. The participants were drawn from 12 medical specialties from both specialized and primary care. We recorded the sessions and transcribed the content verbatim. We analyzed the data using an approach based on the grounded theory.We identified two main constructs that defined the physicians' perceptions towards guidelines: knowledge and usefulness. ""Knowledge"" defined the theoretical meanings of guidelines, while ""Usefulness"" referred to the pragmatic approach to guidelines. These constructs were interrelated through a series of categories such as confidence, usability, accessibility, dissemination and formats.In our study, the constructs that impacted most on physician's attitudes to clinical guidelines were knowledge and usefulness. The tension between the theoretical and the pragmatic constructs determined the attitudes and how physicians use guidelines. Groups developing guidelines should ask relevant clinical questions and develop implementable and context specific recommendations. Developers should be explicit and consistent in the development and presentation of recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2047233567,"Background Management of influenza, a major contributor to the worldwide disease burden, is complicated by lack of reliable methods for early identification of susceptible individuals. Identification of molecular markers that can augment existing diagnostic tools for prediction of severity can be expected to greatly improve disease management capabilities. Methodology/Principal Findings We have analyzed cytokines, proteome flux and protein adducts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sera from mice infected with influenza A virus (PR8 strain) using a previously established non-lethal model of influenza infection. Through detailed cytokine and protein adduct measurements of murine BAL, we first established the temporal profile of innate and adaptive responses as well as macrophage and neutrophil activities in response to influenza infection. A similar analysis was also performed with sera from a longitudinal cohort of influenza patients. We then used an iTRAQ-based, comparative serum proteome analysis to catalog the proteome flux in the murine BAL during the stages correlating with “peak viremia,” “inflammatory damage,” as well as the “recovery phase.” In addition to activation of acute phase responses, a distinct class of lung proteins including surfactant proteins was found to be depleted from the BAL coincident with their “appearance” in the serum, presumably due to leakage of the protein following loss of the integrity of the lung/epithelial barrier. Serum levels of at least two of these proteins were elevated in influenza patients during the febrile phase of infection compared to healthy controls or to the same patients at convalescence. Conclusions/Significance The findings from this study provide a molecular description of disease progression in a mouse model of influenza and demonstrate its potential for translation into a novel class of markers for measurement of acute lung injury and improved case management."
https://openalex.org/W2086116538,"The mammalian Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP) proteins are Golgi-localized homotypic membrane tethers that organize Golgi stacks into a long, contiguous ribbon-like structure. It is unknown how GRASPs undergo trans pairing given that cis interactions between the proteins in the plane of the membrane are intrinsically favored. To test the hypothesis that myristoylation of the self-interacting GRASP domain restricts its orientation on the membrane to favor trans pairing, we established an in vitro assay that recapitulates GRASP-dependent membrane tethering and used neutron reflection under similar conditions to determine the orientation of the GRASP domain. In vivo, the membrane association of GRASP proteins is conferred by the simultaneous insertion of an N-terminal myristic acid and binding to a Golgi-associated binding partner. In our assay, the latter contact was replaced using a C-terminal hexa-His moiety, which bound to Ni2+-conjugated lipids incorporated into a substrate-supported bilayer lipid membrane. Nonmyristoylated protein lacked a fixed orientation on the membrane and inefficiently tethered liposomes. In contrast, myristoylated GRASP promoted tethering and exhibited a unique membrane complex.

Such cross-bridging may be either homotypic or heterotypic depending on whether the process involves the pairing of self-interacting molecules or the pairing of distinct components on each of the apposed membranes. Uniquely, in these types of molecular interactions, the effectiveness of pairing is governed by the relative propensity of the proteins to form interactions in a trans configuration across the membranes, versus binding in cis in the same membrane. Particularly in the case of homotypic cross-bridging where cis interactions may predominate, a mechanism is needed to suppress such cis pairing. An important example of homotypic tethering is the interaction of the GRASP 4The abbreviations used are: GRASPGolgi reassembly stacking proteinG55GRASP55(1–208)-His6myrG55myristoylated G55DOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineLR-PE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) ammonium saltNi2+-NTA-DGS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic-acid)succinyl] nickel saltHC18Z 20-(Z-octadec-9-enyloxy)-3,6,9,12,15,18,22-heptaoxatetracont-31-ene-1-thiolstBLMsparsely tethered bilayer lipid membraneNRneutron reflectionCVOcomponent volume occupancyDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-cholineMDmolecular dynamics. proteins that underlies stacking Golgi cisternae and/or linking the stacks into the elongated, ribbon-like membrane network evident in mammalian cells (5.Puthenveedu M.A. Bachert C.

GRASP55 and GRASP65 play complementary and essential roles in Golgi cisternal stacking.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GRASP65 is localized to cis Golgi cisternae, and GRASP55 is localized to medial and trans cisternae. The immediate effect of inhibiting GRASP65 is a loss of lateral continuity of cis cisternae, whereas inhibiting GRASP55 first disrupts trans cisternal continuity (10.Jarvela T. Linstedt A.D. Isoform-specific tethering links the Golgi ribbon to maintain compartmentalization.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 133-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The GRASP proteins are anchored to their respective cisternal membranes by insertion of an N-terminal myristic acid and interaction of the second PDZ domain, which is positioned near the C terminus of the GRASP domain, with a membrane-bound partner protein (13.Barr F.A.

Such dual anchoring of GRASP is required not only for its stable membrane association but also for its membrane-tethering activity. Stable, singly anchored versions of GRASP proteins have been created using transmembrane domains but, when expressed in cells, they fail to tether, whereas similar dually anchored constructs retain full activity (12.Sengupta D.

However, for such a mechanism to work, the orientation of the protein with respect to the membrane needs to be tightly controlled, raising the possibility that N-myristoylation, as a second anchor point for the protein on the membrane, could set this orientation. Fig. 1 shows possible GRASP orientations on the membrane and their implications for forming trans or cis interactions. Many orientations will not prevent cis interactions from occurring, whereas some that do are fundamentally different but cannot be discriminated in functional assays. Because orientation is difficult to determine in vivo, we developed an in vitro assay of GRASP-mediated tethering on sparsely tethered bilayer lipid membranes (stBLMs) where protein orientation can be determined with neutron scattering. The results show that the GRASP domain is sufficient for membrane tethering and that myristoylation is required for full activity. Neutron reflection revealed decisive differences in GRASP membrane orientation conferred by myristoylation, yielding a model of how orientation promotes trans-membrane tethering. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DOPC),1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-phoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) ammonium salt (LR-PE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl)iminodi-acetic-acid)succinyl] nickel salt (Ni2+-NTA-DGS), and a liposome extruder were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used as prescribed.

No. 1.5 glass coverslips were from Electron Microscopy Science (Hatfield, PA), and microscopy glass slides were from Fisher Scientific. All other chemicals were of HPLC grade. Ultrapure water was prepared in a Millipore (Billerica, MA) Milli-Q water purification device. GRASP55 was cloned into the pRSET-B vector by PCR amplification into the EcoRI site. Subsequently, the N-terminal His tag was deleted by a PCR loop-out procedure and a 10-amino acid linker, ASSRSGGSGA, after which a hexahistidine sequence was inserted after residue 208 followed by a stop codon to create G55, i.e. GRASP55(1–208)-His6. The His6-GRASP55(1–208) construct was made by PCR deletion of the His tag from GRASP55(1–208)-His6 and reintroduction immediately before the starting methionine. Mutations of the pocket and ligand (L59A/I100S+Δ196–199) and of the phosphorylation site (S189D) were generated exactly as described previously (12.Sengupta D. Truschel S. Bachert C. Linstedt A.D.

For fluorescence microscopy, ∼6 nm of gold was sputtered on top of an ∼2-nm thick chromium bonding layer, which leaves the coverslips optically transparent. For SPR, ∼45 nm of gold was sputtered on the chromium bonding layer. Gold layers on chromium for NR were 10–15 nm thick. Freshly gold-coated substrates were immersed in an ethanolic solution of 30% HC18 and 70% β-mercaptoethanol, at a total concentration of 0.2 mmol/liter, to form a mixed self-assembly monolayer.

The dry lipid films were redissolved in pentane and dried under vacuum again and then rehydrated in 50 mmol/liter potassium phosphate buffer at pH ∼7.45 and sonicated. The resulting liposome suspensions were extruded through polycarbonate membranes with a pore size of 100 nm, and liposome sizes were checked by dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetananosizer, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). Alternate liposome sizes were also investigated (extrusion through 30- and 200-nm pore sizes; data not shown). 100 nm-extruded liposomes were used throughout the experiments shown in the study. stBLMs formed on gold-coated microscope glass slides were mounted on a custom-made SPR instrument (SPR Biosystems, Germantown, MD) (21.Shenoy S.

A convergent fan of light (λ = 763.8 nm) was reflected from the backside of the sample-covered interface and recorded by a CCD chip, and the position of the intensity minimum was determined as a function of the reflection angle.

Resonance shifts as a function of protein concentration were fitted to a Langmuir isotherm to determine the dissociation constants, Kd. stBLMs formed on gold-coated glass coverslip were assembled in a Sykes-Moore chamber. Subsequently, 1.2 μmol/liter protein and 0.01 mg/ml liposomes were injected into the chamber. The solution was occasionally mixed and left to incubate the stBLMs for 3 h before excess protein and liposomes were rinsed away. The chamber was then transferred to a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a Zeiss 63× Plan-Apochromat (NA = 1.4) objective lens, a 100-watt HBO 103 W/2 mercury lamp, a Zeiss filter set at BP546/12:FT560: BP665/20, and a Hamamatsu C9100-12 EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) and controlled with IPLab (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA). Images of LR-PE labeled liposomes adhering to the stBLMs were taken with ∼300-ms exposure time at low excitation light intensity with the aperture stop closed to its minimum size. These image acquisition parameters were chosen to minimize the number of saturated pixels in the images. For each sample, at least 12 images (size of field, 100 × 100 μm2) were taken at random positions in the sample. The fluorescence intensity of these images after background subtraction was used as a measure to quantify the tethering activity of the protein constructs. NR measurements were performed on the NG7 and MAGIK reflectometers at the NIST Center for Neutron Research and evaluated with garefl (23.Kirby B.J. Kienzle P.A. Maranville B.B. Berk N.F. Krycka J.

To determine the protein orientation on the membrane, the origins of the two relevant Euler angles (see Fig. 4C, inset) were chosen to coincide with the longest (ϑ0) and second longest (ϕ0) principal axes of the mass distribution in the crystal structure. Parameter space was efficiently searched with a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain algorithm, and provided quantitative measures of parameter and neutron scattering length density confidence limits, as well as parameter cross-correlations (25.Heinrich F. Ng T. Vanderah D.J. Shekhar P. Mihailescu M. Nanda H. Lösche M. A new lipid anchor for sparsely tethered bilayer lipid membranes.Langmuir. 2009; 25: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The crystal structure used in the refinement was reported for a truncated protein, GRASP55(7–208), and also lacks the N-myristoylation and the C-terminal decapeptide and His tag. Therefore, this structure needed to be supplemented to represent the protein used in the experiments. Peptide conformations were obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Because the protein orientation on the membrane was initially unknown, a first, free MD simulation of the full-length proteins in buffer sampled mostly unrealistic peptide conformations. However, this procedure produced an approximate full-length protein model that could be used to gain a first estimate of the protein orientation on the membrane through refinement to the NR data. Based on this orientation, we subsequently modified the model using a steered MD simulation to implement constraints of the His tag and the N-myristoylation reaching to the membrane surface. This refined model was then used to fit the NR data in a second round of modeling. In practical terms, both models yielded the same protein orientation and distance to the bilayer within confidence limits, and this structural protein model was used to determine a unique component volume occupancy profile as a parent of the neutron scattering length density profiles for different isotopic samples. Missing amino acids on the N and C termini of GRASP were added to the crystal structure in an initial fully extended configuration. The patched protein structure was modeled using the Generalized Born Implicit Solvent model implemented in NAMD 2.8 (26.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C.

A solvent dielectric of 78.5 and an ionic concentration of 0.1 mol/liter salt were used in the Generalized Born Implicit Solvent model. The resulting GRASP structure was minimized, first with the core protein held fixed and only the newly constructed termini allowed to vary. Then, in a second step of minimization, the full structure was allowed to vary. Further equilibration was performed with 10 ns of MD simulations followed by a 10-ns production run at 300 K. During both equilibration and production simulations, the backbone of the core protein was held fixed while the side chains were unrestrained. Both the backbone and the side chains of the added terminal residues were unrestrained. CHARMM22 with CMAP dihedral correction (27.MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D.

Frames were collected every 100 ps from the production run and averaged to generate the volume and scattering length profile of the GRASP protein that was then used for reflectivity fitting. Steered MD was performed on the N and C termini using the SMD module in NAMD. An external force was applied to the N-terminal Gly residue and the center of mass of the C-terminal His6 tag. The force was directed downward along the z axis toward the putative membrane interface, resulting in a constant migration velocity of 0.0025 Å/fs. To quantify the tethering activity of the GRASP domain in vitro, we developed a fluorescence-based assay that reports the tethering of liposomes to a supported planar bilayer. The aforementioned stBLMs feature a nanometer-thick hydrated layer between the solid surface and the lipid bilayer (19.McGillivray D.J. Valincius G. Vanderah D.J. Febo-Ayala W. Woodward J.T.

We used purified preparations of the N-myristoylated and unmyristoylated GRASP domain of GRASP55 (residues 1–208). The resulting proteins, myrG55 and G55, included a 10-residue linker and C-terminal hexahistidine tag so that each protein bound to nickel (Ni2+) associated with N-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-functionalized lipids present in both the stBLMs and the liposomes in the assay. The C-terminal position of the His tag was meant to roughly approximate the position of the PDZ2 binding groove, which is near the C terminus of the GRASP domain and is normally responsible for the secondary site of membrane contact. First, we determined the affinity of myrG55 to DOPC stBLMs containing 1 mol % Ni2+-NTA-DGS using SPR. The reaction yielded a dissociation constant, Kd, of 0.32 ± 0.09 μmol/liter (data not shown) comparable with binding constants measured for other His-tagged proteins to Ni2+-NTA-DGS (30.Gizeli E.

The extrapolated (cprotein → ∞) equilibrium SPR signal corresponded to a protein mass density of ∼68 ng/cm2, as calibrated with neutron reflection. 5F. Heinrich and H. Z. Goh, unpublished data. The background of nonspecific protein binding, quantified with myrG55 on DOPC stBLMs devoid of Ni2+-NTA-DGS, was <10% of the signal with Ni2+-NTA-DGS. This is consistent with the relatively weak affinity of myristate for the membrane, Kd ∼100 μmol/liter (32.Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S.

Loss of function of Smpd3 in mice results in an increase in mature hypertrophic chondrocytes. Here, we report that in chondrocytes the Runx2-dependent expression of Smpd3 was increased by BMP-2 stimulation. Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), encoded by the Smpd3 gene, was detected both in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes of mouse embryo bone cartilage. An siRNA for Smpd3, as well as the nSMase inhibitor GW4869, significantly enhanced BMP-2-induced differentiation and maturation of chondrocytes. Conversely, overexpression of Smpd3 or C2-ceramide, which mimics the function of nSMase2, inhibited chondrogenesis. Upon induction of Smpd3 siRNA or GW4869, phosphorylation of both Akt and S6 proteins was increased. The accelerated chondrogenesis induced by Smpd3 silencing was negated by application of the Akt inhibitor MK2206 or the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin. Importantly, in mouse bone culture, GW4869 treatment significantly promoted BMP-2-induced hypertrophic maturation and calcification of chondrocytes, which subsequently was eliminated by C2-ceramide. Smpd3 knockdown decreased the apoptosis of terminally matured ATDC5 chondrocytes, probably as a result of decreased ceramide production. In addition, we found that expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) was elevated by a loss of Smpd3, which was restored by MK2206. Indeed, expression of Has2 protein decreased in nSMase2-positive hypertrophic chondrocytes in the bones of mouse embryos. Our data suggest that the Smpd3/nSMase2-ceramide-Akt signaling axis negatively regulates BMP-induced chondrocyte maturation and Has2 expression to control the rate of endochondral ossification as a negative feedback mechanism.

Over 95% of bone formation during the embryonic and developmental stages is achieved through endochondral ossification. This process is primed by the condensation of mesenchymal progenitor cells expressing the chondrogenic master regulator Sox9 (1.Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Sox9 is required for cartilage formation.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar), after which cells further differentiate into proliferating chondrocytes that are able to express a specific marker, Col2a1, encoding type II collagen (2.Akiyama H. Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B.

These chondrocytes then mature to hypertrophic chondrocytes, which eventually mineralize the surrounding cartilage matrix to be replaced by bone-forming osteoblasts (3.Provot S. Schipani E. Molecular mechanisms of endochondral bone development.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are able to express the type X collagen-encoding gene Col10a1, is mainly governed by the Runx2 transcription factor (4.Enomoto H.

BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, which transduces signals through type II and type I receptors to activate receptor-regulated Smads. Upon ligand binding, BMP type I receptors phosphorylate Smad1/5/8 in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylated Smads form a trimeric complex with Smad4 (co-Smad) to translocate into the nucleus to directly or indirectly regulate the transcription of target genes (7.Miyazono K. Maeda S.

BMPs are also required in vitro for the induction of Col2a1 and Col10a1 to promote chondrocyte maturation at later stages (12.Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M.

Similarly, mice with cartilage-specific combined deletions of two BMP type I receptor genes (Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b), or with a double knock-out of Smad1 and Smad5, showed severely impaired chondrogenesis (16.Yoon B.S.

At a later maturation stage, BMP signaling directly accelerates the expression of Col10a1 in concert with Runx2 (13.Leboy P. Grasso-Knight G. D'Angelo M. Volk S.W. Lian J.V. Drissi H. Stein G.S.

Forced expression of constitutively active Bmpr1a in cartilage promoted the maturation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes in mice (20.Kobayashi T. Lyons K.M. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. BMP signaling stimulates cellular differentiation at multiple steps during cartilage development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18023-18027Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The evidence clearly demonstrates the accelerating roles of BMP signaling in chondrocyte commitment, proliferation, and hypertrophic maturation both in vivo and in vitro. Chondrogenesis in the endochondral ossification process is a promising cellular event for application in cartilage and bone regeneration, and it is a process that can be artificially engineered from human mesenchymal stem/stroma cells (MSCs) (21.Scotti C. Tonnarelli B. Papadimitropoulos A. Scherberich A. Schaeren S. Schauerte A. Lopez-Rios J. Zeller R. Barbero A. Martin I.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7251-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Regarding the treatment of articular cartilage defects, the engineered chondrocytes must arrest maturation processes, because abnormally matured hypertrophic chondrocytes, expressing COL10A1, mineralize cartilage matrix to cause pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA) (22.Pullig O. Weseloh G. Ronneberger D. Käkönen S. Swoboda B. Chondrocyte differentiation in human osteoarthritis: expression of osteocalcin in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage and bone.Calcif.

Ther. 2010; 12: 216Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This is a major problem of cartilage tissue engineering in an in vitro culture system, where MSCs rapidly express COL10A1 in a monolayer or pellet culture before the cells express hypertrophic phenotypes, suggesting that the mechanism by which MSCs induce type X collagen expression in vitro is different from that in chondrogenesis in vivo (25.Nelea V.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4397-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In bone engineering events, MSCs have formed bone trabeculae in vivo only when they had developed hypertrophic chondrocyte structure in vitro prior to implantation (21.Scotti C. Tonnarelli B. Papadimitropoulos A. Scherberich A. Schaeren S. Schauerte A. Lopez-Rios J. Zeller R. Barbero A. Martin I.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7251-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Therefore, controlling the maturation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes is crucial for regenerative medicine of both cartilage and bone. Although the effects of BMP signaling in promoting chondrocyte maturation should be eliminated for cartilage regeneration, they may be artificially enhanced to promote the efficiency of bone engineering. Although the BMP-Smad pathway directly induces the inhibitory Smad, Smad6, to inhibit the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 as a negative feedback mechanism (27.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Smad6 inhibits signalling by the TGF-β superfamily.Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and Smurf1 targets Smad6 and the BMP type I receptors to block BMP signaling (28.Zhu H.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), these inhibitory molecules are not specifically expressed in maturing chondrocytes. Recently, we reported that expression of the transcriptional repressor SnoN gradually increases in BMP-induced differentiating chondrocytes to suppress BMP signaling and the subsequent chondrocyte hypertrophic maturation (30.Kawamura I. Maeda S. Imamura K. Setoguchi T. Yokouchi M. Ishidou Y. Komiya S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 29101-29113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, because SnoN partially blocked chondrocyte maturation, the mechanism regulating the rate of BMP signaling-driven chondrocyte differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner remains unclear. The membrane-bound enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), encoded by the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (Smpd3) gene, cleaves sphingomyelin to generate the lipid second messenger ceramide, which affects a variety of cellular process, including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (31.Obeid L.M.

A deletion mutation in the Smpd3 gene was identified in fragilitas ossium (fro), a mouse model of osteogenesis imperfecta (35.Aubin I. Adams C.P. Opsahl S. Septier D. Bishop C.E. Auge N. Salvayre R.

Interestingly, the number and area of hypertrophic chondrocytes were significantly increased, and conversion of cartilage into bone was retarded in fro/fro bone. Smpd3 knock-out mice also showed fragile bones and dwarfism, with retarded transition of proliferative chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes (37.Stoffel W. Jenke B. Blöck B. Zumbansen M.

Importantly, the knee joint cartilage of adult Smpd3-null mice showed severe deformity with exostosis, the phenotype of OA (38.Stoffel W. Jenke B. Holz B. Binczek E. Günter R.H. Knifka J. Koebke J.

These findings, from two lines of nSMase2 loss-of-function mice, suggest that Smpd3/nSMase2 plays an important role in suppressing hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes and OA initiation. However, there is currently no information regarding the molecular mechanism for the function of nSMase2 in chondrocyte differentiation. In C2C12 myoblasts, BMP-2-induced Runx2 directly binds to the Smpd3 promoter to up-regulate expression, suggesting that BMP signaling could elevate Smpd3 level in a certain context (39.Chae Y.M. Heo S.H. Kim J.Y. Lee J.M. Ryoo H.M. Cho J.Y. Upregulation of smpd3 via BMP2 stimulation and Runx2.BMB Rep. 2009; 42: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that Smpd3 is continuously up-regulated by BMP-2 stimulation of chondrocytes during the maturation stage to suppress the late differentiation step via the Akt pathway. We found that this induction of Smpd3 by BMP-2 was Runx2-dependent and that the transcription factor is crucial for the hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that Smpd3/nSMase2 or ceramide signaling cell-autonomously suppressed expression of Col2a1, Col10a1, and hyaluronate synthase 2 (Has2), as well as accumulation of glycosaminoglycan. The Akt-S6 pathway was found to be responsible for the action of Smpd3/nSMase2. Importantly, application of an inhibitor compound for nSMase into the mouse bone organ culture system significantly increased the hypertrophic conversion and extracellular matrix calcification of cartilage. The mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, established from a differentiated culture of the teratocarcinoma stem cell line AT805 on the basis of chondrogenic potential (40.Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K.

Differentiation of the cells, cultured in monolayer, was induced by the addition of recombinant human BMP-2 (PeproTech) at a concentration of 300 ng/ml, with or without insulin/transferrin/selenium (ITS) supplement (Sigma) on collagen type I-coated culture plates (Iwaki). Metatarsal bone rudiments were harvested from C57BL/6J mouse embryos at 16.5 days post-coitum (E16.5) and cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FBS, and 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as described (42.Alvarez J. Sohn P. Zeng X. Doetschman T. Robbins D.J. Serra R. TGFβ2 mediates the effects of hedgehog on hypertrophic differentiation and PTHrP expression.Development. 2002; 129: 1913-1924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured bones were stained with Alcian blue and alizarin red dyes according to a standard protocol for skeletal preparation. Briefly, bones fixed in 96% ethanol were stained with 0.015% Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma) in a mixture solution of 96% ethanol/acetic acid (4:1) for 1 day, followed by a dehydration step in 100% ethanol. Dehydrated bones were immersed briefly in 1% potassium hydroxide (KOH), followed by staining in 0.001% alizarin red S (Sigma) in 1% KOH for 1 day. Images were captured with stereomicroscope M165FC (Leica). Four bones per group were analyzed. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kagoshima University (number MD12043). Dharmacon siRNA ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, a mixture of four independent siRNAs against mouse Runx1, Runx2, Runx3, Smpd3, or Has2, and the control reagent were purchased from Thermo Scientific. siRNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen). BMP-2 and compounds were added to the culture simultaneously after an overnight transfection of siRNA. Mouse Smpd3 cDNA was cloned from ATDC5 by employing an RT-PCR-based technique, subcloned into the entry vector, pENTR, and further transferred into the C-terminally V5-tagged expression vector, pEF-DEST51, by attL-attR recombination (Invitrogen). To generate adenovirus-carrying Smpd3 cDNA, the Smpd3 gene in the pENTR-Smpd3 vector was transferred into the C-terminally V5-tagged adenovirus expression vector pAd/CMV/V5-DEST by attL-attR recombination (Invitrogen) and further transfected into the adenovirus-producing cell line 293A according to the manufacturer's protocol. pAd/CMV/V5-GW/lacZ adenovirus expression vector was used as a control to express β-galactosidase. Adenovirus infection into ATDC5 cells was performed at a multiplicity of infection of 10. These experiments were approved by the Kagoshima University safety control committee for gene recombination techniques (number 22053). All of the following agents were resolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and DMSO was used as the mock control. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma and applied at a concentration of 10 mm for 2 h, prior to BMP-2 stimulation. The nSMase inhibitor, GW4869 (Sigma), or C2-ceramide (Enzo Life Sciences) was applied at the same time of BMP-2 induction, at 1 or 10 μm, respectively. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (Sigma), Akt inhibitor, MK2206 (Chemie Tek), and the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (Sigma) were applied at the same time of BMP-2 induction, at the indicated concentrations. Cells were lysed in M-PER lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with aprotinin, sodium orthovanadate, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, membrane transfer, and chemiluminescence, using standard protocol. Blots were incubated with the following: anti-Runx2 (1:1,000, 8G5, MBL); anti-nSMase2 (1:500, H-195, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-aggrecan (1:500, H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-collagen type II α1 (1:1,000, LSBio); anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (1:1,000, 587F11, Cell Signaling); anti-Akt (1:1,000, 5G3, Cell Signaling); anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235/236) (1:1,000, D57.2.2E, Cell Signaling); anti-S6 ribosomal protein (1:1,000, 54D2, Cell Signaling); anti-phospho-PI3K (1:1,000, number 4228, Cell Signaling); anti-PI3K (p85) (1:1,000, number 610045, BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (1:1,000, number 9511, Cell Signaling); anti-Smad1 (1:1,000, number 9743, Cell Signaling); and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000) (Cell Signaling), or anti-tubulin antibody (1:1,000, DM1A, T9026, Sigma). Signals were detected using the LAS 4000 Mini Image Analyzer (Fujifilm). We employed PathScan® RTK signaling antibody array kit (Cell Signaling) to analyze the signaling pathway influenced by loss of Smpd3/nSMase2 function. This system is a slide-based antibody array, founded upon the sandwich immunoassay principle and allowing for the simultaneous detection of 28 receptor tyrosine kinases and 11 important signaling nodes when phosphorylated at tyrosine or other residues, was employed to analyze the signaling pathway influenced by loss of Smpd3/nSMase2 function. The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer's manual, and the chemiluminescent readout was performed with LAS 4000 Mini Image Analyzer. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100. CAS block (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used for blocking. For immunohistochemistry, formalin-fixed mouse E17.5 embryo humeri were embedded in paraffin blocks, which were sliced at a 4-μm thickness. The antigen was retrieved by the Liberate Antibody Binding solution (Polysciences). A CAS block was used for blocking. Cells or bone sections were incubated with anti-aggrecan (1:100, H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-collagen type II α1 (1:100, LSBio), anti-nSMase2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100, H-195, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Has2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100, D-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, A11001) or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200, A11011) (Invitrogen) was used to detect signals. Normal rabbit or mouse IgG was used as negative control. Hyaluronan (HA) detection involved the following protocol. Samples were blocked with a streptavidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and digested sequentially with 0.05% of trypsin and 1 unit/ml of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma). Samples were further blocked with CAS block and sequentially incubated with biotin-conjugated HA-binding protein (1:1,000, Hokudo) and 1 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen).

Chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs is currently triggered by micromass culture in the presence of a member of the TGF-β superfamily. However, the main constituents of the cartilaginous matrix, aggrecan and type II collagen, are degraded at the end of the differentiation process through induction of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)13. We hypothesized that MSCs undergoing chondrogenic differentiation produce an intermediate cytokine that triggers this matrix remodeling. Analysis of transcriptomic data identified angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as one of the most strongly up-regulated gene encoding a secreted factor during TGF-β-induced chondrogenesis. To gain insight into the role of ANGPTL4 during chondrogenesis, we used recombinant ANGPTL4 as well as a RNA interference approach. Addition of exogenous ANGPTL4 during the course of TGF-β-induced differentiation reduced the mRNA levels of aggrecan and type II collagen, although it increased those of MMP1 and MMP13. Accordingly, deposition of aggrecan and total collagens was diminished, whereas release of MMP1 and MMP13 was increased. Conversely, transfection of MSCs with an siRNA targeting ANGPTL4 prior to induction of chondrogenesis increased expression of type II collagen and aggrecan, whereas it repressed that of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13. A neutralizing antibody against integrin αVβ5, a known receptor for ANGPTL4, mimicked some of the effects observed after siRNA-mediated ANGPTL4 silencing. Our data provide evidence that ANGPTL4 promotes cartilage matrix remodeling by inhibiting expression of its two key components and by up-regulating the level of certain MMPs.

https://openalex.org/W2071896464,"In this study, we demonstrate closed-loop motion control of self-propelled microjets under the influence of external magnetic fields. We control the orientation of the microjets using external magnetic torque, whereas the linear motion towards a reference position is accomplished by the thrust and pulling magnetic forces generated by the ejecting oxygen bubbles and field gradients, respectively. The magnetic dipole moment of the microjets is characterized using the U-turn technique, and its average is calculated to be 1.310−10 A.m2 at magnetic field and linear velocity of 2 mT and 100 µm/s, respectively. The characterized magnetic dipole moment is used in the realization of the magnetic force-current map of the microjets. This map in turn is used for the design of a closed-loop control system that does not depend on the exact dynamical model of the microjets and the accurate knowledge of the parameters of the magnetic system. The motion control characteristics in the transient- and steady-states depend on the concentration of the surrounding fluid (hydrogen peroxide solution) and the strength of the applied magnetic field. Our control system allows us to position microjets at an average velocity of 115 m/s, and within an average region-of-convergence of 365 m."

The physiological role of granzyme (Gzm) A is controversial, with significant debate over its ability to induce death in target cells. Here, we investigate the natural inhibitors of GzmA.

Of the five human granzymes, the cytotoxin GzmB is best characterized. Its Aspase activity leads primarily to cleavage of Bid and activation of the mitochondrial death pathway, although caspases and other death substrates are also directly activated. GzmB is regulated by the intracellular inhibitor SERPINB9, which serves to protect cytotoxic lymphocytes from GzmB-induced suicide (2.Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Kumar S.

Granzyme A initiates an alternative pathway for granule-mediated apoptosis.Immunity. 1999; 10: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, many reports have shown that cytotoxic cells purified from GzmA null mice are less effective killers than wild-type cells (10.Shresta S. Graubert T.A. Thomas D.A. Raptis S.Z. Ley T.J.

Two cytotoxic pathways have been mapped for GzmA. The first is centered on the cleavage of SET complex proteins and characterized by production of reactive oxygen species and single-stranded DNA damage (11.Lieberman J. Granzyme A activates another way to die.Immunol. Rev. 2010; 235: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas the second affects the actin cytoskeleton, without generation of reactive oxygen species or caspase activation (12.Susanto O.

Mouse granzyme A induces a novel death with writhing morphology that is mechanistically distinct from granzyme B-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Others report that GzmA is not cytotoxic and instead is involved in the processing of cytokines, with the experimentally observed cytotoxicity suggested to arise from bombarding cells with nonphysiological levels of protease (13.Metkar S.S.

Some of these findings can be reconciled by observations suggesting a difference in cytotoxic potential between hGzmA and mGzmA (5.Kaiserman D. Bird C.H. Sun J. Matthews A. Ung K. Whisstock J.C.

We hypothesize that cytotoxicity of GzmA, if physiologically important, would drive the co-evolution of a specific intracellular inhibitor, as it has for GzmB. The GzmB-specific inhibitor SERPINB9 belongs to the intracellular clade B of the serpin superfamily, and limited in vitro evidence suggests that GzmH and -M may also have cognate inhibitors from the same clade (15.de Koning P.J. Kummer J.A. de Poot S.A. Quadir R. Broekhuizen R. McGettrick A.F. Higgins W.J. Devreese B. Worrall D.M. Bovenschen N.

Immunol. 2013; 190: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The serpin inhibitory mechanism uses an exposed region termed the reactive center loop (RCL) that mimics the substrate specificity of the target protease. Cleavage of the RCL initiates a conformational change in the serpin fold that traps the protease in a 1:1 covalent complex (17.Gettins P.G. Serpin structure, mechanism, and function.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Serpin RCL sequences are thus critical determinants of protease inhibition and closely resemble the substrate cleavage site of the protease. This is best illustrated by alterations in the RCL sequence of orthologous human (SERPINB9) (2.Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Kumar S. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Selective regulation of apoptosis: the cytotoxic lymphocyte serpin proteinase inhibitor 9 protects against granzyme B-mediated apoptosis without perturbing the Fas cell death pathway.Mol. Cell.

Proteomics. 2009; 8: 258-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, RCLs often include suboptimal residues that would lead to inefficient cleavage by the target protease. This can be overcome by the presence of exosites and cofactors that increase association rates by several orders of magnitude (19.Gettins P.G. Olson S.T. Exosite determinants of serpin specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The combination of the RCL sequence and exosites or cofactors thus imparts specificity to the serpin-protease interaction. Two extracellular human GzmA inhibitors have previously been reported, the Kazal-type pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (20.Tsuzuki S. Kokado Y. Satomi S. Yamasaki Y. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Purification and identification of a binding protein for pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor: a novel role of the inhibitor as an anti-granzyme A.Biochem.

Inhibition of lymphocyte protease granzyme A by antithrombin III.Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The identification of a specific and efficient intracellular inhibitor would provide strong evidence for cytotoxicity of GzmA in vivo. Here, we probe the substrate specificity of mouse and human GzmA using phage display and positional proteomics. The deduced specificity profiles are then used to identify the intracellular serpin Serpinb6b as a candidate species-specific inhibitor of mGzmA but not hGzmA. We confirm a strong inhibitory interaction and show that Serpinb6b utilizes both the substrate specificity and an exosite on the mGzmA dimer to efficiently inhibit mGzmA. Our findings suggest evolutionary divergence in which mGzmA has increased cytotoxic potential. Phage display using a random 9-mer library was performed as described (5.Kaiserman D. Bird C.H. Sun J.

Where indicated, GzmA was reduced to a monomer by the addition of 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol to all buffers. COS-1 cells were maintained as subconfluent monolayers in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human serpin cDNAs cloned into the NheI site of pEGFP-c2 in-frame with GFP were purchased from Genscript. 4–5 μg of each plasmid was added to 5 × 105 COS-1 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 400 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, and 25 μm chloroquine for 3 h at 37 °C.

A model of the mGzmA-Serpinb6b Michaelis complex was constructed by overlaying the crystal structure of dimeric hGzmA (PDB accession 1ORF) with the Michaelis complex between S195A trypsin and M358R antitrypsin (PDB accession 1OPH). Potential exosites were defined as regions in which the serpin was in close proximity to the noninhibited GzmA monomer. Our aim was to search for intracellular serpins targeting either hGzmA or mGzmA, because their existence would provide evidence of GzmA cytotoxicity in vivo. The serpin inhibitory mechanism requires the RCL to match the substrate specificity of the target protease, and therefore our first step was to define the substrate specificity of both hGzmA and mGzmA using substrate phage display (5.Kaiserman D. Bird C.H. Sun J. Matthews A. Ung K. Whisstock J.C. Thompson P.E. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. The major human and mouse granzymes are structurally and functionally divergent.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sequencing of 62 phage after four rounds of selection with mGzmA revealed strong selectivity at the P4 and P2′ positions around a P1 Arg, with further selection at P3, P2, P1′, and P4′. The data gave a mGzmA substrate specificity sequence of Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-↓-Met-Leu/Phe-Xaa-Val (Fig. 1A). By contrast, analysis of 79 phage following four rounds of selection with hGzmA showed strongest selection at P3, within the pattern Ile-Gly-Xaa-Arg-↓-Xaa-Gly. By including weakly selected residues, some overlap between species could be observed, with Ile and Gly weakly selected by mGzmA at P4 and P3, and hGzmA weakly selected bulky residues Phe, Trp, and Tyr at P2 (Fig. 1A). These findings agree with the P4 to P1 positional scanning substrate combinatorial library analysis (PS-SCL) performed by Bell et al. (27.Bell J.K. Goetz D.H. Mahrus S. Harris J.L. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. The oligomeric structure of human granzyme A is a determinant of its extended substrate specificity.Nat. Struct.

No selection for Lys at the P1 position was observed; however, this is likely due to the very strong preference of both human and mouse GzmA for Arg (see below), rather than an inability to accommodate Lys at P1 or under-representation of P1 Lys in the library. To confirm these differences in specificity, we produced an internally quenched fluorescence peptide substrate for mGzmA based on a phage sequence that most closely matched the overall pattern (GLFR↓SLSS), as well as a hGzmA substrate based on a combination of the phage display pattern and the PS-SCL pattern derived by Bell et al. (27.Bell J.K. Goetz D.H. Mahrus S. Harris J.L. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. The oligomeric structure of human granzyme A is a determinant of its extended substrate specificity.Nat. Struct.

We then determined the activity of human and mouse GzmA against each peptide to determine whether the predicted substrate specificity could be recapitulated. The reaction rate for mGzmA cleaving VANRSAS was 3.70 ± 0.85 × 105 m−1 s−1 compared with a rate of 2.95 ± 0.48 × 105 m−1 s−1 when cleaving GLFRSLSS, and hGzmA rates were 1.27 ± 0.23 × 105 m−1 s−1 for VANRSAS and 4.69 ± 0.12 × 102 m−1 s−1 for the GLFRSLSS substrate (Fig. 1B and Table 1). This shows that mGzmA selects Phe residues strongly at P2, but this is not an absolute requirement as the difference in rate constants between peptides is not significant. Conversely, hGzmA shows a strong 280-fold preference for the VANR substrate, due to a dramatic decrease in turnover efficiency (Fig. 1B and Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for granzyme A cleavage of peptide substratesMouse Granzyme AHuman Granzyme AGLFRSLSSVANRSASGLFRSLSSVANRSASkcat (s−1)33.5 ± 2.9414.2 ± 2.132.51 ± 0.0642 × 10−24.88 ± 0.233Km (μm)114 ± 15.438.3 ± 6.6253.5 ± 0.38235.2 ± 3.46kcat/Km (m−1 s−1)2.95 ± 0.476 × 1053.70 ± 0.848 × 1054.69 ± 0.124 × 1021.39 ± 0.152 × 105 Open table in a new tab We further addressed macromolecular differences between human and mouse GzmA substrate specificities by performing a differential N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC) analysis. As such, the proteomes of Jurkat cells were SILAC-labeled with [13C6]Arg or [13C6,15N4]Arg or left unlabeled. Freeze-thaw lysates were then treated with 200 nm hGzmA (unlabeled), mGzmA ([13C6]Arg-labeled), or no protease ([13C6,15N4]Arg-labeled), and equal proteome quantities were mixed and processed accordingly, allowing for the isolation and quantification of neo-N-terminal peptides. In total, 755 tryptic neo-N termini were identified from 570 unique substrates. Of these, 355 cleavage sites were specific to mGzmA, and six were uniquely cleaved by hGzmA, and 394 were cleaved by both proteases. IceLogos (29.Colaert N. Helsens K. Martens L. Vandekerckhove J.

Weighting all cleavage events equally produces almost identical profiles. The tryptase activity of both is easily apparent, with only Arg or Lys occupying P1, although ∼72.5% of all human and mouse GzmA cleavage sites carry Arg at this position. As with many other proteases, the most common residues at P1′ (covering ∼30% of cleavage sites) are the small amino acids Ser and Ala; however, a significant proportion (16–18%) of GzmA substrates had a Lys at this position. Equal preferences for either small amino acids (Gly, Ala, or Ser) or Leu were found at P2′, each accounting for ∼30% occurrence in cleavage sites of both granzymes. Of note, proline is strongly under-represented at P2′ in GzmA cleavage sites. Although proline occurrence in the human subsection of the Swiss-Prot database is 6.3%, it is only present in 0.25% (1 cleavage site) and 0.40% (3 cleavage sites) of all human and mouse GzmA cleavage sites, respectively. No clear preferences could be identified beyond P3′ or on the nonprime side except for a general preference for charged residues. The similar specificity profiles between mouse and human GzmA obtained using this approach, in contrast to phage display, can be explained by exosite in"

The aims of the present study are 1) to determine whether LVM is associated with mortality and various cardiovascular events and 2) to identify determinants of LVM including biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis.Analysis was performed with data of 327 ESKD patients, a subset from the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST). Echocardiography was performed at baseline. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the relation of LVM tertiles with clinical events. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify factors associated with LVM.Median age was 65 (IQR: 54-73) years, 203 (61%) were male and median LVM was 227 (IQR: 183-279) grams. The risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.11-2.99), cardiovascular death (HR = 3.66, 95% CI: 1.35-10.05) and sudden death (HR = 13.06; 95% CI: 6.60-107) was increased in the highest tertile (>260 grams) of LVM. In the multivariable analysis positive relations with LVM were found for male gender (B = 38.8±10.3), residual renal function (B = 17.9±8.0), phosphate binder therapy (B = 16.9±8.5), and an inverse relation for a previous kidney transplantation (B = -41.1±7.6) and albumin (B = -2.9±1.1). Interleukin-6 (Il-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hepcidin-25 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were not related to LVM.We confirm the relation between a high LVM and outcome and expand the evidence for increased risk of sudden death.

To gain a better insight into the pathology of metastasis, we investigated genomic aberrations in a large cohort of matched colorectal cancer primaries and distant metastases from various sites by high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. In total, 62 primary colorectal cancers, and 68 matched metastases (22 liver, 11 lung, 12 ovary, 12 omentum, and 11 distant lymph nodes) were analyzed. Public datasets were used for validation purposes. Metastases resemble their matched primary tumors in the majority of the patients. This validates the significant overlap in chromosomal aberrations between primary tumors and corresponding metastases observed previously. We observed 15 statistically significant different regions between the primary tumors and their matched metastases, of which only one recurrent event in metastases was observed. We conclude, based on detailed analysis and large independent datasets, that chromosomal copy number aberrations in colorectal metastases resemble their primary counterparts, and differences are typically non-recurrent."
https://openalex.org/W2033000537,"Purpose To present unique cystoid changes occurring in patients with ocular toxoplasmosis observed in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods Forty-six patients (80 eyes) with a diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis, who underwent volume OCT examination between January 2005 and October 2012, were retrospectively collected. Review of clinical examination findings, fundus photographs, fluorescein angiograms (FA) and OCT image sets obtained at initial visits and follow-up. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of cystoid space phenotypes visualized using OCT. Results Of the 80 eyes included, 17 eyes (15 patients) demonstrated cystoid changes in the macula on OCT. Six eyes (7.5%) had cystoid macular edema (CME), 2 eyes (2.5%) had huge outer retinal cystoid space (HORC), 12 eyes (15%) had cystoid degeneration and additional 3 eyes (3.75%) had outer retinal tubulation due to age related macular degeneration. In one eye with HORC, the lesion was seen in the photoreceptor outer segment, accompanied by photoreceptor elongation and splitting. Three eyes presented with paravascular cystoid degeneration in the inner retina without other macular OCT abnormality. Conclusions In this study, different phenotypes of cystoid spaces seen in eyes with ocular toxoplasmosis using spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) were demonstrated. CME presented as an uncommon feature, consistently with previous findings. Identification of rare morphological cystoid features (HORC with/without photoreceptor enlongation or splitting) on clinical examination had provided evidence to previous experimental models, which may also expand the clinical spectrum of the disease. Cystoid degeneration in the inner retina next to the retinal vessels in otherwise “normal” looking macula was observed, which may suggest more often clinical evaluation for those patients. Further studies are needed to verify the relevance of cystoid features seen on SD-OCT in assisting with the diagnosis and management of ocular toxoplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W2015930244,"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a promising technology for both neurology and psychiatry. Positive treatment outcome has been reported, for instance in double blind, multi-center studies on depression. Nonetheless, the application of TMS towards studying and treating brain disorders is still limited by inter-subject variability and lack of model systems accessible to TMS. The latter are required to obtain a deeper understanding of the biophysical foundations of TMS so that the stimulus protocol can be optimized for maximal brain response, while inter-subject variability hinders precise and reliable delivery of stimuli across subjects. Recent studies showed that both of these limitations are in part due to the angular sensitivity of TMS. Thus, a technique that would eradicate the need for precise angular orientation of the coil would improve both the inter-subject reliability of TMS and its effectiveness in model systems. We show here how rotation of the stimulating field relieves the angular sensitivity of TMS and provides improvements in both issues. Field rotation is attained by superposing the fields of two coils positioned orthogonal to each other and operated with a relative phase shift in time. Rotating field TMS (rfTMS) efficiently stimulates both cultured hippocampal networks and rat motor cortex, two neuronal systems that are notoriously difficult to excite magnetically. This opens the possibility of pharmacological and invasive TMS experiments in these model systems. Application of rfTMS to human subjects overcomes the orientation dependence of standard TMS. Thus, rfTMS yields optimal targeting of brain regions where correct orientation cannot be determined (e.g., via motor feedback) and will enable stimulation in brain regions where a preferred axonal orientation does not exist."

Clinicopathologic features and overall survival (OS) of KRAS mutant and wild-type mCRC patients who had used oxaliplatin-based, irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based, as well as cetuximab-based regimens were compared to those who had never-used oxaliplatin-based, irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based, as well as cetuximab-based regimens respectively. Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 394 mCRC patients, in whom 169 KRAS mutant and 225 KRAS wild-type, were enrolled. In KRAS mutant patients who had used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 131), the OS was significantly longer than that in KRAS mutant patients who had never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 38). The OS was 28.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 23.2-34.4] in KRAS mutant patients who had used oxaliplatin-based regimens versus 17.8 months [95% CI: 6.5-29.1] in KRAS mutant patients who had never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (P = 0.026). Notably, OS in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients who had used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 185) was not significantly longer than that in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients who had never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 40) (P = 0.25). Furthermore, the OS in KRAS mutant patients who had used either irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based or cetuximab-based regimens was not significantly different than that in KRAS mutant patients who had never-used either irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based or cetuximab-based regimens respectively. In multivariate analyses, patients who had used oxaliplatin-based regimens remains an independent prognostic factor for longer OS in KRAS mutant mCRC patients. In conclusion, oxaliplatin-based regimens are more beneficial in KRAS mutant than in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2044392646,"We previously reported that multiply-primed rolling circle amplification (MRPCA) using modified random RNA primers can amplify tiny amounts of circular DNA without producing any byproducts. However, contaminating DNA in recombinant Phi29 DNA polymerase adversely affects the outcome of MPRCA, especially for negative controls such as non-template controls. The amplified DNA in negative control casts doubt on the result of DNA amplification. Since Phi29 DNA polymerase has high affinity for both single-strand and double-stranded DNA, some amount of host DNA will always remain in the recombinant polymerase. Here we describe a procedure for preparing Phi29 DNA polymerase which is essentially free of amplifiable DNA. This procedure is realized by a combination of host DNA removal using appropriate salt concentrations, inactivation of amplifiable DNA using ethidium monoazide, and irradiation with visible light from a light-emitting diode lamp. Any remaining DNA, which likely exists as oligonucleotides captured by the Phi29 DNA polymerase, is degraded by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the polymerase itself in the presence of trehalose, used as an anti-aggregation reagent. Phi29 DNA polymerase purified by this procedure has little amplifiable DNA, resulting in reproducible amplification of at least ten copies of plasmid DNA without any byproducts and reducing reaction volume. This procedure could aid the amplification of tiny amounts DNA, thereby providing clear evidence of contamination from laboratory environments, tools and reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2074050256,"Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether more sickness absence is reported in countries with higher income inequality than elsewhere, and whether the level of income inequality moderates the association between psycho-social job demands and sickness absence. Methods Our analysis is based on the Fifth European Working Conditions Survey that compared 23 European countries. We performed multi-level regression analysis. On the macro-level of analysis we included the Gini-Index as measure of inequality. On the micro-level of analysis we followed the Karasek-Theorell model and included three scales for psychological job demands, physical job demands, and decision latitude in the model. The model was stratified by sex. Results We found that, in countries with high income inequality, workers report significantly more sickness absence than workers in countries with low income inequality. In addition we found that the level of income inequality moderates the relationship between psychological job demands and sickness absence. High psychological job demands are significantly more strongly related to more days of sickness absence in countries with low income inequality than in countries with high income inequality. Conclusions As the nature and causal pathways of cross-level interaction effects still cannot be fully explained, we argue that future research should aim to explore such causal pathways. In accordance with WHO recommendations we argue that inequalities should be reduced. In addition we state that, particularly in countries with low levels of income inequality, policies should aim to reduce psychological job demands."
https://openalex.org/W2008095940,"Aggressive tumors such as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are highly heterogeneous in their therapeutic response, making it difficult to improve overall response by using drugs in unselected patients. The goal of this study was to retrospectively, but independently, examine whether biomarker-based personalized chemotherapy selection could improve survival of EOC patients. Using in vitro drug sensitivity and patient clinical outcome data, we have developed co-expression extrapolation (COXEN) biomarker models for predicting patient response to three standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat advanced EOC: paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and topotecan, for which sufficient patient data were available for our modeling and independent validation. Four different cohorts of 783 EOC patients were used in our study, including two cohorts of 499 patients for independent validation. The COXEN predictors for the three drugs independently showed high prediction both for patient short-term therapeutic response and long-term survival for recurrent EOC. We then examined the potential clinical benefit of the simultaneous use of the three drug predictors for a large diverse EOC cohort in a prospective manner, finding that the median overall survival was 21 months longer for recurrent EOC patients who were treated with the predicted most effective chemotherapies. Survival improvement was greater for platinum-sensitive patients if they were treated with the predicted most beneficial drugs. Following the FDA guidelines for diagnostic prediction analysis, our study has retrospectively, yet independently, showed a potential for biomarker-based personalized chemotherapy selection to significantly improve survival of patients in the heterogeneous EOC population when using standard chemotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2119266315,"Background For settings with limited laboratory capacity, 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend targeted HIV-1 viral load (VL) testing to identify virological failure. We previously developed and validated a clinical prediction score (CPS) for targeted VL testing, relying on clinical, adherence and laboratory data. While outperforming the WHO failure criteria, it required substantial calculation and review of all previous laboratory tests. In response, we developed four simplified, less error-prone and broadly applicable CPS versions that can be done ‘on the spot’. Methodology/Principal Findings From May 2010 to June 2011, we validated the original CPS in a non-governmental hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia applying the CPS to adults on first-line treatment >1 year. Virological failure was defined as a single VL >1000 copies/ml. The four CPSs included CPS1 with ‘current CD4 count’ instead of %-decline-from-peak CD4; CPS2 with hemoglobin measurements removed; CPS3 having ‘decrease in CD4 count below baseline value’ removed; CPS4 was purely clinical. Score development relied on the Spiegelhalter/Knill-Jones method. Variables independently associated with virological failure with a likelihood ratio ≥1.5 or ≤0.67 were retained. CPS performance was evaluated based on the area-under-the-ROC-curve (AUROC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The CPSs were validated in an independent dataset. A total of 1490 individuals (56.6% female, median age: 38 years (interquartile range (IQR 33–44)); median baseline CD4 count: 94 cells/µL (IQR 28–205), median time on antiretroviral therapy 3.6 years (IQR 2.1–5.1)), were included. Forty-five 45 (3.0%) individuals had virological failure. CPS1 yielded an AUROC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.62–0.75) in validation, CPS2 an AUROC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.62–0.74), and CPS3, an AUROC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.61–0.73). The purely clinical CPS4 performed poorly (AUROC-0.59; 95% CI: 0.53–0.65). Conclusions Simplified CPSs retained acceptable accuracy as long as current CD4 count testing was included. Ease of field application and field accuracy remains to be defined."

Following localized low-LET irradiation (225 kVp X-rays), low levels of 53BP1 foci were observed in the 3D model (3.8±0.28 foci/Gy/cell) with foci persisting and increasing in size up to 48 h post irradiation. In contrast, in cell monolayers 14.2±0.6 foci/Gy/cell and biphasic repair kinetics with repair completed before 24 h was observed. These differences are linked to differences in cellular status with variable level of p21 driving apoptotic signalling in 2D and accelerated differentiation in both the directly irradiated and bystander areas of the 3D model. The signalling pathways utilized by irradiated keratinocytes to induce DNA damage in non-exposed areas of the skin involved the NF-κB transcription factor and its downstream target COX-2."
https://openalex.org/W2014783870,"Background Zimbabwe underwent a socioeconomic crisis and resultant increase in food insecurity in 2008–9. The impact of the crisis on Tuberculosis (TB) incidence is unknown. Methods Prospective databases from two mission hospitals, which were geographically widely separated, and remained open during the crisis, were reviewed. Results At the Howard Hospital (HH) in northern Zimbabwe, TB incidence increased 35% in 2008 from baseline rates in 2003–2007 (p<0.01) and remained at that level in 2009. Murambinda Hospital (MH) in Eastern Zimbabwe also demonstrated a 29% rise in TB incidence from 2007 to 2008 (p<0.01) and remained at that level in 2009. Data collected post-crisis at HH showed a decrease of 33% in TB incidence between 2009 to 2010 (p<0.001) and 2010/2011 TB incidence remained below that of the crisis years of 2008/2009 (p<0.01). Antenatal clinic HIV seroprevalence at HH decreased between 2001(23%) to 2011(11%) (p<0.001). Seasonality of TB incidence was analyzed at both MH and HH. There was a higher TB incidence in the dry season when food is least available (September-November) compared to post harvest (April-June) (p<0.001). Conclusion This study suggests that an epidemic of TB mirrored socioeconomic collapse and recovery in Zimbabwe. The seasonal data suggests that food security may have been associated with TB incidence both annually and during the crisis in this high HIV prevalence country."
https://openalex.org/W2084577109,"Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) is a synchrotron radiation X-ray phase-contrast imaging technique that can better reveal the microstructure of biological soft tissues than conventional X-rays. The aim of this study is to investigate the angio-architectural changes of the liver during fibrosis, cirrhosis and its subsequent regression by applying synchrotron radiation based DEI.DEI experiments were performed at the 4W1A station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with liver fibrosis by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for up to 10 weeks, after which spontaneous regression started and continued until week 30. Quantitative analysis of the DEI images yielded the mean vascular density and intercapillary distance, which was then re-confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of CD34.Based on the DEI results, the mean vascular density was 1.4-fold higher in fibrotic rats (at week 6) and 2-fold higher in cirrhotic rats (at week 10) compared with the control (p<0.05). Accordingly, the intercapillary distance decreased to 563.89 ± 243.35 µm in fibrotic rats and 392.90 ± 92.68 µm in cirrhotic rats compared with 673.85 ± 214.16 µm in the control (p<0.05). During fibrosis regression at week 30, vascular density was 0.7-fold lower and intercapillary distance increased to 548.60 ± 210.94 µm as compared with cirrhotic rats (p<0.05).In parallel to the DEI results, immunohistochemical analysis of CD34 showed similar changes.Synchrotron-based DEI can conduct radiological as well as pathological analysis. Our results are consistent with previous reports indicating that angiogenesis is directly proportional to fibrosis progression. Furthermore, by clarifying the vascular characteristics of liver diseases, DEI reveals that cirrhosis cannot fully reverse during fibrosis regression."
https://openalex.org/W2041126059,"HIV-1 associated dementia remains a significant public health burden. Clinical and experimental research has shown that reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be a risk factor for neurological complications associated with HIV-1 infection. We are actively testing genetically modified macrophages for their possible use as the cell-based gene delivery vehicle for the central nervous system (CNS). It can be an advantage to use the natural homing/migratory properties of monocyte-derived macrophages to deliver potentially neuroprotective BDNF into the CNS, as a non-invasive manner. Lentiviral-mediated gene transfer of human (h)BDNF plasmid was constructed and characterized. Defective lentiviral stocks were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with lentiviral transfer plasmid together with packaging and envelope plasmids. High titer lentiviral vector stocks were harvested and used to transduce human neuronal cell lines, primary cultures of human peripheral mononocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) and murine myeloid monocyte-derived macrophages (mMDM). These transduced cells were tested for hBDNF expression, stability, and neuroprotective activity. The GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System was used to evaluate transduced cells for any adverse effects by assessing gene profiles of 24 reference genes. High titer vectors were prepared for efficient transduction of neuronal cell lines, hMDM, and mMDM. Stable secretion of high levels of hBDNF was detected in supernatants of transduced cells using western blot and ELISA. The conditioned media containing hBDNF were shown to be protective to neuronal and monocytic cell lines from TNF-α and HIV-1 Tat mediated cytotoxicity. Lentiviral vector-mediated gene transduction of hMDM and mMDM resulted in high-level, stable expression of the neuroprotective factorBDNF in vitro. These findings form the basis for future research on the potential use of BDNF as a novel therapy for neuroAIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2003568686,"Industrial agglomerations have long been thought to offer economic and social benefits to firms and people that are only captured by location within their specified geographies. Using the case study of New York City’s garment industry along with data acquired from cell phones and social media, this study set out to understand the discrete activities underpinning the economic dynamics of an industrial agglomeration. Over a two week period, data was collected by employing the geo-locative capabilities of Foursquare, a social media application, to record every movement of fashion workers employed at fashion design firms located both inside and outside the geographical boundaries of New York City’s Garment District. This unique method of studying worker activity exposed the day-to-day dynamics of an industrial district with a precision thus far undocumented in literature. Our work suggests that having access to the cluster provides almost the same agglomeration economies as residing within its borders."
https://openalex.org/W2069774888,"It is increasingly realised that the molecular clock does not tick at a constant rate. Rather, mitochondrial mutation rates are influenced by factors such as generation length and body mass. This has implications for the use of genetic data in species delimitation. It could be that speciation, as recognised by avian taxonomists, is associated with a certain minimum genetic distance between sister taxa, in which case we would predict no difference in the cytochrome b divergence of sister taxa according to the species' body size or generation time. Alternatively, if what taxonomists recognise as speciation has tended to be associated with the passage of a minimum amount of time since divergence, then there might be less genetic divergence between sister taxa with slower mutation rates, namely those that are heavier and/or with longer generation times. After excluding non-flying species, we analysed a database of over 600 avian sister species pairs, and found that species pairs with longer generation lengths (which tend to be the larger species) showed less cytochrome b divergence. This finding cautions against using any simple unitary criterion of genetic divergence to delimit species."
https://openalex.org/W2037894650,"Cholera is a major infectious disease, affecting millions of lives annually. In endemic areas, implementation of vaccination strategy against cholera is vital. As the use of safer live vaccine that can induce protective immunity against Vibrio cholerae O139 infection is a promising approach for immunization, we have designed VCUSM21P, an oral cholera vaccine candidate, which has ctxA that encodes A subunit of ctx and mutated rtxA/C, ace and zot mutations. VCUSM21P was found not to disassemble the actin of HEp2 cells. It colonized the mice intestine approximately 1 log lower than that of the Wild Type (WT) strain obtained from Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. In the ileal loop assay, unlike WT challenge, 1×106 and 1×108 colony forming unit (CFU) of VCUSM21P was not reactogenic in non-immunized rabbits. Whereas, the reactogenicity caused by the WT in rabbits immunized with 1×1010 CFU of VCUSM21P was found to be reduced as evidenced by absence of fluid in loops administered with 1×102–1×107 CFU of WT. Oral immunization using 1×1010 CFU of VCUSM21P induced both IgA and IgG against Cholera Toxin (CT) and O139 lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The serum vibriocidal antibody titer had a peak rise of 2560 fold on week 4. Following Removable Intestinal Tie Adult Rabbit Diarrhoea (RITARD) experiment, the non-immunized rabbits were found not to be protected against lethal challenge with 1×109 CFU WT, but 100% of immunized rabbits survived the challenge. In the past eleven years, V. cholerae O139 induced cholera has not been observed. However, attenuated VCUSM21P vaccine could be used for vaccination program against potentially fatal endemic or emerging cholera caused by V. cholerae O139."
https://openalex.org/W2048228398,"Stoats (Mustela erminea) and ship rats (Rattus rattus) in New Zealand are targeted by trapping to mitigate their predation on native wildlife. Internationally recognized guidelines for assessing the effectiveness and welfare performance of kill traps are supported by New Zealand legislation under the Animal Welfare Act 1999. The Victor® Easy Set® rat trap was tested and passed a similar standard for killing short-tailed weasels in Canada but failed for stoats when tested in New Zealand in 2002 (short-tailed weasels and stoats are the same species). We tested a modified version of the trap in 2011-12, modified by changing the treadle trigger to a pull trigger and adding a plastic shroud to direct and align approach by animals to the front of the trap. These traps, in vertical and horizontal sets, were tested with both stoats and ship rats. During each test the trap had to render 10 of 10 animals irreversibly unconscious within 3 minutes to meet approval requirements. The modified trap passed with both species in both trap sets. All stoats were struck across the cranium whereas rats were struck either on the cranium or neck. We recommend this trap design for use by community conservation groups for targeting stoats and ship rats in New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W1979812340,"As the cost of whole genome sequencing (WGS) decreases, clinical laboratories will be looking at broadly adopting this technology to screen for variants of clinical significance. To fully leverage this technology in a clinical setting, results need to be reported quickly, as the turnaround rate could potentially impact patient care. The latest sequencers can sequence a whole human genome in about 24 hours. However, depending on the computing infrastructure available, the processing of data can take several days, with the majority of computing time devoted to aligning reads to genomics regions that are to date not clinically interpretable. In an attempt to accelerate the reporting of clinically actionable variants, we have investigated the utility of a multi-step alignment algorithm focused on aligning reads and calling variants in genomic regions of clinical relevance prior to processing the remaining reads on the whole genome. This iterative workflow significantly accelerates the reporting of clinically actionable variants with no loss of accuracy when compared to genotypes obtained with the OMNI SNP platform or to variants detected with a standard workflow that combines Novoalign and GATK."
