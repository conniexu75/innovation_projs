https://openalex.org/W2006423078,"Neurogenesis continues throughout the lifetime in the hippocampus, while the rate declines with brain aging. It has been hypothesized that reduced neurogenesis may contribute to age-related cognitive impairment. Ginsenoside Rg1 is an active ingredient of Panax ginseng in traditional Chinese medicine, which exerts anti-oxidative and anti-aging effects. This study explores the neuroprotective effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on the hippocampus of the D-gal (D-galactose) induced aging rat model. Sub-acute aging was induced in male SD rats by subcutaneous injection of D-gal (120 mg/kg·d) for 42 days, and the rats were treated with ginsenoside Rg1 (20 mg/kg·d, intraperitoneally) or normal saline for 28 days after 14 days of D-gal injection. In another group, normal male SD rats were treated with ginsenoside Rg1 alone (20 mg/kg·d, intraperitoneally) for 28 days. It showed that administration of ginsenoside Rg1 significantly attenuated all the D-gal-induced changes in the hippocampus, including cognitive capacity, senescence-related markers and hippocampal neurogenesis, compared with the D-gal-treated rats. Further investigation showed that ginsenoside Rg1 protected NSCs/NPCs (neural stem cells/progenitor cells) shown by increased level of SOX-2 expression; reduced astrocytes activation shown by decrease level of Aeg-1 expression; increased the hippocampal cell proliferation; enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase) and SOD (Superoxide Dismutase); decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, which are the proinflammatory cytokines; increased the telomere lengths and telomerase activity; and down-regulated the mRNA expression of cellular senescence associated genes p53, p21Cip1/Waf1 and p19Arf in the hippocampus of aged rats. Our data provides evidence that ginsenoside Rg1 can improve cognitive ability, protect NSCs/NPCs and promote neurogenesis by enhancing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2148228108,"Recent studies have been shown that functional connectivity of cerebral areas is not a static phenomenon, but exhibits spontaneous fluctuations over time. There is evidence that fluctuating connectivity is an intrinsic phenomenon of brain dynamics that persists during anesthesia. Lately, point process analysis applied on functional data has revealed that much of the information regarding brain connectivity is contained in a fraction of critical time points of a resting state dataset. In the present study we want to extend this methodology for the investigation of resting state fMRI spatial pattern changes during propofol-induced modulation of consciousness, with the aim of extracting new insights on brain networks consciousness-dependent fluctuations.Resting-state fMRI volumes on 18 healthy subjects were acquired in four clinical states during propofol injection: wakefulness, sedation, unconsciousness, and recovery. The dataset was reduced to a spatio-temporal point process by selecting time points in the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) at which the signal is higher than a given threshold (i.e., BOLD intensity above 1 standard deviation). Spatial clustering on the PCC time frames extracted was then performed (number of clusters = 8), to obtain 8 different PCC co-activation patterns (CAPs) for each level of consciousness.The current analysis shows that the core of the PCC-CAPs throughout consciousness modulation seems to be preserved. Nonetheless, this methodology enables to differentiate region-specific propofol-induced reductions in PCC-CAPs, some of them already present in the functional connectivity literature (e.g., disconnections of the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, auditory cortex), some others new (e.g., reduced co-activation in motor cortex and visual area).In conclusion, our results indicate that the employed methodology can help in improving and refining the characterization of local functional changes in the brain associated to propofol-induced modulation of consciousness."
https://openalex.org/W1970069693,"Sleep related disordered breathing (SDB) in pediatric Prader-Willi Syndrome is gaining increased attention due to the possible association of growth hormone therapy, SDB and sudden death. However data on the patterns of SDB and their management, particularly in infants in this population, is lacking.The aim of this study was to 1) describe patterns of SDB in growth hormone naive infants with PWS and the management of these disorders in our institution 2) Compare the patterns of sleep disorders between infants and children with PWS.Polysomnograms of infants and children (0-18 years of age) with Prader-Willi Syndrome were reviewed. Age, sex, anthropometrics, sleep architecture, obstructive and central apnea indices and oxygen saturations were recorded. Data of infants with central sleep apnea treated with oxygen were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment. The main outcome measures were obstructive and central apnea indices on a polysomnogram.Data of 44 patients, 23 under 2 years of age and 21 older children were included. Infants when compared with older children were more likely to experience central sleep apnea (43% vs. 5%; p = 0.003). In older children obstructive was significantly more prevalent than central sleep apnea. Supplemental oxygen was used to treat 9/23 infants with central sleep apnea. Oxygen therapy resulted in a significant decrease in the median central apnea index from 14 (5,68) to 1 (0,6; p = 0.008) events/hour and an improvement in the oxygen saturation nadir from 70% (52, 92) to 81% (64, 95; p = 0.080).Central sleep apnea with associated oxygen desaturations is more prevalent in infants compared with older children with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Supplemental oxygen was efficacious in treating central sleep apnea in infants. Routine sleep surveillance for all children with Prader-Willi Syndrome and treatment with oxygen for central sleep apnea should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1990686104,"Background Nutritional research in sub-Saharan Africa has primarily focused on under-nutrition. However, there is evidence of an ongoing nutritional transition in these settings. This study aimed to examine the geographic variation of overweight and obesity prevalence at the state-level among women in Nigeria, while accounting for individual-level risk factors. Methods The analysis was based on the 2008 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), including 27,967 women aged 15–49 years. Individual data were collected on socio-demographics, but were aggregated to the country's states. We used a Bayesian geo-additive mixed model to map the geographic distribution of overweight and obesity at the state-level, accounting for individual-level risk factors. Results The overall prevalence of combined overweight and obesity (body mass index ≥25) was 20.9%. In multivariate Bayesian geo-additive models, higher education [odds ratio (OR) & 95% Credible Region (CR): 1.68 (1.38, 2.00)], higher wealth index [3.45 (2.98, 4.05)], living in urban settings [1.24 (1.14, 1.36)] and increasing age were all significantly associated with a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity. There was also a striking variation in overweight/obesity prevalence across ethnic groups and state of residence, the highest being in Cross River State, in south-eastern Nigeria [2.32 (1.62, 3.40)], the lowest in Osun State in south-western Nigeria [0.48 (0.36, 0.61)]. Conclusions This study suggests distinct geographic patterns in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among Nigerian women, as well as the role of demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors in the ongoing nutritional transition in these settings."
https://openalex.org/W2158109779,"Maternal recto-vaginal colonization with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and consequent vertical transmission to the newborn predisposes neonates to early-onset invasive GBS disease. This study aimed to determine the acquisition and loss of serotype-specific recto-vaginal GBS colonization from 20-37+ weeks of gestational age.Vaginal and rectal swabs were collected from HIV-uninfected women at 20-25 weeks of gestation age and at 5-6 weekly intervals thereafter. Swabs were cultured for GBS and isolates were serotyped by latex agglutination. Serologically non-typable isolates and pilus islands were characterized by PCR.The prevalence of recto-vaginal GBS colonization was 33.0%, 32.7%, 28.7% and 28.4% at 20-25 weeks, 26-30 weeks, 31-35 weeks and 37+ weeks of gestational age, respectively. The most common identified serotypes were Ia (39.2%), III (32.8%) and V (12.4%). Of 507 participants who completed all four study visits, the cumulative overall recto-vaginal acquisition rate of new serotypes during the study was 27.9%, including 11.2%, 8.2% and 4.3% for serotypes Ia, III and V, respectively. Comparing the common colonizing serotypes, serotype III was more likely to be associated with persistent colonization throughout the study (29%) than Ia (18%; p = 0.045) or V (6%; p = 0.002). The median duration of recto-vaginal GBS colonization for serotype III was 6.35 weeks, which was longer than other serotypes. Pilus island proteins were detected in all GBS isolates and their subtype distribution was associated with specific serotypes.South African pregnant women have a high prevalence of GBS recto-vaginal colonization from 20 weeks of gestational age onwards, including high GBS acquisition rates in the last pregnancy-trimesters. There are differences in specific-serotype colonization patterns during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2032948560,"Cells that form bone (osteoblasts) express both ephrinB2 and EphB4, and previous work has shown that pharmacological inhibition of the eph-rinB2/EphB4 interaction impairs osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of ephrinB2 signaling in the osteoblast lineage in the process of bone formation. Cultured osteoblasts from mice with osteoblast-specific ablation of ephrinB2 showed delayed expression of osteoblast differentiation markers, a finding that was reproduced by ephrinB2, but not EphB4, RNA interference. Microcomputed tomography, histomorphometry, and mechanical testing of the mice lacking ephrinB2 in osteoblasts revealed a 2-fold delay in bone mineralization, a significant reduction in bone stiffness, and a 50% reduction in osteoblast differentiation induced by anabolic parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment, compared to littermate sex- and age-matched controls. These defects were associated with significantly lower mRNA levels of late osteoblast differentiation markers and greater levels of osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, indicated by TUNEL staining and transmission electron microscopy of bone samples, and a 2-fold increase in annexin V staining and 7-fold increase in caspase 8 activation in cultured ephrinB2 deficient osteoblasts. We conclude that osteoblast differentiation and bone strength are maintained by antiapoptotic actions of ephrinB2 signaling within the osteoblast lineage.—Tonna, S., Takyar, F.

https://openalex.org/W2045665532,"Why are some individuals more vulnerable to persistent weight gain and obesity than are others? Some obese individuals report factors that drive overeating, including lack of control, lack of satiation, and preoccupation with food, which may stem from reward-related neural circuitry. These are normative and common symptoms and not the sole focus of any existing measures. Many eating scales capture these common behaviors, but are confounded with aspects of dysregulated eating such as binge eating or emotional overeating. Across five studies, we developed items that capture this reward-based eating drive (RED). Study 1 developed the items in lean to obese individuals (n = 327) and examined changes in weight over eight years. In Study 2, the scale was further developed and expert raters evaluated the set of items. Study 3 tested psychometric properties of the final 9 items in 400 participants. Study 4 examined psychometric properties and race invariance (n = 80 women). Study 5 examined psychometric properties and age/gender invariance (n = 381). Results showed that RED scores correlated with BMI and predicted earlier onset of obesity, greater weight fluctuations, and greater overall weight gain over eight years. Expert ratings of RED scale items indicated that the items reflected characteristics of reward-based eating. The RED scale evidenced high internal consistency and invariance across demographic factors. The RED scale, designed to tap vulnerability to reward-based eating behavior, appears to be a useful brief tool for identifying those at higher risk of weight gain over time. Given the heterogeneity of obesity, unique brief profiling of the reward-based aspect of obesity using a self-report instrument such as the RED scale may be critical for customizing effective treatments in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2054789750,"Probiotics play an important role in growth increment, immune enhancement and stress mitigation in fish. Increasing temperature is a major concern in present aquaculture practices as it markedly deteriorates the health condition and reduces the growth in fish. In order to explore the possibilities of using probiotics as a counter measure for temperature associated problems, a 30 days feeding trial was conducted to study the hemato-immunological and apoptosis response of Labeo rohita (8.3±0.4 g) reared at different water temperatures, fed with or without dietary supplementation of a probiotic mixture (PM) consisting of Bacillus subtilis, Lactococcus lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (1011 cfu kg−1). Three hundred and sixty fish were randomly distributed into eight treatment groups in triplicates, namely, T1(28°C+BF(Basal feed)+PM), T2(31°C+BF+PM), T3(34°C+BF+PM), T4(37°C+BF+PM), T5(28°C+BF), T6(31°C+BF), T7(34°C+BF) and T8(37°C+BF). A significant increase (P<0.01) in weight gain percentage was observed in the probiotic fed fish even when reared at higher water temperature (34–37°C). Respiratory burst assay, blood glucose, erythrocyte count, total serum protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase were significantly higher (P<0.01) in the probiotic fed groups compared to the non-probiotic fed groups. A significant (P<0.01) effect of rearing temperature and dietary probiotic mixture on serum myeloperoxidase activity, HSP70 level and immunoglobulin production was observed. Degree of apoptosis in different tissues was also significantly reduced in probiotic-supplemented groups. Hence, the present results show that a dietary PM could be beneficial in enhancing the immune status of the fish and also help in combating the stress caused to the organism by higher rearing water temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1990093709,"Borrelia burgdorferi is a zoonotic pathogen whose maintenance in nature depends upon an infectious cycle that alternates between a tick vector and mammalian hosts. Lyme disease in humans results from transmission of B. burgdorferi by the bite of an infected tick. The population dynamics of B. burgdorferi throughout its natural infectious cycle are not well understood. We addressed this topic by assessing the colonization, dissemination and persistence of B. burgdorferi within and between the disparate mammalian and tick environments. To follow bacterial populations during infection, we generated seven isogenic but distinguishable B. burgdorferi clones, each with a unique sequence tag. These tags resulted in no phenotypic changes relative to wild type organisms, yet permitted highly sensitive and specific detection of individual clones by PCR. We followed the composition of the spirochete population throughout an experimental infectious cycle that was initiated with a mixed inoculum of all clones. We observed heterogeneity in the spirochete population disseminating within mice at very early time points, but all clones displayed the ability to colonize most mouse tissues by 3 weeks of infection. The complexity of clones subsequently declined as murine infection persisted. Larval ticks typically acquired a reduced and variable number of clones relative to what was present in infected mice at the time of tick feeding, and maintained the same spirochete population through the molt to nymphs. However, only a random subset of infectious spirochetes was transmitted to naïve mice when these ticks next fed. Our results clearly demonstrate that the spirochete population experiences stochastic bottlenecks during both acquisition and transmission by the tick vector, as well as during persistent infection of its murine host. The experimental system that we have developed can be used to further explore the forces that shape the population of this vector-borne bacterial pathogen throughout its infectious cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2089971263,"Background We derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from rat induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and transduced them with tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), to test whether TSG-6 overexpression would boost the therapeutic effects of iPSC-derived MSCs in experimental periodontitis. Methods A total of 30 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: healthy control group (Group-N, n = 5), untreated periodontitis group (Group-P, n = 5), iPS-MSCs-treated and iPSC-MSCs/TSG-6-treated periodontitis groups (Group-P1 and P2, n = 10 per group). Experimental periodontitis was established by ligature and infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis around the maxillae first molar bilaterally. MSC-like cells were generated from rat iPSCs, and transducted with TSG-6. iPSC-MSCs or iPSC-MSCs/TSG-6 were administrated to rats in Group-P1 or P2 intravenously and topically, once a week for three weeks. Blood samples were obtained one week post-injection for the analysis of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines. All animals were killed 3 months post-treatment; maxillae were then dissected for histological analysis, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and morphological analysis of alveolar bone loss. Results Administration of iPSC-MSC/TSG-6 significantly decreased serum levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the Group-P2 rats (65.78 pg/ml and 0.56 pg/ml) compared with those in Group-P (168.31 pg/ml and 1.15 pg/ml respectively) (p<0.05). Both alveolar bone loss and the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts showed a significant decrease in rats that received iPSC-MSC/TSG-6 treatment compared to untreated rats in Group-P (p<0.05), Conclusions We demonstrated that overexpression of TSG-6 in rat iPSC-derived MSCs were capable of decreasing inflammation in experimental periodontitis and inhibiting alveolar bone resorption. This may potentially serve as an alternative stem-cell-based approach in the treatment and regeneration of periodontal tissues."

Although studies have shown that olfactory impairment in children may occur as a consequence of a number of diseases or head trauma, until today no consensus on how to evaluate the sense of smell in children exists in Europe. Aim of the study was to develop a modified “Sniffin' Sticks” odor identification test, the “Sniffin' Kids” test for the use in children. In this study 537 children between 6-17 years of age were included. Fourteen odors, which were identified at a high rate by children, were selected from the “Sniffin' Sticks” 16-item odor identification test. Normative date for the 14-item “Sniffin' Kids” odor identification test was obtained. The test was validated by including a group of congenital anosmic children. Results show that the “Sniffin' Kids” test is able to discriminate between normosmia and anosmia with a cutoff value of >7 points on the odor identification test. In addition the test-retest reliability was investigated in a group of 31 healthy children and shown to be ρ = 0.44. With the 14-item odor identification “Sniffin' Kids” test we present a valid and reliable test for measuring olfactory function in children between ages 6–17 years."
https://openalex.org/W2068336982,"The quantification of growth and development is an important issue in economics, because these phenomena are closely related to sustainability. We address growth and development from a network perspective in which economic systems are represented as flow networks and analyzed using ecological network analysis (ENA). The Beijing economic system is used as a case study and 11 input-output (I-O) tables for 1985-2010 are converted into currency networks. ENA is used to calculate system-level indices to quantify the growth and development of Beijing. The contributions of each direct flow toward growth and development in 2010 are calculated and their implications for sustainable development are discussed. The results show that during 1985-2010, growth was the main attribute of the Beijing economic system. Although the system grew exponentially, its development fluctuated within only a small range. The results suggest that system ascendency should be increased in order to favor more sustainable development. Ascendency can be augmented in two ways: (1) strengthen those pathways with positive contributions to increasing ascendency and (2) weaken those with negative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2079794035,"Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, such as ranibizumab, have significantly improved the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. This study used patient-level simulation modelling to estimate the number of individuals in Australia who would have been likely to avoid legal blindness or visual impairment due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration over a 2-year period as a result of intravitreal ranibizumab injections. The modelling approach used existing data for the incidence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in Australia and outcomes from ranibizumab trials. Blindness and visual impairment were defined as visual acuity in the better-seeing eye of worse than 6/60 or 6/12, respectively. In 2010, 14,634 individuals in Australia were estimated to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration who would be eligible for ranibizumab therapy. Without treatment, 2246 individuals would become legally blind over 2 years. Monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab would reduce incident blindness by 72% (95% simulation interval, 70-74%). Ranibizumab given as needed would reduce incident blindness by 68% (64-71%). Without treatment, 4846 individuals would become visually impaired over 2 years; this proportion would be reduced by 37% (34-39%) with monthly intravitreal ranibizumab, and by 28% (23-33%) with ranibizumab given as needed. These data suggest that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, given either monthly or as needed, can substantially lower the number of cases of blindness and visual impairment over 2 years after the diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration."

The development of glucose tolerance disorders in adults involves insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Objective To evaluate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in a 4-yr old cohort of SGA. Methods 85 children were prospectively followed from mid-gestation to 4 years of age. Fetal growth velocity (FGV) was measured using ultrasound measurements. Body composition and hormonal profile were measured at birth, 1 and 4 years. Results 23 SGA babies had lower birth weight compared to 62 AGA (−1.9±0.3 vs. −0.6±0.8 z-score; p<0.0001) and they were thinner at birth (ponderal index 24.8±1.8 vs. 26.3±3.1 kg/m3; p = 0.01 and fat mass 11±2.6 vs. 12.9±3.1%; p = 0.01). No significant differences in other measured metabolic and hormonal parameters were observed between two groups at birth. SGA infants experienced an early catch-up growth in weight (mean gain of 1.1±0.6 SD) during the first year of life. At 4 years, SGA children remain lighter than AGA, but with weight z-score in the normal range (−0.1±1.3 vs. 0.5±1.3 z-score; p = 0.05). No excess of fat mass was observed (19±4.8 vs. 19.7±4.1%; p = 0.45). 120-min plasma glucose was significantly higher (6.2±1.1 vs. 5.6±0.9 mmol/l; p = 0.006) and insulinogenic index was significantly lower (0.28±0.15 vs. 0.40±2.4; p = 0.02) in the SGA group at 4-yrs of life contrasting with a preserved insulin sensitivity (QUICKI 0.47±0.09 vs. 0.43±0.05; p = 0.06).

In an extension to our previous voxel-based morphometry findings, we employed a more specific, vertex-based approach to explore cortical thinning in relation to persistent negative symptoms (PNS) in non-affective first-episode of psychosis (FEP) patients to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of primary negative symptoms.This study included 62 non-affective FEP patients and 60 non-clinical controls; 16 patients were identified with PNS (i.e., at least 1 primary negative symptom at moderate or greater severity sustained for at least 6 consecutive months). Using cortical thickness analyses, we explored for differences between PNS and non-PNS patients as well as between each patient group and healthy controls; cut-off threshold was set at p<0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons.A thinner cortex prominently in the right superior temporal gyrus extending into the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right parahippocampal gyrus, and left orbital frontal gyrus was identified in PNS patients vs. non-PNS patients. Compared with healthy controls, PNS patients showed a thinner cortex prominently in the right superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right cingulate; non-PNS patients showed a thinner cortex prominently in the parahippocampal gyrus bi-laterally.Cortical thinning in the early stages of non-affective psychosis is present in the frontal and temporo-parietal regions in patients with PNS. With these brain regions strongly related to social cognitive functioning, our finding suggests a potential link between primary negative symptoms and social cognitive deficits through common brain etiologies."
https://openalex.org/W2045543350,"Many seabirds including penguins are adapted to long periods of fasting, particularly during parts of the reproductive cycle and during moult. However, the influence of fasting on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has not been investigated in seabirds. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the microbial composition and diversity of the GI microbiota of fasting little (Eudyptula minor) and king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) penguins during early and late moult. The results from this study indicated that there was little change in the abundance of the major phyla during moult, except for a significant increase in the level of Proteobacteria in king penguins. In king penguins the abundance of Fusobacteria increases from 1.73% during early moult to 33.6% by late moult, whilst the abundance of Proteobacteria (35.7% to 17.2%) and Bacteroidetes (19.5% to 11%) decrease from early to late moult. In little penguins, a decrease in the abundances of Firmicutes (44% to 29%) and an increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes (11% to 20%) were observed from early to late moult respectively. The results from this study indicate that the microbial composition of both king and little penguins alters during fasting. However, it appears that the microbial composition of king penguins is more affected by fasting than little penguins with the length of fast the most probable cause for this difference."
https://openalex.org/W1971020841,"To achieve robust and stable legged locomotion in uneven terrain, animals must effectively coordinate limb swing and stance phases, which involve distinct yet coupled dynamics. Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the critical influence of swing-leg trajectory on stability, disturbance rejection, leg loading and economy of walking and running. Yet, simulations suggest that not all these factors can be simultaneously optimized. A potential trade-off arises between the optimal swing-leg trajectory for disturbance rejection (to maintain steady gait) versus regulation of leg loading (for injury avoidance and economy). Here we investigate how running guinea fowl manage this potential trade-off by comparing experimental data to predictions of hypothesis-based simulations of running over a terrain drop perturbation. We use a simple model to predict swing-leg trajectory and running dynamics. In simulations, we generate optimized swing-leg trajectories based upon specific hypotheses for task-level control priorities. We optimized swing trajectories to achieve i) constant peak force, ii) constant axial impulse, or iii) perfect disturbance rejection (steady gait) in the stance following a terrain drop. We compare simulation predictions to experimental data on guinea fowl running over a visible step down. Swing and stance dynamics of running guinea fowl closely match simulations optimized to regulate leg loading (priorities i and ii), and do not match the simulations optimized for disturbance rejection (priority iii). The simulations reinforce previous findings that swing-leg trajectory targeting disturbance rejection demands large increases in stance leg force following a terrain drop. Guinea fowl negotiate a downward step using unsteady dynamics with forward acceleration, and recover to steady gait in subsequent steps. Our results suggest that guinea fowl use swing-leg trajectory consistent with priority for load regulation, and not for steadiness of gait. Swing-leg trajectory optimized for load regulation may facilitate economy and injury avoidance in uneven terrain."
https://openalex.org/W2026932338,"The impact of rainwater on the microbial quality of a tropical freshwater reservoir through atmospheric wet deposition of microorganisms was studied for the first time. Reservoir water samples were collected at four different sampling points and rainwater samples were collected in the immediate vicinity of the reservoir sites for a period of four months (January to April, 2012) during the Northeast monsoon period. Microbial quality of all fresh rainwater and reservoir water samples was assessed based on the counts for the microbial indicators: Escherichia coli (E. coli), total coliforms, and Enterococci along with total heterotrophic plate counts (HPC). The taxonomic richness and phylogenetic relationship of the freshwater reservoir with those of the fresh rainwater were also assessed using 16 S rRNA gene clone library construction. The levels of E. coli were found to be in the range of 0 CFU/100 mL-75 CFU/100 mL for the rainwater, and were 10-94 CFU/100 mL for the reservoir water. The sampling sites that were influenced by highway traffic emissions showed the maximum counts for all the bacterial indicators assessed. There was no significant increase in the bacterial abundances observed in the reservoir water immediately following rainfall. However, the composite fresh rainwater and reservoir water samples exhibited broad phylogenetic diversity, including sequences representing Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae and Bacteriodetes.

Here, we investigated CD147 protein expression in 223 patients with gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry and analyzed its association with disease-free and overall survival. CD147 was increased in gastric cancer compared to normal tissues. Additionally, CD147 expression was associated with gastric cancer invasion, metastasis and TNM stage, whereas it was not related to age, sex, differentiation status, tumor site or Lauren classification. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that CD147 was associated with disease-free and overall survival in patients with gastric cancer; i.e., patients with positive CD147 staining tend to have worse disease-free and overall survival. Moreover, Cox's proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that CD147 was an independent marker of disease-free and overall survival for patients with gastric cancer. These results confirm the association of CD147 with gastric cancer invasion and metastasis and prove that CD147 might be an indicator of tumor recurrence and prognosis in gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2045249668,"Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is detrimental to avian health and leads to major economic losses for the poultry industry. AFB1 is especially hepatotoxic in domestic turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), since these birds are unable to detoxify AFB1 by glutathione-conjugation. The impacts of AFB1 on the turkey hepatic transcriptome and the potential protection from pretreatment with a Lactobacillus-based probiotic mixture were investigated through RNA-sequencing. Animals were divided into four treatment groups and RNA was subsequently recovered from liver samples. Four pooled RNA-seq libraries were sequenced to produce over 322 M reads totaling 13.8 Gb of sequence. Approximately 170,000 predicted transcripts were de novo assembled, of which 803 had significant differential expression in at least one pair-wise comparison between treatment groups. Functional analysis linked many of the transcripts significantly affected by AFB1 exposure to cancer, apoptosis, the cell cycle or lipid regulation. Most notable were transcripts from the genes encoding E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2, osteopontin, S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-2, and lipoprotein lipase. Expression was modulated by the probiotics, but treatment did not completely mitigate the effects of AFB1. Genes identified through transcriptome analysis provide candidates for further study of AFB1 toxicity and targets for efforts to improve the health of domestic turkeys exposed to AFB1."
https://openalex.org/W1983617049,"The local field potential (LFP) has recently been widely used in brain computer interfaces (BCI). Here we used power of LFP recorded from area MT of a macaque monkey to decode where the animal covertly attended. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to learn the pattern of power at different frequencies for attention to two possible positions. We found that LFP power at both low (<9 Hz) and high (31–120 Hz) frequencies contains sufficient information to decode the focus of attention. Highest decoding performance was found for gamma frequencies (31–120 Hz) and reached 82%. In contrast low frequencies (<9 Hz) could help the classifier reach a higher decoding performance with a smaller amount of training data. Consequently, we suggest that low frequency LFP can provide fast but coarse information regarding the focus of attention, while higher frequencies of the LFP deliver more accurate but less timely information about the focus of attention."
https://openalex.org/W1974496652,"The activation of the G-protein transducin (Gt) by rhodopsin (Rho) has been intensively studied for several decades. It is the best understood example of GPCR activation mechanism and serves as a template for other GPCRs. The structure of the Rho/G protein complex, which is transiently formed during the signaling reaction, is of particular interest. It can help understanding the molecular details of how retinal isomerization leads to the G protein activation, as well as shed some light on how GPCR recognizes its cognate G protein. The native Rho/Gt complex isolated from bovine retina suffers from low stability and loss of the retinal ligand. Recently, we reported that constitutively active mutant of rhodopsin E113Q forms a Rho/Gt complex that is stable in detergent solution. Here, we introduce methods for a large scale preparation of the complex formed by the thermo-stabilized and constitutively active rhodopsin mutant N2C/M257Y/D282C(RhoM257Y) and the native Gt purified from bovine retinas. We demonstrate that the light-activated rhodopsin in this complex contains a covalently bound unprotonated retinal and therefore corresponds to the active metarhodopin II state; that the isolated complex is active and dissociates upon addition of GTPγS; and that the stoichiometry corresponds to a 1∶1 molar ratio of rhodopsin to the heterotrimeric G-protein. And finally, we show that the rhodopsin also forms stable complex with Gi. This complex has significantly higher thermostability than RhoM257Y/Gt complex and is resistant to a variety of detergents. Overall, our data suggest that the RhoM257Y/Gi complex is an ideal target for future structural and mechanistic studies of signaling in the visual system."
https://openalex.org/W2121905822,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) emerged as key regulators of gene expression. Germline hemizygous deletion of the gene that encodes the miR-17∼92 miRNA cluster was associated with microcephaly, short stature and digital abnormalities in humans. Mice deficient for the miR-17∼92 cluster phenocopy several features such as growth and skeletal development defects and exhibit impaired B cell development. However, the individual contribution of miR-17∼92 cluster members to this phenotype is unknown. Here we show that germline deletion of miR-92a in mice is not affecting heart development and does not reduce circulating or bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, but induces skeletal defects. MiR-92a-/- mice are born at a reduced Mendelian ratio, but surviving mice are viable and fertile. However, body weight of miR-92a-/- mice was reduced during embryonic and postnatal development and adulthood. A significantly reduced body and skull length was observed in miR-92a-/- mice compared to wild type littermates. µCT analysis revealed that the length of the 5th mesophalanx to 5th metacarpal bone of the forelimbs was significantly reduced, but bones of the hindlimbs were not altered. Bone density was not affected. These findings demonstrate that deletion of miR-92a is sufficient to induce a developmental skeletal defect."
https://openalex.org/W2154385932,"The chemokine receptor CCR6 has been recently shown to be associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, the direct evidence for whether CCR6 in tumors is a prognostic marker for the survival of patients with CRC and whether it plays a critical role in CRC metastasis in vivo is lacking. Here we show that the levels of CCR6 were upregulated in CRC cell lines and primary CRC clinical samples. CCR6 upregulation was closely correlated with disease stages and the survival time of CRC patients. Knockdown of CCR6 inhibited the migration of CRC cells in vitro. Overexpression of CCR6 in CRC cells increased their proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro and promoted their metastatic potential in vivo. CCR6 activated Akt signaling, upregulated metastasis genes and downregulated metastasis suppressor genes. Selective targeting of CCR6 in tumors dramatically inhibited the growth of CRC in mice. Thus, the tumor expression of CCR6 plays a critical role in CRC metastasis, upregulated CCR6 predicts poor survival in CRC patients, and targeting CCR6 expression in tumors may be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2016014262,"Treating the vascular elements within the neurovascular unit is essential for protecting and repairing the brain after stroke. Acute injury on endothelial systems results in the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB), while post-ischemic angiogenesis plays an important role in delayed functional recovery. Here, we considered alterations in microvessel integrity to be targets for brain recovery, and tested the natural compound morroniside as a therapeutic approach to restore the vascular elements of injured tissue in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, and morroniside was then administered intragastrically once a day at doses of 30, 90, and 270 mg/kg. BBB integrity and associated factors were analyzed to identify cerebrovascular permeability 3 days after MCAO. The recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the expression of angiogenic factors and the new vessel formation in the peri-infarct cortex of rats were examined 7 days after MCAO to identify the angiogenesis. We demonstrated that at 3 days post-ischemia, morroniside preserved neurovascular unit function by ameliorating BBB injury. By 7 days post-ischemia, morroniside amplified angiogenesis, in part by enhancing endothelial progenitor cell proliferation and expression of angiogenic factors. Morever, the increase in the amount of vWF+ vessels induced by ischemia could be extended to 28 days after administration of morroniside, indicating the crucial role of morroniside in angiogenesis during the chronic phase. Taken together, our findings suggested that morroniside might offer a novel therapeutic approach for promoting microvascular integrity recovery and provide a thoroughly new direction for stroke therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2058855006,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) provides nourishment and protection to the eye. RPE dysfunction due to oxidative stress and inflammation is one of the major reason for many of the retinal disorders. Organophosphorus pesticides are widely used in the agricultural, industrial and household activities in India. However, their effects on the eye in the context of RPE has not been studied. In this study the defense of the ARPE19 cells exposed to Chlorpyrifos (1 nM to 100 µM) in terms of the enzyme paraoxonase (PON) was studied at 24 hr and 9 days of treatment. Chlorpyrifos was found to induce oxidative stress in the ARPE19 cells as seen by significant increase in ROS and decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels without causing cell death. Tissue resident Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) mRNA expression was elevated with chlorpyrifos exposure. The three enzymatic activities of PON namely, paraoxonase (PONase), arylesterase (PON AREase) and thiolactonase (PON HCTLase) were also found to be significantly altered to detoxify and as an antioxidant defense. Among the transcription factors regulating PON2 expression, SP1 was significantly increased with chlorpyrifos exposure. PON2 expression was found to be crucial as ARPE19 cells showed a significant loss in their ability to withstand oxidative stress when the cells were subjected to chlorpyrifos after silencing PON2 expression. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine positively regulated the PON 2 expression, thus promoting the antioxidant defense put up by the cells in response to chlorpyrifos."
https://openalex.org/W2163685284,"Background Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the APOA5-A4-C3-A1 gene complex are associated with elevated plasma triglycerides and elevated vascular risk in healthy populations. In patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia and metabolic syndrome are frequently present, but the contribution of these single nucleotide polymorphisms to plasma triglycerides, effect modification by obesity and risk of recurrent vascular events is unknown in these patients. Methods Prospective cohort study of 5547 patients with vascular disease. Rs964184 (APOA5-A4-C3-A1 gene complex) was genotyped, and we evaluated the relation with plasma lipid levels, presence of metabolic syndrome and the risk for new vascular events. Results The minor allele of rs964184 was strongly associated with log plasma triglycerides (β 0.12; 95%CI 0.10-0.15, p = 1.1*10−19), and was also associated with 0.03 mmol/L lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (95%CI 0.01–0.04), and 0.14 mmol/L higher non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (95%CI 0.09–0.20). The minor allele frequency increased from 10.9% in patients with plasma triglycerides <1 mmol/L to 24.6% in patients with plasma triglycerides between 4 and 10 mmol/L. The relation between rs964184 and plasma triglycerides was modified by body mass index in patients with one minor allele (β 0.02; (95%CI −0.04–0.09) if body mass index <24 kg/m2, β 0.17 (95%CI 0.12–0.22) if body mass index >27 kg/m2, p for interaction = 0.02). The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased from 52% for patients with two copies of the major allele to 62% for patients with two copies of the minor allele (p = 0.01). Rs964184 was not related with recurrent vascular events (HR 0.99; 95%CI 0.86–1.13). Conclusion The single nucleotide polymorphism rs964184 (APOA5-A4-C3-A1) is associated with elevated plasma triglycerides concentrations in patients with clinically manifest vascular disease. In carriers of one minor allele, the effect on plasma triglycerides was modified by body mass index. There is no relation between rs964184 and recurrent vascular events in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W1980615815,"Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) frequently occur in autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and correlate with a worse clinical outcome. In the present study, we evaluated the association between antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), markers of inflammation, disease progression and the presence of an intra-aneurysmal thrombus in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients. APLs ELISAs were performed in frozen serum samples of 96 consecutive AAA patients and 48 healthy controls yielding positive test results in 13 patients (13.5%) and 3 controls (6.3%; n.s.). Nine of the 13 aPL-positive AAA patients underwent a second antibody testing >12 weeks apart revealing a positive result in 6 cases. APL-positive patients had increased levels of inflammatory markers compared to aPL-negative patients. Disease progression was defined as an increase of the AAA diameter >0.5 cm/year measured by sonography. Follow-up was performed in 69 patients identifying 41 (59.4%) patients with progressive disease. Performing multipredictor logistic regression analysis adjusting for classical AAA risk factors as confounders, the presence of aPLs at baseline revealed an odds ratio of 9.4 (95% CI 1.0-86.8, p = 0.049) to predict AAA progression. Fifty-five patients underwent a computed tomography in addition to ultrasound assessment indicating intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation in 82.3%. Median thrombus volume was 46.7 cm3 (1.9-377.5). AAA diameter correlated with the size of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus (corrcoeff = 0.721, p<0.001), however neither the presence nor the size of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus were related to the presence of aPLs. In conclusion, the presence of aPLs is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers and is an independent predictor of progressive disease in AAA patients."
https://openalex.org/W1999051064,"Background Dastarcus helophoroides is known as the most valuable natural enemy insect against many large-body longhorned beetles. The molecular mechanism of its long lifespan and reproduction makes it a unique resource for genomic research. However, molecular biological studies on this parasitic beetle are scarce, and genomic information for D. helophoroides is not currently available. Thus, transcriptome information for this species is an important resource that is required for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of D. helophoroides. In this study, we obtained transcriptome information of D. helophoroides using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Results Using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing, 27,543,746 clean reads corresponding to a total of 2.48 Gb nucleotides were obtained from a single run. These reads were assembled into 42,810 unigenes with a mean length of 683 bp. Using a sequence similarity search against the five public databases (NR, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG, KEGG) with a cut-off E-value of 10−5 using Blastx, a total of 31,293 unigenes were annotated with gene description, gene ontology terms, or metabolic pathways. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the transcriptome information of D. helophoroides. The transcriptome data presented in this study provide comprehensive information for future studies in D. helophoroides, particularly for functional genomic studies in this parasitic beetle."

Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO) was the first inherited disease associated with loss-of-function mutations in a G protein (Gαs) and other studies revealed gain-of-function Gα mutations in cancer. Here we attempted to solve the apparent quandary posed by the fact that the same mutation in two different G proteins appeared associated with both AHO and cancer. We first confirmed the presence of an inherited Gαs-R265H mutation from a previously described clinical case report of AHO. This mutation is structurally analogous to Gαo-R243H, an oncogenic mutant with increased activity in vitro and in cells due to rapid nucleotide exchange. We found that, contrary to Gαo-R243H, Gαs-R265H activity is compromised due to greatly impaired nucleotide binding in vitro and in cells. We obtained equivalent results when comparing another AHO mutation in Gαs (D173N) with a counterpart cancer mutation in Gαo (D151N). Gαo-R243H binds nucleotides efficiently under steady-state conditions but releases GDP much faster than the WT protein, suggesting diminished affinity for the nucleotide. These results indicate that the same disease-linked mutation in two different G proteins affects a common biochemical feature (nucleotide affinity) but to a different grade depending on the G protein (mild decrease for Gαo and severe for Gαs). We conclude that Gαs-R265H has dramatically impaired nucleotide affinity leading to the loss-of-function in AHO whereas Gαo-R243H has a mild decrease in nucleotide affinity that causes rapid nucleotide turnover and subsequent hyperactivity in cancer.

In cells, GTP is loaded spontaneously upon GDP release due to the physiological ∼10:1 GTP:GDP concentration ratio, which ensures the directionality of the reaction toward G protein activation. Both GTP-bound Gα and uncomplexed Gβγ subunits regulate the activity of a wide array of effectors. G protein signaling is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunits, which can be further enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Upon conversion of GTP to GDP + Pi, Gα reassociates with Gβγ to complete a cycle. Given the pivotal role of heterotrimeric G proteins in physiology it is not surprising that dysregulation of the biochemical reactions involved in this process gives rise to human disease. In fact, multiple germline and somatically acquired mutations in Gα subunits that alter their biochemical properties have been described in different human diseases (7.Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Iiri T.

An interesting feature of AHO is that maternal inheritance of the Gαs loss of function mutations also produces multihormone resistance whereas paternal inheritance does not.

In addition to mutations in Gαs codons 201 (R→C) and 227 (Q→L), which are found in ∼25% of pituitary adenomas (18.Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L.

The amino acid residues present in these mutated positions are universally conserved across Gα subunits as is the mechanism by which they trigger oncogenic transformation: i.e. R→C and Q→L mutations promote a gain of function by impairing GTPase activity and rendering the G proteins constitutively active in the GTP-bound conformation. In fact, this high degree of sequence and functional conservation has been traditionally exploited as a tool to investigate the function of G proteins. Artificial mutations equivalent to the oncogenic R→C or Q→L are routinely used to investigate the biological functions of virtually every Gα subunit. For example, introduction of equivalent mutations in Gαo, Gα12, Gα13, or Gαz, which are not found in carcinomas, induces a gain of function and promotes oncogenic transformation when artificially introduced into cultured cells (23.Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.

R→C and Q→L mutants of Gαi1 were also used in the pioneering crystallographic studies that revealed the structural basis of GTP hydrolysis that are common to all Gα subunits (29.Coleman D.E.

Cancer genome sequencing campaigns are revealing a far more complex landscape of G protein mutations (8.O'Hayre M. Vázquez-Prado J. Kufareva I. Stawiski E.W. Handel T.M. Seshagiri S. Gutkind J.S.

More than a hundred different mutations have been identified and although some of them occur at conserved positions in the Gα protein sequences, it is still unclear how conserved their impact on G protein function is. Here we compared the functional consequences of a Gαo cancer somatic mutation (R243H) with an identical Gαs-inherited mutation (R265H) present in a family with AHO. We provide evidence indicating that the same mutation in two homologous Gα subunits causes either a gain-of-function or loss-of-function phenotype associated with two unrelated human diseases. Unless otherwise indicated all reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) codon+ was purchased from Invitrogen. Pfu ultra DNA polymerase was purchased from Agilent. [γ-32P]GTP and [α-32P]GTP were from Perkin-Elmer. Two members of a single family (mother and son, patients II.1 and III.1 in Fig. 2A, respectively) presented skeletal abnormalities of AHO, i.e. brachydactyly assessed by x-ray radiography (30.Bastida Eizaguirre M.

The son (patient III.1) presented characteristics of abnormal endocrine function (elevated TSH with normal thyroxine (T4)) and was diagnosed with PHP-Ia whereas the mother (patient II.1) had normal endocrine markers and was diagnosed with PPHP.

Visualization and display of protein structure images was done using MolsoftICM (San Diego, CA). Rat Gαo (isoform 1; Gαo1, hereafter referred to as Gαo) with a short N-terminal hexahistidine (His) tag was cloned into pET28b as described previously (33.Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Ear J. Farquhar M.G. A structural determinant that renders G α(i) sensitive to activation by GIV/girdin is required to promote cell migration.J. Biol.

His-tagged bovine Gαs with a short N-terminal His tag cloned into pHIS6 was a kind gift from Dr. Artemyev (University of Iowa) (34.Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. A single mutation Asp229 –> Ser confers upon Gsα the ability to interact with regulators of G protein signaling.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13776-13780Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To generate constructs for mammalian expression, Gαs was PCR amplified from pHIS6-Gαs and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the plasmid pMSCV-IRES-GFP (Addgene 20672). In this construct GFP expression is driven by the same promoter as the G protein by virtue of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), making the levels of both transcripts proportional. Point mutations were generated using specific primers following the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange II, Agilent). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, and 5% CO2. Equal amounts DNA plasmids were transfected using the calcium phosphate method and cells harvested after 48 h. For the experiments to assess the stability of Gαs WT and Gαs R265H proteins, HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were incubated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 6 h prior harvesting. Lysates were prepared by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 125 mm K(CH3COO), 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and cleared at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were boiled after addition of Laemmli buffer, run by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse anti-Gαs (1:500, Gαs (12.Bastepe M. Jüppner H. GNAS locus and pseudohypoparathyroidism.Horm. Res. 2005; 63: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GFP (1:2,000, Invitrogen), and mouse anti-tubulin (1:2,500, Sigma) antibodies. Changes in intracellular levels of cAMP were measured by the cAMP-Glo Assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with Gαs WT, Gαs R265H, or an empty vector and harvested 48 h later. 20-μl aliquots in duplicate of a 700 × 103 cell/ml suspension were incubated in the presence of IBMX (1 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped using the lysis buffer provided with the kit, and subsequent steps carried out following the manufacturer's instructions to determine the increase in cAMP compared with control cells (empty vector-transfected). Aliquots of the cells were processed in parallel to quantify total amount of protein and verify the expression of the transfected constructs. cAMP levels were normalized by the total amount of protein. Approximately half of the HEK293 cells of a 10 cm dish transfected with Gαs WT or Gαs R265H were lysed in 45 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 125 mm K(CH3COO), 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 125 μm GDP, 125 μm GTPγS, or 125 μm GDP plus 125 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF. Samples were vortexed, incubated in ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. 40 μl of the supernatants were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to allow the loading of nucleotide. Trypsin (12.5 μg/ml) was added to the tubes and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. Samples were run by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-Gαs antibody (1:500, Gαs (C-18) Santa Cruz Biotechnology). His-Gαo was purified exactly as described previously (33.Garcia-Marcos M.

His-Gαs was purified from BL21(DE3) codon+ bacteria by nickel affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography as described in Ref. 35.Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E.

This assay was carried out exactly as described previously (36.Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G.

Briefly, His-Gαs (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in the presence of GDP (30 μm), GTPγS (30 μm) or GDP·AlF4− (30–100,000 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF). After this incubation, trypsin was added to the tubes (final concentration 80 μg/ml), and samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. This assay was performed as described previously (6.Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. GIV is a nonreceptor GEF for Gαi with a unique motif that regulates Akt signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Purified His-Gαo (1 μm) was equilibrated at room temperature in a cuvette with 1 ml of buffer (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% (w:v) C12E10). GTPγS (2 μm) was added to the cuvette after ∼3 min, and the G protein activation rate monitored by measuring the change in the intrinsic fluorescence (excitation at 284 nm, emission at 340 nm) due to structural rearrangement of the Switch II tryptophan residue Trp-212 (37.Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. The effect of GTP and Mg2+ on the GTPase activity and the fluorescent properties of Go.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were collected with a Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer, background corrected (buffer fluorescence) and expressed as % of maximal binding (fluorescence plateau at >40 min). Each protein (WT or mutant) was normalized to its own maximal binding to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Maximal binding values were similar for WT and mutants and are indicated in the figure legends of the corresponding experiment. Fluorescence measurements for His-Gαs (0.25 μm) were performed identically except that the buffer composition was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm GDP, 5% (v:v) glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and that the results were expressed as a ratio of the basal fluorescence (F/F0) because mutants did not reach a maximum. This assay was carried out essentially as described in Ref. 38.Ross E.M. Higashijima T. Regulation of G-protein activation by mastoparans and other cationic peptides.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. Briefly, His-Gαo (50 nm) was incubated with 0.5 μm, ∼50 cpm/fmol [α-32P]GTP (which is rapidly converted to [α-32P]GDP) for 60 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% (w:v) C12E10. Reactions were initiated by addition of excess (100 μm) unlabeled GDP or GTPγS at 30 °C. Duplicate aliquots (50 μl) were removed at different times, rapidly passed through BA-85 nitrocellulose filters (GE Healthcare) and washed with 4 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2). Filters were dried, and [α-32P]GDP remaining bound to Gαo was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. We recently characterized a novel oncogenic mutation in Gαo (36.Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. Molecular basis of a novel oncogenic mutation in GNAO1.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 2691-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We found that the molecular mechanism by which this gain-of-function mutation, namely R243H, triggers oncogenic transformation differs from any previously characterized oncogenic mutations in other Gα subunits: i.e. it renders the G protein hyperactive by accelerating the rate of nucleotide exchange instead of by impairing GTP hydrolysis (36.Garcia-Marcos M.

Although it is established that the m145 family members mimic the structure of MHC-I molecules, the structure of the m02 family remains unknown. The most extensively studied m02 family member is m04, a glycoprotein that escorts newly assembled MHC-I molecules to the cell surface, presumably to avoid “missing self” recognition.

In addition to the Ig-V core, m04 possesses several unique structural features that included an unusual β-strand topology, a number of extended loops and a prominent α-helix. The m04 interior was packed by a myriad of hydrophobic residues that form distinct clusters around two conserved tryptophan residues. This hydrophobic core was well conserved throughout the m02 family, thereby indicating that murine CMV encodes a number of Ig-V-like molecules.

Many viruses avoid detection by cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune system through strategies that interfere with the surface expression of peptide-MHC-I molecules. These include mechanisms to interfere with the flow and trafficking of MHC-I through the secretory pathway, that interrupt the supply of peptides to MHC-I in the ER, or that modulate the rate of MHC-I endocytosis (1.Petersen J.L.

The interplay between viral defense and host adaptation is best understood in the context of CMV infection. CMVs are a group of species-specific pathogens that are known for their ability to subvert the immune system of their host and establish latent and lifelong infections (4.Reddehase M.J. Antigens and immunoevasins: opponents in cytomegalovirus immune surveillance.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). They are highly prevalent, infecting over 50% of the human population worldwide with infections rates ranging from 45 to 100% in human adult populations and, although asymptomatic in healthy individuals, can cause considerably morbidity and mortality if the immune system is compromised (5.Sissons J.G. Carmichael A.J. McKinney N. Sinclair J.H. Wills M.R. Human cytomegalovirus and immunopathology.Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2002; 24: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The success of CMV in part results from the large size of its genome (∼230 kb), which affords the virus the opportunity to dedicate considerable genetic material to encoding proteins whose function confers even a slender evolutionary advantage (6.Dunn W. Chou C. Li H. Hai R. Patterson D. Stolc V. Zhu H. Liu F. Functional profiling of a human cytomegalovirus genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14223-14228Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Murine CMV (MCMV), which represents the model system for human CMV infection, encodes two large gene clusters whose protein products have been implicated in the subversion of NK cell-mediated recognition (7.Rawlinson W.D. Farrell H.E. Barrell B.G. Analysis of the complete DNA sequence of murine cytomegalovirus.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8833-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, the m145 family, which resides at the extreme right of the MCMV genome and includes m17 and m145–m158, has been extensively studied. So far, the structures of four members of the m145 family (m144, m152, m153, and m157) have been determined (8.Adams E.J. Juo Z.S. Venook R.T. Boulanger M.J. Arase H. Lanier L.L. Garcia K.C.

Remarkably, despite employing diverse mechanisms to mediate their function, each of these molecules possesses an MHC-I like fold, although they differ in their requirement for peptide and β2-microglobulin (β2m). At the extreme left of the MCMV genome lie the less understood m02 family members that include m02–m16 (7.Rawlinson W.D. Farrell H.E. Barrell B.G. Analysis of the complete DNA sequence of murine cytomegalovirus.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8833-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of most of the m02 family members remains unknown, as a group they have been implicated in the subversion of NK cell-mediated immunity. This function was originally attributed based on experiments in which viruses harboring a deletion of entire m02 family grew like their wild-type parental strain in cultured cells or in C57BL/6 mice depleted of NK cells but produced less infectious viruses in mice possessing a robust NK cell response (12.Oliveira S.A. Park S.H. Lee P. Bendelac A. Shenk T.E. Murine cytomegalovirus m02 gene family protects against natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The members of the m02 family can be clustered into three subgroups, m02–m06, m07–m10, and m11–m16 based on the presence of conserved cysteine residues (7.Rawlinson W.D. Farrell H.E. Barrell B.G. Analysis of the complete DNA sequence of murine cytomegalovirus.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8833-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family members also share a number of conserved motifs that include a CXXXXC motif (that is more stringently defined as CXLXXC(L/P)(W/R)o in m02–m06) and a NAXWXX(E/H)Wo motif found in m03–m06 (where X indicates any amino acid, and o indicates a hydrophobic amino acid) (7.Rawlinson W.D. Farrell H.E. Barrell B.G. Analysis of the complete DNA sequence of murine cytomegalovirus.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8833-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the m02 family members are related in the amino acid sequence, they are not appreciably similar to any other MCMV-encoded protein or to any other gene in the GenBankTM database (12.Oliveira S.A. Park S.H. Lee P. Bendelac A. Shenk T.E. Murine cytomegalovirus m02 gene family protects against natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To date, two members of the m02 family have been implicated in MHC-I targeting. Both m04 and m06 bind to newly assembly peptide-MHC-I complexes in the ER. However, whereas m06 redirects MHC-I to the lysosome for degradation (13.Reusch U. Muranyi W. Lucin P. Burgert H.G. Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. A cytomegalovirus glycoprotein re-routes MHC class I complexes to lysosomes for degradation.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), m04-MHC-I complexes traverse to the cell surface (14.Kleijnen M.F. Huppa J.B. Lucin P. Mukherjee S. Farrell H. Campbell A.E. Koszinowski U.H. Hill A.B. Ploegh H.L. A mouse cytomegalovirus glycoprotein, gp34, forms a complex with folded class I MHC molecules in the ER which is not retained but is transported to the cell surface.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Precisely why MCMV encodes a protein that escorts MHC-I to the cell surface is unclear, but it may be that maintaining a low level of MHC-I on the cell surface is beneficial to avoid NK cell-mediated missing self-recognition. More recently it has become apparent that m04 is the target of a novel viral detection strategy. In particular, there is now evidence that a number of activating NK cell receptors including Ly49P, Ly49L, and Ly49W can recognize MCMV-infected cells of certain H2 haplotypes (including H2d, H2k, H2a, and H2f) in an m04-dependent manner (15.Kielczewska A.

Distinct MHC class I-dependent NK cell-activating receptors control cytomegalovirus infection in different mouse strains.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1105-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular details underpinning such a recognition event remain a mystery. To shed light on m04 function, here we determined the crystal structure of m04. The structure revealed that m04 adopted an Ig-V-like scaffold that provides a basis for understanding the structure and function of the m02 family. DNA encoding the full-length nucleotide sequence for m04 from the MCMV isolates Smith, G4, and W8211 were a kind gift from Anthony Scalzo (17.Corbett A.J. Forbes C.A. Moro D. Scalzo A.A. Extensive sequence variation exists among isolates of murine cytomegalovirus within members of the m02 family of genes.J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 758-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fragments encoding the predicted m04 extracellular domains (residues 24–223 for m04Smith and m04G4 and residues 24–220 for m04W8211) were amplified by PCR and ligated into the AgeI and XhoI sites of the pHLSec vector (18.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The reverse primers used for PCR were designed to incorporate a thrombin site (LVPRGS) and His6 tag at the C terminus of the expressed protein. m04 protein was expressed using transient transfection of HEK 293S cells as described previously (18.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Cell culture media containing secreted protein were concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 0.5 m NaCl using tangential flow filtration prior to purification using nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography using Superdex S75 16/60 columns (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl. MHC-I molecules were expressed as inclusion bodies in BL21 DE3 Escherichia coli cells and were refolded and purified essentially as described (19.Clements C.S. Kjer-Nielsen L. Kostenko L. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. The production, purification and crystallization of a soluble form of the nonclassical MHC HLA-G: the essential role of cobalt.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The following peptide MHC-I complexes were employed; H2-Dd (RGP: RGPGRAFVTI), H2-Ld (YPH: YPHFMPTNL), H2-Dk (RL8: RRLGRTLL and RL9: RRLGRTLLL), and HLA-B*5701 (KAFSPEVIPMF). SPR experiments were conducted at 20 °C on a Biacore 3000 instrument using 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% P20 surfactant. Approximately 1300 response units of biotinylated MHC-I molecules were coupled to streptavidin-coated chips (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the remaining free streptavidin sites were blocked with d-biotin. Various concentrations of m04 (3.1–200 μm) were injected over the captured MHC-I at a flow rate of 20 μl min−1. The final response was calculated by subtracting the response of an “empty” flow cell (containing biotin-blocked streptavidin). The equilibrium data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. The data are representative of a single experiment performed in duplicate. For crystallization experiments, the extracellular domain of m04G4 was concentrated to 15.5 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 23% PEG 3350 and 0.2 m sodium malonate, pH 4, at 4 °C. Ytterbium derivative crystals were obtained by soaking crystals overnight in the presence of 20 mm ytterbium-(DPA)3 (Jena Bioscience). Prior to data collection, crystals were equilibrated in a crystallization solution supplemented with 35% PEG 3350 for cryoprotection. Crystals were flash cooled using liquid nitrogen, and x-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Quantum-315 CCD detector at the MX2 beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. Data sets to 3.0 Å (native) and 3.6 Å (ytterbium derivative) were integrated using MOSFLM and scaled using SCALA from the CCP4 program suite.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the extracellular domain of m04G4 was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Diffraction data containing anomalous signal from bound ytterbium atoms was collected at a single high energy remote wavelength (1.148 Å). Experimental phasing was performed using Phenix Autosol (20.Terwilliger T.C. Adams P.D. Read R.J. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Afonine P.V. Zwart P.H. Hung L.W. Decision-making in structure solution using Bayesian estimates of map quality: the PHENIX AutoSol wizard.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 582-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). A preliminary m04 model was built into the solvent-flattened electron density map de novo and then used as a molecular replacement model for the higher resolution 3 Å native data set using Phaser (21.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14440) Google Scholar). Obtaining the correct polypeptide register was greatly facilitated by the presence of clear unbiased electron density for the three N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn54, Asn115, and Asn130 early during the refinement process. The model was refined using Buster to an Rfac/Rfree of 22.1%/24.3%. Once the model was complete, extensive use of omit maps was employed for validation. Details of the refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The structure of m04G4 has been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (code 4PN6). Samples were gel filtered using a Superdex-200 5/150 column in 10 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mm NaCl. The eluate was passed through a Wyatt EOS 18-angle laser photometer coupled to a Wyatt Optilab rEX refractive index detector, and the molecular mass moments were analyzed by using Astra 6.1. To further our understanding of the function of m04, we expressed the m04 ectodomain from a number of MCMV isolates including Smith, G4, W8211, K181, and G1F. Initial expression and refolding trials in E. coli resulted in high yields of protein that were largely unstable. However, expression in HEK 293 cells resulted in highly soluble and stable protein preparations suitable for structural studies. We successfully crystallized the m04G4 ectodomain and determined its structure to 3 Å resolution using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (Table 1). Two m04 protomers were accommodated within the asymmetric unit, and the unambiguous electron density allowed the placement of the vast majority (∼85%) of the m04 polypeptide. The current model includes residues 17–185 of protomer A and residues 19–186 of protomer B. Because SDS-PAGE analysis of intact crystals indicated no evidence of proteolytic degradation (data not shown), we conclude that the N and C termini not visible in our structure are likely to be flexible. The two m04 protomers are essentially identical (having a root mean square deviation of 0.20 Å over 148 aligned Cα atoms) with the exception of the conformation of the F-G loop and the location of the C-terminal tail (residues 177–185), which undergoes a translation of ∼3 Å. The two m04 protomers visible within the crystal lattice form a homodimer via an unusual interface involving the short C-terminal β-strand (residues 179–180), resulting in a relatively small buried surface area of 1090 Å2 (not shown). To determine whether m04 forms a homodimer in solution, we performed MALLS analysis. During in-line size exclusion chromatography, m04G4 eluted at a volume consistent with a monomer. In agreement with this observation, the mass calculated from MALLS analysis was 31,650 Da (Fig. 1A). This is slightly larger than that predicted for the extracellular domain based on amino acid sequence (23,980 Da) but agrees well with the mass estimated from SDS-PAGE analysis. This discrepancy is attributable to the presence of multiple N-linked glycan moieties that are visible at three of the five predicted NX(S/T) sites (Asn54, Asn115, and Asn130). Accordingly, m04 is monomeric in solution, although we cannot exclude the possibility of dimer formation at higher protein concentrations or on the cell surface. The core of the m04 molecule comprises an 11-stranded antiparallel beta sandwich (Fig. 1B) with overall dimensions of ≈ 50 × 35 × 30 Å. The strand assignment and their arrangement into sheets are shown in Fig. 1C. The two β-sheets that make up the sandwich are curved in appearance and comprise four and seven β-strands (sheet 1: BCHG, sheet 2: AA′IDEE′F). Because strands A and E are interrupted by short bulged regions, we have denoted the two parts as A/E and A′/E′. Because of this discontinuity, the width of sheet 2 is limited to five β-strands (Fig. 1C). The overall fold of the β-sandwich is similar to that of the immunoglobulin superfamily; strands A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I correspond to strands G, A, B, C, C′, C″, D, E, and F in an immunoglobulin variable domain (Ig-V). Moreover, the classical hallmark of an Ig domain, a single disulfide bond that connects the B and F strands, is present in an analogous location in m04 and is derived from Cys46 and Cys141 in the C-D loop and I strands, respectively. In addition to the Ig core, m04 contains a number of extended loops and three short 310 helices located between the D-E, F-G, and H-I strands. Moreover, the m04 C terminus contains a bent α-helix of 12 amino acids in length that sits in a concave surface formed by the A′ and I strands and the C-D loop (Fig. 1B). The presence of this helix (termed α4) gives the part of the molecule distal to the Ig domain a “mini platform”-like appearance, in which the C-D loop lies in-between and parallel to the E-F loop and α4 helix and is supported by the AA′IDEE′F sheet (Fig. 1D). Although the core of m04 is rich in hydrophobic residues (discussed below), the surface of the molecule is primarily basic in nature, reflecting its relatively high theoretical isoelectric point (9.03) (Fig. 2A). The three N-linked glycosylation sites lay in a linear arrangement along a basic strip derived from arginine residues at positions 20 and 88 and lysines at positions 18, 106, and 108. One of the glycosylation sites (at Asn54) is present in a loop that is in a homologous location to complementarity determining region 1 of the Ig-V domain. A hydrophobic patch comprising Ile90, Leu91, and Phe93 is solvent-exposed on the outer face of the AA′IDEE′F sheet (Fig. 2B). Such surface-exposed hydrophobic residues are often considered to be involved in protein-protein interactions (22.Pang S.S. Berry R. Chen Z. Kjer-Nielsen L. Perugini M.A. King G.F. Wang C. Chew S.H. La Gruta N.L. Williams N.K. Beddoe T. Tiganis T. Cowieson N.P. Godfrey D.I. Purcell A.W. Wilce M.C. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. The structural basis for autonomous dimerization of the pre-T-cell antigen receptor.Nature. 2010; 467: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results of a Dali search (23.Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) to identify proteins of similar structure to m04 is highly populated by Ig-V domain-containing proteins such as antibodies, T-cell receptor chains, and MHC-I molecules. The sequence conservation between m04 and Ig-V domain containing proteins is typically low (the top 100 Dali results range from 6 to 15% sequence identity). The top Dali “hit” was the variable domain from the heavy chain of an antibody Fab fragment (Protein Data Bank code 2W9D), which has a Z-score of 4.6 and possesses an root mean square deviation of 3.7 Å over 85 aligned Cα atoms. Although the β-strand topology is similar, only the A′, C, D, and I strands of m04 superpose well, with the remainder of the secondary structure elements being tilted, translated, or absent (Fig. 3A). Moreover, m04 possesses a number of atypical features that are not normally associated with Ig-V domains. In particular, the N-terminal A/A′ strands occupy a position normally associated with the G-strand in an Ig-V domain, a topology that is unique to m04. This association is strengthened by an additional disulfide bond connecting Cys25 of the A′ strand to Cys146 of the I strand. Another peculiar feature of the A′ strand is that it leads almost immediately into a truncated B strand on the opposing sheet. Such an arrangement is reminiscent of that found in the H-type Ig fold where the D strand is a direct continuation of the C′ strand (24.Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. The immunoglobulin fold. Structural classification, sequence patterns and common core.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the termini, the length and nature of the interconnecting loops deviates considerably from those found in the classical antibody Ig-V domains. For the most part, these loops are extended, as is evident in the large spacing (98 residues) between Cys46 and Cys141 that make up the canonical disulfide bond (Fig. 3B). This distance is considerably larger than the 63–76 residues that are typically found within the disulfide bridge of Ig-V domains (25.Smith D.K. Xue H. Sequence profiles of immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 530-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Much of the additional length is derived from the E′-F and F-G loops, the latter of which deviates around the molecule to pack on top of the short E-strand. These two loops are the most flexible regions of the structure with average side chain B-factors of 119 (residues 93–106) and 110 (residues 114–119), respectively. Thus, m04 possesses a number of unique features in comparison with other members of the Ig-V superfamily. The m02 family members contain a number of conserved motifs that include a CXLXXC(L/P)(W/R)o motif found in m02–m06 and a NAXWXX(E/H)Wo motif found in m03–m06. Our structure permitted a detailed understanding of the role of these motifs, as well as providing insight into the structure of other m02 family members. Surprisingly, despite being well separated in the m04 primary structure, the CXLXXC(L/P)(W/R)o and NAXWXX(E/H)Wo motifs are intimately associated in the tertiary structure. Although the former occupies the majority of the I strand, the latter encompasses the entire length of the adjacent D strand (Fig. 4A). Of particular prominence are the two Trp residues present in the NAXWXX(E/H)Wo motif. Each of these residues assembles a myriad of hydrophobic residues to form two large but separate clusters that lie at the core of the Ig domain and mini platform regions. The first of these, Trp57 is located near the base of the D-strand and projects upwards toward the C-D loop (Fig. 4B). In doing so, Trp57 makes extensive van der Waals interactions with Leu143 and Met145 from the CXLXXC(L/P)(W/R)o motif, as well as Leu48, Pro49, and Val51 from the C-D loop, Tyr76 and Ser78 from the D-strand, and Pro84 from the D-E loop. The second tryptophan (Trp61) is located near the N terminus of the D-strand and is similarly surrounded by an array of hydrophobic side chains emanating from no less than seven separate β-strands (Fig. 4C) that include the C- (Leu44), D- (Leu59), E- (Val70), G- (Val113), H- (Leu125) and I-strands (Val139). A lone hydrogen bond to Ser74 is the only side chain-derived polar contact of note in the vicinity. Thus, these two motifs act to stabilize the three-dimensional scaffold of m04. The m04 structure now provides an opportunity to establish a structural correlation between m02 family members. Although m02–m06 form a more closely related subclass within the m02 superfamily, m07–m16 also possess some re"

The etiology of and optimum therapy options for this disorder have been much discussed and have been the subject of many publications. One much discussed therapy option is laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP). Despite conflicting opinions and guidelines which recommend that it should not be used, it remains in use. Patients who had previously undergone this procedure were invited for follow-up appointments, at which they were asked to complete a questionnaire, underwent an ENT examination and underwent sleep laboratory analysis using a portable sleep lab device. The average time since LAUP treatment was 11 years. The cohort comprised 25 patients. The average preoperative apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) score was 25.25/h; the average postoperative AHI score 23.62/h. Closer examination of our data enabled us to identify 10 responders (40%) and 15 non-responders (60%). 12% (3/25) of non-responders experienced either no reduction in their AHI score or an increase compared to their preoperative AHI score of less than 5/h. In the remaining 48% (12/25), AHI increased by more than 5/h compared to the preoperative figure. Our questionnaire showed that 40% (10/25) of patients suffered from dry mouth and 20% (5/25) from foreign body sensation. The data led us to conclude that laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty can indeed result in a reduction in AHI score comparable to other mucosal resection methods. Also in common with these methods, the efficacy of the therapy reduces with time and the procedure carries a high risk of bringing about an increase in the patient's AHI score."
https://openalex.org/W2144454360,"Dicer is required for the maturation of microRNA, and loss of Dicer and miRNA processing has been found to alter numerous biological events during embryogenesis, including the development of mammalian skin and hair. We have previously examined the role of miRNA biogenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and found that deletion of Dicer induces cell senescence regulated, in part, by the p53 tumor suppressor. Although Dicer and miRNA molecules are thought to have either oncogenic or tumor suppressing roles in various types of cancer, a role for Dicer and miRNAs in skin carcinogenesis has not been established. Here we show that perinatal ablation of Dicer in the skin of mice leads to loss of fur in adult mice, increased epidermal cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the accumulation of widespread DNA damage in epidermal cells. Co-ablation of Dicer and p53 did not alter the timing or extent of fur loss, but greatly reduced survival of Dicer-skin ablated mice, as these mice developed multiple and highly aggressive skin carcinomas. Our results describe a new mouse model for spontaneous basal and squamous cell tumorigenesis. Furthermore, our findings reveal that loss of Dicer in the epidermis induces extensive DNA damage, activation of the DNA damage response and p53-dependent apoptosis, and that Dicer and p53 cooperate to suppress mammalian skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2040790669,"Oral candidiasis is closely associated with changes in the oral fungal flora and is caused primarily by Candida albicans. Conventional methods of fungal culture are time-consuming and not always conclusive. However, molecular genetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of fungal rRNA is rapid, reproducible and simple to perform. In this study we examined the fungal flora in patients with oral candidiasis and investigated changes in the flora after antifungal treatment using length heterogeneity-polymerization chain reaction (LH-PCR) analysis of ITS regions. Fifty-two patients with pseudomembranous oral candidiasis (POC) and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. Fungal DNA from oral rinse was examined for fungal species diversity by LH-PCR. Fungal populations were quantified by real-time PCR and previously-unidentified signals were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Relationships between the oral fungal flora and treatment-resistant factors were also examined. POC patients showed significantly more fungal species and a greater density of fungi than control individuals. Sixteen fungi were newly identified. The fungal populations from both groups were composed predominantly of C. albicans, though the ratio of C. dubliniensis was significantly higher in POC patients than in controls. The diversity and density of fungi were significantly reduced after treatment. Furthermore, fungal diversity and the proportion of C. dubliniensis were positively correlated with treatment duration. These results suggest that C. dubliniensis and high fungal flora diversity might be involved in the pathogenesis of oral candidiasis. We therefore conclude that LH-PCR is a useful technique for diagnosing and assessing the severity of oral candidal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2064481714,"An electricity demand reduction project based on comprehensive residential consumer engagement was established within an Australian community in 2008. By 2011, both the peak demand and grid supplied electricity consumption had decreased to below pre-intervention levels. This case study research explored the relationship developed between the utility, community and individual consumer from the residential customer perspective through qualitative research of 22 residential households. It is proposed that an energy utility can be highly successful at peak demand reduction by becoming a community member and a peer to residential consumers and developing the necessary trust, access, influence and partnership required to create the responsive environment to change. A peer-community approach could provide policymakers with a pathway for implementing pro-environmental behaviour for low carbon communities, as well as peak demand reduction, thereby addressing government emission targets while limiting the cost of living increases from infrastructure expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2093855751,"Athletes who aim to improve both muscular endurance and power often perform exercises that involve similar joint actions under different lifting conditions, such as changes in the load or speed, which are implemented at different times during a periodized exercise program or simultaneously. The prescribed exercises are considered to recruit the same muscles even if the lifting conditions differ to each other. The present study aimed to clarify this by examining whether the recruitment of individual hip and knee muscles during the squat exercise differs between lifting conditions adopted for muscular endurance and power training regimens. Moderately trained men performed back squats (BS), with a load of approximately 60% of one repetition maximum, as a muscular endurance training exercise, and they performed plyometric squat jumping (PSJ) for power training. During each exercise, the lower limb joint torques and the recruitment of five hip and knee muscles were determined with inverse-dynamics and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. While the maximal and mean knee joint torques were greater during PSJ than during BS (p<0.01), the T2 values for the quadriceps femoris muscle did not differ between the exercises. In contrast, the T2 values of the gluteus maximus and hip adductor muscles were higher during PSJ (p<0.05) than during BS, although there was no significant difference in the mean hip extension torque between the two exercises. The current results indicate that the individual use of the agonist muscles differs between BS and PSJ, and it does not always correspond with the joint kinetics during the exercises. Therefore, in addition to the exercise type, the lifting condition should also be taken into consideration as a determinant of the major muscles trained during a resistance exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2045527985,"Three H9N2 avian influenza viruses were isolated from the Dongting Lake wetland, among which one was from fresh egret feces, the other two were from chicken cloacal swabs in poultry markets. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that eight genes of the egret-derived H9N2 virus might come from Korean-like or American-like lineages. The two poultry-derived H9N2 viruses were reassortants between the CK/BJ/94-like and G1-like viruses. Except the PB1 genes (90.6%), the nucleotide sequence of other internal genes of the two viruses exhibited high homology (>95%). In addition, they also exhibited high homology (96–98.3%) with some genes of the H7N9 virus that caused an epidemic in China in 2013. Nucleotide sequence of the poultry-derived and egret-derived H9N2 viruses shared low homology. Infection studies showed that the egret-derived H9N2 virus was non-pathogenic to both mice and chickens, and the virus was unable to infect chickens even through 8 passages continuously in the lung. On the other hand, the chickens infected by poultry-derived viruses showed obvious clinical symptoms and even died; the infected mice showed no noticeable clinical symptoms and weight loss, but viruses could be detected in their lungs. In conclusion, for the egret-derived H9N2 virus, it would take a long adaptation process to achieve cross-species transmission in poultry and mammals. H9N2 viruses isolated at different times from the same host species in the same geographical region presented different evolutionary status, and virus isolated from different hosts in the same geographical region exhibited genetic diversity. Therefore, it is important to continue the H9N2 virus surveillance for understanding their evolutionary trends so as to provide guidance for disease control and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2025336241,"We recently reported exchange of membrane and cytoplasmic markers between SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells and human gingival fibroblasts (h-GF) without comparable exchange of nuclear markers, while similar h-GF exchange was seen for melanoma and ovarian carcinoma cells. This process of “cellular sipping” changes phenotype such that cells sharing markers of both SAOS-2 and h-GF have morphology intermediate to that of either cell population cultured alone, evidencing increased tumour cell diversity without genetic change. TNF-α increases cellular sipping between h-GF and SAOS-2, and we here study binding of SAOS-2 to TNF-α treated h-GF to determine if increased cellular sipping can be accounted for by cytokine stimulated SAOS-2 binding. More SAOS-2 bound h-GF pe-seeded wells than culture plastic alone (p<0.001), and this was increased by h-GF pre-treatment with TNF-α (p<0.001). TNF-α stimulated binding was dose dependent and maximal at 1.16nM (p<0.05) with no activity below 0.006 nM. SAOS-2 binding to h-GF was independent of serum, while the lipopolysaccharide antagonist Polymyxin B did not affect results, and TNF-α activity was lost on boiling. h-GF binding of SAOS-2 started to increase after 30min TNF-α stimulation and was maximal by 1.5hr pre-treatment (p<0.001). h-GF retained maximal binding up to 6hrs after TNF-α stimulation, but this was lost by 18hrs (p<0.001). FACS analysis demonstrated increased ICAM-1 consistent with the time course of SAOS-2 binding, while antibody against ICAM-1 inhibited SAOS-2 adhesion (p<0.04). Pre-treating SAOS-2 with TNF-α reduced h-GF binding to background levels (p<0.003), and this opposite effect to h-GF cytokine stimulation suggests that the history of cytokine exposure of malignant cells migrating across different microenvironments can influence subsequent interactions with fibroblasts. Since cytokine stimulated binding was comparable in magnitude to earlier reported TNF-α stimulated cellular sipping, we conclude that TNF-α stimulated cellular sipping likely reflects increased SAOS-2 binding as opposed to enhanced exchange mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2039442540,"Acid mine drainage (AMD) was the main environmental problem facing the mining industry. For AMD had high heavy metals content and low pH, the compacted sewage sludge might be a barrier for tailings whose oxidation and weathering produced AMD, with its own carbon source, microorganism reduction ability and impermeability. To study the heavy metals environmental risk, under the simulate AMD, the deionized water (DW), and the pH 2.1 sulfuric acid water (SA) seepage conditions, respectively, the changes of the chemical speciation of heavy metals Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn and total organic carbon (TOC) content in the compacted sewage sludge were assessed in the different periods. The results indicated according to the distribution of heavy metals, the potential mobility was for Cd: 6.08 under AMD, 7.48 under SA, ∞ under DW; for Cu: 0.08 under AMD, 0.17 under SA, 0.59 under DW; for Fe: 0.15 under AMD, 0.22 under SA, 0.22 under DW; for Ni: 2.60 under AMD, 1.69 under SA, 1.67 under DW; and for Zn: 0.15 under AMD, 0.23 under SA and 0.21 under DW at the second checking time. TOC content firstly decreased from 67.62±0% to 66.29±0.35%, then increased to 67.74±0.65% under the AMD seepage while TOC decreased to 63.30±0.53%, then to 61.33±0.37% under the DW seepage, decreased to 63.86±0.41%, then to 63.28±0.49% under SA seepage. That indicated under the AMD seepage, the suitable microorganisms communities in the compacted sewage sludge were activated. And the heavy metals environmental risk of compacted sewage sludge was lower with AMD condition than with other two. So the compacted sewage sludge as a barrier for tailings was feasible as the aspect of environmental risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2073562156,"Background Chagas disease patients with right bundle-branch block (RBBB) have diverse clinical presentation and prognosis, depending on left ventricular (LV) function. Autonomic disorder can be an early marker of heart involvement. The heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise may identify autonomic dysfunction, with impact on therapeutic strategies. This study was designed to assess the HRR after symptom-limited exercise testing in asymptomatic Chagas disease patients with RBBB without ventricular dysfunction compared to patients with indeterminate form of Chagas disease and healthy controls. Methods One hundred and forty-nine subjects divided into 3 groups were included. A control group was comprised of healthy individuals; group 1 included patients in the indeterminate form of Chagas disease; and group 2 included patients with complete RBBB with or without left anterior hemiblock, and normal ventricular systolic function. A symptom-limited exercise test was performed and heart rate (HR) response to exercise was assessed. HRR was defined as the difference between HR at peak exercise and 1 min following test termination. Results There were no differences in heart-rate profile during exercise between healthy individuals and patients in indeterminate form, whereas patients with RBBB had more prevalence of chronotropic incompetence, lower exercise capacity and lower HRR compared with patients in indeterminate form and controls. A delayed decrease in the HR after exercise was found in 17 patients (15%), 9% in indeterminate form and 24% with RBBB, associated with older age, worse functional capacity, impaired chronotropic response, and ventricular arrhythmias during both exercise and recovery. By multivariable analysis, the independent predictors of a delayed decrease in the HRR were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.21; p = 0.010) and presence of RBBB (OR 3.97; 95% CI 1.05 to 15.01; p = 0.042). Conclusions A small proportion (15%) of asymptomatic Chagas patients had attenuated HRR after exercise, being more prevalent in patients with RBBB compared with patients in indeterminate form and controls."
https://openalex.org/W1990045169,"The transcriptional repressor BCL6 plays an essential role in the development of germinal center B cells and follicular helper T cells. However, much less is known about the expression and function of BCL6 in other cell types. Here we report that during murine dendritic cell (DC) ontogeny in vivo, BCL6 is not expressed in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, common DC precursors and committed precursors of conventional DCs (pre-cDCs), but is elevated in peripheral pre-cDCs. BCL6 protein levels rise as pre-cDCs differentiate into cDCs in secondary lymphoid organs. Elevated protein levels of Bcl6 are observed in all cDC subsets, with CD8α+ cDCs displaying the greatest levels. Co-staining of Ki-67 revealed BCL6hi cDCs to be more proliferative than BCL6lo cDCs. After adjuvant inoculation, BCL6 levels are significantly reduced in the CD11cint MHC class IIhi CD86hi cDCs. Activation-induced BCL6 reduction correlated with reduced proliferation. A LPS injection study further confirmed that, in response to microbial stimuli, BCL6 levels are dynamically regulated during the maturation of CD11cint MHC class IIhi splenic cDCs. This reduction of BCL6 levels in cDCs does not occur after LPS injection in MyD88-/- TRIF-/- mice. Thus, regulation of Bcl6 protein levels is dynamic in murine cDCs during development, maturation and activation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2005629256,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a global health burden particularly in Egypt, where HCV genotype 4a (GT-4a) predominates. The prevention and control of HCV infection will remain a challenge until the development of an effective vaccine that protects against different genotypes. Several HCV GT-1-based vaccines are in different stages of clinical trials, but antigenic differences could make protection against other genotypes problematic. In this regard, data comparing the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response to different HCV genotypes are limited. We aimed to ex vivo investigate whether GT-1-based vaccine may protect against HCV GT-4 infections. This was carried out on samples collected from genotype 4 infected/exposed subjects.The CMI responses of 35 subjects; infected with HCV GT-4/or who had spontaneously-resolved the infection and 10 healthy control subjects; to two sets of seven HCV overlapping 15-mer peptide pools derived from both genotypes; and covering most of the viral proteins; were evaluated. This was carried out using an interferon gamma (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 17 subjects (48%) responded to at least one peptide pool derived from GT-1b/GT-4a with 13 subjects responding to peptide pools from both genotypes. A strong correlation was found in the responses to both genotypes (r = 0.82, p<0.001; 95% confidence interval = 0.562-0.933). The average IFNγ total spot forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMC (±SE) from the responding subjects for GT-1b and GT-4a was 216±56 and 199±55, respectively (p = 0.833). Also, there were no significant differences between those who cleared their HCV infection or who remained HCV-RNA positive (p = 0.8).Our data suggest that an effective GT-1b vaccine could protect from GT-4a infection. These data could help in HCV rationale vaccine design and efficacy studies and further our understanding of HCV cross protection against different genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1983184801,"The involvement of PISTILLATA (PI) and APETALA (AP) transcription factors in the development of floral organs has previously been elucidated but little is known about their upstream regulation. In this investigation, two novel mutants generated in Papaver somniferum were analyzed - one with partially petaloid sepals and another having sepaloid petals. Progeny from reciprocal crosses of respective mutant parent genotypes showed a good fit to the monogenic Mendelian inheritance model, indicating that the mutant traits are likely controlled by the single, recessive nuclear genes named “Pps-1” and “OM” in the partially petaloid sepal and sepaloid petal phenotypes, respectively. Both paralogs of PISTILLATA (PapsPI-1 and PapsPI-3) were obtained from the sepals and petals of P. somniferum. Ectopic expression of PapsPI-1 in tobacco resulted in a partially petaloid sepal phenotype at a low frequency. Upregulation of PapsPI-1 and PapsAP3-1 in the petal and the petal part of partially petaloid sepal mutant and down-regulation of the same in sepaloid petal mutant indicates a differential pattern of regulation for flowering-related genes in various whorls. Similarly, it was found that the recessive mutation OM in sepaloid petal mutant downregulates PapsPI-1 and PapsAP3-1 transcripts. The recessive nature of the mutations was confirmed by the segregation ratios obtained in this analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2005054337,"Cocaine dependence involves in the brain's reward circuit as well as nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key region of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Many studies have documented altered expression of genes and identified transcription factor networks and epigenetic processes that are fundamental to cocaine addiction. However, all these investigations have focused on mRNA and/or miRNA, which may not reflect the involvement of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which has been implied in a broad range of biological processes and complex diseases including brain development and neuropathologocal process. To further address the role of snoRNA in cocaine addiction, we show that repeated exposure and conditioned place preference (CPP) training to cocaine negatively regulates the expression of MBII-52 mRNA level, which is a brain-specific C/D box snoRNA, but not influences the serotonin receptor 2C (5HT2CR) mRNA level in NAc. Furthemore, we show, developing lentiviral vector (LV)-expressing MBII-52 and LV-5HT2CR for stable and regulatable MBII-52 and LV-5HT2CR expression. LV-MBII-52 and LV-5HT2CR expression in NAc attenuate cocaine induced CPP and locomotor activity. Taken together, these findings show that MBII-52 and 5HT2CR exert an inhibitory influence on the behavioral responses to cocaine exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2023785240,"The function of a newly sequenced gene can be discovered by determining its sequence homology with known proteins. BLAST is the most extensively used sequence analysis program for sequence similarity search in large databases of sequences. With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies it has now become possible to study genes and their expression at a genome-wide scale through RNA-seq and metagenome sequencing experiments. Functional annotation of all the genes is done by sequence similarity search against multiple protein databases. This annotation task is computationally very intensive and can take days to obtain complete results. The program mpiBLAST, an open-source parallelization of BLAST that achieves superlinear speedup, can be used to accelerate large-scale annotation by using supercomputers and high performance computing (HPC) clusters. Although many parallel bioinformatics applications using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) are available in the public domain, researchers are reluctant to use them due to lack of expertise in the Linux command line and relevant programming experience. With these limitations, it becomes difficult for biologists to use mpiBLAST for accelerating annotation. No web interface is available in the open-source domain for mpiBLAST. We have developed WImpiBLAST, a user-friendly open-source web interface for parallel BLAST searches. It is implemented in Struts 1.3 using a Java backbone and runs atop the open-source Apache Tomcat Server. WImpiBLAST supports script creation and job submission features and also provides a robust job management interface for system administrators. It combines script creation and modification features with job monitoring and management through the Torque resource manager on a Linux-based HPC cluster. Use case information highlights the acceleration of annotation analysis achieved by using WImpiBLAST. Here, we describe the WImpiBLAST web interface features and architecture, explain design decisions, describe workflows and provide a detailed analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1993001623,"Clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between elevated levels of FIX and the risk of coronary heart disease, while reduced plasma FIX causes hemophilia B. FIXa interacts with FVIIIa in the presence of Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing membranes to form a factor X-activating complex (Xase) that is key to propagation of the initiated blood coagulation process in human. We test the hypothesis that PS in these membranes up-regulates the catalytic activity of this essential enzyme. We used a soluble form of phosphatidylserine, 1, 2-dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (C6PS), as a tool to do so. C6PS and PS in membranes are reported to regulate the homologous FXa nearly identically. FIXa binds a molecule of C6PS at each of with two sites with such different affinities (∼100-fold) that these appear to be independent. A high affinity C6PS binding site (Kd∼1.4 µM) regulates structure, whereas a low-affinity binding site (Kd∼140 µM) regulates activity. Equilibrium dialysis experiments were analyzed globally with four other data sets (proteolytic and amidolytic activities, intrinsic fluorescence, ellipticity) to unequivocally demonstrate stoichiometries of one for both sites. Michaelis-Menten parameters for FIXa proteolytic activity were the same in the presence of C6PS or PS/PC membranes. We conclude that the PS molecule and not a membrane surface is the key regulator of both factors Xa and IXa. Despite some minor differences in the details of regulation of factors Xa and IXa, the similarities we found suggest that lipid regulation of these two proteases may be similar, a hypothesis that we continue to test."
https://openalex.org/W2135987881,"Objective To demonstrate the application of causal inference methods to observational data in the obstetrics and gynecology field, particularly causal modeling and semi-parametric estimation. Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women are at increased risk for cervical cancer and its treatable precursors. Determining whether potential risk factors such as hormonal contraception are true causes is critical for informing public health strategies as longevity increases among HIV-positive women in developing countries. Methods We developed a causal model of the factors related to combined oral contraceptive (COC) use and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater (CIN2+) and modified the model to fit the observed data, drawn from women in a cervical cancer screening program at HIV clinics in Kenya. Assumptions required for substantiation of a causal relationship were assessed. We estimated the population-level association using semi-parametric methods: g-computation, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Results We identified 2 plausible causal paths from COC use to CIN2+: via HPV infection and via increased disease progression. Study data enabled estimation of the latter only with strong assumptions of no unmeasured confounding. Of 2,519 women under 50 screened per protocol, 219 (8.7%) were diagnosed with CIN2+. Marginal modeling suggested a 2.9% (95% confidence interval 0.1%, 6.9%) increase in prevalence of CIN2+ if all women under 50 were exposed to COC; the significance of this association was sensitive to method of estimation and exposure misclassification. Conclusion Use of causal modeling enabled clear representation of the causal relationship of interest and the assumptions required to estimate that relationship from the observed data. Semi-parametric estimation methods provided flexibility and reduced reliance on correct model form. Although selected results suggest an increased prevalence of CIN2+ associated with COC, evidence is insufficient to conclude causality. Priority areas for future studies to better satisfy causal criteria are identified."

These preliminary results encourage further research into changes in the embedding dimension as generic markers of an approaching transition point."
https://openalex.org/W2029935590,"Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) is a promising alternative treatment strategy for end-stage liver diseases compared with orthotopic liver transplantation. A limitation for this approach is the low engraftment of donor cells. The deletion of the I-kappa B kinase-regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO in hepatocytes prevents nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and triggers spontaneous liver apoptosis, chronic hepatitis and the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We hypothesized that NEMOΔhepa mice may therefore serve as an experimental model to study HT.Pre-conditioned NEMOΔhepa mice were transplanted with donor-hepatocytes from wildtype (WT) and mice deficient for the pro-apoptotic mediator Caspase-8 (Casp8Δhepa).Transplantation of isolated WT-hepatocytes into pre-conditioned NEMOΔhepa mice resulted in a 6-7 fold increase of donor cells 12 weeks after HT, while WT-recipients showed no liver repopulation. The use of apoptosis-resistant Casp8Δhepa-derived donor cells further enhanced the selection 3-fold after 12-weeks and up to 10-fold increase after 52 weeks compared with WT donors. While analysis of NEMOΔhepa mice revealed strong liver injury, HT-recipient NEMOΔhepa mice showed improved liver morphology and decrease in serum transaminases. Concomitant with these findings, the histological examination elicited an improved liver tissue architecture associated with significantly lower levels of apoptosis, decreased proliferation and a lesser amount of liver fibrogenesis. Altogether, our data clearly support the therapeutic benefit of the HT procedure into NEMOΔhepa mice.This study demonstrates the feasibility of the NEMOΔhepa mouse as an in vivo tool to study liver repopulation after HT. The improvement of the characteristic phenotype of chronic liver injury in NEMOΔhepa mice after HT suggests the therapeutic potential of HT in liver diseases with a chronic inflammatory phenotype and opens a new door for the applicability of this technique to combat liver disease in the human clinic."
