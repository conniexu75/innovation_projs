https://openalex.org/W2168422276,"The Neisseria gonorrhoeae pilus protein is one of the major antigenic determinants on the cell's surface. It is comprised of identical subunits of approximately 18 kd and plays a role in the infectivity and virulence of the organism. We have cloned the gene encoding a gonococcal pilus protein into Escherichia coli, and, using one of these clones as a probe in hybridization studies, we have shown that conversion of the pilus positive to pilus negative state in N. gonorrhoeae involves chromosomal rearrangement. Although the pilus protein is produced by E. coli, it does not appear to be assembled on the surface of the cell in native form."
https://openalex.org/W1490295223,"Purified actin and microtubule proteins polymerized together form a gel, while mixtures of actin with tubulin polymers lacking microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have low viscosities close to the sum of the viscosities of the constituents. Mixtures of actin and MAPs also have high viscosities. Our interpretation of these observations was that there is interaction of actin filaments and microtubules which is mediated by MAPs (Griffith, L. M., and Pollard, T. D. (1978) J. Cell Biol. 78, 958-965). We report here further evidence for this interaction. 1) Actin filaments and microtubules can form gels at physiological ionic strength providing the anion is glutamate rather than chloride. Both glutamate and chloride inhibit actin-MAPs interaction, but this is compensated for in glutamate where the microtubules are longer than in chloride. 2) The low shear viscosity of mixtures of isolated MAPs and actin filaments is enhanced by acidic pH and inhibited by high ionic strength. 3) MAPs can be fractionated to yield four different fractions with actin cross-linking activity: a subset of high molecular weight MAPs, purified MAP-2 and two different fractions of tau polypeptides. 4) We have reconstituted a gel from actin, purified tubulin, and whole MAPs, but have not yet been successful with actin, purified tubulin, and any single purified MAP."

https://openalex.org/W1641342338,"Both the light-stimulated cGMP phosphodiesterase of retinal rod outer segments (ROS) and hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase are regulated by guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (N). Transducin serves as the signal-carrying regulatory protein in ROS, and the N protein (also called G or G/F) performs this role in the adenylate cyclase system. The GTP form of these regulatory proteins activates the corresponding enzyme, whereas the GDP form does not. Both transducin and the N protein possess a GTPase activity that restores the regulatory protein to the unstimulated state. Cholera enterotoxin catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to the N protein, which inhibits its GTPase activity and activates adenylate cyclase. We report here that the toxin also catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of transducin in ROS membranes. This modification of the guanine nucleotide-binding subunit of transducin is markedly enhanced by the bleaching of rhodopsin and by the addition of guanosine-5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate. In contrast, GDP, GTP, and guanosine-5'-(3-O)thiotriphosphate inhibit the reaction, while GMP and ATP have no effect. Under optimal conditions, toxin catalyzes labeling of 0.7 mol of the alpha-subunit of transducin/mol of bound [3H]guanosine-5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate and causes 70% inhibition of the light-dependent GTPase activity of transducin in ROS. These results indicate close functional homology between transducin of ROS and the N protein of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W105256667,"A kinetic characterization of the regulation of purified soluble guanylate cyclase from bovine lung by protoporphyrin M and hematin is reported. Purified guanylate cyclase was isolated with heme and had specific activities @mol of cGMP/min/mg of protein) of 0.1-0.2 and 0.3-0.6 in the presence of excess MgGTP and MnGTP, respectively, in the absence of added activators. Protoporphyrin IX, nitric oxide (NO), and NOheme increased the V,, up to 40-fold and decreased the K,,, for GTP (from 100 to 45-55 p~) in the presence of excess Mgâ€™. However, in the presence of excess Mn2+ the V,, was increased only slightly and the K, for GTP was unchanged. Protoporphyrin IX resembled NO and NO-heme also in lowering the K, and Ki for uncomplexed metal. This close similarity in the interactions of these activators with guanylate cyclase suggests that a common form of activated enzyme is generated. Hematin, in excess of 1.5 p~, inhibited guanylate cyclase activity. Smaller concentrations of hematin competitively inhibited protoporphyrin IX (KI = 0.35 p~), suggesting that both porphyrins compete for a common binding site on guanylate cyclase. The apparent K, for protoporphyrin IX (8-38 n~) varied directly as a function of the guanylate cyclase concentration under the assay conditions employed. The equilibrium dissociation constant of the guanylate cyclase-protoporphyrin IX complex was estimated by Scatchard analysis to be 1.4 n~. The stoichiometry of binding was estimated to be 0.92 mol/mol of holoenzyme. Cyanide and certain oxidants inhibited guanylate cyclase activation by NO, NO-heme, and nitroso compounds without affecting activation by protoporphyrin IX or unactivated enzyme. These observations suggest that protoporphyrin IX, NO-heme, and perhaps other activators regulate guanylate cyclase by similar mechanisms. Moreover, protoporphyrin IX and heme may be important biological regulators of guanylate cyclase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1535851215,"Phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chains of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) from turkey gizzards results in a large increase in the actin-activated MgATPase activity over that observed with unphosphorylated HMM. In an attempt to define which step in the kinetic cycle is affected by phosphorylation, we have measured the binding of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated HMM to actin in the presence of ATP using sedimentation. There was only a 4-fold difference in the actin binding constants of unphosphorylated HMM (5.35 x 10(3) M-1) and fully phosphorylated HMM (2.35 x 10(4) M-1). In contrast, the maximum rate of the actin-activated MgATPase activity (Vmax) of phosphorylated HMM was 25 times greater than that for unphosphorylated HMM. These data rule out a mechanism whereby the unphosphorylated light chain of myosin regulates actin-myosin interaction by directly or indirectly blocking the binding of HMM to actin. This implies that some step in the kinetic cycle other than the binding of HMM to actin must be regulated. We have also measured the rate constant for ATP hydrolysis (the initial phosphate burst) under the same conditions and found that this step was very fast compared to the steady state ATPase rate and was unaffected by phosphorylation. This suggests that the step which is regulated by phosphorylation is either phosphate release or a step preceding phosphate release but following ATP hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1580354352,"Guanylate cyclase in neuroblastoma N1E 115 cells was readily solubilized upon homogenization of the cells with hypotonic buffer. When the supernatant was passed through cation exchangers such as a Chelex 100 Na+ column, the guanylate cyclase activity in the effluent fraction decreased to 4-6% of the original supernatant. The addition of the acid extract of neuroblastoma cells or rat tissues to the effluent restored guanylate cyclase activity, indicating that the supernatant of neuroblastoma cells contained an acid-soluble endogenous activator for guanylate cyclase which was adsorbed on cation exchangers. The activator was purified from rat brain and identified as L-arginine by 13C- and 1H-NMR spectroscopy and paper partition chromatography. L-Arginine, at a concentration of 1-2 x 10(-5) M, stimulated guanylate cyclase activity in the effluent fraction 15-25-fold, whereas D-arginine and other basic L-amino acids were ineffective. Peptides that contained L-arginine at the NH2- or COOH-terminal also resulted in an activation of guanylate cyclase to the extent similar to that of L-arginine, while peptides that contained L-arginine inside the peptide chain failed to stimulate the activity. The activation of L-arginine seemed to operate by a mechanism similar to that induced by nitroso compounds."

The density of labeling of the B, A, and D cells with each labeled ligand correlated well with the known actions of the three hormones on each of the islet cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521164056,"Opiates and opioid peptides inhibit adenylate cyclase and stimulate specific low Km GTPase activity in membranes from neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells. The effects of opiate agonists on both enzymes are mediated by high affinity stereospecific receptors and require Mg2+, GTP, and Na+. In the presence of Mg2+, Na+ inhibits basal GTPase activity; opiates stimulate GTP hydrolysis by antagonizing the Na+-induced inhibition. Activation of GTPase leads, in turn, to inactivation of GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. The intrinsic activities (or efficacies) of a series of opiates are identical for stimulation of GTPase and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. These results provide a mechanism for the dual requirement for Na+ and GTP in the inhibitory coupling of opiate receptors to the adenylate cyclase system in these cells and may be of general significance to the action of other inhibitory hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1517596202,"Suspension cultures of purified bovine adrenal chromaffin cells incorporated 32P from exogenous 32Pi into a protein of approximately M4 = 60,000 (isolated by discontinuous, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis). Phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase, purified from chromaffin cell supernatants by immunoprecipitation, co-migrated with the Mr = 60,000 band. Tryptic fragments prepared fom either the Mr congruent to 60,000 band or the immunoprecipitated tyrosine hydroxylase band were analyzed after separation with two-dimensional electrophoresis/chromatography. Two distinct 32P-peptides were present in either sample. After a 2-3-min lag period. 32P incorporation into both peptides was relatively linear with time for at least 20 min. In the presence of calcium, exogenous acetylcholine (100 microM) increased 32P incorporation into both of the 32P-labeled tryptic peptides whereas 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) increased 32P incorporation into only one of the two. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and MnCl2 inhibited the acetylcholine-induced phosphorylation of both tryptic peptides. Thus, tyrosine hydroxylase is phosphorylated in situ at more than one site, and the phosphorylation of these sites is affected differently by acetylcholine and 8-bromo-cAMP. The data imply that kinase activity other than (or in addition to) cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity attends tyrosine hydroxylase in the intact chromaffin cells and that multiple kinase activities may be involved in the short term regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis by afferent activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559083422,"Selenium deficiency and vitamin E deficiency both affect xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity. In addition, selenium deficiency causes changes in the activity of some glutathione-requiring enzymes. We have studied glutathione metabolism in isolated hepatocytes from selenium-deficient, vitamin E-deficient, and control rats. Cell viability, as measured by trypan blue exclusion, was comparable for all groups during the 5-h incubation. Freshly isolated hepatocytes had the same glutathione concentration regardless of diet group. During the incubation, however, the glutathione concentration in selenium-deficient hepatocytes rose to 1.4 times that in control hepatocytes. The selenium-deficient cells also released twice as much glutathione into the incubation medium as did the control cells. Total glutathione (intracellular plus extracellular) in the incubation flask increased from 47.7 +/- 8.9 to 152 +/- 16.5 nmol/10(6) selenium-deficient cells over 5 h compared with an increase from 46.7 +/- 7.1 to 92.0 +/- 17.4 nmol/10(6) control cells and from 47.7 +/- 11.7 to 79.5 +/- 24.9 nmol/10(6) vitamin E-deficient cells. This overall increase in glutathione concentration suggested that glutathione synthesis was accelerated by selenium deficiency. The activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was twice as great in selenium-deficient liver supernatant (105,000 X g) as in vitamin E-deficient or control liver supernatant (105,000 X g). Hemoglobin-free perfused livers were used to determine the form of glutathione released and its route. Selenium-deficient livers released 4 times as much GSH into the caval perfusate as did control livers. Plasma glutathione concentration in selenium-deficient rats was found to be 2-fold that in control rats, suggesting that increased GSH synthesis and release is an in vivo phenomenon associated with selenium deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1987801540,"Successful engraftment of mouse fetal liver cells in early fetal recipients, after microinjection via the placental circulation, is attributable to seeding of the recipient's liver by a cell type that is ancestral to both the myeloid and lymphoid definitive lineages and is capable of sustained self-renewal and differentiation for more than 2 years. This primitive cell is therefore the normal totipotent hematopoietic stem cell (THSC). The use of a large series of mutant anemic recipients with decreasing severity of an endogenous stem-cell defect (W/W, Wv/Wv, Wf/Wf, Wv/+), and therefore of graded selective advantage to normal donor cells, has revealed that engraftment entails marginal numbers of cells--probably individual ones--in the least afflicted hosts. Thus the observed progressive and coordinate shift toward donor-strain erythrocytes, granulocytes and B and T lymphocytes, over time, indicates THSC expansion to form a larger stem-cell pool and normally regulated differentiation of cells from the pool. This transplant system allows allogeneic combinations with impunity and therefore provides many novel experimental possibilities for investigating THSC normal development, genetic abnormalities or neoplastic potential in relation to the intact developmental succession of hematopoietic tissue environments in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1497338732,"In cultured mouse epidermal basal cells, retinoic acid is a potent inducer of transglutaminase, the enzyme responsible for isodipeptide bond formation in protein cross-linking in the production of the cornified membrane during terminal differentiation. Paradoxically retinoic acid also inhibits the formation of the cross-linked envelope and greatly reduces the level of dipeptide bond formation in epidermal cells induced to differentiate by calcium. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which retinoids can modify transglutaminase activity and epidermal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1983582491,Somatostatin perfused in canine pancreases at 10 to 20 picograms per milliliter or 10 to 20 percent of the pancreatic vein somatostatin concentration inhibited insulin and glucagon secretion. This suggests that the high local concentration of endogenous somatostatin is not in contact with somatostatin receptors of the islets. The integrity of this separation may determine the sensitivity of islet cells to circulating somatostatin.

https://openalex.org/W2001797064,"Most neurons in organotypic cultures of dorsal root ganglia from 13-day-old fetal mice require high concentrations of nerve growth factor for survival during the first week after explanation. These nerve growth factor-enhanced sensory neurons mature and innervate the dorsal regions of attached spinal cord tissue even after the removal of exogenous growth factor after 4 days. In cultures exposed for 4 days to nerve growth factor and taxol (a plant alkaloid that promotes the assembly of microtubules) and returned to medium without growth factor, greater than 95 percent of the ganglionic neurons degenerated and the spinal cord tissues were reduced almost to monolayers. In contrast, when the recovery medium was supplemented with nerve growth factor, the ganglionic neurons and dorsal (but not ventral) cord tissue survived remarkably well. Dorsal cord neurons do not normally require an input from dorsal root ganglia for long-term maintenance in vitro, but during and after taxol exposure they become dependent for survival and recovery on the presence of neurite projections from nerve growth-factor-enhanced dorsal root ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W1593412680,"The intrinsic cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity of highly purified cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles was characterized. The sarcolemmal protein kinase was specifically activated by cAMP. Binding of cAMP to the kinase was saturable and occurred exclusively to a protein of Mr = 55,000 intrinsic to the vesicles. This binding of cAMP to the sarcolemmal vesicles caused a selective release of catalytic activity from the membranes, which was capable of phosphorylating several endogenous sarcolemmal substrates as well as one additional substrate, which was also identified in purified vesicles of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Unmasking experiments conducted with the ionophore alamethicin demonstrated that the protein kinase activity and its endogenous sarcolemmal substrates were localized on the inner, cytoplasmic surfaces of the vesicles, and, furthermore, suggested that at least 75% of the vesicles were right side out. The major protein substrates phosphorylated in the sarcolemmal fraction exhibited apparent molecular weights of 21,000 and 8,000, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Heating the membranes in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate prior to electrophoresis completely converted the 21,000-dalton substrate into the form of higher mobility, suggesting that the two substrates were, in fact, identical proteins. This was supported by the observation that both substrates exhibited identical pI values of approximately 6.7. Although present in the sarcolemmal fraction, these two substrates were not localized exclusively to sarcolemmal membranes. The same two substrates were present in 3-fold higher content in purified cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Moreover, although phosphorylation of all other sarcolemmal proteins in right side out vesicles by exogenously added protein kinase was increased 4-fold or greater by alamethicin, phosphorylation of the substrates of Mr = 21,000 and 8,000 was not altered appreciably by the ionophore. The results suggest that these two major substrates identified in the sarcolemmal preparations are not intrinsic sarcolemmal proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1480412527,"Preincubation of turkey erythrocytes with isoproterenol results in an impaired ability of beta-adrenergic agonists to stimulate adenylate cyclase in membranes prepared from these cells. The biochemical basis for this agonist-induced desensitization was investigated using the new beta-adrenergic antagonist photoaffinity label [125I]p-azidobenzylcarazolol ([125I]PABC). Exposure of [125I]PABC-labeled turkey erythrocyte membranes to high intensity light leads to specific covalent incorporation of the labeled compound into two polypeptides, Mr approximately equal to 38,000 and 50,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Incorporation of [125I]PABC into these two polypeptides is completely blocked by a beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist consistent with covalent labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor. After desensitization of the turkey erythrocyte by preincubation with 10(-5) M isoproterenol, the beta-adrenergic receptor polypeptides specifically labeled by [125I]PABC in membranes prepared from desensitized erythrocytes were of larger apparent molecular weight (Mr approximately equal to 42,000 versus 38,000, and 53,000 versus 50,000) compared to controls. When included during the preincubation of the erythrocytes with isoproterenol, the antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M) inhibited both agonist-promoted desensitization of the adenylate cyclase and the altered mobility of the [125I]PABC-labeled receptor polypeptides. These data indicate that structural alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptor accompany the desensitization process in turkey erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1482461412,"Crude immunoglobulin fractions from a sheep, immunized with rat pheochromocytoma tyrosine hydroxylase, increased the catalytic activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in vitro up to 20-fold. Kinetic analysis of the activation revealed both a decrease in Km(app) for pterin cofactor and an increase in Vmax(app). No change Km(app) for tyrosine was observed. Activation was maximal at the minimum antibody/enzyme ratio required to remove tyrosine hydroxylase activity from solution with protein A immunoadsorbent. Chromatography of the crude immunoglobulins on either DEAE-Sephacel or protein A-Sepharose separated two immunoglobulin fractions. In both cases, the activating influence and the anti-tyrosine hydroxylase activity bound to the matrices and were eluted together. As supported by data from a solid phase radioimmunoassay using rabbit anti-bovine IgG1, this chromatographic data was consistent with the activating activity and the anti-tyrosine hydroxylase activity both being sheep IgG1 immunoglobulins. Preadsorption of the active immunoglobulin fraction from DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (with protein A immunoadsorbent precoated with rabbit anti-sheep IgG) eliminated the activating influence. Moreover, after incubation with the active fraction, tyrosine hydroxylase was bound to protein A-Sepharose and the activity recovered was severalfold higher than the initial activity. These data clearly demonstrate the involvement of antibody in the activation of the enzyme and suggest that the anti-tyrosine hydroxylase activity and the activating activity may derive from one and the same set of interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1509965101,"Lysyl oxidase purified from urea extracts of various connective tissues resolves into multiple catalytically functional species upon chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in 6 M urea. The four enzyme species of bovine aorta retain their original chromatographic behavior on DEAE with time of storage and after purification to homogeneity by gel exclusion chromatography. The peptide maps of each aortic enzyme partially digested by STaphylococcus aureus V8 protease are very similar to each other, as are the peptide maps of complete tryptic digests of each enzyme. Such similarity also exists between the peptide maps of the aortic enzyme and the urea-extractable lysyl oxidase of bovine cartilage, as well as with the peptide maps of a catalytically quiescent protein resolved from the aortic enzyme by gel exclusion chromatography. The substrate activity profiles of the multiple aortic enzyme species are also extremely similar. Although the origin of the enzyme multiplicity remains to be established, there is evident structural and catalytic similarities between the enzyme forms."
https://openalex.org/W1492835272,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use urea as sole nitrogen source by degrading it in two steps (urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase) to ammonia and carbon dioxide. We previously demonstrated that: 1) the enzymatic functions required for degradation are encoded in two tightly linked genetic loci and 2) pleiotropic mutations each resulting in the loss of both activities are found in both loci. These and other observations led to the hypothesis that urea degradation might be catalyzed by a multifunctional polypeptide. Waheed and Castric (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1628-1632), on the other hand, purified urea amidolyase from Candida utilis and reported it to be a tetramer composed of nonidentical 70- and 170-kilodalton subunits. To resolve the differing views of urea amidolyase structure, we purified the protein using rapid methods designed to avoid proteolytic cleavage. Application of these methods resulted in the isolation of a single, inducible and repressible, 204-kilodalton species. We observed no evidence for the existence of nonidentical subunits. A similar inducible, high molecular weight species was also detected in C. utilis. These biochemical results support our earlier hypothesis that urea degradation is carried out in yeast by an inducible and repressible protein composed of identical, multifunctional subunits."

https://openalex.org/W80592449,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses dual enzymatic sequences to both L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, a biosynthetic arrangement further complicated by the presence of five aromatic aminotransferases. Each aminotransferase is capable of transamination in vitro with any of the three keto acid intermediates in the aromatic pathway (phenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, or prephenate). The fractional contribution of these aminotransferases to particular transamination reactions in vivo can best be approached through the systematic and sequential elimination of individual aminotransferase activities by mutation. A program of sequential mutagenesis has produced two aminotransferase-deficient mutations. The first mutation imposed a phenotype of bradytrophy for L-phenylalanine (doubling time of 2.4 h in minimal salts/glucose medium compared to a 1.0-h doubling time for wild type). This mutant completely lacked an enzyme denoted aminotransferase AT-2. A genetic background of aminotransferase AT-2 deficiency was used to select for a second mutation which produced a phenotype of multiple auxotrophy for L-phenylalanine, L-aspartate, and L-glutamate. The double mutant completely lacked activity for aromatic aminotransferase AT-1 in addition to the missing aminotransferase AT-2. Enzymes AT-1 (Mr = 64,000) and AT-2 (Mr = 50,000) were readily separated from one another by gel filtration and were individually characterized for pH optima, freeze-thaw stability, heat lability, and molecular weight. The phenotypic and enzymological characterizations of the aminotransferase mutants strongly support the primary in vivo role of enzyme AT-2 in L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine biosynthesis, while enzyme AT-1 must primarily be engaged in L-aspartate and L-glutamate synthesis. The substrate specificities and possible in vivo functions for AT-3, AT-4, and AT-5 are also considered."
https://openalex.org/W1518600522,"Interaction of 5-oxo-L-prolinase (which catalyzes stoichiometric cleavage of 5-oxo-L-proline to L-glutamate coupled to that of cleavage of ATP to ADP and Pi), with a number of new 5-oxo-L-proline analogs was examined in studies in which (a) analogs were substituted for 5-oxo-L-proline and the formation of products was determined, (b) the effects of the analogs on the normal catalytic reaction were observed, and (c) the effects of the analogs on the ITPase activity exhibited by the enzyme were examined. Some of these reactions are partially coupled, i.e. the molar formation of ADP exceeds that of amino acid; others are uncoupled, i.e. cleavage of ATP, but not that of imino acid occurs. Analogs in which the 4-methylene moiety of 5-oxo-L-proline is replaced by O, S, and NH (L-2-oxooxazolidine-4-carboxylate, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate, and 2-imidazolidone-4-carboxylate) participate in reactions that are, partially coupled, coupled, and uncoupled respectively. Partial coupling occurs with cis- and trans-2-oxo-5-methyloxazolidine-4-carboxylate, and uncoupled reactions occur with L-2-iminothiazolidine-4-carboxylate, 2-thiazolinone-4-carboxylate, and 2-oxo-5,5-dimethylthiazolidine-4-carboxylate. These and earlier findings indicate that significant binding of the imino acid substrate requires a 5-carbonyl (or = NH), an unsubstituted N-1 and a C-2 of the L-configuration; substantial modification of 5-oxo-L-proline in the region of C-3 and C-4 is possible with retention of binding properties. Uncoupling and partial coupling may be associated with significant differences in the orientations of the analogs at the active site that facilitate (to various extents) the access of water to the nucleoside triphosphate."

Thirty-two tryptic peptides were isolated by ion exchange chromatography, high voltage paper electrophoresis, descending paper chromatography, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The last method permitted the isolation of 29 tryptic peptides, many in a single step, in yields usually greater than 75%. The purified peptides were characterized by amino acid analysis and their sequences determined by the manual 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Edman degradation procedure or by the automated Edman-Begg degradation method. These peptides accounted for all 12 lysine and 21 arginine residues observed by amino acid analysis of the intact protein and for 347 amino acid residues of the 345 predicted by the analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1990652135,"The murine fibrosarcoma cell line HSDM1C1 synthesizes prostaglandin E2 in response to thrombin and bradykinin, two products of the coagulation pathway. These physiologic effectors interact with two independent cell-surface receptor systems whose properties we have characterized. HSDM1C1 cells possess a B2 bradykinin receptor, a type more sensitive to native bradykinin than to related peptides, including Met-Lys- and desArg9-bradykinin. A period of bradykinin desensitization follows the initial response. Recovery occurs within 1 hr by a process independent of serum factors. The thrombin-mediated pathway differs in several respects. The maximum amount of prostaglandin E2 synthesized is 40% lower. Prolonged desensitization of the thrombin response occurs after an initial exposure; recovery requires at least 3 hr and depends strictly on the presence of serum. Antithrombin III and hirudin, two proteins that specifically inactivate thrombin, act in serum-free medium to relieve thrombin desensitization. Thrombin's prolonged desensitization thus suggests a persistent ligand-receptor association. The expression of receptor-mediated prostaglandin synthesis governed by multiple physiologic effectors in the same cell may reflect environmental conditions, such as the relative proportions of each effector and the presence of exogenous factors that modulate the ligand-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2086035618,"A pituitary glycopeptide whose amino acid sequence was previously identified has now been recognized as the final portion of the precursor to arginine vasopressin and its associated neurophysin.

The peptide is located in vasopressin-synthesizing cells in the neurosecretory magnocellular nuclei. Positively stained fibers project from the magnocellular nuclei through the median eminence to the posterior pituitary. Studies of the homozygous Brattleboro rat, which is known to be deficient in the production of vasopressin and its related neurophysin, also show the absence of immunoreactivity to this peptide.

https://openalex.org/W1583357201,"The influences of different nitrogen sources on the relative rates of biosynthesis of glutamine and alanine have been studied by 15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of intact Neurospora crassa mycelia suspensions.

The reverse trend was observed for the biosynthesis of alanine. A competition between the two biosynthetic pathways for the same substrate, glutamic acid, was found to limit the rate of alanine synthesis when glutamine synthesis was rapid. The observed in vivo rates of these reactions are compared to the reported specific activities of the enzymes catalyzing the reactions, and implications of these results for nitrogen regulation of these pathways under various physiological conditions are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1584867003,"In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the initial enzyme of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase, has been known to be subject to feedback inhibition by a metabolite in each of the three major pathway branchlets. Thus, an apparent balanced multieffector control is mediated by L-tyrosine, by L-tryptophan, and phenylpyruvate. We have now resolved DAHP synthase into two distinctive regulatory isozymes, herein denoted DAHP synthase-tyr (Mr = 137,000) and DAHP synthase-trp (Mr = 175,000). DAHP synthase-tyr comprises greater than 90% of the total activity. L-Tyrosine was found to be a potent effector, inhibiting competitively with respect to both phosphoenolpyruvate (Ki = 23 microM) and erythrose 4-phosphate (Ki = 23 microM). Phenylpyruvate was a less effective competitive inhibitor: phosphoenolpyruvate (Ki = 2.55 mM) and erythrose 4-phosphate (Ki = 1.35 mM). DAHP synthase-trp was found to be inhibited noncompetitively by L-tryptophan with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate (Ki = 40 microM) and competitively with respect to erythrose 4-phosphate (Ki = 5 microM). Chorismate was a relatively weak competitive inhibitor: phosphoenolpyruvate (Ki = 1.35 mM) and erythrose 4-phosphate (Ki = 2.25 mM). Thus, each isozyme is strongly inhibited by an amino acid end product and weakly inhibited by an intermediary metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1502998518,"The kinetic mechanism of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase with D-alpha-aminobutyrate as substrate has been examined in detail using a combination of steady state and rapid reaction methods. At concentrations of D-alpha-aminobutyrate below 0.5 mM, the rapid reaction and steady state results are consistent with the mechanism previously proposed for D-alanine (Massey, V., and Gibson, Q. H. (1964) Fed. Proc. 23, 18-29; Porter, D. J. T., Voet, J. G., and Bright, H. J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4464-4473). Both flavin reduction by D-alpha-aminobutyrate and reoxidation are quite rapid. Release of product from the oxidized enzyme has been measured directly and matches the turnover number at infinite concentrations of both substrates. Substitution of deuterium for the alpha-hydrogen decreases the rate of reduction 1.4-fold, without any effect on the apparent Kd. Computer simulations show that the kinetic isotope effects on the reductive half-reaction with D-alanine reported by Porter et al. (see above reference) can be explained using a two-step model with a kinetic isotope effect of 1.75 on the limiting rate of reduction. The effect of enzyme concentration on the kinetics has been examined in some detail. With D-alanine as substrate, increasing the enzyme concentration over the range 29 nM to 17 microM resulted in less than a 2-fold decrease in the turnover number. The Kd for benzoate binding also decreased marginally with increasing enzyme concentration. The effect of enzyme concentration is consistent with a decrease in the rate of release of ligands from the oxidized enzyme as the enzyme concentration is increased."
https://openalex.org/W1526655187,"Myosin subfragment 1 ((S-1) is inactivated upon incubation with the nucleotide analogue 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (5'-FSO2BzAdo). The rate of inactivation is increased in the presence of MgADP and MgPPi and decreased in the presence of MgATP. Complete loss of ATPase activity correlates with the loss of two sulfhydryl groups on S-1, and for reactions carried out in the presence of MgADP, this is accompanied by noncovalent trapping of the nucleotide (0.75 ADP/S-1). Treatment of the inactivated S-1 with dithiothreitol leads to the recovery of the lost sulfhydryl groups, release of the trapped MgADP, and recovery of the protein's activity. Importantly, all of these changes are achieved without any significant release of the incorporated radioactive nucleotide analogue. Remarkably similar results were obtained for the reaction of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) with S-1 (Wells, J. A., and Yount, R. G. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 1711-1717) and were interpreted in terms of disulfide bond formation between the reactive SH1 and SH2 thiols. It is proposed that the inactivation of S-1 by 5'-FSO2BzAdo is caused by a two-step reaction involving the initial formation of a thiosulfonate, with the SH1 group, followed by a displacement of the analogue by the SH2 residue to yield a disulfide. The stable and measurable incorporation of the analogue into S-1 proceeds in a parallel reaction at site(s) which did not affect the ATPase activity. The general feasibility of the proposed role of 5'-FSO2BzAdo in forming a disulfide bond in proteins is demonstrated by monitoring its reaction with free cysteine. As detected by pH stat titrations, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) titrations, and amino acid analysis, 5'-FSO2BzAdo rapidly converts cysteine into cystine."
https://openalex.org/W1591023709,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were preloaded with either 45Ca2+ or unlabeled Ca2+. The unidirectional Ca2+ efflux and influx, together with Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis and phosphorylation of the membrane-bound (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase, were determined in the presence of ATP and ADP. The Ca2+ efflux depended on ATP (or ADP or both). It also required the external Ca2+. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the efflux was similar to the Ca2+ concentration dependences of Ca2+ influx, Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis, and phosphoenzyme formation. The rate of the efflux was approximately in proportion to the concentration of the phosphoenzyme up to 10 microM Ca2+. These results and other findings indicate that the Ca2+ efflux represents the Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange (between the external medium and the internal medium) mediated by the phosphoenzyme. In the range of 0.6-5.2 microM Mg2+, no appreciable Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange was detected although phosphoenzyme formation occurred to a large extent. Elevation of Mg2+ in the range 5.2 microM-4.8 mM caused a remarkable activation of the exchange, whereas the amount of the phosphoenzyme only approximately doubled. The kinetic analysis shows that this activation results largely from the Mg2+-induced acceleration of an exchange between the bound Ca2+ of the phosphoenzyme and the free Ca2+ in the internal medium. It is concluded that Mg2+ is essential for the exposure of the bound Ca2+ of the phosphoenzyme to the internal medium."
https://openalex.org/W1649241083,"Changes in the net protonation of D-amino acid oxidase during binding of competitive inhibitors and during reduction by amino acids have been monitored using phenol red as a pH indicator. At pH 8.0, no uptake or release of protons from solution occurs upon binding the inhibitors benzoate, anthranilate, picolinate, or L-leucine. The Kd values for both picolinate and anthranilate were determined from pH 5.4 to 9.0. The results are consistent with a single group on the enzyme having a pK of 6.3 which must be unprotonated for tight binding, as is the case with benzoate binding (Quay, S., and Massey, V. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 3348-3354) and with tight binding of the inhibitor form with an unprotonated amino group. Upon reduction of the enzyme by amino acid substrates, two protons are released to solution. The first is released concomitantly with reduction to the reduced enzyme-imino acid charge transfer complex. The second is released only upon dissociation of the charge transfer complex to free reduced enzyme and imino acid. The first proton is assigned as arising from the amino acid group and the second from the amino acid alpha-hydrogen. These results are consistent with the flavin in reduced D-amino acid oxidase being anionic."

https://openalex.org/W1669011871,"Incubation of pineal acetyl-CoA hydrolase preparations with disulfide peptides activates the enzyme. Activation of somatostatin, the most potent peptide tested, is enhanced at higher pH, indicating that disulfide exchange is probably involved. This interpretation is supported by the observation that activation is reversed by dithiothreitol treatment. The order of potency is somatostatin = [Tyr1]somatostatin greater than or equal to Tyr-somatostatin greater than vasopressin = pressinoic acid = [Arg8]vasotocin greater than oxytocin. Insulin, insulin A, insulin B, and [Asu1,6, Arg8]vasopressin were ineffective. This order of potency is distinctly different from that for the inactivation of pineal N-acetyltransferase (Namboodiri, M. A. A., Favilla, J., and Klein, D. C. (1981) Science 213, 571-573) by these peptides. Examination of the primary structure of the peptides reveals that the above order of potency is consistent with the predictions of the nearest neighbor model as applied to the disulfide group."
