https://openalex.org/W2107513655,"Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF 3, which coordinately regulate the expression of type-I interferons such as interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Herein, we report the identification of a novel protein termed MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling), which mediates the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3 in response to viral infection. Silencing of MAVS expression through RNA interference abolishes the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3 by viruses, thereby permitting viral replication. Conversely, overexpression of MAVS induces the expression of IFN-beta through activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3, thus boosting antiviral immunity. Epistasis experiments show that MAVS is required for the phosphorylation of IRF 3 and IkappaB and functions downstream of RIG-I, an intracellular receptor for viral RNA. MAVS contains an N-terminal CARD-like domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, both of which are essential for MAVS signaling. The transmembrane domain targets MAVS to the mitochondria, implicating a new role of mitochondria in innate immunity."

Here, we show that overexpression of Klotho in mice extends life span. Klotho protein functions as a circulating hormone that binds to a cell-surface receptor and represses intracellular signals of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for extending life span. Alleviation of aging-like phenotypes in Klotho-deficient mice was observed by perturbing insulin and IGF1 signaling, suggesting that Klotho-mediated inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling contributes to its anti-aging properties. Klotho protein may function as an anti-aging hormone in mammals."

In clonal populations, this may be achieved through sensing followed by response or through the generation of diversity by stochastic phenotype switching. Here we show that stochastic switching can be favored over sensing when the environment changes infrequently. The optimal switching rates then mimic the statistics of environmental changes. We derive a relation between the long-term growth rate of the organism and the information available about its fluctuating environment."
https://openalex.org/W2140175819,"The complexity of soil bacterial communities has thus far confounded effective measurement. However, with improved analytical methods, we show that the abundance distribution and total diversity can be deciphered. Reanalysis of reassociation kinetics for bacterial community DNA from pristine and metal-polluted soils showed that a power law best described the abundance distributions. More than one million distinct genomes occurred in the pristine soil, exceeding previous estimates by two orders of magnitude. Metal pollution reduced diversity more than 99.9%, revealing the highly toxic effect of metal contamination, especially for rare taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2100761325,"We have explored the use of embryonic stem cells as an alternative to oocytes for reprogramming human somatic nuclei. Human embryonic stem (hES) cells were fused with human fibroblasts, resulting in hybrid cells that maintain a stable tetraploid DNA content and have morphology, growth rate, and antigen expression patterns characteristic of hES cells. Differentiation of hybrid cells in vitro and in vivo yielded cell types from each embryonic germ layer. Analysis of genome-wide transcriptional activity, reporter gene activation, allele-specific gene expression, and DNA methylation showed that the somatic genome was reprogrammed to an embryonic state. These results establish that hES cells can reprogram the transcriptional state of somatic nuclei and provide a system for investigating the underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1970864109,"Osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone and are ideally located to influence bone turnover through their syncytial relationship with surface bone cells. Osteocyte-derived signals have remained largely enigmatic, but it was recently reported that human osteocytes secrete sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone formation. Absent sclerostin protein results in the high bone mass clinical disorder sclerosteosis. Here we report that within adult iliac bone, newly embedded osteocytes were negative for sclerostin staining but became positive at or after primary mineralization. The majority of mature osteocytes in mineralized cortical and cancellous bone was positive for sclerostin with diffuse staining along dendrites in the osteocyte canaliculi. These findings provide for the first time in vivo evidence to support the concept that osteocytes secrete sclerostin after they become embedded in a mineralized matrix to limit further bone formation by osteoblasts. Sclerostin did not appear to influence the formation of osteocytes. We propose that sclerostin production by osteocytes may regulate the linear extent of formation and the induction or maintenance of a lining cell phenotype on bone surfaces. In doing so, sclerostin may act as a key inhibitory signal governing skeletal microarchitecture."

Refinement of data collected between 293 and 30 kelvin revealed a total of eight symmetry-independent adsorption sites. Five of these are sites on the zinc oxide unit and the organic link; the remaining three sites form a second layer in the pores. The structural integrity and high symmetry of the framework are retained throughout, with negligible changes resulting from gas adsorption."

https://openalex.org/W2033415145,"CD4 + regulatory T (Treg) cells have a profound ability to suppress host immune responses, yet little is understood about how these cells are regulated. We describe a mechanism linking Toll-like receptor (TLR) 8 signaling to the control of Treg cell function, in which synthetic and natural ligands for human TLR8 can reverse Treg cell function. This effect was independent of dendritic cells but required functional TLR8-MyD88-IRAK4 signaling in Treg cells. Adoptive transfer of TLR8 ligand-stimulated Treg cells into tumor-bearing mice enhanced anti-tumor immunity. These results suggest that TLR8 signaling could play a critical role in controlling immune responses to cancer and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1997742462,"Whether rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations will cause forests to grow faster and store more carbon is an open question. Using free air CO 2 release in combination with a canopy crane, we found an immediate and sustained enhancement of carbon flux through 35-meter-tall temperate forest trees when exposed to elevated CO 2 . However, there was no overall stimulation in stem growth and leaf litter production after 4 years. Photosynthetic capacity was not reduced, leaf chemistry changes were minor, and tree species differed in their responses. Although growing vigorously, these trees did not accrete more biomass carbon in stems in response to elevated CO 2 , thus challenging projections of growth responses derived from tests with smaller trees."

https://openalex.org/W2144262617,"Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is considered a crucial mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia through its regulation of genes that control angiogenesis1,2,3,4. It represents an attractive therapeutic target5,6 in colon cancer, one of the few tumor types that shows a clinical response to antiangiogenic therapy7. But it is unclear whether inhibition of HIF-1 alone is sufficient to block tumor angiogenesis8,9. In HIF-1α knockdown DLD-1 colon cancer cells (DLD-1HIF-kd), the hypoxic induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was only partially blocked. Xenografts remained highly vascularized with microvessel densities identical to DLD-1 tumors that had wild-type HIF-1α (DLD-1HIF-wt). In addition to the preserved expression of VEGF, the proangiogenic cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 was induced by hypoxia in DLD-1HIF-kd but not DLD-1HIF-wt cells. This induction was mediated by the production of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, the KRAS oncogene, which is commonly mutated in colon cancer, enhanced the hypoxic induction of IL-8. A neutralizing antibody to IL-8 substantially inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in DLD-1HIF-kd but not DLD-1HIF-wt xenografts, verifying the functional significance of this IL-8 response. Thus, compensatory pathways can be activated to preserve the tumor angiogenic response, and strategies that inhibit HIF-1α may be most effective when IL-8 is simultaneously targeted."

https://openalex.org/W2065600921,"During cell division, chromosomes are distributed to daughter cells by the mitotic spindle. This system requires spatial cues to reproducibly self-organize. We report that such cues are provided by chromosome-mediated interaction gradients between the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran and importin-β. This produces activity gradients that determine the spatial distribution of microtubule nucleation and stabilization around chromosomes and that are essential for the self-organization of microtubules into a bipolar spindle."
https://openalex.org/W2011732452,"In several metals, including URhGe, superconductivity has recently been observed to appear and coexist with ferromagnetism at temperatures well below that at which the ferromagnetic state forms. However, the material characteristics leading to such a state of coexistence have not yet been fully elucidated. We report that in URhGe there is a magnetic transition where the direction of the spin axis changes when a magnetic field of 12 tesla is applied parallel to the crystal b axis. We also report that a second pocket of superconductivity occurs at low temperature for a range of fields enveloping this magnetic transition, well above the field of 2 tesla at which superconductivity is first destroyed. Our findings strongly suggest that excitations in which the spins rotate stimulate superconductivity in the neighborhood of a quantum phase transition under high magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2085020849,"The malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, exploits multiple ligand-receptor interactions, called invasion pathways, to invade the host erythrocyte. Strains of P. falciparum vary in their dependency on sialated red cell receptors for invasion. We show that switching from sialic acid-dependent to -independent invasion is reversible and depends on parasite ligand use. Expression of P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding like homolog 4 (PfRh4) correlates with sialic acid-independent invasion, and PfRh4 is essential for switching invasion pathways. Differential activation of PfRh4 represents a previously unknown mechanism to switch invasion pathways and provides P. falciparum with exquisite adaptability in the face of erythrocyte receptor polymorphisms and host immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2089962959,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) has been shown to antagonize numerous cellular pathways, including the antiviral interferon-alpha response. However, the capacity of this protein to interact with the viral polymerase suggests a more direct role for NS5A in genome replication. In this study, we employed two bacterially expressed, soluble derivatives of NS5A to probe for novel functions of this protein. We find that NS5A has the capacity to bind to the 3'-ends of HCV plus and minus strand RNAs. The high affinity binding site for NS5A in the 3'-end of plus strand RNA maps to the polypyrimidine tract, an element known to be essential for genome replication and infectivity. NS5A has a preference for single-stranded RNA containing stretches of uridine or guanosine. Values for the equilibrium dissociation constants for high affinity binding sites were in the 10 nM range. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting revealed the presence of unphosphorylated NS5A in Huh-7 cells stably expressing the subgenomic replicon. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation and NS5A pull-down experiments showed the capacity of replicon-derived NS5A to bind to synthetic RNA and the HCV genome, respectively. Deletion of all of the casein kinase II phosphorylation sites in NS5A supported stable replication of a subgenomic replicon in Huh-7. However, this derivative could not be labeled with inorganic phosphate, suggesting that extensive phosphorylation of NS5A is not required for the replication functions of NS5A. The discovery that NS5A is an RNA-binding protein defines a new functional target for development of agents to treat HCV infection and a new structural class of RNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2041787701,"Histone lysine methylation can have positive or negative effects on transcription, depending on the precise methylation site. According to the “histone code” hypothesis these methylation marks can be read by proteins that bind them specifically and then regulate downstream events. Hetero-chromatin protein 1 (HP1), an essential component of heterochromatin, binds specifically to methylated Lys9 of histone H3 (K9/H3). The linker histone H1.4 is methylated on Lys26 (K26/H1.4), but the role of this methylation in downstream events remains unknown. Here we identify HP1 as a protein specifically recognizing and binding to methylated K26/H1.4. We demonstrate that the Chromo domain of HP1 is mediating this binding and that phosphorylation of Ser27 on H1.4 (S27/H1.4) prevents HP1 from binding. We suggest that methylation of K26/H1.4 could have a role in tethering HP1 to chromatin and that this could also explain how HP1 is targeted to those regions of chromatin where it does not colocalize with methylated K9/H3. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for a “phospho switch” model in which neighboring phosphorylation reverts the effect of histone lysine methylation.

Our results provide the first experimental evidence for a “phospho switch” model in which neighboring phosphorylation reverts the effect of histone lysine methylation. In eukaryotic cells the DNA is packaged into chromatin. The building block of chromatin is the nucleosomal core particle containing a histone octamer (two each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) around which 147 bp of DNA are wrapped (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). Linker histone H1 binds to the DNA between the nucleosomal core particles and stabilizes higher order chromatin structure (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. 1988; (Rich, A., ed) Springer Series in Molecular Biology, Springer Verlag, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The N-terminal tails of the core histones protrude from the nucleosomal surface and are subject to multiple covalent modifications including methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These modifications have the potential to regulate chromatin architecture and thereby can affect all aspects of DNA processing. According to the so called “histone code” hypothesis these modifications could be read by proteins that bind to specific modifications and then can regulate downstream events (3Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar). Methylation of lysines has positive as well as negative effects on transcription, depending on the methylation site. The methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (K9/H3) and lysine 27 of histone H3 (K27/H3) has generally been implicated in transcriptional repression. Methylated K9/H3 is specifically recognized and bound by Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) 3The abbreviations used are: HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; CD, chromo domain; CSD, chromoshadow domain; me, methylated; Ezh2, Enhancer of Zeste 2; PRC2, Polycomb repressive complex 2; EED, embryonic ectoderm development; Suv39, suppressor of variegation 3-9; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; aa, amino acids.

HP1 has a role in heterochromatin organization, maintenance, and in gene repression. In mammals three HP1 isoforms HP1α, HP1β(M31), and HP1γ(M32) have been identified. The HP1 proteins are very similar in their amino acid sequence, they contain a conserved N-terminal Chromo domain (CD), a more variable hinge region and a conserved C-terminal Chromoshadow domain (CSD). This modular organization of HP1 allows several proteins to bind simultaneously to HP1. The CD binds specifically to methylated K9/H3; the hinge region can bind to RNA, DNA, and chromatin, whereas the CSD is involved in self-association and interacts, e.g. with the DNA methyl-transferases Dnmt1 and 3a, and the lysine methyltransferase Suv39. Since Suv39 can methylate K9/H3 and HP1 binds to methylated K9/H3, the propagation of heterochromatin could be ensured by a “self-sustaining loop” (for a review, see Ref. 9Maison C. Almouzni G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and references therein). However, the methylation of K9/H3 is necessary but not sufficient for targeting of HP1 (10Stewart M.D. Li J. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that other distinct, yet unidentified, HP1 interaction sites could be involved in HP1 targeting (9Maison C. Almouzni G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells four histone H1 variants are present in all somatic cells (H1.2 to H1.5), and a fifth (H1.1) is restricted to thymus, testis, and spleen and possibly lymphocytic and neuronal cells (11Khochbin S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Histone H1 is also covalently modified. Multiple phosphorylation sites have been mapped (12Garcia B.A. Busby S.A. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that H1 phosphorylation can promote chromatin decondensation, enabling access to chromatin (13Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Histone H1.4 is di-methylated at Lys26 (meK26/H1.4), which is next to a phosphorylation site at Ser27 (12Garcia B.A. Busby S.A. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). K26/H1.4 is located within the flexible N-terminal domain of H1 just preceding the globular domain. K27/H3 and K26/H1.4 are methylated by a multisubunit methyltransferase complex PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) whose catalytic subunit is the polycomb protein Ezh2. The specificity depends on the isoform of the EED protein present in the PRC complex (14Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The methylation of K26/H1.4 is important for the transcriptional repression by Ezh2 (14Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The extension of the so called “histone code” to include linker histones has been recently suggested but not yet demonstrated, and the function of specific methylation in H1.4 is largely unknown (14Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To get insight into the functional role of linker histone modifications, we chose to study the recently described K26/H1.4 di-methylation. The identification of proteins that are able to bind specifically to methylated K26/H1.4 is essential to understand how this modification might be read. We found that HP1(s) binds specifically via its CD to methylated Lys26 of histone H1 and that simultaneous phosphorylation of neighboring Ser27 prevents HP1 binding to H1.4, providing experimental evidence for the “phospho switch” model (15Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Peptides—Histone peptides were made by Clonstar (Brno, Czech Republic) and Peptides and Elephants (Berlin). The H1.4 peptides correspond to amino acids 23-33 or 20-32 of human H1.4. The K9/H3 peptide corresponds to amino acid 1-14 of H3 and the K64/H3 peptide to amino acids 54-69 of H3. The C terminus of all peptides contained a cysteine residue. Peptides were immobilized onto Sulfolink gel (Pierce) via the C-terminal cysteine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Dephosphorylation of peptides was performed with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Antibodies—Antibody 2376 was raised against the peptide KKPAKAAAASKKKPA and is specific for H1.1 and H1.4 (supplemental Fig. 1A). Antibody meK26/H1.4 was raised (Gramsch) against the peptide KARK(me)2SAGAAKR. Immunoreactive serum was affinity-purified using sequentially Lys26 unmethylated and Lys26-methylated H1.4 peptide columns. In Western blot it recognizes specifically methylated, but not unmethylated, H1.4 (supplemental Fig. 1, B-D). Note that this antibody is not suitable for immunocytochemistry or immunoprecipitation. HP1 subtype-specific monoclonal antibodies (2G9, 1A9, 1G6, provided by Pierre Chambon), HP1α- and HP1β-specific antibody (Abcam), His-specific antibody (Sigma), and GST-specific antibody (Sigma) were used in Western blots. Western Blots—Proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with the primary antibodies described above and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Dako) and visualized with ECL. Native H1.4 Purification—Native H1.4 was high performance liquid chromatography-purified from HL60 cells (16Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Hanecke K. Doenecke D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30478-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Note that HL60 cells contain no H1.1 (17Meergans T. Albig W. Doenecke D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Proteins—HP1 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Professor R. Losson and T. Kouzarides or subcloned. These were purified using standard conditions. The purified proteins were either left attached to the Ni2+-affinity resin (Sigma) or the glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or eluted from the resin. Recombinant H1 proteins were produced and purified as described (18Albig W. Runge D.M. Kratzmeier M. Doenecke D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification from Nuclear Extract—HeLa nuclear extract (Computer Cell Culture Center, Seneffe, Belgium) or mouse 38B9 cell nuclear extract was diluted in IPH-E buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) to a final protein concentration of 4 mg/ml and precleared. Affinity purifications were done with 10 μl of Sepharose-linked peptide and 150 μl of diluted nuclear extract. The purifications were incubated for 90 min on a wheel at 4 °C and washed three times in IPH-E before resolution on a 15% SDS-PAGE. Bound HP1 was detected by Western blot analysis. Pull-down Binding Assays—Binding assays were done with either 10 μl of Sepharose-linked peptide or HP1 fusions and eluted recombinant HP1 or purified native H1.4, respectively. All assays were incubated for 90 min on a wheel at 4 °C and washed three times in IPH-E before resolution on a 15% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining or Western blotting as indicated. For competition experiments HP1 was preincubated with free competitor peptides, and the binding was performed in presence of the competitor. Preparation of Nuclei and Peptide Challenge—HeLa nuclei were purified, permeabilized, diluted into PBS, and incubated with and without peptide for 2 h on ice as described (6Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The supernatants were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of HP1. Far-Western-type Overlay Assays and Immunocytochemistry—As described previously (19Muchardt C. Guilleme M. Seeler J.S. Trouche D. Dejean A. Yaniv M. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) mouse NIH 3T3 cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with PBS, 0.6% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were incubated overnight with 0.5 μg/ml recombinant GST or GST-HP1α protein in PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20 either in the absence or in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of histone peptides. Next we performed primary and secondary antibody stainings with an anti-GST antibody (Sigma) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research) before counterstaining of nucleic acid with DAPI and image acquisition with a Leica SP2 UV confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). HP1 Binds Specifically to Methylated K26/H1.4—To identify proteins specifically binding to Lys26-methylated H1.4 we followed a candidate approach. The CD of HP1 binds specifically to methylated K9/H3 (meK9/H3) (5Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar, 6Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 7Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence conservation of the regions surrounding K9/H3 and K26/H1.4 (Fig. 1A) we wanted to know whether HP1 can also bind to methylated K26/H1.4. We coupled H1.4 peptides methylated or unmethylated at Lys26 onto Sepharose beads and used them as affinity columns. As shown in Fig. 1B, recombinantly expressed mouse HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ bind, as expected, to meK9/H3 peptides (lane 3) but also to meK26/H1.4 peptides (lane 2). No binding was observed to unmethylated H1.4 peptides (lane 1) or to meK64/H3 or meK20/H4 peptides (lanes 4 and 5). This binding to meK26/H1.4 was specific and reproducible using two different H1.4 peptides (corresponding to amino acids 20-33 and 23-32) (data not shown). To verify the specificity of HP1 for meK26/H1.4 we performed pull-down experiments in the presence of free competitor peptides. Fig. 1C shows that meK26/H1.4 (lane 1) but not unmethylated H1.4 peptides (lane 2) disrupt the binding of HP1 to meK26/H1.4. Additionally we performed cross-competition experiments using the H1.4 and the H3 peptides. These experiments show that the meK26/H1.4 peptide competes better for the binding of the HP1β CD to meK26/H1.4 than the meK9/H3 peptide (Fig. 1D) and vice versa (data not shown). Taken together this data demonstrates that all subtypes of HP1 (HP1α, HP1β, HP1γ) bind directly and specifically to methylated K26/H1.4. We next asked whether endogenous HP1 also binds to methylated K26/H1.4. As shown by Western blot with HP1 subtype-specific antibodies (Fig. 1E), all three isoforms of HP1 can be affinity purified from 38B9 cell nuclear extract with meK26/H1.4 (lane 2) but not with unmethylated (lane 3) H1.4 peptides. We obtained the same result using human nuclear extract suggesting that this interaction is conserved (data not shown). We then investigated whether methylated H1.4 has a role in tethering HP1 to chromatin. To address this we prepared nuclei from HeLa cells, permeabilized them, and challenged them with methylated or unmethylated H1.4 peptides to elute HP1 from chromatin. After pelleting the chromatin fraction we probed the supernatant for the presence of HP1. Fig. 1F shows that challenging nuclei with excess of meK26/H1.4 peptides increases the proportion of HP1 in the soluble fraction (compare lanes 2 and 3), whereas challenging with the unmethylated H1.4 peptides did not result in a significant increase of HP1 in the soluble fraction (lane 1). Therefore a meK26/H1.4 peptide can displace HP1 from native chromatin, confirming the specific binding of HP1 to methylated Lys26. HP1 Binding to meK26 Is Mediated by the CD—To map the domain of HP1 that interacts with meK26/H1.4 we used HP1 deletion constructs. Fig. 2A shows that the HP1α CD binds specifically to meK26/H1.4 peptides (lane 2, top panel). The HP1α hinge region and the HP1α CSD are not binding. Full-length HP1α only binds to the meK26/H1.4 peptides (lane 2, bottom panel). Additionally we analyzed the binding of the three HP1 CD His fusions to K26/H1.4. As shown in Fig. 2B, the CD of HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ bind all to meK26/H1.4 but not to unmethylated peptides (compare lanes 1 and 2). To examine whether an intact CD is required for meK26/H1.4 binding, we tested mutations in the CD of HP1 for binding. The K41W42 to AA mutation affects central residues in the CD (8Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). This mutation abolished the binding of HP1 to meK26/H1.4 peptides (Fig. 2C, lane 2), testifying for the importance of an intact CD for the binding to methylated H1.4. Phosphorylation of Ser27 Prevents HP1 Binding—According to the “binary switch” model a phosphorylation next to a lysine methylation could reverse the effect of the methylation (15Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In the case of H1.4, a Lys26-methylated and Ser27-phosphorylated form has been described (12Garcia B.A. Busby S.A. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate how the phosphorylation of Ser27 influences the binding of HP1 to meK26/H1. Fig. 3A shows that recombinant HP1α, HP1β and HP1γ no longer bind to meK26/H1.4 peptide when it is simultaneously phosphorylated on Ser27 (compare lanes 1 and 2). To test whether the absence of binding was indeed due to the phosphorylation of Ser27 we used λ-phosphatase to remove the phospho group from the meK26/phosphoS27/H1.4 peptide. Fig. 3B shows that dephosphorylation of the peptide restores the binding (compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3) confirming that Ser27 phosphorylation blocks HP1 binding. We next asked whether competition with H1.4 peptides affects the localization of HP1 in NIH 3T3 cells performing overlay assays as previously described (19Muchardt C. Guilleme M. Seeler J.S. Trouche D. Dejean A. Yaniv M. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Fixed and permeabilized NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with recombinant GST-HP1α fusion protein in the presence of different peptide competitors. Fig. 3C, panels 2 and 10, show a specific nuclear localization of GST-HP1α (compared with control GST, panels 1 and 9), similar to the predominant localization of endogenous HP1α to foci of pericentromeric heterochromatin (Ref. 9Maison C. Almouzni G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and data not shown). The localization of HP1 did not change when unmethylated H1.4 peptide was added as competitor (panels 3 and 11). However, addition of the meK26/H1.4 peptide results in displacement of GST-HP1 from the pericentromeric heterochromatin foci and a clear reduction of the nuclear staining (panels 4 and 12) as it is observed with the meK9/H3 peptide competitor (panels 7 and 15). Addition of the meK26/phosphoS27/H1.4 peptide fails to compete for GST-HP1α binding and does not affect the HP1α localization (panels 5 and 13). Use of phosphatase treated meK26/phosphoS27/H1.4 peptide restores the competition capacity of the peptide (compare panels 6 and 14 with panels 4 and 12 and 5 and 13). Note that as described previously (19Muchardt C. Guilleme M. Seeler J.S. Trouche D. Dejean A. Yaniv M. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) the meK9/phosphoS10/H3 peptide causes HP1 displacement from pericentromeric heterochromatin foci, suggesting that our approach with the short peptides is relevant to the native histone molecules (panels 8 and 16). HP1 Binds to Native Methylated H1.4—We then used purified native H1.4 from human HL60 cells to assess HP1 binding. Fig. 4A shows that HP1 full-length (lane 1) and HP1 CD (lane 2) bind native H1.4. No binding is observed with the HP1 CSD (lane 6). Strikingly, only a meK26/H1.4 peptide competitor disrupts this binding (lane 4), but not an unmethylated H1.4 peptide (lane 3), indicating that the Lys26 methylation of native H1.4 is important for the binding. Interestingly, a meK26/phosphoS27/H1.4 peptide cannot compete for this binding (lane 5). To verify the importance of the Lys26 methylation for the binding to HP1 we asked whether HP1 binds preferentially to methylated H1.4. To this end we raised a meK26/H1.4-specific antibody (see supplemental Fig. 1). We then tested whether using an HP1β affinity column results in an enrichment of Lys26-methylated H1.4. Using the meK26/H1.4-specific antibody we detected a significant enrichment of Lys26-methylated H1.4 bound to HP1 compared with total H1.4 bound to HP1 (Fig. 4C, compare lane 1 and 2, top and bottom panels). With the help of quantification software we determined an ∼2.5-fold enrichment of methylated H1.4 bound to HP1 (Fig. 4C, histogram). Taken together these data suggest that binding of HP1 to methylated K26/H1.4 is important for tethering HP1 to chromatin. Moreover simultaneous phosphorylation of Ser27 prevents binding of HP1 to H1. HP1 Binds to Methylated K26/H1.4—In this study we show that HP1 binds in vitro specifically to H1.4 peptides and native H1.4 methylated on Lys26 and that this binding is specifically competed with meK26/H1.4 peptides (Figs. 1 and 4). Moreover, we have mapped the interaction site to the CD of HP1 and demonstrated that the CD needs to be intact for HP1 to bind to meK26/H1.4 (Figs. 2 and 4). Importantly the phosphorylation of Ser27 prevents the binding of HP1 to methylated H1.4 (Fig. 3). Despite the sequence similarity around K26/H1.4 and K9/H3 our competition studies suggest that the binding to meK26/H1.4 is specific (Fig. 1D). The fact that we detect binding of purified human H1.4 to HP1 and an enrichment of methylated H1.4 (Fig. 4) strongly supports the relevance of our finding. Losson and colleagues (20Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) showed that HP1 interacts with H1. They demonstrated by far-Western analysis that the hinge region of HP1α binds to H1. This binding might provide an additional contact and might have a role in stabilizing the interaction between HP1 and H1. We observe a specific interaction of the HP1 CD with human H1.4. In our experiments the HP1 CD can also bind to purified human H1 containing nucleosomes (data not shown). Additionally, we can compete HP1 in vitro from chromatin (Fig. 1F) and change the nuclear localization of HP1 (Fig. 3C) by competition with methylated H1.4 peptides. Differences to Nielsen et al. (20Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) might be due to different experimental conditions and approaches and the use of different H1 sources. We used purified human H1.4 and human-based H1.4 peptides in our experiments, while Nielsen et al. (20Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) used calf thymus H1. There is so far no evidence that calf H1 can be methylated at Lys26. Moreover among different species, the region surrounding Lys26, which may be important for the binding of HP1 varies. All our results point strongly toward an interaction of the HP1 CD with methylated human H1.4. Lys26 is present in all of the somatic linker histone subtypes but, however, not in more specialized H1 variants. At least H1.2 and H1.4 are methylated at Lys26 (21Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Vaquero A. Preissner T.S. Scher M. Kirmizis A. Ouyang X. Brockdorff N. Abate-Shen C. Farnham P. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), but only H1.4 is known to be phosphorylated at the neighboring serine. The regions around Lys26 differ between the variants. Therefore it will be interesting to test the binding of HP1 to other methylated H1 variants besides H1.4. A Possible Function for H1 Methylation—The binding of HP1 to methylated K9/H3 is necessary but not sufficient (10Stewart M.D. Li J. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) for targeting HP1 to chromatin. In line with this, HP1 and methylated K9/H3 do not completely colocalize (9Maison C. Almouzni G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), which raises the question whether additional HP1 interaction sites are involved in tethering HP1. Binding of HP1 to methylated H1.4 could provide these additional interactions. So far the only described HMT that can methylate K26/H1 is Ezh2. The binding of HP1 to methylated K26/H1.4 would be consistent with the role of H1 methylation by Ezh2 in transcriptional repression (14Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recently, an interaction between Su(z)12, a component of PRC2, and HP1 has been described (22Yamamoto K. Sonoda M. Inokuchi J. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 401-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore PRC2 could have a role in recruiting HP1 (and vice versa). This suggests the existence of an extended self-sustaining loop; HP1 can bind to methylated K9/H3 and/or methylated K26/H1.4 and interacts with the methyltransferases Ezh2 and Suv39 that methylate K26/H1.4 and K9/H3, respectively. This loop might have an important role in gene repression and heterochromatinization. H1 binding to chromatin is dynamic; the linker histone does not remain associated with a specific site throughout the cell cycle (23Bustin M. Catez F. Lim J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 617-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In a similar way HP1 binding to chromatin seems to be highly dynamic (24Cheutin T. McNairn A.J. Jenuwein T. Gilbert D.M. Singh P.B. Misteli T. Science. 2003; 299: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the dynamic localization of HP1 on chromatin could be, at least partially, a consequence of the dynamic association of H1 with chromatin. It is important to notice that post-translational modifications of H1 can modulate its association with nucleosomes (25Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). If the methylation of K26/H1.4 might modulate its residence time on a specific nucleosome, the hypothesis of a differential targeting of HP1 to specific sites of chromatin via methylated H1.4 is quite appealing. Testing this and being able to demonstrate how general the role of H1 methylation in targeting of HP1 is in vivo awaits the development of methyl-K26/H1.4 specific antibodies that are suitable for immunocytochemistry or immunoprecipitation. Simultaneous Phosphorylation and Methylation of H1.4 Prevents HP1 Binding—The phosphorylation of H1 increases the dynamic exchange of H1 from chromatin (26Dou Y. Bowen J. Liu Y. Gorovsky M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and it is involved in gene activation and repression (27Dou Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 225-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of H1 has also been correlated with chromatin decondensation (28Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Lys26 in H1.4 is within a modification cluster (15Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar); it can be methylated or acetylated, and neighboring Ser27 can be phosphorylated (12Garcia B.A. Busby S.A. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Given that methylation of H1.4 might have a role in tethering HP1 to chromatin and heterochromatinization, then loss of HP1 could be necessary for decondensation. This could be regulated by phosphorylation of S27/H1.4 and the resulting displacement of HP1. In the case of H3, the phosphorylation of S10/H3 does not result in loss of HP1 binding (Fig. 3C and Ref. 29Mateescu B. England P. Halgand F. Yaniv M. Muchardt C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that despite a sequence similarity each phospho-methyl mark behaves differently. Our finding that phosphorylation leads to loss of HP1 binding is in agreement with the binary switch hypothesis postulated by Allis and colleagues (15Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and extends it toward linker histone H1. This is also the first experimental evidence showing that adjacent phosphorylation could reverse the effect of histone lysine methylation. In conclusion we have shown a new, specific binding of HP1 to methylated Lys26 on histone H1.4, a mechanism that may explain, at least partially, how HP1 could be tethered to chromatin particularly to regions lacking methylated K9/H3. Importantly, simultaneous phosphorylation of the neighboring residue blocks HP1 binding. However, the events that lead to HP1 recruitment to methylated K26/H1.4 in vivo await further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2005249317,"Vertebrate eggs awaiting fertilization are arrested at metaphase of meiosis II by a biochemical activity termed cytostatic factor (CSF). This activity inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that triggers anaphase onset and mitotic/meiotic exit by targeting securin and M-phase cyclins for destruction. On fertilization a transient rise in free intracellular calcium causes release from CSF arrest and thus APC/C activation. Although it has previously been shown that calcium induces the release of APC/C from CSF inhibition through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), the relevant substrates of this kinase have not been identified. Recently, we characterized XErp1 (Emi2), an inhibitor of the APC/C and key component of CSF activity in Xenopus egg extract. Here we show that calcium-activated CaMKII triggers exit from meiosis II by sensitizing the APC/C inhibitor XErp1 for polo-like kinase 1 (Plx1)-dependent degradation. Phosphorylation of XErp1 by CaMKII leads to the recruitment of Plx1 that in turn triggers the destruction of XErp1 by phosphorylating a site known to serve as a phosphorylation-dependent degradation signal. These results provide a molecular explanation for how the fertilization-induced calcium increase triggers exit from meiosis II."

Crystal structures in different nucleotide states have been determined that identify conformational changes in the nitrogenase complex during ATP turnover. These structures reveal distinct and mutually exclusive interaction sites on the MoFe-protein surface that are selectively populated, depending on the Fe-protein nucleotide state. A consequence of these different docking geometries is that the distance between redox cofactors, a critical determinant of the intermolecular electron transfer rate, is coupled to the nucleotide state. More generally, stabilization of distinct docking geometries by different nucleotide states, as seen for nitrogenase, could enable nucleotide hydrolysis to drive the relative motion of protein partners in molecular motors and other systems."

Friction along the aperiodic direction is one-eighth as much as that along the periodic direction.

https://openalex.org/W2102365921,"A universal response to changes in cellular oxygen tension is governed by a family of heterodimeric transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Tumor hypoxia, as well as various cancer-causing mutations, has been shown to elevate the level of HIF-1alpha, signifying a critical role of the HIF pathway in cancer development. The recently identified third member of the human HIF-alpha family, HIF-3alpha, produces multiple splice variants that contain extra DNA binding elements and protein-protein interaction motifs not found in HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha. Here we report the molecular cloning of the alternatively spliced human HIF-3alpha variant HIF-3alpha4 and show that it attenuates the ability of HIF-1 to bind hypoxia-responsive elements located within the enhancer/promoter of HIF target genes. The overexpression of HIF-3alpha4 suppresses the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous HIF-3alpha4 increases transcription by hypoxia-inducible genes. HIF-3alpha4 itself is oxygen-regulated, suggesting a novel feedback mechanism of controlling HIF-1 activity. Furthermore, the expression of HIF-3alpha4 is dramatically down-regulated in the majority of primary renal carcinomas. These results demonstrate an important dominant-negative regulation of HIF-1-mediated gene transcription by HIF-3alpha4 in vivo and underscore its potential significance in renal epithelial oncogenesis."

Here we characterize these patterns for tropical reef fishes and corals across a 10,000-kilometer biodiversity gradient. Numerical abundance and resource-use distributions have similar shapes, but they emerge at markedly different scales. These results are consistent with a controversial null hypothesis regarding community structure, according to which abundance distributions arise from the interplay of multiple stochastic environmental and demographic factors. Our findings underscore the importance of robust conservation strategies that are appropriately scaled to the broad suite of environmental processes that help sustain biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2149689856,"Aquaporins are a family of water channels found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. A subfamily of aquaporins, the aquaglyceroporins, are permeable for water as well as certain solutes such as glycerol, lactate, and urea. Here we show that the brain contains two isoforms of AQP9--an aquaglyceroporin with a particularly broad substrate specificity--and that the more prevalent of these isoforms is expressed in brain mitochondria. The mitochondrial AQP9 isoform is detected as an approximately 25 kDa band in immunoblots. This isoform is likely to correspond to a new AQP9 mRNA that is obtained by alternative splicing and has a shorter ORF than the liver isoform. Subfractionation experiments and high-resolution immunogold analyses revealed that this novel AQP9 isoform is enriched in mitochondrial inner membranes. AQP9 immunopositive mitochondria occurred in astrocytes throughout the brain and in a subpopulation of neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and arcuate nucleus. In the latter structures, the AQP9 immunopositive mitochondria were located in neurons that were also immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase, as demonstrated by double labeling immunogold electron microscopy. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial AQP9 is a hallmark of astrocytes and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In physiological conditions, the flux of lactate and other metabolites through AQP9 may confer an advantage by allowing the mitochondria to adjust to the metabolic status of the extramitochondrial cytoplasm. We hypothesize that the complement of mitochondrial AQP9 in dopaminergic neurons may relate to the vulnerability of these neurons in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2053826548,"Acrolein is a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, but the factors that control its reactions with nucleophilic groups on proteins remain poorly understood. Lipid peroxidation and threonine oxidation by myeloperoxidase are potential sources of acrolein during inflammation. Because both pathways are implicated in atherogenesis and high density lipoprotein (HDL) is anti-atherogenic, we investigated the possibility that acrolein might target the major protein of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), for modification. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that lysine 226, located near the center of helix 10 in apoA-I, was the major site modified by acrolein. Importantly, this region plays a critical role in the cellular interactions and ability of apoA-I to transport lipid. Indeed, we found that conversion of Lys-226 to Nϵ-(3-methylpyridinium)lysine by acrolein associated quantitatively with decreased cholesterol efflux from cells via the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 pathway. In the crystal structure of truncated apoA-I, Glu-234 lies adjacent to Lys-226, suggesting that negatively charged residues might direct the modification of specific lysine residues in proteins. Finally, immunohistochemical studies with a monoclonal antibody revealed co-localization of apoA-I with acrolein adducts in human atherosclerotic lesions. Our observations suggest that acrolein might interfere with normal reverse cholesterol transport by HDL by modifying specific sites in apoA-I.

Chemical damage to key proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of many disorders, including diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and ischemiareperfusion injury and perhaps to the aging process itself (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar).

Res. 2005; 96: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), may be one physiologically important target of aldehyde compounds. Its protective effect has been attributed partly to the ability of its major protein, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), to mobilize cholesterol from macrophages of the arterial wall to the liver, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (18Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because this protein accounts for ∼70% of HDL total protein content, structural alterations to apoA-I that inhibit HDL function might be pivotal to atherogenesis (19Bergt C. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1488-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because HDL is the major carrier of lipid hydroperoxides in plasma (20Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K.

Pathways that oxidize HDL and thereby impair its function may, thus, be pivotal to the development of atherosclerosis (19Bergt C. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Bielicki J.K. Forte T.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Modification is associated with loss of the ability of HDL to activate lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (30McCall M.R. Tang J.Y. Bielicki J.K. Forte T.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a key enzyme in reverse cholesterol transport. However, it is unknown whether HDL in the human artery wall is vulnerable to modification by acrolein or other reactive aldehydes. HDL apolipoproteins remove cellular cholesterol and phospholipids by a cholesterol-inducible active transport process mediated by a cell membrane protein called ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (18Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 31Wang N. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Lipid poor apoA-I promotes the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids from macrophages exclusively by this pathway. The process appears to involve the amphipathic α-helical domains of apoA-I (32Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we demonstrate that acrolein impairs the ability of apoA-I to promote cellular cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. Moreover, we show that a single lysine (Lys-226) in helix 10 of apoA-I is major target of acrolein and that conversion of this residue to MP-Lys is quantitatively associated with inhibition of ABCA1 activity. Importantly, our immunohistochemical studies demonstrate co-localization of acrolein adducts and apoA-I in human atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, acrolein and perhaps other reactive aldehydes may interfere with normal HDL cholesterol transport by modifying apoA-I in the human artery wall. A preliminary account of this work was presented at the Eighth International Symposium on the Maillard reaction (33Shao B. O'Brien K.D. McDonald T.O. Fu X. Oram J.F. Uchida K. Heinecke J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1043: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HPLC grade acetonitrile (CH3CN) and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Fisher. Unless otherwise indicated, all other materials were purchased from Sigma. Isolation of HDL and ApoA-I—Blood collected from healthy subjects who had fasted overnight was anticoagulated with EDTA. HDL (density 1.125-1.210 g/ml) was prepared from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation and was depleted of apolipoproteins E and B100 by heparin-agarose chromatography (34Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I was purified to apparent homogeneity from HDL (34Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad), with albumin as the standard. The Human Studies Committees at University of Washington School of Medicine approved all protocols involving human material. Acrolein Modification—Reactions with isolated apoA-I (25 μm, 0.7 mg protein/ml), HDL (1 mg protein/ml), or synthetic peptides (100 μm) were carried out at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA. Reactions were initiated by adding acrolein and terminated by adding a 20-fold molar excess (relative to acrolein) of aminoguanidine. When indicated, reaction mixtures were reduced with a 50-fold molar excess (relative to protein or peptide) of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Proteolytic Digestion—Native or acrolein-modified apoA-I or HDL was incubated overnight at 37 °C with a 20:1 ratio (w/w) of endoproteinase Glu-C (from Staphylococcus aureus V8), sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), or Glu-C/trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8). Digestion was halted by acidifying (pH 2-3) with trifluoroacetic acid. Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)—LC-ESI-MS analyses were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) coupled to a Waters 2690 HPLC system (Milford, MA) (35Fu X.

Synthetic peptides and peptide digests were separated on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS column, 25 × 2.1-mm inner diameter) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using solvent A (0.2% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.2% formic acid in 90% CH3CN and 10% water). Solvent B was kept at 0% for 8 min, increased to 10% in 2 min, and then increased to 35% over 35 min for synthetic peptides or to 40% over 60 min for peptide digests. The electrospray needle was held at 4500 V. Nitrogen, the sheath gas, was set at 60 units. The collision gas was helium. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)—MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using a Voyager-DE STR system equipped with delayed extraction (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The matrices were α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid for peptide digests and sinapinic acid for intact protein. The spectra of peptide digests were obtained in the positive reflectron mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The spectra of intact proteins were obtained in the positive linear mode using an accelerating voltage of 25 kV. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated under reducing and denaturing conditions on 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue. For Western blotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). ApoA-I was detected with a goat polyclonal antibody to human apoA-I (1:10,000 dilution; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000 dilution). Acrolein-modified apoA-I was detected with the monoclonal antibody mAb5F6 (1:5,000 dilution) (4Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Sakai K. Matsda T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Suzuki D. Miyata T. Noguchi N. Niki E.

Visualization of immunoreactive bands was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunohistochemical Studies—Human coronary artery segments were obtained from hearts excised at the time of cardiac transplantation.

Single-label immunohistochemistry was performed using previously described techniques (37O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A.

Efflux of Cellular Cholesterol and Phospholipid—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing mifepristone-inducible human ABCA1 were radiolabeled with either [3H]cholesterol or [3H]choline. Expression of ABCA1 was induced by incubating cells for 20 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 nm mifepristone. Efflux of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]choline-labeled phospholipids was measured after a 2-h incubation with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin without or with apoA-I as described (39Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7622-7628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 40Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cholesterol or phospholipid efflux mediated by apoA-I was calculated as the percentage of total [3H]lipid (medium plus cell) released into the medium after subtracting the value obtained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin alone. BHK cells incubated with native or acrolein-modified apoA-I for up to 4 h showed no changes in morphology or in cell protein or cholesterol and phospholipid content per well. FDP-Lys, MP-Lys, and Nim-propanalhistidine Are the Major Products when Synthetic Peptides Are Exposed to Acrolein—In vitro studies have suggested that acrolein modifies amino groups, guanidine groups, sulfhydryl groups, and imidazole groups (3Witz G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 10Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

Aging. 2005; 26: 465-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate the reactions with acrolein of amino acid side chains containing these nucleophiles, we synthesized four model peptides: Ac-GEYAHKY (HK), Ac-GEYAEKY (EK), Ac-GEYARKY (RK), and Ac-GEYAREY (RE). In peptide HK the imidazole and amino groups compete directly to react with acrolein. Peptides RE and RK were designed to determine the reactivity of Arg. Peptides EK and RK explored the impact of an adjacent positively or negatively charged group on the reactivity of Lys. The N-terminal group of each peptide was acetylated to prevent the primary amine from participating in the reactions. We did not explore the reactivity of thiol groups because apoA-I lacks cysteine residues. Each peptide was exposed to acrolein in phosphate buffer supplemented with DTPA (to chelate redox-active metal ions (41Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar)) for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with aminoguanidine with or without subsequent reduction with NaBH4 and then analyzed by LC-ESI-MS. We initially focused on peptide HK. After the peptide was exposed to acrolein and reduced with NaBH4, LC-ESI-MS analysis detected several products (Fig. 1). One product exhibited a major ion at m/z 967.4, which was consistent with the addition of 58 atomic mass units to the protonated peptide [peptide + 58 atomic mass units + H]+. MS/MS analysis of this product demonstrated b5 and b6 ions that had gained 58 atomic mass units (Fig. 1B), indicating that acrolein had converted His to His+58. In the absence of reduction the apparent mass of the His in the modified peptide increased by 56 atomic mass units, strongly suggesting that the adduct was Nim-propanalhistidine (His+56) (4Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Sakai K. Matsda T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Suzuki D. Miyata T. Noguchi N. Niki E. Osawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4882-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Two other products exhibited major ions at m/z 1005.3 [peptide + 96 atomic mass units + H]+ and m/z 985.5 [peptide + 76 atomic mass units + H]+. MS/MS analysis demonstrated that Lys was modified in these peptides and that its apparent mass had increased by 96 or 76 atomic mass units (Fig. 1, C and D; K+96 and K+76). In the absence of reduction, the mass of the Lys+96 adduct was shifted to Lys+94, but the Lys+76 adduct exhibited the same apparent Mr in the presence or absence of reduction. These observations are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that acrolein reacts with Lys to form FDP-Lys (K+94) and MP-Lys (K+76) (4Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Sakai K. Matsda T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Suzuki D. Miyata T. Noguchi N. Niki E. Osawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4882-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 12Furuhata A. Ishii T. Kumzawa S. Yamada T. Nakayama T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48658-48665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We also used LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS to determine whether peptides EK, RE, and RK reacted with acrolein. FDP-Lys and MP-Lys were readily detectable in the peptides containing Lys. In contrast, we failed to detect adducts of Arg in peptides RE or RK (with or without reduction), which suggests that the guanidine group of these peptides had failed to react with the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde or that acrolein adducts of Arg were reversible under our experimental conditions. We quantified the product yields of FDP-Lys and MP-Lys using reconstructed ion chromatograms of the precursor and product peptides. At a mole ratio of acrolein to peptide of 10:1 and an incubation time of 24 h, all the peptides gave a similar (25-42%) product yield of FDP-Lys (K+94) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the product yields of MP-Lys varied over a 10-fold range (1-15%), suggesting that the local amino acid environment might strongly affect the reaction pathway. At relatively low mole ratios of aldehyde to peptide (<10:1), the product yield of the Lys adducts was linearly dependent on the concentration of acrolein (Fig. 2A). Acrolein initially reacted rapidly with the Lys residue in each peptide, but the reaction rate gradually decreased (Fig. 2B). Under all conditions, FDP-Lys was the major product in peptides EK and RK. MP-Lys was also a major product in peptide HK (Fig. 2), whereas MP-Lys was always a minor product in peptides EK and RK (data not shown). We also quantified Nim-propanalhistidine (His+56) after exposing peptide HK to acrolein (10:1, mol/mol) for 24 h (Fig. 2). Approximately 50% of the His residue was converted to Nim-propanalhistidine, indicating that the yield of His+56 was similar to that of Lys+96 (FDP-Lys) plus Lys+76 (MP-Lys). It should be noted that we also observed peptides with adducts of both His and Lys (H+56, K+94, and H+56, K+76) when we exposed peptide HK to acrolein. This suggests that modifying one of these amino acids does not prevent the side chain of the other from reacting. Collectively, these observations indicate that Lys and His are major targets of acrolein in the synthetic peptides HK, EK, and RK. Moreover, high yields of FDP-Lys were produced in all the Lys-containing peptides, whereas the yield of MP-Lys depended on the sequence of each peptide. In contrast, we were unable to detect stable adducts of Arg after we incubated RK or ER for variable times with a wide range of acrolein concentrations. MP-Lys, but Not FDP-Lys or Nim-propanalhistidine, Is the Major Product When ApoA-I Reacts with Acrolein—The 10 amphipathic helical domains in apoA-I, the major protein in HDL, are thought to play essential roles in lipid binding, lipoprotein stability, and reverse cholesterol transport (42Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 853-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sorci-Thomas M.G. Thomas M.J. Trends Cardiovasc.

Our peptide studies suggested that acrolein reacts with residues that contain primary amines and imidazoles, and apoA-I contains 21 Lys and 5 His residues (Fig. 3). To determine which of these amino acids acrolein can modify, we exposed apoA-I to the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde at neutral pH in phosphate buffer containing a metal chelator for 24 h at 37 °C. After terminating the reaction with aminoguanidine, a proteolytic digest of the protein was analyzed by LC-ESI-MS, LC-ESI-MS/MS, and MALDI-TOF-MS. Because apoA-I is rich in Lys and Arg residues, a tryptic digest yields many small peptides that are poorly retained on a reverse-phase column. ApoA-I digested with Glu-C (which cleaves peptide bonds C-terminal to glutamic acid in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (45Drapeau G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)) produces fewer, larger peptides, but several contain multiple Lys residues.

We tested the hypothesis that EP 80317, a novel CD36 ligand derived from the growth hormone (GH)-releasing peptide family but devoided of any GH releasing activity, exerts anti-atherosclerotic effects in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice fed an atherogenic diet from 6 wk of age. Daily subcutaneous injections of EP 80317 (300 microg/kg) or vehicle were initiated at 6, 10, 12, or 14 wk until death at 18 wk. En face analyses of the entire aortic tree revealed a striking reduction (up to 51%) of lesion areas in EP 80317-treated apoE-/- mice compared with controls. Chronic treatment with EP 80317 (12 wk) is also associated with a 30% decrease in total plasma cholesterol, suggesting potential effects of this drug on cholesterol metabolism at the intestine/hepatic levels. EP 80317 exerts both preventive and curative effects on atherosclerotic lesion progression that were shown to be reversible after cessation of treatment. At the macrophage level, EP 80317 reduced oxidized low density lipoproteins internalization and up-regulated genes involved in cholesterol efflux, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), liver x receptor alpha (LXRalpha), and the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, supporting a role in regulating peripheral cholesterol trafficking. Importantly, the effects of EP 80317 were shown to be CD36 dependent, inasmuch as no anti-atherosclerotic or hypocholesterolemic effects were observed in apoE/CD36 double-deficient mice. In addition, long-term treatment of apoE/CD36 double-deficient mice with EP 80317 did not modulate the expression of genes of the PPARgamma-LXRalpha-ABC transporters pathway.

Here, we have demonstrated the potential of lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, for the restoration of impaired remyelination mediated through enhanced survival and differentiation of OPs in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals. Lovastatin treatment significantly increased the level of myelin lipids in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals, coinciding with the attenuation of disease severity and inflammatory demyelination as compared with untreated EAE animals. The increased expression of myelin proteins and transcription factors associated with differentiating oligodendrocytes along with the increase in number of NG2+/BrdU- and NG2+/BrdU+ cells, and the expression of proliferating OP-specific proteins, demonstrated the restoration of remyelination in the spinal cord of lovastatin-treated EAE animals. Corresponding to this, in vitro studies further corroborated the increased survival and differentiation of OPs in lovastatin-treated activated mixed glial cells suggesting that lovastatin protects against the degeneration of OPs and enhances their differentiation through induction of a pro-remyelinating environment in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals. Together, these data demonstrate that lovastatin has the potential to augment remyelination in MS lesions and other neuroinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2073310884,"Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; EC 5.3.1.9) is a housekeeping cytosolic enzyme of the sugar metabolism pathways that plays a key role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. PGI is a multifunctional dimeric protein that extracellularly acts as a cytokine with properties that include autocrine motility factor (AMF) eliciting mitogenic, motogenic, differentiation functions and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Since metastasis is regulated in part by hypoxia, which induces the transcription of metastasis-associated genes and anaerobic glycolic metabolism, we questioned whether hypoxia also regulates the expression level of tumor cells' PGI/AMF. We establish here that in the human breast carcinoma BT-549 cells hypoxia enhanced expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, which in turn led to the up-regulation of PGI/AMF expression and was specifically inhibited by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase signaling pathway. In addition, the hypoxia induction of PGI/AMF expression was suppressed by inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptors, suggesting that hypoxia-inducible VEGF regulates the PGI/AMF expression. Hypoxia also enhanced cancer cell motility, and these effects were strongly inhibited by the PGI/AMF, VEGF, or VEGF receptor inhibitors. The results presented here suggest that under hypoxic conditions the expression of PGI/AMF is regulated in part by the HIF pathway, which in turn increases the flow of the glycolytic cascade leading to an increased anaerobic energy generation; thus, inhibition of PGI/AMF expression and activities may provide a new therapeutic modality for treatment of hypoxic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2059578188,"Mouse lines with targeted disruption of the cocaine amphetamine-related transcript (CART), melanocortin receptor 3 (MCR3), or melanocortin receptor 4 (MCR4) were used to assess the role of each component in mediating the anorectic and metabolic effects of leptin, and in regulating the partitioning of nutrient energy between fat and protein deposition. Leptin was administered over a 3 day period using either intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular routes of injection. The absence of MCR4 blocked leptin's ability to increase UCP1 mRNA in both brown and white adipose tissue, but not its ability to reduce food consumption. In contrast, deletion of MCR3 compromised leptin's ability to reduce food consumption, but not its ability to reduce fat deposition or increase UCP1 expression in adipose tissue. Leptin-dependent effects on food consumption and adipocyte gene expression were unaffected by the absence of CART. Repeated measures of body composition over time indicate that the absence of either MCR3 or MCR4, but not CART, increased lipid deposition and produced comparable degrees of adiposity in both lines. Moreover, modest increases in fat content of the diet (4 to 11%) accentuated fat deposition and produced a rapid and comparable 10-12% increase in % body fat in both genotypes. The results indicate that nutrient partitioning, as well as the anorectic and metabolic responses to leptin, are dependent on integrated but separable inputs from the melanocortin 3 and 4 receptor subtypes."

However, the mechanisms by which they recycle back to the cell surface are still poorly defined. We have recently demonstrated that the small Rab11 GTPase protein is a determinant factor in controlling the recycling to the cell surface of the β-isoform of the thromboxane A2 receptor (TPβ) following its internalization. Here, we demonstrate with co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 cells that there is a Rab11-TPβ association occurring in the absence of agonist, which is not modulated by stimulation of TPβ. We show with purified TPβ intracellular domains fused to GST and HIS-Rab11 proteins that Rab11 interacts directly with the first intracellular loop and the C-tail of TPβ. Amino acids 335–344 of the TPβ C-tail were determined to be essential for the interaction of Rab11 with this receptor domain. This identified sequence appears to be important in directing the intracellular trafficking of the receptor from the Rab5-positive intracellular compartment to the perinuclear recycling endosome. Interestingly, our data indicate that TPβ interacts with the GDP-bound form, and not the GTP-bound form, of Rab11 which is necessary for recycling of the receptor back to the cell surface.

These proteins, which contain seven transmembrane domains, are responsible for communicating stimuli from the environment to the cell in order to produce a broad variety of physiological responses. They respond to a wide range of stimulants including light, hormones, neurotransmitters, and odorants, and generate responses as diverse as cell contraction, secretion, chemotaxis, and proliferation. It is well known that different molecular mechanisms regulate GPCRs signaling cascades. Following agonist binding, many GPCRs undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation, internalization, and resensitization or down-regulation, resulting in a control of the expression of cell surface receptors as well as agonist sensitivity (2von Zastrow M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our laboratory is interested in the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular trafficking of the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP), a rhodopsin-like GPCR.The prostanoid thromboxane A2 (TXA2) mediates morphological changes and aggregation of platelets.

Rab GTPases are associated with specific intracellular compartments and direct the trafficking pathways of intracellular vesicles. For example, Rab11 was shown to be associated with post-Golgi membranes, including the trans-Golgi network, and the perinuclear recycling endosome, which is proposed to regulate the slow return of recycling receptors to the plasma membrane (24Ullrich O.

The cells were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (9 nm pepstatin, 9 nm antipain, 10 nm leupeptin, and 10 nm chymostatin) (Sigma). After the cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 60 min at 4 °C, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. 4 μg of specific polyclonal antibodies were added to the supernatant. After 60 min of incubation at 4 °C, 75 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer was added, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by a 60-min incubation at room temperature. Initial lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using specific antibodies.Recombinant Protein Production and Binding Assays—The pRSET A-HA-Rab11 construct was used to produce a His-tagged HA-Rab11 fusion protein in OverExpress™ C41(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Avidis) by following the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant HA-Rab11 protein was purified using Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) as indicated by the manufacturer. All the constructs in the pGEX-4-T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) listed above were used to produce GST-tagged mutants of TPβCT or ICL fusion proteins also in the Over-Express™ C41(DE3) E. coli strain. All the recombinant mutants of TPβCT and ICL were purified using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated by the manufacturer. Purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. 50 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST mutants of TPβCT or ICL were incubated with 50 μg of purified (His)6-HA-Rab11 in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal) supplemented with proteases inhibitors (9 mm pepstatin, 9 mm antipain, 10 mm leupeptin, and 10 mm chymostatin) (Sigma) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The binding reactions were then washed four times with binding buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the binding reactions, and the tubes were boiled for 5 min. The binding reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed with the indicated specific antibodies or by Ponceau Red S staining.Radioligand Binding Assays—Competition binding curves were done on HEK293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant receptor species. Cells were harvested and washed twice in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 129 mm NaCl, 8.9 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm dextrose, 0.38% sodium citrate, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA). Binding reactions were carried out on 1.5 × 105 cells in a total volume of 0.1 ml in the same buffer with 10 nm [3H]SQ29548 (a TXA2 antagonist) and increasing concentrations of U46619 or nonradioactive SQ29548 for 2 h at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.Measurement of Cell Surface Receptor Loss—For quantification of cell surface receptor loss, ELISA assays were performed as described (16Parent J.L.

HEK293 cells were plated at 8 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish, transfected with 4 μg of DNA, and 24-h after the transfections into 6 wells of a 24-well tissue culture dish coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly(l-lysine) (Sigma). On the following day, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in the presence or the absence of 100 nm of U46619 for different times at 37 °C in prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Then, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with TBS and nonspecific binding blocked with TBS/BSA, 1%, for 45 min. HA-specific monoclonal antibody was then added at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS/BSA, 1%, for 60 min. Following incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed three times with TBS and blocked again with TBS/BSA, 1%, for 15 min. Incubation with goat anti-mouse-conjugated alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:1000 in TBS/BSA, 1%, was carried out for 60 min. The cells were washed three times with TBS and 250 μl of a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate was added. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C until a yellow color appeared. A 100-μl aliquot of the colorimetric reaction was taken, stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 n NaOH, and read at 405 nm using a Titertek Multiskan MCC/340 spectrophotometer. Cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone were studied concurrently to determine background.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy assays were performed as described (23Thériault C. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 911 cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells per 60-mm plate. The next day, cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 alone (control) or cotransfected with pcDNA3-Rab11 or GFP-Rab5 and either pcDNA3-HA-TPβ or pcDNA3-HA-TPβ-(Δ335–344). On the following day, 2 × 105 cells were transferred onto coverslips and further grown overnight. Cells were treated or not with 100 nm U46619 for 120 min at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated in quenching solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized 20 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with HA-specific monoclonal and Rab11-specific polyclonal antibodies where applicable at a dilution of 1:500 in blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked again with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse Rhodamine Red-conjugated and anti-rabbit Oregon Green 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking solution for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were washed four times with permeabilization buffer, two times with PBS, and coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope using a plan fluor ×40/0.75 objective. Image acquisition was done using a Hamamatsu Photonics C4742-95-12ER camera and Simple PCI high performance imaging software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop.RESULTSThe C-terminal Tail of TPβ Interacts Directly with the Small Rab11 GTPase—Recently, we showed by co-localization experiments performed by immunofluorescence microscopy that both constitutive and agonist-triggered internalization resulted in the targeting of TPβ to the Rab11-positive recycling endosome. We also demonstrated that Rab11 regulates the recycling of TPβ (23Thériault C. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of the very strong co-localization of the two proteins and of the dramatic effect of Rab11 on TPβ cell surface expression (23Thériault C. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we suspected a putative interaction between TPβ and Rab11.

https://openalex.org/W1968922975,"Transcription factor NF-κB plays a key regulatory role in the cellular response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). In the absence of TNF, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IκB proteins. Phosphorylation of IκBby the β-catalytic subunit of IKK, a multicomponent IκB kinase, targets the inhibitor for proteolytic destruction and facilitates nuclear translocation of NF-κB. This pathway is initiated by TNF-dependent phosphorylation of T loop serines in IKKβ, which greatly stimulates IκB kinase activity. Prior in vitro mixing experiments indicate that protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) can dephosphorylate these T loop serines and inactivate IKK, suggesting a negative regulatory role for PP2A in IKK signaling. Here we provided several in vivo lines of evidence indicating that PP2A plays a positive rather than a negative role in the regulation of IKK. First, TNF-induced degradation of IκB is attenuated in cells treated with okadaic acid or fostriecin, two potent inhibitors of PP2A. Second, PP2A forms stable complexes with IKK in untransfected mammalian cells. This interaction is critically dependent on amino acid residues 121–179 of the IKKγ regulatory subunit. Third, deletion of the PP2A-binding site in IKKγ attenuates T loop phosphorylation and catalytic activation of IKKβ in cells treated with TNF. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the formation of IKK·PP2A complexes is required for the proper induction of IκB kinase activity in vivo.

NF-κB regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in the control of cell growth, division, and survival. A variety of stimuli can activate NF-κB-mediated gene transcription, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), interleukin-1, T and B cell mitogens, bacterial products, viral proteins, double-stranded RNA, as well as physical and chemical stress. Most of these agonists converge on a latent, cytoplasmic form of NF-κB that associates with IκBα or other members of the inhibitory IκB family. Following cellular stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. In turn, NF-κB is free to translocate to the nuclear compartment where it activates transcription units containing the κB-binding site (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. Karin M.

Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar). Within the prototypic complex are two highly homologous IκB kinase subunits, termed IKKα and IKKβ, which form homo- or heterodimers via their leucine zippers (4Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). In response to various cell stimuli, IKKα and IKKβ are activated by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of their respective T loops at Ser-176/Ser-180 and Ser-177/Ser-181 (7Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). T loop phosphorylation occurs via IKK subunit trans-autophosphorylation and/or the action of upstream kinases (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation of T loop serines, activated IKKα and IKKβ also undergo autophosphorylation at a C-terminal serine cluster, resulting in decreased kinase activity (7Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Despite extensive study of these kinases, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the activation and post-inductive repression of IKK are poorly understood. Signal-induced activation of IKKβ is dependent on its interaction with the regulatory subunit IKKγ, which lacks a kinase domain (8Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 9Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of IKKγ is required for its assembly into a functional IκB kinase complex containing IKKα and IKKβ. In contrast, the C-terminal half of this regulatory subunit is required for the induction of IκB kinase activity, presumably by serving as an interaction surface for upstream signal transducers. For example, IKKγ serves as a molecular adaptor for the Tax oncoprotein of human T cell leukemia virus, type 1, which stimulates persistent activation of IKK (11Sun S.C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular composition of the IKK signalsome remains unclear in terms of the cellular proteins that modulate its transient activity following cellular stimulation with physiologic agonists of NF-κB (12Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE 1999. 1999; : RE1Google Scholar, 13Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The multilevel regulation of IKK by phosphorylation indicates that protein phosphatases may play an important role in IKK signaling. Consistent with this possibility, prior studies with purified proteins have indicated that protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibits IκB kinase activity in vitro (14DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A in cells is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic C subunit (PP2AC), a structural A subunit, and a variable B subunit (reviewed in Refs. 15Janssens V.

Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate that PP2A forms stable complexes with a growing set of cellular protein kinases, presumably to facilitate substrate recognition and rapid signal-dependent changes in their phosphorylation status (reviewed in Ref. 26Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Here we provide several in vivo lines of evidence indicating that PP2A binds to IKK and modulates its catalytic activity. Specifically, we show that TNF-induced degradation of IκB is attenuated in cells treated with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A. PP2A and IKK derived from mammalian cell extracts co-immunoprecipitate and fractionate together on both kinase and phosphatase affinity resins. This phosphatase/kinase interaction is mediated by the IKKγ regulatory subunit. Deletion of the PP2A-binding site in IKKγ (amino acids 121–179) attenuates T loop phosphorylation and catalytic activation of IKKβ induced by enforced cellular expression of either the Tax oncoprotein or the type 1 receptor for TNF. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to wild type IKKγ, IKKγ lacking the PP2A-binding site is unable to restore TNF-induced phosphorylation of IKKβ, degradation of IκBα, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB when the mutant is stably introduced into IKKγ-deficient fibroblasts. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the formation of IKK·PP2A complexes is required for TNF-dependent phosphorylation and activation of IKK in vivo.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9882-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as a template; the second region of IKKγ encoding amino acid residues 180–419 (with a 5′ overhang) was amplified in another PCR by using the sense primer 5′-GAAGGAGGCGCGGCAGCTGG-3′, the antisense primer 5′-TCCGCCTTGTAGATATCCG-3′, and T7-IKKγ/pcDNA3 as a template. The PCR products were allowed to anneal and then amplified by using the outside primers 5′-ATGGGTCGCATGGATCCG-3′ and 5′-TCCGCCTTGTAGATATCCG-3′. The resulting PCR product of IKKγ, lacking the sequence encoding amino acids 121–179, was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated back into BamHI/EcoRV-digested T7-IKKγ/pcDNA3. Proper construction of the plasmid encoding the deletion mutant was verified by automated DNA sequencing (Vanderbilt University DNA Core Facility). Generation of MEF Cell Lines Stably Expressing T7-tagged IKKγ Constructs—Viral stocks were produced by transfecting HEK-293T cells (35-mm dish) with 3 μg of pBABE-Puro encoding the IKK construct, 3 μg of pCL-Ampho, and 1.2 μg of pHSCMV-VSVg (32Yee J.K. Friedmann T. Burns J.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 33Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants containing fully packaged retrovirus were recovered 48 h after transfection and were immediately used for transduction. Transduction was achieved by incubating IKKγ-deficient MEFs with the appropriate viral stock in the presence of Polybrene (0.8 μg/ml). Supernatants were removed 8 h post-infection, and the cells were cultured an additional 48 h in complete DMEM. Transduced cells were selected in DMEM containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% methanol (1 h at 1 A). Proteins on the membrane were visualized with Ponceau S, followed by washing in TTBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 0.2% Tween 20). The membrane was blocked in TTBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin or in Blocking Buffer (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by incubation with the diluted primary antibody. After washing, the membranes were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase- or fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies; bound antibodies were visualized by colorimetric detection or via the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (LiCor). Alternatively, immunoblotting was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system from Amersham Biosciences. Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography—Jurkat T cells (100 ml of cell suspension) were stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 15 min. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 12 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% Triton X-100) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm benzamidine. The clarified cell lysates obtained following centrifugation at 12,000 × g were adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (20 ml) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate and reduced protease inhibitor concentrations (400 ng/ml pepstatin, 200 ng/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm benzamidine). The column was developed (2 ml/min) with a linear gradient (1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in the same buffer), and 4-ml fractions were collected. The peak fractions of IKK activity (fractions 34–45) were pooled and applied to a MonoQ column (1 ml). The MonoQ column was developed (1 ml/min) using a linear gradient (0 to 0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A), and 1-ml fractions were collected. The peak fractions of IKK, which eluted from the MonoQ column between 370 and 400 mm NaCl (fractions 20–22), were pooled and concentrated to 200 μl using a Centricon-30. The concentrated sample was fractionated (0.5 ml/min) on an analytical Superdex-200 gel filtration column (20 ml) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of each column fraction were subjected to Western analysis or assayed for IKK activity. ATP-Sepharose and Microcystin-Sepharose Affinity Purifications—Jurkat T cell lysates (3.5 mg of protein) in 1 ml of Buffer C (50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40) were incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of ATP-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. ATP-Sepharose-bound proteins were washed five times with Buffer C and once with “wash buffer” (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 1% Nonidet P-40). After washing, bound proteins were eluted three times with 75 μl of elution buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EGTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (ATP). The eluted material was then incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of microcystin-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Microcystin-Sepharose-bound proteins were washed five times with wash buffer and eluted two times with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (ATP→ MC). Twenty-μl aliquots of the ATP and ATP→ MC samples and a 20-μl aliquot of Jurkat T cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining or immunoblotting by using IKKα-, IKKβ-, and PP2AC-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitations—One μg of the PP2AC 1D6 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was preincubated with or without 50 μg of the corresponding PP2AC C-terminal peptide (PHVTRRTPDYFL) for 0.5 h on ice. Jurkat T cell lysates (0.5–1.5 mg of protein) were prepared in Buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm benzamidine). Cell extracts were incubated with the PP2AC monoclonal antibody (pretreated ± peptide) and 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose for 4–16 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed four times with “IP wash buffer” (33 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 167 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged IKK subunits was accomplished by incubating cellular extracts (50–60 μg of protein) prepared in Buffer B with 10–15 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-T7-agarose or anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. For immunoblot analyses, bound proteins were washed four times with ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm NaCl), eluted with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For kinase assays, bound proteins were washed sequentially with ELB buffer and kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm NaF, and 50 μm Na3VO4) and assayed as described below. For immunoprecipitation studies with primary B lymphocytes, lysates were prepared from 107 cells in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). Extracts were pre-cleared by incubating with 12 μl of either protein G-Sepharose (PP2AC immunoprecipitations) or protein A-Sepharose (IKK immunoprecipitations) for 1 h at 4°C. The pre-cleared cell extracts were incubated with 2 μg of the PP2AC monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and 12 μl of protein G-Sepharose or with 2 μg of the IKKγ polyclonal antibody (FL-419, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 12 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 12–14 h at 4 °C. As controls, precleared extracts were also incubated with equivalent amounts of normal mouse IgG and protein G-Sepharose or normal rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose. Bound proteins were washed three times with ELB buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In Vitro Kinase Assays—IκB kinase activity was measured in reaction mixtures containing recombinant glutathione S-transferase protein fused to amino acids 1–54 of IκBα(GST-IκBα), 10 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, as described previously (14DiDonato J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A substrate containing alanine replacements for Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα(GST-IκBα MU) was used to assess kinase specificity. The kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then terminated by heat denaturation in the presence of 1% SDS. Radiolabeled phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Microcystin-Sepharose Affinity Isolations—Soluble protein extracts (0.5 mg) of HEK-293T or HeLa cells expressing T7-tagged IKKγ proteins were incubated with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of microcystin-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with Buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Soluble protein extracts of MEF cell lines (0.1 mg) were incubated with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of microcystin-Sepharose in ELB buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with ELB buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis.

However, cellular induction of NF-κB activity in response to prolonged incubation with okadaic acid also coincides with cell death (42Morimoto H. Okamura H. Yoshida K. Kitamura S. Haneji T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), making it difficult to distinguish whether the effects of this phosphatase inhibitor are the direct result of inhibition of phosphatase(s) regulating IKK/NF-κB activities or an indirect result of cellular apoptosis. Although these earlier studies have linked PP2A to the control of NF-κB activation, the precise in vivo role of PP2A in IKK/NF-κB signaling remains unclear. To investigate this question further, we monitored the fate of IκBα in HeLa cells following acute treatment with okadaic acid, the cytokine TNF, or both. As shown"
https://openalex.org/W2124932702,"The isoform-specific interaction of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) pumps with partner proteins has been explored using a yeast two-hybrid technique. The 90 N-terminal residues of two pump isoforms (PMCA2 and PMCA4), which have a low degree of sequence homology, have been used as baits. Screening of 5 × 106 clones of a human brain cDNA library yielded ∼100 LEU2- and galactoside-positive clones for both pumps. A clone obtained with the PMCA4 bait specified the ϵ-isoform of the 14-3-3 protein, whereas no 14-3-3ϵ clone was obtained with the PMCA2 bait. The 14-3-3ϵ protein immunoprecipitated with PMCA4 (not with PMCA2) when expressed in HeLa cells. Overexpression of 14-3-3ϵ in HeLa cells together with targeted aequorins showed that the ability of the cells to export Ca2+ was impaired; stimulation with histamine, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-producing agonist, generated higher cytosolic [Ca2+] transients, higher post-transient plateaus of the cytosolic [Ca2+], and higher Ca2+ levels in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and in the subplasmalemmal domain. Thus, the interaction with 14-3-3ϵ inhibited PMCA4. Silencing of the 14-3-3ϵ gene by RNA interference significantly reduced the expression of 14-3-3ϵ, substantially decreasing the height of the histamine-induced cytosolic [Ca2+] transient and of the post-transient cytosolic [Ca2+] plateau.

In addition to the four basic gene products (PMCA1-4), a complex array of alternative splicing of the primary transcripts of each gene product generates a vast family of additional variants. The finding that the isoforms are differentially distributed among cells whose Ca2+ homeostasis needs differ substantially, e.g. neurons, suggests functional differences among the pump variants. These differences are unlikely to be dramatic and probably concern only subtler aspects related to regulation or even to the differential targeting to selected plasma membrane domains. The information in the literature on functional differences among pump variants is very scarce. Older findings on purified pumps or on pumps in isolated membrane preparations showed that one variant of the pump that is essentially restricted to neurons (PMCA2) has higher calmodulin affinity than the ubiquitous isoform PMCA4 (1Hilfiker H. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that one variant truncated C-terminally by a splicing process that changes the C-terminal part of the calmodulin-binding domain (PMCA2a or CII) has significantly reduced calmodulin affinity (2Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that purified PMCA1 preparations are peculiarly sensitive to calpain proteolysis (3Guerini D. Pan B. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38141-38148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the information obtained on pumps removed from the native cellular environment is necessarily incomplete, as it does not consider the possible effects of the endogenous regulators as well as the concentration of activators, e.g. calmodulin, available to the PMCA pumps in vivo. Thus, a recent study of the activity of pump variants in vivo has unexpectedly shown that C-terminally truncated recombinant pumps, which have reduced calmodulin affinity when tested in the isolated state, are as effective in ejecting Ca2+ from model cells as their full-length counterparts (4Brini M. Coletto L. Pierobon N. Kraev N. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24500-24508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Evidently, in the native cellular environment, sufficient calmodulin may be available to the PMCA pumps to ensure optimal Ca2+ extrusion even by variants that have much reduced affinity for calmodulin. The in vivo work has also shown that, irrespective of calmodulin, the overall Ca2+-extruding ability of the two ubiquitously expressed gene products (PMCA1 and PMCA4) is much lower than that of the two tissue-specific gene products (PMCA2 and PMCA3). plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase cytosol-targeted wild-type aequorin human glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate endoplasmic reticulum subplasmalemma-targeted aequorin mutant endoplasmic reticulum-targeted aequorin mutant mitochondrion-targeted aequorin mutant Krebs-Ringer buffer Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone subplasmalemmal [Ca2+]. An interesting contribution on splice variants, although not immediately related to function, has offered a clue to the reason for the alternative splicing at site A in the first intracellular loop. It is essential for the targeting of pump 2 to the apical region of the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (5Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18464-18470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The matter of endogenous regulators of the activity of PMCA pumps is now beginning to attract attention. A number of studies on possible protein partners of the pumps have appeared, and recent contributions have extended the information to their effects on pump activity. In general, these studies have not considered the possibility of isoform-specific effects, but one interesting contribution has shown that PMCA2 interacts with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-2, whereas PMCA4 does not (6DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Most studies searching for PMCA pump interactors have focused on the C-terminal domain of the pump, showing its ability to bind to the PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains of partner proteins. This work has led to the identification of partners like the membrane-associated guanylate kinases (7DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this study, we have extended the search for interactors to the pump isoforms using a yeast two-hybrid screening procedure and the N-terminal domain (which differs most significantly among the four basic isoforms) of the pump as bait. Two isoforms were chosen for this study, one ubiquitously expressed (PMCA4) and one tissue-restricted (PMCA2). We have identified one protein partner (the 14-3-3ϵ protein) for PMCA4 and have found that it does not interact with PMCA2. The interaction inhibits the activity of the PMCA4 pump. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 75-cm2 Falcon flasks. For the aequorin experiments, the cells were seeded onto 13-mm glass coverslips and allowed to grow to 75% confluence. At this stage, transfection with 4 μg of total DNA (3 μg of the indicated expression plasmids + 1 μg of aequorin) was carried out as described previously (11Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with the expression plasmid for PMCA4 (pSG5/PMCA4) or for PMCA2 (pcDNA3/PMCA2) at 6 μg/well. For small interfering RNA experiments, HeLa cells were plated onto 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected with 16 μg of DNA (14 μg of mitochondrion-targeted green fluorescent protein + 2 μg of cytosol-targeted wild-type aequorin (cytAEQ) in control cells or 14 μg of pSUPER/14-3-3ϵ + 2 μg of cytAEQ). Aequorin measurements or co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed 36 h after transfection. The expression plasmid for 14-3-3ϵ (pEGFP-C1/14-3-3ϵ) was kindly provided by Dr. S. Volinia (University of Ferrara). Plasmid Constructions—The region encoding the N-terminal portion (residues 2-92) of human (h) PMCA4 and PMCA2 was amplified by 30 cycles of PCR (denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) using the following oligonucleotides (with the restriction sites underlined): hPMCA2, 5′-CCGGAATTCGGTGACATGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCGGATCCGCTTTCTTTGGAG-3′ (antisense); and hPMCA4, 5′-CCGGAATTCACGAACCCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGTCTTGGGC-3′ (antisense). The amplified products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in-frame into the cloning sites of plasmid pGilda (Clontech) to generate the DNA-binding fusions (pGilda-P2 and pGilda-P4) for yeast two-hybrid screening and assays. The same sequences were cloned with the appropriate restriction enzymes into the pGEX-4TK vector (Amersham Biosciences) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (GST-P2 and GST-P4). The mammalian expression vector pSUPER (Oligoengene) was used for the expression of small interfering RNA in HeLa cells. The gene-specific insert specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 539-557 downstream of the transcription start site (ggaggctgcggagaacagc) of 14-3-3ϵ, which is separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer (ttcaagaga) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. This sequence was inserted into the pSUPER vector backbone after digestion with BglII and HindIII. This vector is referred to as pSUPER/14-3-3ϵ and was transformed into DH5α competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Oligoengene). After plating on LB medium supplemented with ampicillin, colonies were selected, and the vector was amplified. Positive colonies were identified by the presence of an EcoRI-HindIII restriction fragment of ∼290 bp. (The corresponding fragment from the empty vector is 227 bp.) Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out according to the standard protocol recommended by Clontech. The bait plasmid pGilda and the p8op-lacZ reporter gene plasmid were first transformed in yeast EGY48 cells, followed by transformation of the library of brain cDNA plasmids. Approximately 5 × 106 yeast cells cotransformed with the bait, and cDNAs from a premade human brain cDNA Matchmaker LexA library (Invitrogen) were screened. Positive clones were selected for their ability to grow on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and uracil and were assayed for β-galactosidase activity on medium supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Plasmids containing the brain cDNAs were isolated from positive yeast cells, and their nucleotide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the positive cDNA was isolated from yeast by a miniprep protocol. The cells of the positive clone were resuspended in 1 m sorbitol and 50 mm EDTA with the yeast lytic enzyme (2 mg/ml; MP Biomedicals). After 30 min at 37 °C, the yeast cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved in Hirt's solution (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS) with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) and incubated at 50 °C for >6 h. The plasmid DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The aqueous phase was precipitated with the same volume of 20% polyethylene glycol and 2.5 m NaCl, and the plasmid DNA was pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The plasmid obtained was transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α by electroporation. Co-immunoprecipitations—After 36 h, HeLa cells were rinsed with cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After 30 min on ice, the cells were scraped from the plates using a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 500 μg were used for each immunoprecipitation, to which 2-3 μl of antibody (anti-PMCA monoclonal antibody 5F10, Affinity Bio-Reagents, Golden, CO) were added. After 3 h of rocking at 4 °C, 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were added to each mixture, and rocking was continued overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose was pelleted at 4000 × g for 30 s. The immune complex beads were quickly washed three times with cold PBS. All of the bound protein and 5% of the starting lysate (input) were separated on 10% NuPAGE BisTris gel with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen); transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; and incubated with rabbit anti-14-3-3ϵ, anti-14-3-3ζ, and anti-14-3-3θ polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). GST Fusion Protein Expression and Pull-down Assay—GST and GST-P2 and GST-P4 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 by incubation in LB medium supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and ampicillin at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were pelleted and sonicated in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) plus protease inhibitors. GST fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with Tris-buffered saline, the concentrations and integrity of the fusion proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. For pull-down assay, the HeLa cells were lysed in buffer A. Equal amounts of total lysate of cells expressing equivalent levels of endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms (ϵ, ζ, and θ) were incubated with Sepharose beads containing GST, GST-P2, or GST-P4 and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. After three washings with Tris-buffered saline, the bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli loading buffer; separated on 10% NuPAGE BisTris gel with MOPS running buffer; transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; and incubated with rabbit anti-14-3-3ϵ, anti-14-3-3ζ, and anti-14-3-3θ polyclonal antibodies and mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunofluorescence Experiments—HeLa cells were plated onto 24 × 24-mm coverslips at a density of 3 × 105 cells/coverslip. Transfected cells (hPMCA4 and 14-3-3ϵ) were washed with PBS, warmed at 37 °C, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Unspecific staining was reduced by blocking with 10% horse serum for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight with a 0.1% (v/v) solution of mouse anti-PMCA4 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in 1% horse serum and a 0.1% solution of anti-14-3-3ϵ polyclonal antibody in 1% horse serum. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS. Antibodies that bound to PMCA4 or 14-3-3ϵ were detected by incubating the cells for 2 h in the dark with a 1% (v/v) solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 1% horse serum. Unbound antibody was removed by washing three times with PBS. Fluorescence was visualized using a digital imaging system based on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope equipped with a back-illuminated CCD camera (Roper Scientific) with a ×63 objective and appropriate filters. Some cells were treated only with secondary antibodies and used to calculate background values (due to unspecific binding) in the samples. The data were acquired and processed using MetaMorph Version 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Z-series images were deconvolved using exhaustive photon reassignment EPR software, a point spread function-based deconvolution algorithm developed by the University of Massachusetts Imaging Group (12Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D. Isenberg G. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), running on a Linux-based personal computer. Aequorin Measurements—The probes employed are chimeric aequorins targeted to the cytosol (cytAEQ), subplasmalemmal region (pmAEQmut), endoplasmic reticulum (ER; erAEQmut), and mitochondria (mtAEQmut). “AEQ” refers to wild-type aequorin, and “AEQmut” refers a low affinity D119A mutant of aequorin. For a map of the constructs and detailed information on their characteristics, see Ref. 13Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 335: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar. Reconstitution protocols were different for cytAEQ and mtAEQmut and for erAEQmut and pmAEQmut. For the experiments with cytAEQ and mtAEQmut, cells were incubated with 5 μm coelenterazine for 1-2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. A coverslip with transfected cells was placed in a perfused thermostatted chamber located in close proximity to a low noise photomultiplier with a built-in amplifier/discriminator. To reconstitute erAEQmut with high efficiency, the luminal [Ca2+] of the ER first had to be reduced. This was achieved by incubating the cells for 1 h at 4°C in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) supplemented with 5 μm coelenterazine, 5 μm Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (Sigma), and 600 μm EGTA. After this incubation, cells were extensively washed with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and then transferred to the perfusion chamber. For recombinant aequorin pmAEQmut reconstitution, the cells were transferred to modified KRB (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) supplemented with 100 μm EGTA and 5 μm coelenterazine at 37 °C. After 45 min, the coverslip was transferred to the luminometer chamber and perfused with KRB containing 100 μm EGTA. All aequorin measurements were carried out in KRB supplemented with either 1 mm CaCl2 (cytAEQ and mtAEQmut) or 100 μm EGTA (erAEQmut and pmAEQmut). Agonist and other drugs were added to the same medium as specified in the figure legends. The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-containing solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The output of the discriminator was captured by a Thorn EMI photon-counting board and stored in an IBM-compatible computer for further analyses. The aequorin luminescence data were calibrated offline into [Ca2+] values using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wild-type and mutant aequorins as described previously (14Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Chemicals and reagents were from Sigma or Merck, except for coelenterazine and coelenterazine n, which were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Statistical data are presented as means ± S.E. Fura-2 Acetoxymethyl Ester (Fura-2/AM) Measurements—The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) was evaluated using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Briefly, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 2.5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min, washed with KRB to remove the extracellular probe, supplied with preheated KRB (supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2), and placed in a thermostatted (37 °C) incubation chamber on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200). Dynamic video imaging was performed using MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Fluorescence was measured every 100 ms with the excitation wavelength alternating between 340 and 380 nm and the emission fluorescence being recorded at 510 nm. At the end of the experiment, a region free of cells was selected, and one averaged background frame was collected at each excitation wavelength for background correction. The [Ca2+]c was calculated by the ratio method using the following equation: [Ca2+]c = Kd(R - Rmin)/(R - Rmax) × Sf2/Sf1, where Kd is the dissociation constant of Fura-2/AM for Ca2+ taken as 240 nm at 37 °C, R is the ratio of fluorescence for Fura-2/AM at the two excitation wavelengths (F340/F380), Rmin is the ratio of fluorescence in the presence of minimal calcium obtained by lysing the cells and then chelating all the Ca2+ with 0.5 m EGTA, Rmax is the ratio of fluorescence in the presence of excess calcium obtained by lysing the cells with 10 μm ionomycin, Sf2 is the fluorescence of the Ca2+-free form of Fura-2/AM at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm, and Sf1 is the fluorescence of the Ca2+-bound form of Fura-2/AM at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Western Blot Analysis of Small Interfering RNA Expression—36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 80 μl of buffer A, and kept on ice for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min, and then the supernatants were harvested. The proteins (5 μg) were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The amounts of endogenous 14-3-3ϵ and the marker protein β-tubulin were estimated by Western blotting using rabbit anti-14-3-3ϵ polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Binding of 14-3-3ϵ to the PMCA Pumps—To identify proteins that interact with the N-terminal sequence of PMCA pumps, we used as bait a construct consisting of the LexA DNA-binding domain of pGilda fused to the first 90 amino acids of PMCA4 or PMCA2 to screen a human brain cDNA library. The N-terminal region was chosen because of its low degree of homology among PMCA pumps (∼50% amino acid identity). Approximately 100 LEU2- and galactosidase-positive clones were obtained from both pumps upon screening 5 × 106 clones. Sequencing of the cDNA inserts revealed that a clone obtained using the PMCA4 bait specified amino acids 5-55 of the 14-3-3 protein. This clone was sequenced and identified as the ϵ-isoform of the 14-3-3 protein. To confirm that an interaction had indeed occurred, the yeast EGY48 positive clone was isolated, and the plasmid containing the cDNA corresponding to amino acids 5-55 of the identified 14-3-3ϵ partner was extracted. The purified plasmid was cotransformed with the plasmid bait (pGilda-P4) and used in the β-galactosidase assay. The results confirmed the interaction between the two proteins. No clones specifying the 14-3-3 protein were obtained with the PMCA2 bait. Selective Co-immunoprecipitation and Co-localization of PMCA4 with the 14-3-3ϵ Protein—Based on the high degree of homology (∼65% identity) of the first 55 residues of different 14-3-3 isoforms, we decided to analyze the interaction between PMCA pumps and the ϵ-, θ-, and ζ-isoforms of 14-3-3. (The θ- and ζ-isoforms have 65 and 68% homology to the ϵ-isoform, respectively.) All three isoforms are abundantly expressed in HeLa cells. To test the ability of PMCA4 and PMCA2 to bind the different isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein in the cellular environment, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with the pcDNA3/PMCA2 or pSG5/PMCA4 plasmid construct. 14-3-3ϵ was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-PMCA antibody 5F10 with PMCA4, but not with PMCA2 (Fig. 1A). 14-3-3θ and 14-3-3ζ failed to immunoprecipitate with either PMCA4 or PMCA2. Pull-down assays with HeLa lysates using the GST fusion proteins of the N-terminal domains of PMCA4 (GST-P4) and PMCA2 (GST-P2) confirmed that the interaction with PMCA4 was specific for 14-3-3ϵ (Fig. 1B). To further substantiate the physical interaction between PMCA4 and 14-3-3ϵ in HeLa cells, we cotransfected them with the PMCA4 and 14-3-3ϵ expression plasmids and analyzed the localization of the recombinant proteins by immunofluorescence. PMCA4 and 14-3-3ϵ were detected by staining with a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes PMCA4 and with anti-14-3-3ϵ antibody, respectively. PMCA4 localized at the plasma membrane of transfected cells (Fig. 1C). 14-3-3ϵ localized at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol (Fig. 1C). The merged image shows co-localization of PMCA4 and 14-3-3ϵ (Fig. 1C). Samples incubated with only secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, did not show any staining (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the immunofluorescence detection. These results thus substantiate the finding of an interaction between PMCA4 and 14-3-3ϵ. Effects of 14-3-3ϵ Overexpression on Calcium Signaling in HeLa Cells—The above results prompted us to investigate whether the interaction with 14-3-3ϵ has any effect on the activity of PMCA4, i.e. whether the overexpression of 14-3-3ϵ affects intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recombinant aequorins were cotransfected with 14-3-3ϵ in HeLa cells, which express endogenous PMCA4 (15Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Because the two recombinant proteins were expressed by the same subset of cells, the risks associated with the use of stable clones or single cells were eliminated. As analyzed in detail in our previous studies (14Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), this approach was preferred to the isolation and analysis of stable clones coexpressing the photoprotein and the protein under investigation. The latter approach would be unavoidably plagued by the high intrinsic variability of clones, which, in most case, would mask the effects of the protein of interest. Conversely, transient coexpression of the probe and the protein of interest allows the monitoring of a proportion of the transfected cell population (∼30-40%) and thus better represents the behavior of the parental population. Under these conditions, the effects observed can be reliably ascribed to the transfected population (for more details, see Ref. 14Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows [Ca2+]c monitored with cytAEQ in control cells and in HeLa cells cotransfected with cytAEQ and 14-3-3ϵ. 36 h after transfection, cells were challenged with histamine (100 μm) in medium containing 1 mm CaCl2. The stimulation caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]c in both sets of transfected cells, which was followed by a gradual decline the of trace to a lower plateau. However, the [Ca2+]c increase evoked by histamine in 14-3-3ϵ-transfected cells was significantly higher than in control cells (∼18%) and was followed by a slower declining phase (peak amplitude of 3.38 ± 0.07 μm (n = 11) versus 2.95 ± 0.12 μm (n = 15); p < 0.01). The data suggest an inhibitory effect of 14-3-3ϵ on the function of PMCA, resulting in an increased height and a reduced clearance rate of the [Ca2+] transient. To confirm this effect, we calculated, from the slope of the declining phase of the [Ca2+] transient, the velocity of the Ca2+-ext"

Here we describe the novel finding that l-tryptophan and its derivatives tryptamine, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, serotonin, and indoles-propionic acid strongly inhibit H+-dependent l-[3H]proline uptake into Caco-2 cells with inhibition constants (Ki) of 0.9 to 6.1 mM. Uptake of l-[3H]tryptophan into Caco-2 cells on the other hand was not inhibited by l-proline. Whereas PAT1 substrates produced significant changes in a membrane potential assay for electrogenic transport in Caco-2 cells, l-tryptophan, tryptamine, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan failed to alter membrane voltage. When PAT1 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, glycine elicited high inward currents that were dependent on membrane potential but no currents were observed with l-tryptophan, tryptamine, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, or serotonin. Although not transported electrogenically by PAT1, l-tryptophan and its derivatives inhibited glycine-evoked currents dose-dependently. We conclude that serotonin, l-tryptophan, and tryptamine bind to PAT1 with potencies similar to the prototype substrates, inhibit transport function but are not transported by this carrier protein. They may be considered as the carriers' naturally occurring inhibitors that may alter the transport function of PAT1. Metzner, L., Kottra, G., Neubert, K., Daniel, H., Brandsch, M. Serotonin, l-tryptophan, and tryptamine are effective inhibitors of the amino acid transport system PAT1. FASEB J. 19, 1468–1473 (2005)"
https://openalex.org/W2031136952,"The retinoblastoma protein Rb is critical for the regulation of mammalian cell cycle entry. Hypophosphorylated Rb is considered to be the active form and directs G1 arrest, while hyperphosphorylated Rb permits the transition from G1 to S phase for cell proliferation. Upon stimulation by various growth factors, Rb appears to be phosphorylated by a cascade of phosphorylation events mediated mainly by kinases associated with cyclins D and E. Here we report that in prototype small intestine crypt stem cells (RIEC-6), stimulation with either epidermal growth factor or fetal bovine serum results in an unexpected rapid and sustained Rb phosphorylation at sites Ser780, Ser795, and Thr821 which precedes cyclin D1 expression, cyclin D1/cdk4 complex formation, and cdk4 kinase activity. Rb phosphorylation at Ser780 and Ser795 is prevented by MEK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibitors. In vitro, Rb is directly phosphorylated by active ERK1/2 as shown by [γ-32P]ATP labeling. The phosphorylation sites are further directed to Ser780 and Ser795 by kinase assays using recombined active ERK1/2 or immunoprecipitated phospho-ERK1/2 from mitogen stimulated cells. Pull-down assays revealed that Rb interacts with active ERK1/2 but not their inactive unphosphorylated forms. Upon EGF stimulation, phosphorylated ERK1/2 co-immunoprecipitates together with phosphorylated Rb. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel rapid Rb phosphorylation at specific sites induced by mitogen stimulation in epithelial cells of the small intestine. These data specifically identify ERK1/2 as the kinase responsible for Rb phosphorylation targeted to sites Ser780 and Ser795.

Following the acute loss of intestinal length, there is an important compensatory response that occurs in the remnant bowel. This response, termed adaptation, is primarily a mitogenic signal to the intestinal crypt cells to grow taller villi and deepen the crypts, thereby augmenting the remaining absorptive and digestive mucosal surface area (1O'Brien D.P.

Expressed cyclin D1 associates with cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 4 and 6 causing their activation. Activated cdk4/6 then phosphorylate Rb, which leads to cell cycle progression (15Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism for EGFR directed Rb phosphorylation within crypt enterocytes is fundamental for elucidating a more complete understanding of the process of intestinal adaptation after massive small bowel resection. Rb affects the cell cycle progression by modulation of the activity of E2F transcription factors, which regulate the expression of many genes that are essential for cell cycle progression and S phase entry (16Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 17Dyson N. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1994; 18: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dyson N.

The cyclin D-cdk4/6 complex phosphorylates Rb at early G1 phase and results in its partial activation, thus allowing the transcriptional activation of limited target proteins including cyclin A/E. In late G1 phase, cyclin E associates with cdk2, and the resulting complex further phosphorylates Rb. The hyperphosphorylation of Rb then leads to disruption of the transcriptional repression complex and allows the expression of essential proteins required for G1/S transition. During S phase, cyclin A-cdk2 activity is responsible for maintaining Rb phosphorylation (15Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Most of this information has been derived from experiments using overexpression systems or in cancer cell lines in which the Rb regulation system may already be altered. It is therefore unclear as to what regulates Rb phosphorylation in vivo following a mitogenic stimulus for normal cell cycling. Recently, mice have been generated whereby cyclins D1/D2/D3 (22Malumbres M. Sotillo R. Santamaria D. Galan J. Cerezo A. Ortega S. Dubus P. Barbacid M. Cell. 2004; 118: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) or cdk 4/6 (23Kozar K. Ciemerych M.A. Rebel V.I. Shigematsu H. Zagozdzon A. Sicinska E. Geng Y. Yu Q. Bhattacharya S. Bronson R.T. Akashi K. Sicinski P. Cell. 2004; 118: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) have been inactivated. Both strains of mice developed until mid/late gestation and then died secondary to defects in hematopoiesis. Despite this, it was noted that the majority of other tissues had developed normally. The quiescent cdk4/6-null or cyclin D1/D2/D3-null embryonic fibroblast responded to serum stimulation and re-entered the cell cycle normally although with either lower efficiency or increased requirement for mitogenic stimulation. These in vivo results strongly suggest the presence of an alternative mechanism to initiate cell cycle entry besides the cyclin-cdk pathway. Interestingly, it has been shown that raf-1, which is a MAPKKK, could interact and phosphorylate Rb directly, and disruption of the raf-1/Rb interaction inhibits Rb phosphorylation and cell proliferation (24Dasgupta P. Sun J. Wang S. Fusaro G. Betts V. Padmanabhan J. Sebti S.M. Chellappan S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9527-9541Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Wang S. Ghosh R.N. Chellappan S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7487-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Collectively, accumulated data favor the model of an alterative cyclin-independent pathway that could potentially regulate Rb phosphorylation, thereby playing an important role during mitogen induced cell cycle re-entry. In our current study, we use RIEC-6 cells, which retain the undifferentiated character of the small intestine crypt stem cell (26Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) to investigate EGF-induced Rb phosphorylation. We found that EGF stimulation induced a rapid and sustained Rb phosphorylation at Ser780, Ser795, and Thr821. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence to demonstrate that activated ERK1/2 is responsible for mitogen induced rapid Rb phosphorylation specifically at Ser780 and Ser795. This process occurs independent of cyclin/cdk pathway. Materials—Anti-P-Ser780, anti-P-Ser795, anti-P-Ser807/811, anti-ERK1/2, anti-P-ERK1/2 (both monoclonal and polyclonal), anti-Akt, anti-P-Akt, and anti-cyclin D1 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-cdk4 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Anti-P-Ser249/Thr252, anti-P-Thr821, and anti-P-Thr826 antibodies were from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). The MAPK inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Cell Signaling. LY294002 and recombinant human EGF were from Sigma. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 was obtained from AstraZeneca (Cheshire, England). Plasmids and Protein Expression—The construct GST fusion Rb large pocket domain containing amino acids from 379 to 928 (GST-LP) was a kind gift from Eric Knudsen (Department of Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati). A GST fusion Rb C-terminal region (GST-SP), GST fusion Rb single point mutant of Ser780 to A (S780A) and Ser795 to A (S795A) were made by PCR using GST-LP as the template and containing amino acids from 701 to 928. The PCR fragment was subsequently cloned into a pGEX 6P-1 vector (Amersham Bioscience). The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing and the GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α, purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience) following the manufacturer's protocols. Cell Culture and Flow Cytometry—RIEC-6 cells was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and cells in passage 15 to passage 22 were used in this study. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC) complemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 μg/ml insulin. For all experiments, the cells were first starved for 24 h and then stimulated for the indicated time period. For flow cytometry, RIEC-6 cells were grown on 100-mm culture dishes and serum-starved for 24 h for cell cycle synchronization. Following appropriate treatments, cells were trypsinized and transferred into 15-ml Falcon tubes. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 ml of 100% EtOH were added under continuous vortex. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.2% RNase (Sigma catalog number R6513) and subsequently mixed with 490 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 10 μl of propidium iodide (Sigma catalog number P4170). The final mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark before analysis with FACS. Results were analyzed using Cell Quest (BD Biosciences). Whole-cell Lysates, Triton X-100 Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Whole-cell lysates were prepared by directly adding 1× SDS sample buffer to the cells. For Triton X-100 cell extract preparation, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I/II (Sigma). The lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant were saved as Triton X-100 cell extracts. For immunoprecipitation, the protein A plus G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were washed three times with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors and then incubated with cell extracts for 1 h (preclearing) at 4 °C. Following this, the beads were spun down and discarded, and the supernatant was further incubated with protein A plus G beads and appropriate antibody for overnight at 4 °C. After washing in lysis buffer, the absorbed complexes were removed from the beads by heating for 5 min at 100 °C in 1× SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins resolved on gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected with appropriate antibodies by Western blot. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The in vitro kinase reaction was carried out in a total volume of 40 μl containing 5 μg of maltose-binding protein fusion Rb C-terminal region (MBP-Rb) (Cell Signaling), 100 ng of recombined active ERK1, or 50 ng of recombined active ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA), 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Perkinelmer Life Sciences) in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2) at 30 °C for 30 min, then the reaction was terminated by adding 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and the sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE; the gel was then dried, and results were visualized by autoradiography. For antibody-based detection of Rb phosphorylation catalyzed by recombined ERK1/2, the kinase assay was performed identically, except the same amount of MBP-Rb or GST fusion Rb or their mutants were used as substrate, and no [γ-32P]ATP was involved. For the immunoprecipitation kinase assay, the kinases were immunoprecipitated as indicated above and the final wash was done by using a kinase buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer, 5 μg MBP-Rb was added as substrate, and the reaction was initiated by adding 100 μm ATP. After reaction, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Pull-down Assay—GST or GST-LP was immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads and mixed with unstimulated or EGF-stimulated RIEC-6 cell extracts for 3 h at 4°C; the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed in triplicate with cell lysis buffer as mentioned above. Bound protein was then eluted from the beads by adding 1× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min; the sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. EGF and FBS Display a Differential Phosphorylation Pattern of Rb—To study the effect of EGF on Rb phosphorylation, we applied the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies that have been developed recently. As a positive control, 10% FBS was used to stimulate RIEC-6 cells to determine the Rb phosphorylation response. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, both FBS and EGF strongly activated ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) as shown by the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 detected by a phosphorylation site (Thr202/Tyr204) specific antibody. The mitogen stimulation also induced a similar cyclin D1 expression pattern over the time period tested. FBS stimulation for up to 20 h induced Rb phosphorylation at all sites examined, while EGF stimulation did not induce Rb phosphorylation at Ser249/Thr252, Ser807/811 and Thr826 during this same period. Under FBS stimulation, Rb was slightly phosphorylated at Ser249/Thr252 and Ser826 by 8 h and became further phosphorylated by 20 h. The phosphorylation at Ser807/811 occurred between 8 and 20 h. Rb Phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 Induced by EGF or FBS Precedes Expression of Cyclin D1, Formation of Cyclin D1/cdk4 Complex, and cdk4 Kinase Activity—Phosphorylation at Ser780, Ser795, and Thr821 was already significant as soon as 8 h with either EGF or FBS stimulation (Fig. 1). These observations directed us to evaluate Rb phosphorylation at these sites at earlier time points. Surprisingly, both EGF and FBS induced a very rapid (within minutes for Ser780/Ser795 and 1 h for Thr821) and sustained Rb phosphorylation at these sites (Fig. 2, A and B). Phosphorylation of Ser780/Ser795 is thought to be mediated by the cyclin D1 associated kinase Cdk4/6, while phosphorylation of Thr821 is felt to be mediated by the cyclin E associated kinase Cdk2 (27Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 28Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast with these data, Rb phosphorylation preceded cyclin D1 expression at early time points in our experiments. Cyclin D1 expression was not detectable until after 4 h of mitogen stimulation. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 did not seem to be elevated further by the later expression of cyclin D1. In a recent study, cdk4 has been suggested to be involved in rapid Rb phosphorylation at Ser795 after mitogen stimulation in vascular smooth muscle cells (29Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Vlasova T.M. Grewal J.S. Ullian M.E. Tholanikunnel B.G. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24899-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether cdk4/6 was responsible for the rapid Rb phosphorylation in RIEC-6 cells, we recovered Triton X-100 extracts from stimulated cells. Cdk4/6 were immunoprecipitated and the complexes detected for cyclin D1 incorporation and kinase activity. Cyclin D1 could be detected within cdk4 complexes at 4 h after mitogen stimulation (Fig. 2C) but not in cdk6 complexes even after 8 h (data not shown). The cdk4 kinase activity was then analyzed using MBP-Rb as a substrate and revealed by immunoblotting using site specific phosphorylation antibodies. While cdk4 was presented evenly in the immunoprecipitated complex, its activity only began to appear 2 h after mitogen stimulation as evidenced by its ability to phosphorylate Rb at Ser795 in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these data suggesting that mitogen induced rapid Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 is very unlikely to be mediated by cyclin D associated kinases in RIEC-6 cells. Inhibition of MEK, but Not PI3K, Prevents Rb Phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821—The temporal activation of ERK1/2 was noted to closely parallel Rb phosphorylation of Ser780/Ser795. Sequence analysis revealed that Rb has multiple potential MAPK phosphorylation sites (30Buckley C.T. Sekiya F. Kim Y.J. Rhee S.G. Caldwell K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41807-41814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including Ser780/Ser795/Thr821. We therefore next tested the possibility of direct ERK1/2 phosphorylation of Rb. First, we determined the effect of the ERK1/2 upstream kinase MEK inhibitors. As expected, ERK1/2 activation was abolished by pretreating RIEC-6 cells with either PD98059 (data not shown) or U0126 (Fig. 3, A and B). Rb phosphorylation at Ser795 was totally blocked by administration of U0126; phosphorylation at Ser780 was prominently reduced, while phosphorylation at Thr821 was only slightly affected by the drug under conditions of either EGF or FBS stimulation. The EGFR inhibitor ZD1839 totally abolished EGF induced signals such as ERK1/2 and Rb phosphorylation (data not shown). However, this inhibitor did not significantly affect either serum stimulated Rb phosphorylation or ERK1/2 phosphorylation until a later time point (6 h). These results suggest that alternative pathways for activation of the downstream kinase ERK1/2 may contribute to EGF stimulated Rb phosphorylation at these sites. We also noticed that in these cells, inhibition of ERK1/2 activity only partially reduced cyclin D1 expression. This contrasts with a previous study in which sustained ERK1 activation was required for cyclin D1 expression in CHO cells (32Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In addition to the ERK pathway, the PI3K pathway is also known to be activated by EGFR stimulation (7Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) and has been considered to play multiple roles during cell cycle progression (33Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We therefore interrogated the role for PI3K as a possible contributor toward Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 in our cells. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, treatment of the cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished most of the kinase activity as evidenced by the disappearance of phosphorylated Akt, the conventional effecter of PI3K. The expression of inactive Akt remained the same under all conditions. Rb phosphorylation at Ser780, Ser795, or Thr821 was unaffected, despite PI3K activity inhibition. These data endorse the notion that PI3K is unlikely to be involved in mitogen-stimulated Rb phosphorylation at these 3 sites. It is also important to point out that PI3K inhibition had no effect on activation of ERK1/2, while cyclin D1 expression was totally diminished. These observations are in agreement with other investigators (34Sheng H. Shao J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Gut. 2003; 52: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that ERK1/2, but not PI3K is involved in mitogen-induced rapid Rb phosphorylation at sites Ser780/Ser795/Thr821. ERK1/2 Phosphorylates Rb at Ser780/Ser795—We next sought to determine whether Rb could be a potential substrate for ERK1/2 directly. To test this, MBP-Rb was incubated with a recombined constitutive active GST fusion ERK1/2 and [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4A, MBP-Rb was strongly phosphorylated by both active ERK1 and ERK2, while the carrier protein MBP or active ERK1/2 itself only showed background radiolabeling under the reaction conditions. This result indicates that Rb is a substrate of ERK1/2. Since mitogen-stimulated Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795 was most affected by MEK inhibition, we next tested whether ERK1/2 could specifically phosphorylate Rb at Ser780 or Ser795. A GST fusion Rb construct containing amino acids 701–928 (GST-SP) was generated. In addition, point mutations of Ser780 to Ala (S780A) or Ser795 to Ala (S795A) were also produced. The constructs were then expressed in E. coli, and the GST fusion proteins were purified from Triton X-100 lysates of bacteria by glutathione-affinity purification. The protein was then incubated with or without active ERK1/2, and the reaction results were analyzed by Western blot using phosphorylation site specific antibodies. In the complete absence of kinases (Fig. 4B) or the presence of an inactive ERK2 (data not shown), no phosphorylation at Ser780 could be detected. Application of either active ERK1 or ERK2 resulted in a robust phosphorylation signal at Ser780 with GST-SP and S795A, but not S780A, indicating the specific Rb phosphorylation at Ser780 by active ERK1/2. Although the antibody P-S795 showed a slight background for all the GST fusion proteins even without kinase involvement, ERK1 application resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation signal with GST-SP and S780A but not S795A. These results indicate a specific Rb phosphorylation at Ser795 by active ERK1 (Fig. 4B). Further experiments indicate that even though ERK1 could phosphorylate Rb at both Ser780 and Ser795, the efficiency of phosphorylation was different. We found high phosphorylation efficiency at Ser780 and low efficiency at Ser795 (see supplemental Fig. 1). When ERK2 was used in the kinase assay, no more than background signal was detected by antibody P-S795 with all the fusion proteins (Fig. 4B). As a control, the same amount of protein was present in all the reactions as shown by the Poceau S staining of the same membrane utilized for Western blot (Fig. 4B). To further confirm ERK1/2 phosphorylation of Rb, RIEC-6 cells were stimulated and Triton X-100 cell extracts were recovered. Phospho-ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated followed by a kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4C, the immunoprecipitated phospho-ERK1/2 could phosphorylate Rb at Ser780 and Ser795 under the conditions tested. As a control, similar levels of phospho-ERK1/2 were measured in this assay. Collectively these results clearly demonstrate that active ERK1/2 can phosphorylate Rb specifically at Ser780/Ser795. Phosphorylated ERK Interacts Directly with Phosphorylated Rb in Vivo and in Vitro—To determine whether ERK1/2 could physically interact with Rb, we first performed a pull down assay. We used GST-LP, which contained the large pocket domain of Rb as a bait for the pull down. As expected EGF stimulation resulted in robust ERK1/2 phosphorylation in RIEC-6 cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the total unphosphorylated ERK1/2 was maintained at a similar level. The Triton X-100 cell extracts were generated from the stimulated and unstimulated cells, which were incubated together with either GST alone or GST-LP, which was immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing, the bound protein was eluted by 1× SDS sample buffer and presented for Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5A, GST-LP only pulled down the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 but not the unphosphorylated form. As a control, GST itself did not pull down anything from the cell extracts. These results indicate that the large pocket domain could interact with the active form of ERK1/2. The same Triton X-100 cell extracts were utilized to perform in vivo studies with immunoprecipitation using antibodies against the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 and Rb. As shown in Fig. 5B, P-ERK1/2 antibody immunoprecipitated a strong phosphorylated ERK1/2 as expected. More importantly, anti-phospho-Ser780 antibody also co-immunoprecipitated a phosphorylated form of ERK1/2, but a control antibody did not. These results strongly suggest that after mitogen stimulation, activated ERK1/2 directly interacts with Rb for its phosphorylation at specific sites such as Ser780 and Ser795. EGF-directed Rb Phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 Is Insufficient for Cell Cycle Progression—Finally, we sought to determine whether Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 induced by EGF stimulation was enough to initiate cell cycle re-entry after serum deprivation. Using flow cytometry (Fig. 6), serum starvation for 24 h resulted in 95% of the cells arresting in G0 phase. Following 20 h of serum stimulation, roughly 20% of the cells were in S phase. However, under EGF stimulation, only about 7% of the cells were in S phase despite the findings that Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 are all phosphorylated during this time. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Rb at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 is not enough to cause cell cycle re-entry after serum deprivation alone. Phosphorylation of Rb at additional sites is therefore likely to be required to fully inactivate the cell cycle arrest function of Rb. Most of our current knowledge about the function of Rb phosphorylation is derived from studies using an over expression system or in vitro cell free analysis. The detection of phosphorylated Rb is often either based on the slow migration band detected by a general Rb antibody or [γ-32P]ATP incorporation (21Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 24Dasgupta P. Sun J. Wang S. Fusaro G. Betts V. Padmanabhan J. Sebti S.M. Chellappan S.P. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 35Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). While these studies have provided us with very useful information about the function of Rb phosphorylation, the site-specific or temporal regulation of Rb phosphorylation was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we use phosphorylation site(s)-specific antibodies to detect mitogen-induced Rb phosphorylation in a prototypical undifferentiated small intestine epithelial cell line (26Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). We observed a very rapid and sustained Rb phosphorylation occurring at sites Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 by FBS or EGF stimulation. Phosphorylation at other sites Ser249/Thr252/Ser807/811/Thr826 could only be induced by FBS stimulation at later time points. This is an important observation, since traditional detection methods based on different migration velocities between the hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms of Rb would not be possible to identify. Furthermore, the temporal and site specific differences in Rb phosphorylation in response to FBS and EGF stimulation would be impossible to distinguish. The significance of Rb phosphorylation at different sites is suggested by the observations that Rb function may be modulated according to the location of its phosphorylation. For example, Ser780, Ser807/811, and Thr821/826 appear to be involved in the disruption of E2F binding to Rb (35Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser807/811 may disrupt the binding of c-Ab1 to Rb (21Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been presented that Thr821/Thr826 phosphorylation is required for releasing the LXCXE motif containing protein from Rb repression complex (21Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 27Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, mitogen-induced rapid Rb phosphorylation at Ser795 by cdk4 may dissociate E2F binding from Rb (29Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Vlasova T.M. Grewal J.S. Ullian M.E. Tholanikunnel B.G. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24899-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In SAOS-2 cells, Rb phosphorylation at Ser795 by cdk4 is required for inactivation of the Rb cell cycle arrest function (28Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr826 is felt to be required for pp32 binding to Rb and inhibits pp32 mediated apoptosis (36Adegbola O. Pasternack G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15497-15502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Rb phosphorylation at Ser567 by cyclin E-cdk2 is critical for disruption of the pocket A and B interface and preventing Rb from binding and inactivating E2F (20Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei S.A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In our study, we found EGF stimulation induces a rapid and sustained Rb phosphorylation at Ser780, Ser795, and Thr821, but it is not enough to induce cell cycle re-entry in small intestine epithelial cells. FBS stimulation induces a normal cell cycle re-entry and Rb is phosphorylated at other sites including Ser249/Thr252, Ser807/811, and Thr826. These findings would suggest that phosphorylation of Rb at these sites are required for cell cycle re-entry. However, whether early Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 is required for later Rb phosphorylation at Ser249/Thr252, Ser807/811, or Thr826 is currently unclear. When the MEK inhibitor U0126 was used to block early Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795,it also significantly abolished FBS-induced later Rb phosphorylation at Ser249/Thr252, Ser807/811, and Thr826 (see supplemental Fig. 2). Therefore, at this time point we cannot determine whether sequential Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795, ERK1/2 kinase activity, or both are required for the later Rb phosphorylation at Ser249/Thr252, Ser807/811, and Thr826. Despite this, the differential Rb phosphorylation pattern at specific sites at early versus later stages following mitogenic stimulation discovered in this study provides further mechanistic insight into the function of Rb phosphorylation in the control of cell cycle machinery. Mitogen-regulated Rb phosphorylation is thought to be initiated early through cyclin D-cdk4/6 and later via cyclin A/E-cdk2. Mitogen stimulation activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, which will activate the cyclin D1 promoter resulting in the synthesis of cyclin D1 (9Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 33Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 37Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d887-d912Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, mitogen stimulation activates the Ras-PI3K-AKT pathway, which triggers a cascade of signals resulting in the stabilizing of cyclin D1 (33Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 then binds to cdk4/6 and initiates Rb phosphorylation. In the present study the early phosphorylation of Rb at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821 induced by mitogen stimulation could not be due to cyclin D-cdk4/6 activity, since there was no detectable cyclin D1 expression or cyclin D1/cdk4 kinase activity at the early stimulation time points. Furthermore, even though cyclin D1 expression was fully activated by both FBS and EGF at later time points, only FBS induced a strong Rb phosphorylation at Ser249/Thr252/Ser807/811/Thr826. These observations suggest that cyclin D1 is insufficient by itself to induce Rb phosphorylation, at least at Ser249/Thr252/Ser807/811/Thr826. Pretreating cells with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, totally abolished cyclin D1 synthesis while not affecting Rb phosphorylation at Ser780/Ser795/Thr821. These results strongly suggest an alterative mechanism for Rb phosphorylation by mitogen stimulation that is cdk-independent. Similarly, in quiescent U937 cells, serum stimulation results in Rb phosphorylation before the appearance of cyclin D or cdk kinase activity, but this early Rb phosphorylation is found to be mediated by Raf-1 and is independent of its downstream MAPK pathway (24Dasgupta P.

In mouse embryo fibroblast cells, ERK activity is found not required for Rb-null cell proliferation which indicates the importance of ERK in regulating Rb function (38D'Abaco G.M. Hooper S. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our current study provides strong evidence that ERK1/2 is capable of physically binding to Rb to cause phosphorylation in a rapid fashion in response to mitogen stimulation. These results represent the finding of a novel, alternative way to regulate Rb phosphorylation via the MAPK pathway and to directly link mitogen stimulation and cell cycle machinery that is independent of the traditional cyclin-associated kinase pathway. The findings in this study involved a prototypical rat intestinal crypt epithelial cell line (26Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). These cells differ in several respects from crypt stem cells found in the intestine of adult rats and therefore have inherent limitations. First, these cells are derived from fetal rat intestine. They do not show features of terminal differentiation, analogous to what occurs as cells emerge from the crypt/villus junction. Therefore, the effects of factors controlling cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation soon after proliferation cannot be studied. Furthermore, depending on the culture conditions, tight junctions in RIEC-6 cells are not the same as what is encountered in vivo. As it is established that cell adhesion plays a critical role in the control of cell proliferation (39Crossin K.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 961: 159-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the contribution of this factor to our results cannot be tested. Despite the above-mentioned limitations, site-specific phosphorylation of Rb within intestinal crypt cells offers important mechanistic insight into the process of signaling for enterocyte proliferation. This mechanism is especially relevant to the adaptation response of the intestine to massive intestinal loss, which is largely a mitogenic signal to the proliferative crypt region of the bowel mucosa. Since insufficient adaptation commits patients to a lifelong need for supplemental nutrition by vein, a thorough understanding of this mechanism is fundamental toward the development of clinical therapy designed to enhance this important response.

In addition, both proteins have been shown to play important roles in disease including cancer and Alzheimer disease. Although PS1 and β-catenin are found in the same complexes, it is not clear whether they bind directly to each other or a third complex component, like cadherin, may mediate their interactions. Here we show that PS1 and β-catenin form no detectable complexes in cells that express no cadherin. In contrast, these complexes are readily found in E-cadherin containing cells. Furthermore, binding of both PS1 and β-catenin to E-cadherin is necessary for the formation of PS1/β-catenin complexes. Importantly, our data show that binding of PS1 to cadherin mediates the effects of PS1 on the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and destabilization of β-catenin. Thus, cadherins mediate both the association of PS1 and β-catenin and the effects of PS1 on the cellular levels of β-catenin.

Thus, cadherins mediate both the association of PS1 and β-catenin and the effects of PS1 on the cellular levels of β-catenin. Cytosolic β-catenin is an important mediator of Wnt signaling, a pathway that plays crucial roles in development and in disease including cancer (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular levels of this catenin are regulated by an axin-dependent multiprotein complex that includes adenomatous polyposis coli factor and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). 3The abbreviations used are:GSK-3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βFADfamilial Alzheimer diseasePS1presenilin1IPimmunoprecipitateWBWestern blotCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonateWTwild type In the absence of Wnt stimulation, the axin complex promotes the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation at β-catenin residues 33, 37, and 41. Phosphorylated β-catenin is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (2Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.

Binding of Wnt to its cell surface receptor results in the inactivation of the axin complex and the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin, which then translocates to the nucleus where it activates gene transcription (4Lustig B. Behrens J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, β-catenin is a component of the cadherin-based adherens junction complexes formed at cell-cell adhesion sites. β-Catenin binds the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin distal to the membrane at residues 833–862 and acts as a structural protein by linking cell surface cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (5Ozawa M.

Our data show that cadherins are necessary for this association. Furthermore, binding of both PS1 and β-catenin to E-cadherin is necessary for the formation of PS1/β-catenin complexes. Importantly, E-cadherin mediates the effects of PS1 on β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and destabilization.

A polyclonal antibody against PS1 C-terminal fragment (PS1/CTF) purchased from Sigma was used to detect PS1Δ330–360 that is not recognized by 33B10. Monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (C36), anti-γ-catenin, and anti-β-catenin antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories, and polyclonal anti-β-catenin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Retroviral expression vectors pMX/WTPS1 and pMX/PS1Δ330–360 were generated by insertion of the corresponding cDNAs into the XhoI/NotI sites of vector pMX-IRES-GFP (24Onishi M. Kinoshita S.

Cell Culture and Transfections—all cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of the cells was done using either Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for A431D cells or FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) for the Phoenix α cells according to the recommended protocols. For retroviral gene transfer of pMX vectors, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein pseudo-typed murine leukemia virus particles were prepared using Phoenix α cells according to standard procedures. For transduction target cells (6 × 104 cells/60-mm dish) were incubated with the virus particles for 6–8 h in the presence of polybrene (10 μg/ml). 48 h after transduction GFP-positive cells were sorted using a MoFlo cell sorter. Cell Lysis for β-Catenin Determination—to assess the PS1 effect on the amount of detergent soluble β-catenin, cells were lysed in 1% CHAPS lysis buffer or 1% SDS containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 200 nm microcystin-LR, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1× protease inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4°C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined. Soluble β-catenin was then determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody. Western Blots (WBs) and Immunoprecipitations—For Western blot analysis cells were washed with PBS and solubilized in 1% SDS solubilization buffer. For immunoprecipitation, cells were solubilized in HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture), containing 1% Triton X-100. Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants (2–3 mg of protein) were precleared with either non-immune serum and Protein A or Protein G (Pierce) for 2 h at 4°C. Supernatants were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C and treated for 2 h with Protein A or Protein G.

Briefly, cell lysates were passed 10 times through each needle of 19, 22, and 25 gauge and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. The cytosolic fraction was subjected to IP using anti-β-catenin antibodies and analyzed on Western blots for ubiquitin or β-catenin. The crude membrane fraction was washed twice with buffer A, resuspended by sonication in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to isolate the membrane fraction from Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. The membrane fraction was subjected to immunoblot with anti-PS1 antibody 33B10. Each experiment has been replicated at least twice. E-cadherin Is Necessary for the Association of PS1 with β-Catenin—To examine the role cadherins may play in the association of PS1 with β-catenin we used the cadherin-negative cell line A431D (25Lewis J.E. Wahl III, J.K. Sass K.M. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and asked whether PS1 and β-catenin are able to form complexes in the absence of cadherins. Since cells depleted of cadherins contain no detectable levels of β-catenin (25Lewis J.E. Wahl III, J.K. Sass K.M. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we transfected A431D cells with the missense β-catenin mutant S33Y that is stable in the absence of cadherins. This mutant binds cadherins and has been used in β-catenin transactivation assays (26Olmeda D. Castel S. Vilaro S. Cano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2844-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) expreriments (Fig. 1, a and b, lanes 1–3) showed that A431D cells expressing exogenous β-catenin contain no detectable PS1/β-catenin complexes. In contrast, reintroduction of WT E-cadherin in A431D cells (A431D-E) stimulated the formation of β-catenin complexes with both PS1 and E-cadherin (Fig. 1a, lanes 4–6) as well as the formation of PS1 complexes with E-cadherin and β-catenin (Fig. 1b, lanes 4–6). To examine whether binding of PS1 to E-cadherin plays a role in the association between PS1 and β-catenin, we transfected A431D cells with E-cadherin mutant 761 (A431D-E/761). This mutant contains a three-amino acid change (GGG759–761AAA) in the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and is unable to bind PS1 (12Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulous A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Fig. 1a, lanes 7–9, shows that although E-cadherin mutant 761 binds to β-catenin, no complexes are found between β-catenin and PS1. Furthermore, PS1 immunoprecipitates (IPs) contained neither β-catenin nor mutant E-cadherin (Fig. 1b, lanes 7–9). Since the E-cadherin-expressing A431D-E and A431D-E/761 cells contain detectable levels of endogenous β-catenin, we compared the levels of PS1/β-catenin complexes in these cells in the absence of exogenous β-catenin. In agreement with a critical role of the cadherin/PS1 binding, endogenous β-catenin associates with PS1 in A431D-E cells but not in A431D-E/761 cells (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that cadherins promote the association of PS1 and β-catenin and that binding of PS1 to cadherin may be critical for the formation of PS1/β-catenin complexes. To exclude the possibility that our results are cell- or construct-specific we examined this question in L cells, a cadherin-negative cell line (5Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 27Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J.

Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This mutant is also unable to bind PS1, but it still binds β-catenin (11Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 2b shows that in the presence of WT E-cadherin, β-catenin forms complexes with both E-cadherin and PS1 (lanes 1–3). In the presence of the E-cadherin mutant EΔ760–771, however, β-catenin is unable to associate with PS1, although β-catenin still binds the mutant cadherin (Fig. 2b, lanes 4–6). Together, these data show that the cadherin/PS1 binding is critical for the formation of PS1/β-catenin complexes. We next asked whether E-cadherin binding to β-catenin is necessary for the formation of PS1/β-catenin complexes. To answer this question we transfected the cadherin-negative L cells with E-cadherin mutant EΔ71 lacking the 71 C-terminal amino acids that are critical for β-catenin binding (Fig. 2a). This mutant binds PS1 although it is unable to bind β-catenin (11Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc.

Co-IP experiments showed that β-catenin forms complexes neither with the mutant cadherin nor with PS1 (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9). That E-cadherin mutant EΔ71 binds PS1 (11Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) even though it is unable to bind β-catenin suggests that PS1 binds E-cadherin independently of β-catenin. Conversely, E-cadherin mutants 761 and EΔ760–771 bind β-catenin, although they are unable to bind PS1 (Fig. 1b, lanes 7–9, and Fig. 2b, lanes 4–6). Together, our data show that E-cadherin binds β-catenin and PS1 independent of each other and that E-cadherin binding to both PS1 and β-catenin is necessary for the formation of PS1/β-catenin complexes suggesting that cadherin organizes the PS1/β-catenin association. Binding of PS1 to E-cadherin Mediates the Effects of PS1 on β-Catenin Destabilization—Recent reports show that PS1 destabilizes the detergent-soluble pool of β-catenin (16Murayama M. Tanaka S.

Our data that cadherins mediate the PS1/β-catenin association suggest that cadherins may play a critical role in the transmission of the PS1 effects on β-catenin stability. To test this hypothesis we used A431D-E and A431D-E/761 cells that express WT or mutant 761 E-cadherins, respectively. Fig. 3, a, lanes 1 and 2, and c show that exogenous PS1 reduces the levels of detergent-soluble β-catenin in A431D-E cells. These data are in agreement with recent reports that PS1 suppresses the levels of cellular β-catenin (16Murayama M. Tanaka S. Palacino J. Murayama O. Honda T. Sun X. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N.

In contrast, in A431D-E/761 cells that express mutant E-cadherin, PS1 has no effect on β-catenin levels (Fig. 3, b and c). These data indicate that binding of PS1 to cadherin may be crucial for the transmission of the PS1 effects on β-catenin stability. Recently it was reported that PS1 mutant Δ330–360 is able neither to associate with β-catenin nor to promote its degradation (Ref. 19Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R. Chevallier N. Zheng H. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 3a, lane 3). Fig. 3d shows that this mutant is also unable to bind E-cadherin, a result consistent with the requirement of a cadherin/PS1 binding for the PS1-induced degradation of β-catenin. The negative effects of PS1 on β-catenin stability are not an artifact of the overexpression of PS1 because down-regulation of PS1 activity in PS1–/– cells results in increased β-catenin, but not γ-catenin, levels (Fig. 3e), a result consistent with the reported suppression of β-catenin by PS1 (23Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). E-cadherin Mediates the Effects of PS1 on β-Catenin Phosphorylation and Ubiquitination—Recent evidence indicates that PS1 promotes the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin by facilitating a GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin at residues 33, 37, and 41 (23Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To examine whether PS1 binding to cadherin is necessary for the PS1-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin we used A431D-E and A431D-E/761 cells. Fig. 4a shows that WT PS1 stimulates β-catenin phosphorylation at GSK-3β-dependent sites in A431D-E cells expressing WT E-cadherin but not in A431D-E/761 cells expressing mutant E-cadherin unable to bind PS1. In addition, PS1Δ330–360 that is unable to bind E-cadherin had no significant effects on β-catenin phosphorylation (data not shown, see also Refs. 19Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R.

Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PS1-induced phosphorylation of β-catenin is followed by its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (23Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of the PS1/cadherin binding on the PS1-induced ubiquitination of β-catenin we used two distinct proteasomal inhibitors. Fig. 4b shows that treatment of our cultures with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 revealed that PS1 promotes ubiquitination of cytosolic β-catenin in cells expressing WT E-cadherin but not in cells expressing E-cadherin mutant 761. Similar results were obtained using the more specific inhibitor lactacystin, indicating that the PS effects are specific to proteasomal function (Fig. 4c). Taken together, our data show that PS1 binding to cadherin is necessary for transmission of the PS1 effects on β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and stability. Recent studies revealed that PS1, β-catenin, and cadherins form complexes with important functions in cell development and in disease including cancer and Alzheimer disease (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Consequently, the exact structure, composition, and functions of the PS1/cadherin/β-catenin complexes have been the subjects of intense investigation. It has been suggested that PS1 binds β-catenin and promotes its degradation thus inhibiting β-catenin transactivation (16Murayama M. Tanaka S. Palacino J. Murayama O. Honda T. Sun X. Yasutake K.

However, the mechanism of PS1/β-catenin association is not clear and no evidence of a direct PS1/β-catenin binding has been presented. Since both PS1 and β-catenin bind cadherins at distinct sites (11Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc.

Our data show that binding of both PS1 and β-catenin to cadherins is necessary for the formation of stable complexes between PS1 and β-catenin indicating that cadherins mediate the interactions of PS1 and β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that binding of PS1 to cadherin is essential for the transmission of the PS1 effects on the destabilization, GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of β-catenin. By bringing together PS1 and β-catenin, cadherins may also mediate the effects of PS1 on β-catenin trafficking (22Nishimura M. Yu G. Levesque G. Zhang D.M. Ruel L. Chen F. Milman P. Holmes E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Presently, however, it is not entirely clear how the functions of β-catenin in signaling and adhesion are coordinated as changes in cadherin are not always correlated with changes in β-catenin signaling (32Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the extent of PS1/cadherin/β-catenin association may regulate the amount of β-catenin marked for degradation, a function expected to affect β-catenin signaling. Consistent with this suggestion, in vivo data show that loss of either cadherins (31Cox R.T. Kirkpatrick C. Peifer M. J.

Although the mechanism by which the PS1/cadherin/β-catenin complex destabilizes β-catenin needs further investigation, formation of this complex seems to facilitate the post-translational modifications that mark β-catenin for degradation.

Structurally local effects and secondary structural changes are modeled using all-atom Brownian dynamics to investigate the changes of the backbone torsional distributions upon phosphorylation. For tertiary and global changes, we employ a coarse-grained model to sample ensembles of conformations both with and without phosphorylation. At the secondary structure level, phosphorylation moderately increases the helical propensity and gives a more rigid local backbone conformation. The tertiary effects of phosphorylation caused by the extensive charge modification are more pronounced and collectively change the conformation of the regulatory domain of NFAT from a flexible globular ensemble to a rather rigid helical bundle, blocking access to the nuclear localization sequence. These studies give computational support to one scenario conjectured from experiments."

In contrast, small interference RNA directed against MEKK3 and a dominant negative form of MEKK3 caused the reduction of NFAT activation in response to angiotensin II in cardiac myocytes.

Conversely, restoring MEKK3 to the MEKK3-deficient cells restored angiotensin II-mediated calcineurin/NFAT activation. We determined that angiotensin II induced MEKK3 phosphorylation. Thus, MEKK3 functions downstream of the AT1 receptor and is essential for calcineurin/NFAT activation. Finally, we determined that MEKK3-mediated activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling was associated with the phosphorylation of modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 at Ser108 and Ser112.

Calcineurin is activated upon binding of calcineurin B and calmodulin to CnA.

Autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways involving angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1, and activators of the adrenergic system also contribute to myocyte hypertrophy. Pathological hypertrophy is associated with maladaptive changes in cardiac contractility and calcium handling, cardiac fibrosis, myocyte apoptosis, and sudden death from arrhythmias. Thus, deciphering the details of the signaling pathways that convey hypertrophic stimuli is an important problem with therapeutic relevance (14Chien K.R. Olson E.N.

MCIP1 shares a structural motif with NFAT termed the SP repeat domain. Peptides derived from the SP repeat domain of human MCIP1 inhibit calcineurin activity (27Rothermel B.A. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B.

These findings support a competitive antagonist function for MCIP1 with respect to calcineurin action on NFAT proteins. The function of MCIP1 as a suppressor of calcineurin activity has been defined largely from studies of MCIP1 overexpression and supports the hypothesis that MCIP1 antagonizes the prohypertrophic actions of calcineurin. For example, cardiac overexpression of MCIP1 in transgenic mice diminished hypertrophy in response to overexpression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin, as well as to chronic isoproterenol administration, pressure overload, and exercise (27Rothermel B.A. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MCIP1 gene expression is also up-regulated in response to calcineurin signaling, suggesting that MCIP1 functions in a feedback inhibition loop to suppress calcineurin activity (34Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 61e-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCIP1 can be phosphorylated in vitro by p43/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and this phosphorylation is necessary for efficient phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (35Vega R.B.

In vitro studies have also shown that phosphorylated MCIP1 itself can serve as a substrate for calcineurin (35Vega R.B. Yang J. Rothermel B.A. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30401-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recent evidence indicates that phosphorylation of RCN1, a yeast ortholog of MCIP1, enhances calcineurin activity (36Hilioti Z. Gallagher D.A. Low-Nam S.T. Ramaswamy P. Gajer P. Kingsbury T.J. Birchwood C.J. Levchenko A. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of calcineurin activation was unclear. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that calcineurin signaling may be regulated through phosphorylation of MCIP1 by protein kinases. To test this hypothesis, we sought initially to identify candidate kinases that activate calcineurin-NFAT signaling and then to determine whether calcineurin/NFAT signaling is regulated through MCIP1 phosphorylation by the candidate kinases.MATERIALS AND METHODSMammalian Expression Constructs and Reporter Constructs—Plasmids for HA-tagged or non-HA-tagged MEKK3 (wild type (WT), constitutively active (CA), and dominant negative (DN)) have been described (5Liu S.

In addition, 4×NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmids were co-transfected with constitutively active MEKK3 in the presence of constitutively active or dominant negative MEK5, MEK6, MEK7, or BMK1 in a dosage range of 0.1-1 μg. The pCMVlacZ plasmid (1 μg) was used as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. The data are presented as relative luciferase activity or CAT activity, calculated as the ratio of the activity of luciferase or CAT activity to the activity of β-galactosidase.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Full-length Myc-MCIP1 or NFAT3-GFP constructs were transiently co-transfected with wild type or constitutively active forms of HA-MEKK3 into cardiac myocytes or CHO-AT1 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with or without Ang II from 0 to 60 min. Following treatment, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer, consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cellular extracts from Myc-MCIP1- and HA-MEKK3-transfected cells were precipitated with specific antibodies, respectively, with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed with specific antibodies, respectively. For NFAT-GFP transfection, the nuclear, cytosolic, and total cellular extracts were isolated, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (37Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M.

Then cellular extracts were collected as described above. Lysates were treated with 1 unit of calf alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) per 100 μl of cellular lysates at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were processed for Western blot analysis as described above.Generation of MEKK3-/- Murine Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFs) and Stable Transformants—The matings of MEKK3+/- mice were timed, and the embryos generated were dissected at embryonic day 9.5, as described (41Yang J. Boerm M. McCarty M. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Zhuang Y. Su B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Yolk sacs were isolated and genotyped with the use of the polymerase chain reaction; each individual embryo was homogenized and treated with trypsin for 30 min. After washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 ml) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, the embryonic fibroblast cells were cultured in 6-well plates that had been coated with 0.1% gelatin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum. Genotypes of the established MEFs were further confirmed, after three or four passages, by Southern blot and PCR analysis (42Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To establish stable MEKK3 transformants, pBabe-HA-MEKK3 expression vector (2 μg) was transfected into 5 × 106 MEKK3-/- MEF cells in a 10-cm dish. Two days after transfection, cells were treated for 8-10 days with puromycin (3 μg/ml). The puromycin-resistant clones were collected and are referred to as the MEKK3-/+ cells herein.Calcineurin Activity Assay—Cardiac tissue was minced finely and homogenized in lysis buffer as described above, followed by further disruption by sonication. Lysates then were cleared by centrifugation. Free phosphate was removed by passing the lysate through a Micro Bio 6 desalting column (Bio-Rad). Calcineurin activity was measured by using the synthetic phosphorylated RII peptide (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The amount of free phosphate released was measured with molybdate dye solution (Promega). Calcineurin-specific phosphatase activity was measured as the amount inhibited by cyclosporin A. Western blots to detect calcineurin protein were performed with the above lysates by using a calcineurin A antibody (Sigma).Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or an analysis of variance test. A value of p < 0.05 was interpreted to mean that observed experimental differences were statistically significant.RESULTSMEKK3 Is Capable of Activating Calcineurin/NFAT Signaling in Cardiac Myocytes—To identify protein kinases capable of activating calcineurin/NFAT signaling, we co-transfected an NFAT-luciferase reporter along with constructs encoding a candidate protein kinase into rat neonatal cardiac myocytes. Following co-transfection, we monitored NFAT activation by measuring luciferase activity in cell extracts. Using this screening assay, we found that a constitutively active form of MEKK3, a member of the MAP3K family of protein kinases, activated the NFAT-luciferase reporter construct ∼25-30-fold (Fig. 1A). Next, we showed that FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, completely inhibited NFAT activation by MEKK3(CA), indicating that calcineurin is involved in MEKK3-mediated NFAT activation (Fig. 1A). In addition, we found that MCIP1 inhibited MEKK3(CA)-mediated NFAT activation in a dosage-dependent way (Fig. 1B). The Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody indicated that the expression of various forms of HA-tagged MEKK3 was at the same level (the insets in Fig. 1, A and B). The inhibitory effects of FK506 and MCIP1 on NFAT activation by MEKK3(CA) indicated that MEKK3(CA)-induced NFAT activation is mediated through calcineurin signaling.MEKK3 Activates the Cardiac Hypertrophic Transcriptional Response—To determine whether MEKK3 is capable of inducing the cardiac hypertrophic transcriptional response, we evaluated the effect of MEKK3 on the activation of a number of genes associated with cardiac hypertrophy. For this purpose, we co-transfected cardiac myocytes with c-fos, β-MHC, and skeletal α-actin-luciferase reporter constructs with or without constitutively active MEKK3. We found that the transcriptional activities of c-fos, β-MHC, and skeletal α-actin reporter genes were induced by constitutively active MEKK3, and that the induction was inhibited by FK506 or MCIP1 (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that MEKK3 functions upstream of calcineurin-NFAT signaling to induce the cardiac hypertrophic transcriptional response.FIGURE 2MEKK3 induces cardiac hypertrophic gene expression.A, MEKK3 induces transcription of proto-oncogene and fetal contractile protein genes in vitro. c-fos, β-MHC, and skeletal α-actin-luciferase reporter constructs were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding MEKK3(CA) with or without FK506 or MCIP1.

TRE17 encodes a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16)/Rab GTPase-activating protein homology domain at its N terminus and a ubiquitin-specific protease at its C terminus. In the current study, we identified the ubiquitous calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) as a novel binding partner for TRE17. CaM bound directly to TRE17 in a Ca2+-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. The CaM-binding site was mapped to two hydrophobic motifs near the C terminus of the TBC domain. Point mutations within these motifs significantly reduced the interaction of TRE17 with CaM. We further found that TRE17 is monoubiquitinated and promotes its own deubiquitination in vivo. CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17 exhibited significantly reduced monoubiquitination, suggesting that binding of Ca2+/CaM to TRE17 promotes this modification. Consistent with this notion, treatment of cells with the CaM inhibitor W7 reduced levels of TRE17 monoubiquitination. Interestingly, the calcium ionophore A23187 induced accumulation of a polyubiquitinated TRE17 species. The effect of A23187 was attenuated in CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17.

Taken together, these studies indicate a role for Ca2+/CaM in regulating ubiquitination through direct interaction with TRE17. The covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitination regulates diverse cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, gene expression, and membrane trafficking (1Pickart C.M.

Proteins can be modified by the addition of a chain of multiple ubiquitin molecules (polyubiquitination) or a single ubiquitin (monoubiquitination). The most extensively studied function of ubiquitination is its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This requires appendage of a chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules to a substrate. In recent years, monoubiquitin has been shown to elicit numerous nondegradative functions, including endocytosis, lysosomal targeting, DNA repair, histone regulation and gene expression, and viral budding (4Sigismund S. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 149-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination occurs through a mechanism requiring the sequential activity of three enzymes. First, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 4The abbreviations used are:E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseUSPubiquitin-specific proteaseGAPGTPase-activating proteinCaMcalmodulinUbubiquitinDUBdeubiquitinating enzymeUBPubiquitin-specific processing proteaseUCHubiquitin C-terminal hydrolaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininMBPmaltose-binding proteinNEMN-ethylmaleimideBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid activates the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. Next, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) transfers the activated ubiquitin to the substrate, which is bound to a ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3 enzymes fall into two classes, the RING type and the HECT type. With RING-type ligases, ubiquitin is transferred directly from the E2 to the substrate, with the ligase serving as an adaptor to bridge their interaction. In contrast, ubiquitin is covalently linked to HECT ligases through a thiol ester intermediate before transfer to the substrate. A hierarchical organization of these enzymes exists, such that the human genome encodes a single E1 but at least 50 E2 enzymes and ∼1000 E3 ligases (1Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 3Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R.

This diversity of E3 ligases allows exquisite specificity of protein ubiquitination. ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase ubiquitin-specific protease GTPase-activating protein calmodulin ubiquitin deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific processing protease ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin maltose-binding protein N-ethylmaleimide 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Equally important in the regulation of cellular ubiquitination are deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from substrates as well as disassemble ubiquitin chains to replenish intracellular pools (6Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 7Wing S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Five subclasses of DUBs have been described, the largest and most diverse being the USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) or UBP (ubiquitin-specific processing protease) subclass (hereafter referred to as USP). USPs contain two highly conserved short motifs termed the Cys and His boxes, which encompass key catalytic residues. USPs are believed to target specific protein substrates. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH) constitute the second class of DUBs and are believed generally to function nonspecifically in the cleavage of free ubiquitin chains. Finally, recent studies have identified the OTU, Josephin, and JAMM/MPN+ domains as three additional families of deubiquitinating enzymes (6Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 7Wing S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As alluded to above, USPs constitute the largest family of DUBs, with over 80 members predicted in humans. Recent work has implicated USPs in numerous processes, including eye development, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, immune signaling, gene silencing, and neurological disease (6Amerik A.Y.

Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, in only a handful of cases have in vivo substrates been identified. Several well documented examples include fat facets (which targets liquid facets), HAUSP (which targets p53) (8Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W.

Our laboratory has focused on the cellular functions of the USP TRE17 (transfection recombined on chromosome 17; also referred to as USP6 and tre-2). TRE17 was originally identified as an oncogene, based on its ability to induce transformation of murine fibroblasts (14Nakamura T. Hillova J. Mariage-Samson R. Onno M. Huebner K. Cannizzaro L.A. Boghosian-Sell L. Croce C.M. Hill M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 733-741PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work has revealed that TRE17 also induces neoplastic growth in humans. The TRE17 locus was found to be a recurring target of chromosomal translocation in an osseous neoplasm termed aneurysmal bone cyst (15Oliveira A.M. Hsi B.L. Weremowicz S. Rosenberg A.E. Cin P.D.

Five different fusion partners of TRE17 were identified in aneurysmal bone cysts, and in each case “promoter swapping” occurred, leading to aberrantly high expression of TRE17 (15Oliveira A.M. Hsi B.L. Weremowicz S. Rosenberg A.E. Cin P.D. Joseph N. Bridge J.A. Perez-Atayde A.R. Fletcher J.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Oliveira A.M.

Despite strong evidence for the role of TRE17 in neoplastic growth in vivo, the mechanism by which it induces transformation remains unknown. TRE17 encodes a TBC (tre-2/bub2/cdc16)/Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) homology domain at its N terminus and a USP domain at its C terminus. Our recent work showed that the TBC domain of TRE17 targets the Arf6 GTPase, which regulates plasma membrane-endosomal recycling and actin remodeling (18Martinu L. Masuda-Robens J.M. Robertson S.E. Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Chou M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9752-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, TRE17 does not function as a GAP for Arf6. Rather, TRE17 binds directly to Arf6 via its TBC domain and appears to promote recycling of endocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane. Targets of the TRE17 USP domain have not been identified. Furthermore, it is not known whether TRE17 USP activity or effects on Arf6-dependent trafficking are required for transformation. In the current study, we sought to identify mechanisms of TRE17 regulation. We report herein that the ubiquitous calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca2+-dependent binding partner of TRE17. We further show that TRE17 is mono- and polyubiquitinated and that its association with CaM promotes these modifications. Our work thus reveals a role for Ca2+/CaM in regulating ubiquitination through direct interaction with TRE17. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin, and GlutaMax (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—Human calmodulin 2 cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from total HeLa RNA, and its sequence was confirmed by direct automated sequencing. The entire open reading frame was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEBG to generate a GST-tagged fusion protein (CaM·pEBG). Hemagglutinin (HA)-TRE17(long), HA-TRE17(onco), and T17(447)/pcDNA3 have been described previously (18Martinu L. Masuda-Robens J.M. Robertson S.E. Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Chou M.M. Mol. Cell.

Point mutants HA-T17(447)/F328E/pcDNA3, T17(447)/L319D, W320D/pcDNA3, HA-T17(447)/V306D,L311D)/pcDNA3, and HA-T17(447)/R15A/pcDNA3 were generated by overlap extension PCR. HA-T17(447)/Δ305–311/pcDNA3 and HA-T17(447)/Δ306–328/pcDNA3, harboring internal deletions of the indicated residues, were also generated by overlap extension PCR. HA-T17(325)/pcDNA3, HA-T17(305)/pcDNA3, and HA-T17(201)/pcDNA3 encode the indicated N-terminal residues of TRE17 and were generated using the XmnI, AflII, and Bsu36I sites, respectively. Further details are available upon request. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-HA antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (sc-805) and Roche Applied Science (clone 3F10) were used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively. Anti-GST has been described previously (19Masuda-Robens J.M. Kutney S.N. Qi H. Chou M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2151-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Anti-ubiquitin (Ub) antibody (FK2) was purchased from Affiniti Research Products, and anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) from New England Biolabs. Anti-CaM was generously provided by Dr. David B. Sacks (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Purified CaM conjugated to agarose beads was purchased from Sigma. W7 and A23187 were purchased from Calbiochem, BAPTA from Molecular Probes, and N-ethylmaleimide from Sigma. Pull-down and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in CaM lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 500 μm BAPTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with the indicated free CaCl2 concentration. Concentrations of CaCl2 used to give the desired free Ca2+ concentrations were estimated using Maxchelator software (C. Patton, Stanford University, CA). Free Ca2+ concentrations in the lysis buffers were confirmed using a Fura-2-based fluorescence measurement according to the manufacturer's (Calbiochem) instructions. Cells were solubilized on ice for 10 min and then pelleted at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. An aliquot of the clarified supernatant was removed for direct immunoblotting. The remainder was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), CaM-agarose (Sigma), or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) beads as indicated for 4 h at 4°C with constant mixing. Beads were washed four times in CaM wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 500 μm BAPTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) supplemented with the appropriate CaCl2 concentration. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) was added to lysis and wash buffers where indicated. Samples were boiled, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, subjected to immunoblotting, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For direct binding of TRE17 to CaM, T17(447) was purified as an MBP fusion from Escherichia coli as described previously (18Martinu L. Masuda-Robens J.M. Robertson S.E. Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Chou M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9752-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Deubiquitination Assays—Deubiquitinating activity of TRE17 alleles was measured as described previously (20Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ub-Met-β-galactosidase/pACYC184 was co-transformed with the specified GST fusion construct into E. coli MC1061. Positive clones were grown overnight and then incubated with 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The culture was pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with anti-β-galactosidase (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). The DOA4–, TRE17(Onco)–, and TRE17(long)/pGEX-KG plasmids have been described previously and were generously provided by Dr. Mark Hochstrasser (Yale University) (20Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Mutation of cysteine 541 to serine in TRE17(long)/USP– was achieved with QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: 5′-CAACCTGGGAAAC-ACTAGTTTCATGAACTCAAGCATCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGATGCTTGAGTTCATGAAA-CTAGTGTTTCCCAGGTTG (antisense). Monitoring of TRE17 Ubiquitination in Vivo—HeLa cells were transfected with the various TRE17 alleles and then treated with W7 (100 μm for 40 min) or A23187 (40 μm in the presence of 1 mm extracellular CaCl2 for 1 h) as indicated. Cells were lysed in (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide plus protease inhibitors). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA matrix (Roche Applied Science), washed four times in the same buffer, and then immunoblotted with anti-Ub or anti-HA. CaM Binds Directly to TRE17 in a Ca2+-dependent Manner—To gain insights into TRE17 function and regulation, we sought to identify its binding partners using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Two splice variants of TRE17 have been described, which give rise to the TRE17(long) and TRE17(onco) isoforms (Fig. 1A). TRE17(onco) was used as bait because TRE17(long) was not efficiently expressed in yeast. Using a human skeletal muscle cDNA library, troponin C (TnC), the calcium (Ca2+)-binding regulatory subunit of the muscle troponin complex, was identified as a specific TRE17(onco)-interacting protein (data not shown). Although TnC is expressed exclusively in muscle cells, TRE17 is expressed in multiple cell lines of varied tissue origin, including HeLa cervical carcinoma, MCF7 breast cancer, and human erytholeukemia (HEL) cells (supplemental Fig. 1). We therefore explored whether homologues of TnC that are more widely expressed might also bind to TRE17. One such protein is calmodulin, which shares 46% identity and 65% similarity with troponin C. CaM is a ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved Ca2+-binding protein that is regarded as a major transducer of Ca2+ signals (21Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S. MacKenzie L. De Smet P. Travers M. Tovey S.C. Seo J.T. Berridge M.J. Ciccolini F. Lipp P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 22Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chin D. Means A.R.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CaM binds to Ca2+ through its EF-hands, causing a conformational change that enables it to associate with target proteins, such as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), in a Ca2+-dependent manner (25Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochem. 1980; 19: 5608-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, CaM can bind to other proteins, such as IQGAP1, independently of Ca2+ (26Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 317: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether binding of CaM to TRE17 was Ca2+-dependent. Basal levels of intracellular Ca2+ in most mammalian cells are in the 10–100 nm range; stimulation typically elevates levels to 0.5–1.0 μm, although Ca2+ in the 100 μm and even low mm range are observed in certain microenvironments (21Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S. MacKenzie L. De Smet P. Travers M. Tovey S.C. Seo J.T. Berridge M.J. Ciccolini F. Lipp P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 22Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chin D. Means A.R.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore examined binding under a range of Ca2+ concentrations. HA-tagged TRE17(long) or TRE17(onco) was transfected into HeLa cells. Cells were lysed in the presence of various Ca2+ concentrations and subjected to affinity chromatography using CaM-agarose beads. TRE17 peptides failed to bind CaM in buffer containing the Ca2+-chelating agent BAPTA without additional Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). When Ca2+ was raised to 100 nm, a minimal degree of TRE17 binding was observed. Strikingly, elevation of Ca2+ to 1 μm induced a significant increase in binding of TRE17(long) and TRE17(onco) to CaM (Fig. 1B). Binding was not significantly enhanced when Ca2+ was raised further to 100 μm (data not shown). To delineate the site of interaction, we tested a C-terminal truncation mutant that encodes the first 447 amino acids of TRE17 (T17(447)) (see Fig. 1A). T17(447) also bound to CaM in the presence of 1 μm, but not 100 nm, Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Together, these data reveal that TRE17 binds to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that this interaction is regulated by physiologically relevant changes in Ca2+ levels. Furthermore, the N-terminal 447 amino acids of TRE17 are sufficient to mediate this interaction. We next examined whether TRE17-CaM interaction was direct by using recombinant purified proteins. MBP-tagged T17(447) was used, as recombinant TRE17(onco) and TRE17(long) could not be purified from E. coli in sufficient quantities. Purified MBP-T17(447) was incubated with CaM or control agarose beads. As seen in Fig. 1C, MBP-T17(447) but not MBP was specifically retained on CaM beads in the presence of 1 μm Ca2+. As described above, association was significantly reduced when Ca2+ was lowered to 100 nm. These results confirm that TRE17 binds directly to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Association of TRE17 with Endogenous CaM in Mammalian Cells—To determine whether interaction of TRE17 with CaM occurrs in vivo, epitope-tagged forms of the proteins were transfected into HeLa cells. CaM was expressed as a GST fusion together with HA-tagged TRE17(long), which is the isoform endogenously expressed in HeLa cells (Ref. 18Martinu L. Masuda-Robens J.M. Robertson S.E. Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Chou M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9752-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and data not shown). Lysates were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads and then probed with anti-HA to detect associated TRE17. As seen in Fig. 2A, TRE17(long) bound to GST·CaM but not GST alone. T17(447) also co-precipitated specifically with GST·CaM (Fig. 2A). We next wished to confirm whether TRE17 associates with endogenous CaM. HeLa cells were transfected with HA-tagged TRE17(long), TRE17(onco), T17(447), or control vector. Cells were lysed in the presence of 1 μm Ca2+, immunoprecipitated using anti-HA matrix, and then probed with anti-CaM antibody. Endogenous CaM specifically co-immunoprecipitated with TRE17(long) and TRE17(onco) (Fig. 2B). Again, the N-terminal 447 amino acids of TRE17 were sufficient to mediate interaction, confirming our in vitro binding analysis. Similar experiments could not be performed for endogenous TRE17, because anti-TRE17 antibodies were not sufficiently sensitive to detect the endogenous protein. These experiments nevertheless demonstrate that TRE17 peptides associate with endogenous CaM. Mapping of the CaM-binding Site in TRE17—Multiple CaM-binding consensus sites have been defined, including 1-10, 1-14, and IQ motifs (28Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). There are two subtypes (1-5-10 and 1-10) of the 1-10 motif and three subtypes (1-5-8-14, 1-8-14, and 1-14) of the 1-14 motif in which the indicated positions are occupied by hydrophobic amino acids. IQ motifs consist of (I/L)QXXX(K/R), where the first position is isoleucine or leucine, the second is glutamine, the last is basic, and X is any amino acid (28Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Within T17(447), which is sufficient to bind CaM, there are one IQ, one 1-8-14, and two 1-5-10 motifs (Fig. 3A). To determine whether any of these motifs mediates binding to CaM, a series of nested deletions was generated and co-expressed with GST·CaM in HeLa cells. Glutathione-Sepharose pull-downs were performed, and association of TRE17 mutants was monitored by anti-HA immunoblotting. Although T17(447) bound strongly to CaM, a construct containing the first 325 amino acids (T17 (325)) exhibited greatly reduced binding (Fig. 3B). Mutants encoding the N-terminal 201 or 305 amino acids failed to associate with GST·CaM (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the CaM-binding site resides at or near amino acids 305–325, which comprises the two 1-5-10 motifs (Fig. 3A). To pinpoint the site of interaction, internal deletion mutants were generated in the context of T17(447). As shown in Fig. 4A, deletion of amino acids 305–311 or 306–328 abolished binding of T17(447) to GST·CaM. Thus, both of the 1-5-10 motifs could potentially contribute to CaM binding. This was confirmed through analysis of point mutants in which the conserved hydrophobic residues were mutated. Mutation of the first 1-5-10 motif (T17(447)/V306D,L311D) severely inhibited interaction of TRE17 to CaM (Fig. 4B). Similarly, two independent mutants of the second 1-5-10 motif, T17(447)/F328E and T17(447)/L319D,W320D, were also significantly compromised in binding (Fig. 4B). We further confirmed that mutation of this motif within the context of full-length TRE17(onco) and TRE17(long) inhibited CaM binding (Onco/F328E and Long/F328E, Fig. 4C). In contrast, mutation of the putative IQ motif (mutant R15A, Fig. 4B) had no effect on binding of T17(447) to CaM. Taken together, these results indicate that optimal binding to CaM requires both 1-5-10 motifs of TRE17. TRE17 Is Monoubiquitinated and Promotes Its Own Deubiquitination in Vivo—During our immunoblotting analysis, we noted that in addition to peptides of the predicted sizes, both TRE17(onco) and T17(447) gave rise to a species that migrated ∼8 kDa larger (see Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Notably, this slower migrating product was significantly reduced in all CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17 (Fig. 4B). Based on its relative molecular mass, we predicted that this band might represent a monoubiquitinated form of TRE17. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells expressing HA-TRE17(onco) or -T17(447) were lysed in the presence of NEM to inhibit the activity of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, then immunoblotted with anti-Ub or anti-HA antibodies. The slower migrating species of both TRE17(onco) and T17(447) reacted strongly with the anti-Ub antibody (Fig. 5A, arrows). This signal was specific, as a highly expressed control protein, HA-tagged Akt, showed minimal cross-reactivity with the anti-Ub antibody (Fig. 5A). In contrast to TRE17(onco) and T17(447), ubiquitination of TRE17(long) was not readily detected (Fig. 5B). Because TRE17(long) is catalytically active as a ubiquitin-specific protease, but TRE17(onco) and T17(447) are not (20Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that TRE17(long) might promote its own deubiquitination. If this were true, inactivation of its USP domain should lead to increased monoubiquitination of TRE17(long). We therefore generated a point mutation in which the highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-541) required for USP activity was replaced with serine (denoted TRE17(long)/USP–). To confirm that this mutation ablated USP activity, GST-TRE17(long) wild type or USP– was co-expressed in E. coli with a chimeric β-galactosidase-ubiquitin construct (βgal-Ub), which has been widely used as a model USP substrate (20Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The positive control DOA4, a USP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, catalyzed conversion of βgal-Ub to its deubiquitinated form (Fig. 5C). Similarly, TRE17(long) efficiently catalyzed deubiquitination of βgal-Ub. In contrast, TRE17(onco) and TRE17(long)/USP– were completely inactive (Fig. 5C). Having confirmed that the TRE17(long)/USP– mutant is catalytically inactive, we next examined its ubiquitination status in mammalian cells. HA-TRE17(long)/USP– was immunopurified from transfected HeLa cells and then subjected to anti-Ub immunoblotting. In striking contrast to wild-type TRE17(long), TRE17(long)/USP– was strongly recognized by a"

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 10523–10530). We found that when overexpressed in CHOP cells, neutral ceramidase hydrolyzed cell surface ceramide, which increased in amount after the treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase, leading to an increase in the cellular level of sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate. On the other hand, knockdown of the endogenous enzyme by siRNA decreased the cellular level of both sphingolipid metabolites. The treatment of cells with bovine serum albumin significantly reduced the cellular level of sphingosine, but not sphingosine 1-phosphate, generated by overexpression of the enzyme. The cellular level of sphingosine 1-phosphate increased with overexpression of the cytosolic sphingosine kinase. These results suggest that sphingosine 1-phosphate is mainly produced inside of the cell after the incorporation of sphingosine generated on the plasma membranes. The enzyme also seems to participate in the hydrolysis of serum-derived ceramide in the vascular system. Significant amounts of sphingosine as well as sphingosine 1-phosphate were generated in the cell-free conditioned medium of ceramidase transfectants, compared with mock transfectants. No increase in these metabolites was observed if serum or bacterial sphingomyelinase was omitted from the conditioned medium, suggesting that the major source of ceramide is the serum-derived sphingomyelin. A sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, S1P1, was internalized much faster by the treatment of S1P1-overexpressing cells with conditioned medium of ceramidase transfectants than that of mock transfectants. Collectively, these results clearly indicate that the enzyme is involved in the metabolism of ceramide at the plasma membrane and in the extracellular milieu, which could regulate sphingosine 1-phosphate-mediated signaling through the generation of sphingosine.

S1P is a ligand for the G protein-coupled, plasma membrane-spanning receptors S1P1–5 (10Hla T. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). S1P-mediated signaling regulates the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, being involved in the formation and maintenance of the vascular system. S1P has been also implicated as an intracellular second messenger in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (3Spiegel S. Kolesnick R. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Intracellular S1P seems to be generated through phosphorylation of Sph by Sph kinase, which is mainly located in the cytosol (3Spiegel S. Kolesnick R. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Sph is supplied to Sph kinase has not yet been clarified. In the vascular system, platelets are thought to be a source of S1P because they contain a very large amount of S1P because of the strong activity of Sph kinase and a lack of S1P lysase, and are known to release S1P when stimulated (11Yatomi Y.

Sph is considered to be exclusively generated from Cer through the action of ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23) because de novo synthesis of Sph has been ruled out experimentally because of the specificity of Δ4 desaturase, which acts on dihydroCer to convert Cer but not on dihydroSph (15Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G.

To date, acid, neutral, and alkaline CDases have been identified, which are clearly distinguished by catalytic pH optimum, primary structure, and localization (16Ito M. Okino N. Tani M. Mitsutake S. Kita K. Futerman A.H. Ceramide Signaling. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003: 41-48Google Scholar). However, which CDase species are involved in the generation of S1P and S1P-mediated signaling remains to be elucidated. Neutral CDase, which shows an optimal pH of 6.5–8.5 (except the enzyme from slime mold whose pH optimum is 3.5–4.0), has been cloned from bacteria (17Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S.

Murine neutral CDases are localized at the plasma membrane as a type II integral membrane protein and occasionally released from cells after processing of the N-terminal anchoring region (24Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). O-Glycosylation of a mucin-like domain (mucin box) near the N terminus was found to be required for retention of the enzyme on the plasma membrane (24Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The localization of human neutral CDase is controversial, i.e. a form lacking the N-terminal 13 amino acids was exclusively found in mitochondria (23El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A.

Tani M. Nakagawa T. Okino N. Ito M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that targeted expression of neutral CDase rescued the retinal degeneration in arrestin and phospholipase C mutants of Drosophila through modulation of the endocytosis of rhodopsin in photoreceptors (26Acharya U.

We also found that the gene knockdown of zebrafish neutral CDase during embryogenesis resulted in a defect of blood cell circulation (20Yoshimura Y. Tani M. Okino N. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44012-44022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It should be noted that neutral CDase activity was regulated by several cytokines and growth factors (28Nikolva-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

In this study, we found that mouse neutral CDase is involved in the metabolism of Cer at the plasma membrane and in the extracellular milieu. Sph generated in the plasma membrane by the CDase was promptly incorporated into the cells and then phosphorylated by cytosolic Sph kinase while Sph generated in the serum by the secreted CDase was then phosphorylated by serum-derived Sph kinase. These two pathways for the generation of S1P involving neutral CDase are demonstrated for the first time in this study. Materials—CHOP cells were kindly provided by Dr. K. Nara (Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Sciences). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Nacalai Tesque. Doxorubicin and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma, ECL plus from Amersham Biosciences, Bacilluscereus sphingomyelinase from Funakoshi, [14C]palmitic acid and [14C]stearic acid from Amersham Biosciences Radiolabeled Chemicals, anti-Myc antibody from Invitrogen, anti-HA antibody and rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgM from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Cer monoclonal antibody 15B4 from Biocytex Biotech, and dimethylsphingosine from BIOMOL. Anti-Sph kinase type I antibody was raised in a rabbit using the recombinant mouse Sph kinase as an antigen (30Fukuda Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C12-NBD-Cer was prepared as described (31Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. CDase Assay—The activity of neutral CDase was measured using C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate (32Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake M. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3462-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—To obtain a mouse neutral CDase tagged with Myc at the C terminus (wild-type CDase), cDNA encoding the CDase was subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) (Invitrogen) by PCR using a 5′ primer with a KpnI restriction site (5′-AGGGTACCGAAATGGCAAAGCGAACCTTCTCC-3′) and a 3′ primer with a XhoI restriction site and a disrupted stop codon (5′-GCCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAATTTCAAAAGGGGAAGA-3′). To obtain a CDase mutant, which possesses the secretory signal sequence of the mouse Vh chain instead of the signal/anchor sequence (SecCD), a DNA fragment of the CDase lacking the signal/anchor sequence and containing a sequence encoding a Myc-His epitope and a stop codon at the 3′-end, was amplified with a 5′ primer with a PstI restriction site (5′-TGAACTGCAGAAAGATTCAGGAAATCACTGGTTT-3′) and a 3′ primer with a NotI restriction site (5′-GGGCGGCCGCTCAATGGTGATGATGATGATGACC-3′) using wild-type CDase as a template. A CDase mutant with an ER retention signal (ERCD) was constructed by PCR using a 5′ primer with a PstI restriction site (5′-CCACCATGGCAAAGCGAACCTTCTCC-3′) and a 3′ primer with a NotI restriction site (5′-GGGCGGCCGCAGTAGTGACAACTTCAAAAGGAGAAG-3′). These fragments were digested with PstI and NotI, and subcloned into the vector pCMV/Myc/ER (Invitrogen). The sequences of these constructs were verified with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Japan; Model 377). RNA Interference—Gene silencing of the neutral CDase in mouse B16 cells was performed using the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-DNR vector (Clontech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequence-specific DNA oligonucleotide was selected from mouse neutral CDase cDNA as described below. Mouse neutral CDase starting 721 nucleotides from the initiation codon, TCCACAGTCAGAGAGAGCA, and a scrambled sequence (SCR) for the control experiment, GATGACAGTGACAAGCACC, were used. The sequences were evaluated against the data base using the NIH BLAST program to test for specificity. To express siRNA, B16 cells were transfected with the target sequence inserted in pSIREN-DNR using Lipofectamine™ PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—CHOP cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells that express polyoma LT antigen to support the replication of eukaryotic expression vectors (33Heffernan M. Dennis W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were grown in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. CHO cells, chinese hamster ovary cells, and B16 melanoma cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), respectively, each supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. cDNA transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine™ PLUS according to the instructions of the manufacturer. CHO-SPHK1 and CHO-S1P1 cells, which are transfectants of CHO cells stably expressing mouse Sph kinase type I (SPHK1) and S1P1, respectively, were established as described previously (30Fukuda Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Kohno T. Wada A. Igarashi Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Conditioned Medium—CHOP cells were grown on 6-well plates for 24 h and transfected with plasmid containing the CDase cDNA. At 18 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free α-MEM (2 ml/well on 6-well plates), and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. The cell culture medium was collected by pipette and subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used as a conditioned medium. Measurement of Sph and S1P by HPLC—The amounts of Sph and S1P were measured with HPLC (Agilent 1100 series, Agilent Technologies) after derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) essentially as described (35Min J-K. Yoo H-S. Lee E-Y. Lee W-J. Lee Y-M Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Extraction and Analysis of Radioisotope-labeled Cer—Cells labeled with [14C]palmitic acid or [14C]stearic acid were harvested by centrifugation (120 × g for 5 min) and washed with PBS. Lipids were extracted with 500 μl of methanol with sonication. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatants obtained were dried under N2 gas, dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and then applied to the TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (90/20/0.5, v/v). Radiolabeled Cer separated on the TLC plate was visualized with an imaging analyzer (FLA5000 model, Fuji Film, Japan), and the photostimulated luminescence of the band was quantified. Sph Kinase Assay—A Sph kinase assay was performed according to the method of Olivera et al. (36Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, an appropriate amount of FBS was incubated with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 50 μm Sph at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of reaction mix (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.25% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 375 μl of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:200: 1), and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). A portion of the lipid extract was applied to a TLC plate, which was then developed in butanol/acetic acid/water (3/1/1, v/v). Radioactive bands were visualized and quantified using an imaging analyzer. One enzyme unit was defined as the amount capable of forming 1 μmol of S1P per min. A value of 10–9 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 nanounit in this study. Protein Assay, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—Transfected cells were cultured on cover glass then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After a rinse with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized, if necessary, with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After treatment with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in PBS) for 15 min, the samples were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C for 1 day followed by secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Immunostained samples were examined with a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope with an Axio-Cam CCD camera, Carl Zeiss) or a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Digital Eclipse C1, Nikon, Japan). Hydrolysis of Cell Surface Cer by Neutral CDase and Subsequent Generation of Sph and S1P—Because the catalytic domain of neutral CDase faces the extracellular space (24Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), cell surface Cer is expected to be hydrolyzed by the enzyme. However, no significant increase in Sph was observed when mouse neutral CDase was overexpressed in CHOP cells, possibly because of the limited amount of free Cer in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes. Thus, bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) was used as a tool for hydrolysis of the cell surface SM to increase the amount of free Cer in the plasma membranes (39Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment of the cells with bacterial SMase, a marked increase in the level of free Cer was observed in both CHOP cells transfected with a neutral CDase cDNA (CDase transfectants) and cells transfected with a vector without the CDase gene (mock transfectants) (Fig. 1A). Expectedly, the amount of free Cer in CDase-overexpressing cells was found to decrease about 30% compared with that in mock transfectants, indicating cell surface Cer was hydrolyzed by neutral CDase expressed in the CHOP transfectants. This was confirmed with an immunocytochemical method using a specific anti-Cer monoclonal antibody, 15B4, which was successfully used for the detection of cell surface Cer (40Grassme H. Jekle A.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The amounts of cell surface Cer in CDase transfectants, which increased significantly after treatment with bacterial SMase (Fig. 1B, panels a versus c), were reduced much faster than those in mock transfectants (Fig. 1B, panels c versus d). Simultaneously, the amounts of cellular Sph and S1P in CDase transfectants increased much faster than those in mock transfectants (Fig. 1C). The increase in these metabolites occurred transiently, peaking at 0.5–1 h (Fig. 1C). Effects of Down-regulation of Endogenous Neutral CDase on the Amounts of Cellular Sph and S1P—To verify whether endogenous neutral CDase is involved in the generation of Sph and S1P by the hydrolysis of cell surface Cer, siRNA was used to suppress the activity of the endogenous enzyme. The effectiveness of the neutral CDase siRNA was first examined using neutral CDase overexpressors. Mouse B16 melanoma cells were simultaneously transfected with mouse neutral CDase cDNA and neutral CDase siRNA. For the control experiment, SCR siRNA was co-transfected with the CDase cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the increase of neutral CDase activity in the CDase transfectants was strongly suppressed by co-transfection with the CDase siRNA, but not with the SCR siRNA. Furthermore, the CDase siRNA effectively inhibited the activity of the endogenous neutral CDase as expected (Fig. 2B), while acid SMase activity was not affected by the transfection with the CDase siRNA under the conditions used (data not shown). We then examined the effects of the CDase siRNA on the cellular levels of Sph and S1P during the treatment of cells with bacterial SMase. Interestingly, production of Sph and S1P in B16 cells was significantly reduced by CDase siRNA, but not SCR siRNA, during SMase treatment (Fig. 2C). Collectively, not only the overexpressed neutral CDase but also the endogenous enzyme was responsible for the generation of Sph as well as S1P by hydrolysis of cell surface Cer. Effects of Localization of Neutral CDase on the Generation of Sph and S1P—To disclose the effects of the subcellular localization of neutral CDase on the generation of Sph and S1P, two constructs were generated; a secretable mutant CDase (SecCD), which has a secretory signal sequence instead of the signal/anchor sequence, and an ER-retainable mutant CDase (ERCD), which has an ER retention signal at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). These constructs were tagged with Myc at the C terminus. The mouse neutral CDase (wild-type CDase) was detected as two protein bands having a molecular mass of 123 kDa (a mature form) and 107 kDa (a developing form in the ER) by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody when expressed in CHOP cells (Fig. 3B). The mature form was also detected in the culture medium (Fig. 3B). The signals for wild-type CDase were detected in ER/Golgi compartments as well as on plasma membranes by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, SecCD was exclusively released into the medium (Fig. 3B), and no signals were detected on the plasma membranes under impermeable conditions (Fig. 3C), indicating that the mutant enzyme was not retained on the cell surface. In contrast to SecCD, ERCD was detected in the cell lysate as a 107-kDa ER-developing form but not in the medium (Fig. 3B), and exclusively localized to the ER and not present on the cell surface (Fig. 3C). ERCD showed strong activity in the cell lysate but not in the medium (Fig. 3B). Using these mutant and wild-type CDases, the generation of cellular Sph and S1P was examined after treatment of the cells with SMase. A significant increase in the amounts of Sph and S1P was observed in the cells transfected with wild-type CDase and SecCD, but not ERCD, compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that plasma membrane-bound and secreted neutral CDases, but not the ER-retainable enzyme (ERCD), are involved in the generation of Sph by hydrolysis of Cer at the outer leaflets of plasma membranes possibly leading to an increase in the cellular S1P level. It is worth noting that ERCD did not participate in the generation of Sph and S1P although it exhibited strong activity in the cells (Fig. 3B). Sites for Neutral CDase-dependent Production of Sph and S1P—To examine whether Sph is generated at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by the action of neutral CDase, the amount of Sph in CDase transfectants was examined with or without treatment with 1% fatty acid-free BSA at 4 °C after the SMase treatment (Fig. 4A). The amount of cell-bound Sph was drastically reduced by BSA treatment, possibly because Sph was withdrawn by BSA from the outer leaflet of plas"
https://openalex.org/W1966856730,"Pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been found to alter the voluntary consumption of alcohol. Here we characterize the role of central angiotensin II (Ang II) in alcohol intake first by using transgenic rats that express an antisense RNA against angiotensinogen and consequently have reduced Ang II levels exclusively in the central nervous system [TGR(ASrAOGEN)680]. These rats consumed markedly less alcohol in comparison to their wild-type controls. Second, Spirapril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which passes the blood-brain barrier, did not influence the alcohol consumption in the TGR(ASrAOGEN)680, but it significantly reduced alcohol intake in wild-type rats. Studies in knockout mice indicated that the central effect of Ang II on alcohol consumption is mediated by the angiotensin receptor AT1 whereas the AT2 receptor and the bradykinin B2 receptor are not involved. Furthermore, the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is markedly reduced in rats with low central Ang II, strengthening our hypothesis of a role of dopaminergic transmission in Ang II-controlled alcohol preference. Our results indicate that a distinct drug-mediated control of the central RAS could be a promising therapy for alcohol disease."

FANCE interactions with FANCC and FANCD2 have been shown to involve direct binding using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system (20Medhurst A.L. Huber P.A. Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol.

FANCE has thus become a focus of interest as a connection between the core complex and other elements of the FA pathway, although its simultaneous binding to FANCC and FANCD2, providing an actual physical link, has not been demonstrated.In this study, the role of FANCE in mediating interactions between other components of the FA pathway is tested in the yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) system. Both a FANCC/FANCE/FANCF ternary interaction, indicating a role for FANCE in complex assembly, and a FANCC/FANCE/FANCD2 ternary interaction, linking another member of the core complex to the downstream components of the FA pathway, are identified. The FANCE-mediated FANCC/FANCD2 interaction is also observed between endogenous proteins in human cell lines. A Y2H-based random mutagenesis strategy is developed to generate FANCE mutants with selective loss of the FANCD2 (but not FANCC) interaction for further analysis in the mammalian system. Loss of the FANCE/FANCD2 link is associated with the absence of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and the presence of DNA cross-linker sensitivity, indicating the importance of this interaction to the function of the FA DNA damage response pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial and Yeast Strains—Escherichia coli strains DH10B (Invitrogen) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used in the construction and propagation of plasmid constructs unless indicated otherwise. E. coli was propagated in LB medium at 30 °C for FANCD2 and FANCE constructs and at 37 °C for other constructs. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ69-4A (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). The c-Myc epitope sequence was added to the 5′-end of the ORF by PCR using Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science). All PCR products and linker regions were verified by DNA sequencing. pBabe-Myc-FANCE mutants were generated by replacement of the pBabe-Myc-FANCE ORF with ORFs excised from the pGADT7-FANCE mutant yeast constructs.

The PA317 cell line was stably transfected with pBabe-puro constructs using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with selection in 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Following removal of PA317 producer lines from selection, retroviral supernatant was collected from cells grown at 34 °C, filtered through a 0.4-μm filter, and used to transduce LCLs in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). LCLs were exposed to fresh supernatant twice daily for 4 days, followed by selection in 1 μg/ml puromycin.Generation of FANCE Antisera—The region of the FANCE ORF encoding amino acids 371–536 was cloned into the pGEX3X vector (Amersham Biosciences) for generation of the fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the FANCE C terminus. GST fusion protein was produced in E. coli strain JM109 by induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and eluted protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. New Zealand White rabbits were injected with a 1:1 mixture of the fusion protein of GST and the FANCE C terminus and complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by monthly boosters of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The polyclonal antiserum was purified with immobilized protein A (Pierce) according to the directions of the manufacturer, followed by depletion of antibodies directed against GST by chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B containing immobilized GST. Antiserum specificity was validated by testing for recognition of recombinant protein and endogenous protein (58 kDa) in cell extracts from normal versus FA-E cell lines.Subcellular Fractionation, Whole Cell Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Subcellular fractionation of LCLs was performed using the NucBuster protein extraction system (Novagen, Madison, WI). For preparation of whole cell extracts, LCLs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in NETN lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.4% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, followed by shearing with a 25-gauge needle and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of clarified supernatants was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoprecipitation, whole cell extracts were diluted to adjust the Nonidet P-40 concentration to 0.1%, and antibodies were added at a concentration of 1 μg/mg protein extract (for rabbit polyclonal antibodies or purified preimmune serum) or 0.8 μg/mg protein extract (for goat antibodies or goat control IgG) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Immobilized protein A or G (Pierce) was then added, and incubation was continued overnight 4 °C, followed by three washes with NETN lysis buffer containing 0.15% Nonidet P-40 and addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The antisera used in immunoprecipitation included the polyclonal anti-FANCE antibody described above; a rabbit polyclonal anti-FANCC antibody generously provided by H. Youssoufian (28Youssoufian H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7975-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); and goat anti-FANCC (C-14), anti-FANCE (L-21), and anti-FANCD2 (E-19) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Whole cell extracts, subcellular fractions, or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris glycine, 7% Tris acetate, or, for resolution of the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2, 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Western analysis was performed with the rabbit antibodies against FANCC and FANCE described above and mouse antibodies against FANCD2 (FI17) and c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and β-tubulin (Roche Applied Science), followed by peroxidase-conjugated IgG and chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences).Mitomycin C (MMC) Viability Assay—LCLs (105/ml) were seeded in 24-well plates. After 24 h of growth, medium supplemented with MMC (Roche Applied Science) was added at concentrations up to 300 nm. After 8 days, cells were counted using a Coulter counter. Cell counts were plotted against MMC concentrations.RESULTSY3H Analysis of FANCE-mediated Protein Interactions—Use of the Y3H system to examine the role of FANCE in mediating interactions between other FA proteins revealed the participation of FANCE in two ternary complexes (TABLE ONE). FANCE was able to mediate the interaction between FANCC and FANCD2, the two proteins with which FANCE interacts directly in the Y2H system. Nutritional and lacZ reporter gene activation was observed for both AD-FANCC/BD-FANCD2 and BD-FANCC/AD-FANCD2 pairings (Fig. 2A and TABLE TWO). The Y3H interaction was abrogated by the L554P mutation (29Gavish H. dos Santos C.C. Buchwald M. Hum. Mol.

Some reporter activation was observed for the BD-empty vector/HA-FANCE/AD-FANCF cotransformants, but the levels were below those seen for the BD-FANCC/HA-FANCE/AD-FANCF combination (Fig. 2B and TABLE THREE). The FANCC-L554P mutant (29Gavish H. dos Santos C.C. Buchwald M. Hum. Mol.

Consistent with the Y3H result, novel reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous FANCC and FANCD2 proteins from a normal human LCL was observed, as were the previously described constituent FANCC/FANCE and FANCE/FANCD2 interactions (Fig. 3, A–C). Only antibody against the C terminus of FANCD2 co-immunoprecipitated FANCE and FANCC as shown, whereas antibody to the N terminus of FANCD2 failed to immunoprecipitate either protein. The absence of the FANCC/FANCD2 interaction in FA-E cells was recovered by exogenous expression of FANCE with an N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag (Myc-FANCE), demonstrating the FANCE-dependent nature of the interaction (Fig. 3D). The interaction was reduced or absent in FA patient-derived LCLs from complementation groups corresponding to core complex members, but was maintained in an FA-D1 LCL, which is deficient for a downstream component of the pathway. Loss of the FANCC/FANCD2 interaction accompanied loss or reduction of the FANCE/FANCD2 interaction, also consistent with mediation of the FANCC/FANCD2 interaction by FANCE (Fig. 3E). FANCF, which the FANCC/FANCE/FANCF Y3H interaction indicates may be proximal to the FANCC/FANCE pairing in the FA core complex, was not detected in FANCD2 immunoprecipitates from normal LCLs (data not shown).FIGURE 3Demonstration of the FANCC/FANCE/FANCD2 interaction in human cells. Endogenous FANCC and FANCD2 were co-immunoprecipitated from whole cell extract (WCE) of the normal wild-type (wt) HSC93 LCL. A, immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FANCE antibody. Blots were probed with anti-FANCD2 or anti-FANCC antibody. B, immunoprecipitation with anti-FANCD2 antibody. Blots were probed with anti-FANCC or anti-FANCE antibody.

Immunoprecipitations in A–C were performed with goat (anti-FANCE Ab1, anti-FANCC Ab1, and anti-FANCD2) or rabbit (anti-FANCE Ab2 and anti-FANCC Ab2) antibody from 3 mg of whole cell extract. The electrophoretic conditions used did not resolve the monoubiquitinated from the non-ubiquitinated form of FANCD2.

https://openalex.org/W1983284877,"Insulin is a key hormone that controls glucose homeostasis. In liver, insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the transcriptions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes. In insulin resistance and type II diabetes there is an elevation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which contributes to hyperglycemia. To search for novel genes that negatively regulate insulin signaling in controlling metabolic pathways, we screened a cDNA library derived from the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice using a reporter system comprised of the PEPCK promoter placed upstream of the alkaline phosphatase gene. The mitogen-activated dual specificity protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP-3) was identified as a candidate gene that antagonized insulin suppression on PEPCK gene transcription from this screen. In this study, we showed that MKP-3 was expressed in insulin-responsive tissues and that its expression was markedly elevated in the livers of insulin-resistant obese mice. In addition, MKP-3 can activate PEPCK promoter in synergy with dexamethasone in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MKP-3 in hepatoma cells by adenoviral infection increased the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase genes and led to elevated glucose production. Taken together, our data strongly suggests that MKP-3 plays a role in regulating gluconeogenic gene expression and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Therefore, dysregulation of MKP-3 expression and/or function in liver may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type II diabetes.

Therefore, dysregulation of MKP-3 expression and/or function in liver may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing at an alarming rate and affects ∼6% of the adult population in the Western society (1Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance, characterized by elevated circulating insulin level and impaired glucose tolerance, usually precedes the development of diabetes and is closely associated with obesity. In the past decade, a tremendous amount of effort has been made trying to understand the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance. Our approach toward this same goal is to identify genes that antagonize insulin action in insulin-responsive tissues and develop small molecule inhibitors for these targets, hoping to find drugs that cannot only treat type 2 diabetes but also improve insulin sensitivity and ultimately cure the disease. Insulin is an anabolic hormone that controls many aspects of metabolism. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are:MAPKmitogen-activated kinaseDexdexamethasoneERKextracellular signal-regulated protein kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMKPMAPK phosphatasePECKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylasePIphosphatidylinositolSEAPsecreted placental alkaline phosphatase 2The abbreviations used are:MAPKmitogen-activated kinaseDexdexamethasoneERKextracellular signal-regulated protein kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMKPMAPK phosphatasePECKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylasePIphosphatidylinositolSEAPsecreted placental alkaline phosphatase cascade and the PI 3-kinase pathway are two of the signaling networks activated by insulin upon binding to its receptor. The activation of ERK by insulin seems to play a major role in insulin-mediated mitogenesis, whereas PI 3-kinase has been implicated as a key player of the metabolic arm. Defects in the insulin-stimulated metabolic cascade lead to insulin resistance. Therefore, to identify additional genes that negatively regulate insulin-stimulated metabolic pathway(s), we employed an expression cloning approach using the promoter of the PEPCK gene placed upstream of the secreted alkaline phosphatase gene as a surrogate reporter system for the metabolic effects of insulin as described previously (2Xu H.

Like many other genes, PEPCK, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is highly regulated by insulin at transcription level (3Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

In this study we showed that the expression of MKP-3 was markedly elevated in the livers from the insulin-resistant animal models. We further investigated the role of MKP-3 in the regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression in the absence or presence of insulin as well as hepatic glucose production. Cells and DNA Constructs—The rat hepatoma H4IIE and Fao cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. The PEPCKp600-SEAP (which includes the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase) was constructed as described previously (2Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D. Moriarty A. Tayber O. Chen H. Kapeller R. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30187-30192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The PEPCKp600-Luc was generated by subcloning the PEPCK promoter (–558 to +73) into the pGL3-basic vector at the MluI and BglII sites. To construct adenovirus expression vectors for MKP-3 and GFP, the two genes were first cloned into a shuttle vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV), then both genes and the CMV promoter were excised with I-ceuI and PI-sceI digestion and ligated into the Adeno-X expression vector as described in the user's manual (Clontech). The Adeno-X expression constructs were linearized with PacI digestion before being transfected into HEK293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for virus production. Crude cell lysates were obtained 2 weeks after the initial transfection and then used to infect a larger amount of HEK293 cells for further virus amplification and purification. Construction of cDNA Library—Epidydimal adipose tissues were dissected from 10 week-old male ob/ob mice, and total RNA was extracted. cDNAs were generated from total RNA by reverse transcription using oligo(dT) primer. The cDNAs were then cloned into the pMET7 expression vector (6Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sanker S.

The individual clones were sequenced from the 5′-end. The cDNA clones were plated into 96-well plates (1 clone/well), and duplicate plates were made to be used for the functional screening (125 ng DNA/clone/well). Functional Screening and PEPCK Reporter Gene Assays in H4IIE Cells—In the functional screening, individual clones in the ob/ob white adipose tissue cDNA library were cotransfected with the PEPCKp600-SEAP in H4IIE cells. Cells were seeded at 20,000 per well on 96-well plates a day prior to transfection. The next morning, 125 μg of the PEPCK reporter construct, PEPCKp600-SEAP (2Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D.

FuGENE 6 (0.38 μl/well) (Roche Applied Science) was added to the DNAs, and the entire mixture was transferred to the cells. The dominant negative 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase, DNp85, was cotransfected with PEPCKp600-SEAP into H4IIE cells and served as a positive control. Cells were serum-starved for 5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum at 16 h post-transfection followed by treatment with dexamethasone (1 μm), 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mm), and insulin (100 nm) for an additional 16 h. Medium was then collected and assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (2Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D. Moriarty A. Tayber O. Chen H. Kapeller R. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30187-30192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cDNA clones that resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase activity were tested again in the same assay, and the confirmed clones' identities were determined by DNA sequencing. To determine the effect of MKP-3 on the PEPCK gene transcription, H4IIE cells were seeded at 20,000 per well on a 96-well plate. Cells were cotransfected overnight with either an empty vector or the MKP-3 expression vector (100 ng) along with PEPCKp600-Luc (80 ng) and phRL-SV40 (an internal control; Promega) using FuGENE 6. Cells were then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 16 h and subsequently treated with various stimuli as indicated in TABLE ONE. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assay using Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega).TABLE ONEActivation of PEPCK gene transcription by MKP-2 (fold induction)TreatmentVectorMKP-3None1.00 ± 0.022.20 ± 0.86Dex4.4114 ± 1.0762.4 ± 11.14ap < 0.05 vector versus MKP-3 with the same treatment.cAMP1.33 ± 0.381.42 ± 0.50Dex + cAMP8.62 ± 4.75176.95 ± 29.17ap < 0.05 vector versus MKP-3 with the same treatment.Dex + InsbInsulin.0.90 ± 0.147.42 ± 0.53ap < 0.05 vector versus MKP-3 with the same treatment.cAMP + InsbInsulin.1.51 ± 0.032.32 ± 1.56Dex + cAMP + InsbInsulin.0.83 ± 0.195.84 ± 0.74ap < 0.05 vector versus MKP-3 with the same treatment.a p < 0.05 vector versus MKP-3 with the same treatment.b Insulin. Open table in a new tab RNA Extraction, Northern Blot, and TaqMan Analysis—RNA samples were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were denatured and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, RNAs were transferred to a Biotrans membrane (ICN Pharmaceuticals), UV light cross-linked, and baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Hybridization with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) labeled cDNA probes and subsequent washings were done as described previously (7Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (5969) Google Scholar). Photographs of ethidium bromide gels were presented for loading adjustment. The gene expression profiles of MKP-3, G6Pase, and PEPCK in Fao cells were measured using real time PCR (TaqMan analysis). Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan assay was performed in a 12.5-μl reaction containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 10 ng cDNA, 900 nm primers, 250 nm FAM-labeled probe for the target genes, and 1× of both the 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) primers and VIC-labeled 18 S rRNA TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems) in 384-well clear plates (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were 50 °C for 2 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min for 1 cycle and then 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated by comparing the target gene versus 18 S rRNA. The sequences for the primers and probe sets for mouse and rat MKP-3, rat G6Pase, and rat PEPCK were as follows: 5′-ACTGAGCAGCCCTTGTGACA-3′ (forward), 5′-TGGAGGGCGTGGTGAAGTAC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-6FAM-CCGTGTCCCCACTCCGCAGC-TAMRA-3′ (probe) for mouse MKP-3; 5′-CCTCCAACCAGAATGTCTACCAA-3′ (forward), 5′-ACACTCCCGGCTAGGAAAGG-3′ (reverse), and 5′-6FAM-TGGACTCCCTGCAATCTACGTGAA-TAMRA-3′ (probe) for rat MKP-3; 5′-CCCAGACTAGAGATCCTGACAGAAT-3′ (forward), 5′-GCACAACGCTCTTTTCTTTTACC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-6FAM-ACTGTGCAGAATCCTCCAGGCCGA-TAMRA-3′ (probe) for rat G6Pase; and 5′-CCGGGCACCTCAGTGAAG-3′ (forward), 5′-CGTTGGTGAAGATGGTGTTTTTC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-6FAM-AATCCGAACGCCATTAAGACCATCC-TAMRA-3′ (probe) for rat PEPCK. Western Blot Analysis—Livers were dissected from 9 week-old ob/ob mice and their lean controls that were either fasted overnight or fed ad libitum. For diet-induced obese mice, male C57B/L6 mice were fed with either a low fat (10% fat) or high fat diet (45% fat) for 4 months. Mice were fasted overnight, and livers were dissected. The isolated livers were homogenized in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline once and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Passive lysis buffer from Promega plus protease inhibitors). One hundred micrograms of liver extract or 60 μg of cell lysate from each sample was used for Western blot analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, following SDS-PAGE the resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies in the presence of 5% nonfat dry milk followed by incubation with anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-goat (Alpha Diagnostic International) horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody. Protein bands were detected by ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). MKP-3 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 1:200. Tubulin antibody was obtained from ABcam and used at 1:3000 dilution. The secondary antibodies, sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase and rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase were used at 1:5000. Glucose Output—Fao cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1.5 million/well in growth medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum). The next day, cells were transduced with either MKP-3 or GFP adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Twenty-four hours post-transduction, cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 and incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP for 5 h. Cells were then incubated in 0.35 ml (per well) of phenol red-free, glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm pyruvate and 20 mm lactate containing dexamethasone (1 μm) and 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mm) in the presence or absence of insulin (100 nm). Medium was collected 3 h later and subjected to glucose measurement using the Amplex® Red glucose/glucose oxidase assay kit (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed, and protein concentration was determined. The glucose output rate was normalized by cellular protein concentration and expressed as microgram of glucose per milligram of protein per 3 h. Identification of MKP-3 as a Candidate Gene for Insulin Resistance—To find negative modulators of insulin signaling, a cDNA library derived from the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice was cotransfected with a PEPCK promoter (–558 to +73 bp) construct into H4IIE cells (8Forest C.D.

The transcription of the PEPCK promoter has been well characterized in response to a number of hormones and stimuli. Dexamethasone (Dex) and 8-bromo-cAMP strongly stimulate PEPCK gene transcription. In contrast, insulin suppresses transcription of PEPCK (4Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 5O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using SEAP as a reporter, the rate of transcription is reflected by the activity of alkaline phosphatase in the conditioned media. The cDNA clones that resulted in high alkaline phosphatase activity in the presence of insulin were selected and further confirmed in the secondary assays. A dominant negative form of PI 3-kinase's regulatory subunit p85, DNp85, was used as a positive control (12Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, insulin strongly antagonized the activation of the PEPCK gene transcription induced by cAMP and Dex (lane 2 versus lane 1). DNp85, a negative modulator of the insulin signaling pathway, released insulin's suppression on the PEPCK transcription (lane 3 versus lane 2) as expected. Among the 10,000 clones screened in this system, MKP-3 and MKP-4 (2Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D. Moriarty A. Tayber O. Chen H. Kapeller R. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol.

The role of MKP-3 in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance is unknown and, therefore, is the focus of this study. Expression of MKP-3 Is Markedly Elevated in Insulin-resistant Mouse Livers—The expression of MKP-3 mRNA was examined previously in a small number of rat tissues and during mouse embryogenesis (13Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 14Klock A. Herrmann B.G. Mech.

The expression of this gene in adult human and mouse tissues has not been reported. Fig. 2 showed that MKP-3 mRNA was widely expressed in human with the highest expression in placenta, trachea, and spleen (Fig. 2A). In mouse, MKP-3 was detected in all the tissues examined (Fig. 2B). To understand the relevance of this phosphatase to obesity and insulin resistance, the expression of MKP-3 was investigated in insulin-responsive tissues, including white adipose tissue, liver, and muscle, from two genetic obese and insulin-resistant mouse models, ob/ob and db/db mice, and their lean, insulin-sensitive controls (Fig. 3). MKP-3 mRNA is markedly elevated in the livers from ob/ob and db/db mice compared with their controls (Fig. 3B). Its expression is also significantly increased in white adipose tissue from the same mice (Fig. 3A). In contrast, MKP-3 expression in muscle does not vary regardless of decreased insulin sensitivity in this tissue of ob/ob and db/db mice (Fig. 3C). To determine whether MKP-3 protein level is also elevated in the livers from insulin-resistant mice, Western blot analysis was performed using liver extracts from ob/ob mice and their lean controls. Coincident with its mRNA level, the protein level of MKP-3 is much higher in the ob/ob liver compared with that in the control mice in both fasted and fed states (Fig. 3, D and E). Interestingly, MKP-3 protein level is higher in the fasted state than in the fed state in the insulin-sensitive livers. However, this regulation is lost in the insulin-resistant ob/ob livers (Fig. 3, D and E). To further determine whether this dysregulation of MKP-3 occurs in diet-induced obese and insulin-resistant animals, hepatic MKP-3 protein level was measured in mice fed with either a low fat or a high fat diet for 4 months. In contrast to ob/ob mice, MKP-3 protein level in liver is not significantly elevated in the diet-induced obese mice (Fig. 3F). It is worth noting that although both diet-induced obese and ob/ob mice are insulin-resistant, only the later is hyperglycemic. These results suggest that MKP-3 may play a role in modulating the hepatic gluconeogenic pathway.FIGURE 3Regulation of MKP-3 expression in insulin-resistant mouse models. A–C, MKP-3 mRNA expression level in white adipose tissue (WAT)(A), liver (B), and skeletal muscle (C) from ob/ob, db/db mice (lanes 1 and 3) and the lean control mice fed ad libitum (lanes 2 and 4). 20 μg of each total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis.

Hepatic glucose production and output increase during fasting as an important mechanism for maintaining blood glucose within a normal range. In healthy individuals, gluconeogenesis is tightly regulated by glucagon and insulin in response to fasting and feeding. This regulation is disrupted in obesity because of decreased sensitivity to insulin in liver. Hepatic MKP-3 protein level is modulated by fasting and fed conditions, and the elevation of MKP-3 expression in ob/ob and db/db livers suggests that MKP-3 may be involved in this metabolic process. To investigate which gluconeogenic hormone(s) may increase the expression of MKP-3, Fao cells, an insulin sensitive rat hepatoma cell line, were treated with 8-bromo-cAMP and Dex for 6 h. MKP-3 mRNA level was measured by TaqMan analysis. MKP-3 mRNA was significantly elevated by Dex treatment but not by cAMP (Fig. 3F). It is known that glucocorticoid promotes gluconeogenesis and that its level is elevated in the state of obesity and insulin resistance (16Kraus-Friedmann N. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 170-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Barf T. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it is conceivable that the elevation of MKP-3 expression by glucocorticoid may partly account for the effect of this hormone in promoting gluconeogenesis. MKP-3 Activates the PEPCK Gene Transcription in Synergy with Glucocorticoid—PEPCK, the rate-limiting enzyme controlling the gluconeogenic pathway, can be transcriptionally activated by glucocorticoid and glucagons but suppressed by insulin. The control of PEPCK on hepatic glucose production is exclusively regulated at the transcription level. Given the fact that MKP-3 expression was up-regulated by Dex treatment, we hypothesize that MKP-3 may affect PEPCK gene transcription. To address this question, we used a PEPCK promoter-luciferase system to investigate the role of MKP-3 in activating the PEPCK gene transcription. H4IIE cells were transfected with the PEPCK promoter-luciferase plasmid PEPCKp600-Luc along with either the control vector or the MKP-3 expression vector. Cells were then treated with various stimuli as shown in TABLE ONE for 24 h and then harvested for luciferase measurement. Modulation of the PEPCK gene transcription was summarized in TABLE ONE. Overexpression of MKP-3 alone did not significantly increase PEPCK promoter activity. Treatment with Dex alone resulted in a 4.4-fold increase of PEPCK transcription. Dex treatment in combination with overexpression of MKP-3 led to a 62.4-fold induction on PEPCK transcription. This indicates that MKP-3 and Dex worked in synergy to strongly induce the PEPCK gene transcription. Treatment with cAMP alone did not significantly increase PEPCK transcription; however, cAMP and Dex had a synergistic effect in activating PEPCK transcription in both vector- and MKP-3-transfected cells (8.62 and 176.9-fold, respectively, by cAMP plus Dex treatment versus 4.4 and 62.4-fold by Dex treatment alone). Insulin completely suppressed PEPCK promoter activity to the basal level in vector-transfected H4IIE cells treated with Dex or Dex in combination with cAMP (0.9- and 0.83-fold of baseline, respectively), but not in MKP-3-transfected H4IIE cells under the same treatment, which has PEPCK transcription 7.42- and 5.84-fold of baseline, respectively. These results indicate that MKP-3 overexpression negatively impacted the effect of insulin on suppressing PEPCK transcription. These data, together with the fact that Dex induces MKP-3 expression, suggest that MKP-3 plays a role in mediating the effect of glucocorticoid on PEPCK gene transcription. Ectopic Expression of MKP-3 Increases Hepatic Glucose Production and Activates Gluconeogenic Gene Expression—Given the fact that MKP-3 in combination with Dex markedly induced the PEPCK gene transcription and that its expression was elevated in ob/ob and db/db livers, which have increased gluconeogenesis, we wondered whether the elevation of MKP-3 expression in obese livers contributed to enhanced hepatic glucose production. To address this question, we infected Fao cells with adenovirus expressing either MKP-3 or GFP, stimulated them with Dex and cAMP in the absence or presence of insulin, and measured glucose output. Fig. 4A shows that the cells infected with the MKP-3 adenovirus resulted in a significant increase of MKP-3 protein compared with the GFP-infected cells. This increased expression of the MKP-3 protein led to an increase of glucose output as shown in Fig. 4B. Under all conditions, MKP-3 infected cells had a higher glucose output rate compared with GFP-infected cells. In the absence of any treatment, the basal glucose output in MKP-3 infected cells was increased to 159% of the GFP-infected cells. Treatments with Dex and cAMP led to increased glucose output in both GFP- and MKP-3-infected cells; the latter was 237% of the former. In the presence of insulin, glucose production was suppressed in both GFP- and MKP-3-infected cells. However, in the MKP-3-infected cells the effect of insulin in suppressing glucose production was partially reduced, because the glucose production in the MKP-3 cells was ∼2-fold higher compared with the GFP cells. To investigate whether MKP-3 overexpression could increase glycogenolysis, which may contribute to elevated glucose production, glycogen content in Fao cells transduced with either adenoviral MKP-3 or GFP was measured before and after stimulation for measurement of gluconeogenesis. The glycogen content did not change in either cells (data not shown), suggesting that the rate of glycogenolysis was not altered by MKP-3 overexpression. Thus the effect of MKP-3 on glucose output is due to increased gluconeogenesis. To investigate whether MKP-3 expression could induce the expression of gluconeogenic genes, which may account for the elevation of glucose output, we examined the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase, two key genes controlling gluconeogenic pathway. Consistent with the role of MKP-3 on activation of the PEPCK promoter, overexpression of MKP-3 in Fao cells significantly increased the mRNA level of PEPCK (Fig. 4C) and G6Pase (Fig. 4D) in all conditions examined. These results, together with the increased glucose production, strongly suggest that MKP-3 plays a role in modulating the hepatic gluconeogenic program. Liver is a key target tissue of insulin action, which controls fasting blood glucose primarily by regulating the rate of gluconeogenesis. The rate of gluconeogenesis is controlled in a large part by changes in the transcription of the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, PEPCK (18Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar, 19O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A number of key hormones, such as glucagon, cAMP, and glucocorticoids, have been shown to activate the transcription of this enzyme. Insulin, on the other hand, suppresses PEPCK transcription. Under pathological conditions such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, the effect of insulin in suppressing PEPCK transcription is diminished, which leads to enhanced hepatic glucose output. Although several factors have been identified in mediating insulin suppression on PEPCK gene transcription, the signaling pathways and regulators involved in hepatic insulin resistance and elevated gluconeogenesis are not yet well understood (20Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E685-E692Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Functional screening was conducted in search for novel genes that antagonize insulin action on PEPCK transcription, and MKP-3 was identified as a candidate. MKP-3 belongs to the dual specificity phosphatase family with nine members identified to date (21Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These phosphatases have different tissue distributions and substrate specificity, suggesting they may have distinct functions. In this family, MKP-1 and MKP-4 have been shown to play a role in regulating adipocyte differentiation and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes (2Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MKP-3 has been shown to be involved in modulating growth and apoptosis. However, the role of MKP-3 in insulin sensitivity and metabolism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression and regulation of MKP-3 in liver under physiological conditions such as fasting and feeding as well as pathological conditions such as insulin resistance and diabetes. We found that MKP-3 expression was markedly elevated in livers from insulin-resistant and diabetic animals. The MKP-3 protein level was induced by fasting and suppressed by feeding in mouse livers. This regulation is impaired in livers from ob/ob mice. MKP-3 expression was also induced by Dex, a glucocorticoid that promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis. In addition, MKP-3 dramatically activated the PEPCK gene transcription in synergy with glucocorticoid. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MKP-3 in Fao hepatoma cells significantly elevated both basal and stimulated glucose output and increased the expression of G6Pase and PEPCK genes in these cells. It is interesting to note that MKP-3 inhibits insulin-mediated repression of the PEPCK promoter (Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE). MKP-3 is highly selective for inactivation of p42/44 MAPKs (24Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and complete blockage of ERK-mediated signaling with kinase inhibitors and dominant negative mutants has no effect on PEPCK gene expression (25Sutherland C.

Therefore, it is unlikely that MKP-3 blocks insulin-mediated repression on the PEPCK promoter by inactivating ERKs. In contrast to the MAPK pathway, the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway is required for repression of PEPCK transcription by insulin. To address the question whether MKP-3 antagonizes insulin regulation of the PI 3-kinase pathway, we investigated MKP-3 overexpression on the phosphorylations of several components in insulin signaling pathway upstream and downstream of PI 3-kinase, including tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, and insulin receptor substrate-2 and serine phosphorylation of AKT in Fao cells transduced with either GFP or MKP-3 adenovirus. We found that insulin regulation of PI 3-kinase pathway was not impaired in the MKP-3-overexpressing Fao cells at the level of and upstream of AKT. The evidence we provided in this study clearly demonstrates that MKP-3 plays a role in regulating the hepatic gluconeogenic program. MKP-3 strongly activated PEPCK transcription in synergy with Dex, a hormone that also induced MKP-3 expression. These data suggests that MKP-3 promotes gluconeogenesis by potentiating and/or mediating the effect of glucocorticoid signaling on hepatic glucose output. It is known that there is a glucocorticoid regulatory unit in the PEPCK promoter. It remains unknown whether activation of PEPCK transcription by MKP3 in synergy with Dex is mediated through the same glucocorticoid response unit or other regulatory element(s). This question will be addressed in future study via mutagenesis of PEPCK promoter. On the other hand, MKP-3 antagonized the effect of insulin on suppressing PEPCK transcription. Interestingly, the insulin-regulated PI 3-kinase pathway (i.e. AKT phosphorylation) was not impaired by MKP-3 overexpression. This suggests that other factors downstream of AKT or additional signaling pathway(s) might be involved. Our data, along with other studies (2Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D. Moriarty A. Tayber O.

Further studies are necessary to identify the substrates of MKP-3 in regulating these metabolic processes in liver and fat. We thank Dr. Yang-Sheng Tzeng for critical reading of the manuscript."

Reduced expression of Nurr1 increases the vulnerability of mesencephalic dopamine neurons to dopaminergic toxins. We evaluated the role of nitric oxide as a possible mechanism for this increased susceptibility. Increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and increased 3-nitrotyrosine were observed in striatum of Nurr1 heterozygous (Nurr1 +/-) mice as compared with wild-type. Increased cytochrome C activation and consecutive release of Smac/DIABLO were also observed in Nurr1 +/- mice. An induction of active Caspase-3 and p53, cleavage of poly-ADP (RNase) polymerase and reduced expression of bcl-2 were observed in Nurr1 +/- mice. Methamphetamine significantly increased these markers in Nurr1 +/- mice as compared with wild-type. The present data therefore suggest that nitric oxide plays a role as a modulating factor for the increased susceptibility, but not the potentiation, of the dopaminergic terminals in Nurr1 +/- mice. We also report that this increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression and increased nitration in Nurr1 +/- mice led to the activation of apoptotic cascade via the differential alterations in the DNA binding activity of transcription factors responsible for the propagation of growth arrest as well as apoptosis."

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy can detect mobile lipids in vivo. To examine the local effects of burn in skeletal muscle, we performed in vivo 1H NMR on mice 3 days after burn trauma; and ex vivo, high-resolution, magic angle spinning (1)H NMR on intact excised mouse muscle samples before and 1 and 3 days after burn. These samples were then analyzed for apoptotic nuclei using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. To confirm our NMR and cell biology results, we used transcriptome analysis to demonstrate that burn trauma alters the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that burn injury results in a localized intramyocellular lipid accumulation, which in turn is accompanied by burn-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, as seen by the up-regulation of apoptotic genes and down-regulation of genes that encode lipid oxidation and the peroxisomal proliferator activator receptor gamma coactivator PGC-1beta. Moreover, the increased levels of bisallylic methylene fatty acyl protons (2.8 ppm) and vinyl protons (5.4 ppm), in conjunction with the TUNEL assay results, further suggest that burn trauma results in apoptosis. Together, our results provide new insight into the local physiological changes that occur in skeletal muscle after severe burn trauma."

HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) protein and mRNA levels are both decreased in diabetic animals and can be rapidly restored with insulin treatment (6Ness G.C. Wiggins L. Zhao Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 193-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. Previous experiments in H4IIE cells (rat hepatoma) showed that the proximal reductase promoter could be activated by insulin (7Osborne A.R. Pollock V.V. Lagor W.R. Ness G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), at levels greater than or equal to those seen in live animals. Questions remain as to whether this mode of insulin activation mirrors the physiological regulation of the gene.

Although SREBP-1c appears to be insulin-responsive at the mRNA level, recent evidence suggests this factor is more closely tied to lipogenesis than cholesterol biosynthesis (14Shimano H. Horton J.D.

SREBP-2 is a potent activator of the HMG-CoA reductase gene, but insulin regulation of this protein has not been reported. There are several other important elements in the HMG-CoA reductase promoter. These include possible binding sites for Sp1 and NF-Y, as well as a functional cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) (10Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The CRE in particular was shown to be required for insulin activation of the HMGR promoter in rat hepatoma cells (7Osborne A.R. Pollock V.V. Lagor W.R. Ness G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because of the problems inherent in a cell culture model, especially for a gene that is sterol-sensitive, we decided to perform in vivo footprinting in rat liver. This approach allows for a complete unbiased survey of the HMGR promoter. Performing this technique in animals ensures that the footprint reflects physiological regulation of the gene, in the context of the many nutritional and hormonal stimuli that the liver receives. In vivo footprinting has been used successfully to map where transcription factors are bound to DNA in vivo (17Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 18Bossard P. McPherson C.E. Zaret K.S. Methods. 1997; 11: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro footprinting studies of the HMGR promoter were successful in identifying sterol-responsive elements (19Osborne T.F. Gil G. Brown M.S. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The only previous in vivo footprints of this promoter failed to detect changes in occupancy in response to insulin in HepG2 cells, although a 1.5-fold increase in mRNA was observed (20Lloyd D.B. Thompson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25812-25818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this report we show that diabetes alters the occupancy of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter in live animals. Animal Care and Treatment—Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 125–150 g (Harlan), were allowed free access to Harlan Teklad 22/5 rodent chow and water. Animals were kept on a reverse cycle lighting system and were sacrificed at 9:00–10:00 a.m., when HMG-CoA reductase expression is at its diurnal high. Animals were rendered diabetic by a single subcutaneous injection of streptozotocin (Sigma), 65 mg/kg. Diabetes was verified by the presence of urinary glucose using Clinistix from Bayer. Where indicated, animals were injected subcutaneously with 3.0 units/100 g of recombinant human insulin (Novolin 70/30, Novo Nordisk) 2 h prior to sacrifice. Nuclei Isolation—Nuclei were prepared as described previously (21Mano H. Mori R. Ozawa T. Takeyama K.I. Yoshizawa Y. Kojima R. Arao Y. Masushigo S. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1591-1594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by centrifugation through dense sucrose. Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclear run-on assays were carried out essentially as described previously (22Lopez D. Chambers C.M. Ness G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, nuclei from 2 g of liver were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS with 3 mm MgCl2. Next, 100 μl of 2× run-on buffer (160 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml heparin, 1% Sarkosyl, 0.7 m ammonium sulfate, 0.8 mm each of ATP, GTP, and UTP) and 250 μCi of [α-32P]CTP were added to each reaction. Samples were incubated at 37 °C to continue extension of RNA transcripts. Samples were then treated with 50 units of DNase I, 40 μg of proteinase K and lysed with the addition of 50 μl of 10% SDS and 25 μl of 0.2 m EDTA. After extraction and precipitation, equal counts of 32P-labeled RNA were added to each membrane at ∼5 × 106 dpm. These membranes were spotted previously with 5 μg of cDNA encoding HMG-CoA reductase, catalase, or the pBluescript vector. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 57 °C. The next day membranes were washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 1 min, then 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by 2× SSC containing 250 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Membranes were given a quick final rinse in 2× SSC and dried, followed by exposure to autoradiography film with an enhancing screen at –70 °C for 1–5 days. Sequencing—The rat HMG-CoA reductase promoter was obtained by PCR of rat liver genomic DNA, using primers to the sequence published previously (10Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PCR products were sequenced by Retrogen (San Diego). In Vivo Footprinting of Rat Liver—Rat liver (2.2g) was minced in 8 ml of ice-cold PBS. Liver pieces were homogenized 4–5 times on a drill press with a Teflon pestle in a glass vessel. A 5-ml portion of filtered homogenate was placed in a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube. Each filtered homogenate was treated with 5 μl of dimethyl sulfate for 2 min at room temperature. The DMS reaction was slowed by rapid dilution with 40 ml of ice-cold PBS. Tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of PBS and washed again. The pellet was then resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K). Samples were rocked gently at room temperature for 3 h to completely lyse nuclei. Genomic DNA isolation and piperidine treatment were performed as described previously (17Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Roughly 200–300 μg of DNA was obtained per sample. Ligation-mediated PCR—Ligation-mediated PCR was performed according to the original method (17Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The primers corresponding to the coding (top) strand of the HMGR promoter starting at –185 were as follows: primer 1, 5′-CAA TAG GAA GGC CGC GAT GC-3′; primer 2, 5′-ATG CTG GGA CCC GAC TAG CCA TTG-3′; and primer 3, 5′-ATG CTG GGA CCC GAC TAG CCA TTG GTT G-3′. The primers to reveal the template (bottom) strand starting at –58 were as follows: primer 1, 5′-CGG AAG GAA CTG CGC TTA CG-3′; primer 2, 5′-AAC CGG CCG CCA ATA AGG AAG GAT C-3′; and primer 3, 5′-CGG CCG CCA ATA AGG AAG GAT CGT CCG ATC-3′. The following annealing temperatures were used for both primer sets: 58, 63, and 68 °C. All primers were ordered PAGE-purified from Integrated DNA Technologies. Products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide wedge gel with 7.75 m urea. Each PCR used 6–9 μg of DNA. Nuclear Extract—Nuclei isolated from 2 g of rat liver were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 3 mm MgCl2 and were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.5–1.0 ml of high salt buffer (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). Nuclei were lysed by rotating slowly at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were then centrifuged at 15,700 × g for 15 min to pellet nuclear debris. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and stored at –70 °C until needed. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). EMSA—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (23Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Briefly, probes corresponding to the HMG-CoA reductase promoter footprinted regions were generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). The sequences are as follows: –59/–82, 5′-CAG CCT CCC GCC GAT TGG CTA GGG-3′ and 5′-CTG ACC CTA GCC AAT CGG CGG GAG GCT G-3′; –115/–85, 5′GCG ACC GTT CGT GAC GTA GGC CGT CAG GCT-3′ and 5′-AGC CTG ACG GCC TAC GTC ACG AAA CGG T-3′; –119/–142, 5-GGG TGC GAG CAG TGG GCG GTT GTT-3′ and 5′-CTG AAA CAA CCG CCC ACT GCT CGC ACC C-3′; and –129/–152, 5′-TTC TCC GCC CGG GTG CGA GCA GTG-3′ and 5′-CTG ACA CTG CTC GCA CCC GGG CGG AGA A-3′. One pmol of probe was labeled by the Klenow fill in reaction using 20 μCi of [γ-32P]dCTP, along with cold 0.125 mm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. Each probe (25 fmol) was incubated with 10 μg of rat liver nuclear extract in a binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at room temperature. One to two μg of the following antisera were added to the binding reactions: NF-Y (sc-7711x), NF-Y (sc-13045x), NF-1 (sc-870), CREB-1 (sc-187x), Sp1 (sc-59x), and Sp1 (sc-420x) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Binding reactions were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE. Chromatin Preparation from Rat Liver—Rat liver (2.2 g) was placed in a beaker containing 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. The liver was minced into small pieces and diluted with an equal volume of 2% formaldehyde in PBS followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature. Formaldehyde cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of 1.25 m glycine. Liver pieces were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. Samples were then homogenized in 12 ml of nuclei isolation buffer + Triton X-100 using a Teflon glass homogenizer in a drill press. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation through dense sucrose. Nuclei were resuspended in 1–2 ml of PBS containing 3 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min in 1.5-ml tubes. The nuclear pellet occupied an ∼50-μl volume and was white in color. Nuclei were then resuspended in 1 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Sonication was accomplished with a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics W375 sonicater with a microtip. Ten 10-s bursts at a power setting of 4, 40% duty cycle, were sufficient to shear chromatin to an average size of 200–600 bp. Shearing of chromatin was checked by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel. Chromatin concentrations were equalized to 0.3 mg/ml by A260 and stored at –70 °C until needed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described previously (24Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, chromatin suspensions were diluted 1:10 and pre-cleared with single-stranded DNA/protein A-agarose beads (Upstate). Each immunoprecipitation reaction received 15 μg of chromatin and 5 μg of the appropriate antibody: USF-2 (sc-862), CREB-1 (sc-187x), and phospho-CREB (sc7978r). All antibodies were polyclonal rabbit IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PCR was performed using the following primers (25Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar): HMG-CoA reductase promoter, left 5′-CAA TAG GAA GGC CGC GAT GC-3′ and right 5′-CGG AAG GAA CTG CGC TTA CG-3′ (58 °C); HMG-CoA reductase Exon 12, left 5′-GGC GGT CAG TGG TAA CTA TT-3′ and right 5′ GCA GAG CCC ACA AGA TTC TT-3′ (57 °C). Plasmid Construction—A PCR product from rat genomic DNA containing the HMG-CoA reductase promoter from –325 to +70 was cloned into the PGL3 basic vector (Promega) using standard molecular biology techniques. Briefly, the 5′ primer was designed to possess an overhang to introduce an MluI site by PCR, and the 3′ overhang added an XhoI site. The resulting PCR product was digested and cloned into the pGL3 basic backbone. Mutant HMGR promoter-luciferase plasmids were generated using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. Both mutants were verified by sequencing at the core sequencing facility at the Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL. pRL-TK, a vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter was from Promega. (Primer sequences are available upon request.) Cell Culture—H4IIE cells (rat hepatoma) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Eagle's modified essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin per ml, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Transient Transfections—H4IIE cells were plated to an initial density of 100,000 cells per well in 24-well plates the day before the experiment. The following day, the media were removed, and the cells were washed one time with PBS. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well using Transfast reagent (Promega) in the recommended 2:1 ratio. Cells were co-transfected with reporter construct and pRL-TK in a 4:1 ratio. One h after transfection, the 200 μl of transfection mix in each well was diluted with 800 μl of growth media. 12–16 h later, cells were harvested in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Data are shown as the average ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase counts ± S.D. At least six independent yet identical transfections were performed per condition. All plasmid concentrations were checked by A260 prior to transfection. Nuclear run-on assays were performed to determine whether insulin acts to increase transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. Inbred male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) to induce diabetes. Animals were sacrificed during the 3rd h of the dark cycle, at the diurnal high for hepatic HMG-CoA reductase expression. Nuclei were isolated from the livers of these animals, and nuclear run-on assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” HMG-CoA reductase transcription was greatly diminished in the diabetic animals (Fig. 1A). It was also found that administration of insulin to diabetic animals restored HMG-CoA reductase transcription to normal in just 2 h (Fig. 1B). We next carried out in vivo footprinting to examine the occupancy of the hepatic HMGR promoter. Livers from normal and diabetic animals were treated with dimethyl sulfate and subjected to footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR. A primer set designed to reveal the top strand begins by reading cytosines at –185. Another primer set reveals the bottom strand by reading guanines beginning at –58. It should be noted that these primers were designed against the rat HMGR promoter sequence, which varies slightly (about 10 bp) from the hamster (10Bifulco M. Perillo B. Saji M. Laezza C. Tedesco I. Kohn L.D. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15231-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our primers were designed against sequence from the inbred Sprague-Dawley rats used in our experiments. Minor differences from the published rat sequence included an extra G at –15 and a reversal of the CG at –3 and –4. Numbering is therefore –1 bp relative to the previously published sequence, based on the transcription start site (Fig. 2). On the top strand, several areas of DMS protection or enhancement were detected (Fig. 3). The Naked lane refers to DNA that was first extracted and purified and then treated with DMS in vitro. This lane is a control that shows all the reactive G residues in the sequence. Bands that are absent or reduced in intensity in the in vivo samples (Fig. 3, lanes N and D) represent protections where protein binding shields the DNA from dimethyl sulfate attack. Bands that are significantly darker in the in vivo samples, or new bands that appear in these lanes, are known as enhancements. Enhanced DMS reactivity is indicative of protein binding in the nearby area, although generally not on that particular residue. In Fig. 3, the protections are noted with a filled triangle, and enhancements are marked with an open triangle. In both normal and diabetic samples, the CRE was completely protected at –101 and showed enhanced DMS reactivity at –104, –99, and –95/–94 (Fig. 3, right). This pattern was seen in all animals regardless of treatment. A significant protection seen only in normal animals occurred at –71, as shown in Fig. 3, right. Protections at –137 and –147 were not consistently observed. On the bottom strand, the CRE is heavily protected at –100, –105, –103, and –109 (Fig. 4, bottom right) in both normal and diabetic animals. The A at –102 showed up as an enhancement in both cases. A key difference in the footprints is a very obvious enhancement at –142 seen only in the diabetic samples (Fig. 4, middle right). This particularly dark band, indicating enhanced DMS reactivity, was seen in 4/5 diabetic footprints and 0/5 normal footprints. Conversely, the nearby enhancement at –138 of the normal lane was not seen in diabetic footprints, suggesting possible competition for a binding site in this region. Another obvious difference is an enhancement at –161 in the diabetic lane (Fig. 4, top right). This residue is in the middle of the SRE located between –164 and –155. The SRE appears unoccupied under normal conditions and enhanced in diabetic samples (4/5 animals). Protections at –189/–190 were seen in all groups, whereas those at –70 were not observed in the diabetics. Both of these areas contain potential NF-Y-binding sites, with the sequence ATTGG. Because there was an enhancement at –161 of the SRE in four of the five diabetic animals, we wondered if insulin activation could be a result of sterol regulation through the SRE. To investigate this possibility, we examined livers of rats fed lovastatin or cholesterol to alter liver cholesterol levels. Animals were fed 0.02% lovastatin or 1% cholesterol for 5 days. Previous research in our lab has shown that a similar dose of lovastatin elevates HMGR transcription 4–6-fold (22Lopez D. Chambers C.M. Ness G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas dietary cholesterol reduces HMGR protein levels to about 1% of control. It should be noted that dietary cholesterol has only a minor repressive effect on the rate of HMGR transcription in these animals (26Chambers C.M. Ness G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We predicted that the lovastatin-fed animals would show strong protections at the SRE, because of elevated cleavage of SREBPs, induced by sterol deprivation. Curiously, no definitive protections or enhancements at the SRE were visible when animals were fed either lovastatin or cholesterol (Fig. 5, right). The footprints were the same for the two animals in each group. The CRE was also heavily protected in these animals but unchanged by either treatment. The enhancement at –138 seen in normal animals was also seen in both lovastatin and cholesterolfed rats. The enhancement at –142 seen in diabetics was noticeably absent from these animals. In addition, the NF-Y sites at –189/–190 and –70 are readily visible in this footprint and protected in both cases. A summary of the major differences between normal and diabetic footprints is presented in Fig. 6.FIGURE 6Summary of DMS reactivity. Many areas of DMS protection and enhancement were observed by in vivo footprinting. The most common and reproducible sites are noted. Protected bases are indicated by a solid triangle, and areas of enhanced DMS reactivity are denoted with an open triangle. The nucleotide position is given relative to the transcription start site. Five normal (N) and five diabetic (D) animals were footprinted. The number of times each protection or enhancement was observed is expressed as a fraction of the total animals in the group. In the sequence column, the sequence is given, showing the reactive residue that was detected. Possible factors that may bind are listed in the last column. Major differences are in A, and common elements are in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify some of the major factors bound to footprinted regions, we performed EMSAs with short oligonucleotide probes for these elements. Nuclear extracts prepared from normal and diabetic rats were used in this assay. By using the probe from –59 to –82, we observed strong binding that could be supershifted with two different NF-Y antisera but not with antisera to NF-1, an unrelated protein (Fig. 7A). This confirms the presence of another NF-Y-binding site in the HMGR promoter, in addition to the one previously described upstream of the SRE (9Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3380-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF-Y binding did not change in liver nuclear extracts, despite a marked difference in occupancy of this site in vivo (Fig. 6). A probe corresponding to the CRE was able to bind CREB-1 from normal and diabetic nuclear extracts (Fig. 7B). Overall binding to the CRE was not different between normal and diabetic extracts, as expected from the footprinting. Probes for the –119/–142 and –129/–152 regions showed strong binding of an unknown factor, whose in vitro binding ability was unaffected by diabetes (Fig. 7C). In an effort to identify the factor binding to the –119/–142 region, we performed additional EMSAs. Fig. 8 shows an experiment in which a probe to the –119/–142 region was incubated in a binding reaction with normal rat liver nuclear extract (Fig. 8, 2nd lane). An unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added in 10-fold molar excess relative to the hot probe in the remaining lanes. The sequence at the top of Fig. 8 is the wild type promoter sequence, with an arrow highlighting the point mutation in each lane. The upper band in Fig. 8 can be efficiently competed away with the wild type competitor (3rd lane), and most of the mutant oligonucleotides. Noteworthy exceptions are “C_AG” from –137 to –134 and the entire sequence “GGGCGGTT” between –129 and –122. The presence of two binding sites expla"

We previously demonstrated that the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex restrains cell proliferation mediated through protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1. We have now tested the hypothesis that thrombomodulin transduces a signal to activate the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3) and to modulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with thrombin or a mutant of thrombin that binds to thrombomodulin and has no catalytic activity on PAR-1. Thrombin and its mutant dose dependently activated NO release at cell surface. Pretreatment with anti-thrombomodulin antibody suppressed NO response to the mutant and to low thrombin concentration and reduced by half response to high concentration. Thrombin receptor-activating peptide that only activates PAR-1 and high thrombin concentration induced marked biphasic Ca2+ signals with rapid phosphorylation of PLCβ3 and NOS3 at both serine 1177 and threonine 495. The mutant thrombin evoked a Ca2+ spark and progressive phosphorylation of Src family kinases at tyrosine 416 and NOS3 only at threonine 495. It activated rapid phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent NO synthesis and phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and calmodulin kinase II. Complete epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition only partly reduced the activation of phospholipase Cγ1 and NOS3. Prestimulation of thrombomodulin did not affect NO release but reduced Ca2+ responses to thrombin and histamine, suggesting cross-talks between thrombomodulin and G protein-coupled receptors. This is the first demonstration of an outside-in signal mediated by the cell surface thrombomodulin receptor to activate NOS3 through tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway.

Thrombin mediates cellular events by signal transduction through protease-activated receptors (PARs) (6Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar). It activates PAR-1 by cleavage of its N terminus extremity, thereby unmasking the tethered ligand SFLLRN that flips over to activate the receptor. We have previously shown that the thrombin-TM complex restrains endothelial cell proliferation activated by the synthetic peptide SFLLRN, so-called thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) (7Lafay M. Laguna R. Le Bonniec B.F. Lasne D. Aiach M. Rendu F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The binding of thrombin to endothelial TM indeed decreased the DNA synthesis by prolonging the phosphorylation and the nuclear retention of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (8Olivot J.M. Estebanell E. Lafay M. Brohard B. Aiach M. Rendu F. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is dependent on nitric oxide (NO) generated by NO synthase (NOS) (9Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol.

Through ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NO mediates either proliferative or anti-proliferative responses (10Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol.

It was recently reported that a human recombinant TM containing the six EGF-like domains and the Ser/Thr-rich sequence induces angiogenesis through activation of the endothelial NOS (NOS3) and ERK1/2, as do growth factors (15Shi C.S. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.S. Han H.S. Kuo C.H. Liu C. Huang H.C. Chang Y.J. Chen P.S. Wu H.L. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1627-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that thrombin activates NOS3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (16Topal G. Brunet A. Millanvoye E. Boucher J.L. Rendu F. Devynck M.A. David-Dufilho M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether thrombin binding to endothelial membrane-bound TM induced signaling events to activate NOS3 and modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signals. Our tool was a mutant of thrombin that binds to TM but has no catalytic activity on PAR-1. We report that endothelial TM mediates Ca2+ spark and NO synthesis through the EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase and calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). Reagents and Antibodies—Primers, TRIzol®, and culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM) and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). TRAP was purchased from Bachem. The thrombin mutant S195A, which has no catalytic activity but binds to TM, was provided by Dr. B. Le Bonniec (INSERM Unit 428, Paris, France) (17Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human thrombin and the selective inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) (LY294002), EGFR kinase (AG1478), Src family kinases (PP2), protein kinase C (PKCα,β: Go6976 and PKCδ: rottlerin) and CaMKII (KN62) were from Calbiochem. The mouse monoclonal antibody against the EGF5–6 region of TM was from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphor-Thr495-eNOS, phospho-Tyr416-Src, phospholipase Cβ3 (PLCβ3), phospho-Ser537-PLCβ3, phospho-Tyr1068-EGFR, EGFR, and PLCγ1, the mouse monoclonal antibody against Src and the anti-rabbit IgG antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase were from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-Tyr783-PLCγ1 was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibodies against phospho-Ser1177-eNOS and eNOS were from BD Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Thr286-CaMKIIα and CaMKII and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—Endothelial cells were isolated from segments of human umbilical cord vein and cultured as previously described (18Lantoine F. Iouzalen L. Devynck M.A. Millanvoye-Van Brussel E. David-Dufilho M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At confluence, HUVECs were detached with trypsin/versene (Invitrogen), washed, and grown for 3–4 days. At subconfluence, cells were serum starved (0.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum) for 18 h. Cells were incubated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 (PBS-MgCa), except for Ca2+ measurements for which a specific reaction buffer was used (in mm: NaCl 136, KCl 5, Na2PO4 2, MgSO4 0.4, NaHCO3 4, CaCl2 1, glucose 8, glutamine 2, a mixture of amino acids, and HEPES 25, pH 7.4). RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs grown on 60-mm plastic dishes using the TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by incubation for 15 min at 42 °C with 2.5 units/μl murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PE Applied Biosystems) in 20 μl of PCR buffer II containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm of deoxy-NTP, 1 unit/μl ribonuclease inhibitor, and 2.5 mm random hexamers. PCR was performed by using 3 μl of cDNA and the following primers: eNOS sense primer, 5′-GAAGAGGAAGGAGTCCAGTAACACAGC-3′; eNOS antisense primer, 5′-GGACTTGCTGCTTTGCAGGTTTTC-3′ (438-bp product). The PCR reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 2 mm MgCl2, PCR buffer II, AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PE Applied Biosystems) at 25 milliunits/μl, and each primer at 0.2 μm. Amplification was performed in a programmable thermal controller (model PTC-100; MJ Research Inc.). Sample denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min was followed by 35 PCR cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C and a further incubation of 7 min at 72 °C after the last cycle. Each sample (5 μl) was electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels (4–20% Tris/boric acid/EDTA) and stained for 15 min with ethidium bromide (2.5 μg/ml) for densitometric analysis. Western Blot—Proteins of cell homogenates were resolved by SDS-PAGE as previously described (19Millanvoye-Van Brussel E. Topal G. Brunet A. Do Pham T. Deckert V. Rendu F. David-Dufilho M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary mouse- or rabbit-specific antibody (1:1000 dilution), rinsed, and further incubated at room temperature for 90 min with 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, respectively. Membranes were reprobed with antibodies against unphosphorylated proteins. Measurements of Nitric Oxide—The NO released at the surface of cells grown on 35-mm plastic culture dishes was measured by differential pulse amperometry at a porphyrinic NO-selective microsensor as previously described (20Lantoine F. Trévin S. Bédioui F. Devynck J. Electroanal. Chem. 1995; 392: 85-89Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The NO sensor was calibrated by the addition of NO standard solutions. Treatment of HUVECs with kinase inhibitors did not change the NO calibration curves. Results were expressed as the maximum of the agonist-induced oxidation current. Cytosolic [Ca2+] Measurement—HUVECs seeded onto glass coverslips were loaded with 2 μm fura-2AM as previously described (21Iouzalen L. Devynck M. David-Dufilho M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cell fluorescence intensities were recorded alternately at 340 and 380 nm with an emission wavelength of 505 nm using a spectrofluorimeter SPEX CMIII (ISA-Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France), and [Ca2+]i was calculated as previously detailed (21Iouzalen L. Devynck M. David-Dufilho M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n independent cultures. Multiple comparisons and time-dependent effects were examined by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Fisher's test. Comparison of time-dependent effects between two groups was assessed by two-way analysis of variance. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed by paired Student's t test. The amplitude of NO release at cell surface rose with increasing concentrations of both thrombin and the mutant thrombin S195A (Fig. 1, A and B). Thrombin activated NO synthesis with an EC50 of 0.2 (0.1–0.5) nm and S195A with an EC50 of 20 (7–70) nm. Noteworthy, the dose-response curve for thrombin was biphasic with a first plateau between 0.5 and 2 nm and a second one at 20 nm, suggesting that the two receptors TM and PAR-1 are involved in NOS3 activation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the dose-response curve for the mutant thrombin was characterized by only one plateau of saturation between 200 nm and 1 μm (Fig. 1B). Cell pretreatment with an anti-TM antibody totally suppressed the NO release induced by 200 nm S195A and 0.5 nm thrombin but decreased by only 50% that activated by saturating concentration of thrombin (Fig. 1C). The results demonstrate the stimulation of NO synthesis by thrombin binding to TM at concentrations below the nanomolar range and to PAR-1 at upper concentrations. To investigate the transduction pathway of TM and its role in the regulation of PAR-1 signaling, we used the maximal concentrations of 200 nm for S195A and 20 nm for thrombin. Because agonist-activated NO synthesis is dependent on Ca2+ (18Lantoine F. Iouzalen L. Devynck M.A. Millanvoye-Van Brussel E. David-Dufilho M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we first examined intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Both NO synthesis and Ca2+ signals activated by the mutant thrombin S195A, thrombin, or the PAR-1-activating peptide TRAP were maximal at 15–30 s and rapidly decreased thereafter (Fig. 2). The maximum NO production was 21 ± 2 nm after stimulation by S195A, 19 ± 2 nm after thrombin, and 17 ± 2 nm after 100 μm TRAP, a concentration that induced maximal Ca2+ signals in HUVECs (22Schaeffer P. Riera E. Dupuy E. Herbert J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ signals evoked by the three agonists were, however, of different amplitudes (Fig. 2B). After addition of S195A the peak value (57 ± 14 nm) was followed by a decrease back to initial value. After thrombin and TRAP, the peak was of much higher amplitude (254 ± 46 and 281 ± 49 nm, respectively) and followed by a plateau well above initial value (50 ± 11 and 61 ± 8 nm, respectively). Cell treatment with the anti-TM antibody had no effect on the Ca2+ response to 20 nm thrombin (250 ± 60 and 38 ± 14 nm for peak and plateau, respectively). This indicates that thrombin-induced Ca2+ signal is mainly caused by PAR-1 stimulation. Because PAR-1-mediated Ca2+ signal results from PLCβ activation (6Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the phosphorylation of an upstream (PLCβ) and a downstream (NOS3) Ca2+ signal-related enzyme. Thrombin induced a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Ser537-PLCβ3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the mutant thrombin S195A did not activate the PLCβ3. As shown by the dose-response curve for thrombin (Fig. 3B), Ser537-PLCβ3 phosphorylation was detectable with 2 nm but was significant only at 20 nm. This suggests that another PLC isoform is responsible for Ca2+-dependent activation of NOS3 by S195A and low thrombin concentrations. It has been reported that high thrombin concentration activates Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of Ser1177-NOS3 (23Thors B. Halldorsson H. Thorgeirsson G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present study, 20 nm thrombin induced a transient Ser1177-NOS3 phosphorylation with a maximum at 1 min followed by a return toward basal levels within 20 min (Fig. 4). The time courses obtained here for Ser1177-NOS3 phosphorylation and also for NO release (Fig. 2A), i.e. in serum-starved HUVECs, were similar to those we previously observed in cells cultured with 20% serum (16Topal G. Brunet A. Millanvoye E. Boucher J.L. Rendu F. Devynck M.A. David-Dufilho M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). During the first 5 min, the Ser1177-NOS3 phosphorylation activated by TRAP was similar to that induced by thrombin (Fig. 4). At 20 min, however, Ser1177-NOS3 remained phosphorylated in TRAP-treated cells. No phosphorylation of Ser1177-NOS3 occurred following S195A stimulation. The results suggest that the amplitude of TM-induced Ca2+ spark was too low to activate the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser1177 and demonstrate that this residue is not involved in TM-mediated NOS3 activation.FIGURE 4Phosphorylation of Ser1177-NOS3 by S195A, thrombin, or TRAP.

Reducing the serum level from 20 to 0.5% decreased the phosphorylation ratio of unstimulated cells from 0.74 ± 0.02 (Fig. 5A) to 0.03 ± 0.01 (p <0.001) (Fig. 5B). In the presence of serum, thrombin induced Thr495-NOS3 phosphorylation at 2 min (Fig. 5A), whereas in serum-starved cells, Thr495-NOS3 phosphorylation started at 1 min (Fig. 5). Under the latter conditions, all three agonists, i.e. thrombin, the mutant thrombin S195A, and TRAP, progressively increased Thr495-NOS3 phosphorylation up to a plateau reached at 5 min (Fig. 5C). From 1 to 20 min, the intensities of phosphorylation were, however, lower in S195A-stimulated HUVECs than in TRAP-activated cells (p <0.001) and intermediate in thrombin-stimulated ones (Fig. 5C). The results show that factors present in serum regulate Thr495-NOS3 phosphorylation and that TM mediates NOS3 phosphorylation at this residue. Both PKC and PI3K are involved in NOS3 activation by growth factors (24Zachary I. Gliki G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of these two kinases in NOS3 activation mediated by TM, we studied the effects of the PKCδ and PI3K inhibitors, rottlerin and LY 294002, respectively. The two inhibitors reduced TRAP-activated NO release, but they had opposite effects in thrombin- and S195A-stimulated cells (Fig. 6). Thrombin-activated NO release was not affected by LY 294002 but was markedly reduced by rottlerin. In contrast, S195A-induced NO synthesis was not altered by rottlerin but was abolished by LY 294002, indicating that TM-mediated NOS3 activation depended on PI3K. The activities of PI3K and Src family kinases are tightly linked in endothelial cells (25Stephens L.R. Anderson K.E. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42767-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed the participation of Src kinases in TM-induced NO synthesis. Although the Src inhibitor PP2 (100 nm) had no effect on S195A-activated NO release detected at 20–30 s (20 ± 4 versus 18 ± 3 nm in untreated cells, n = 5), Src was progressively phosphorylated at Tyr416 by S195A (Fig. 7). Phosphorylation of Tyr416-Src was maximal at 5 min and remained stable over 20 min. Following thrombin, a phosphorylation peak appeared at 1 min and was followed by a decrease back to a plateau of similar intensity as that evoked by S195A. As Src family kinases are upstream activators of ERK1/2 (26Bromann P.A. Korkaya H. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7957-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 27Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), we examined whether S195A activated this cascade. Thrombin rapidly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (281 ± 82% at 5 min, n = 4, p <0.05), whereas S195A did not (19 ± 28%, n = 5). The results demonstrate that TM signaling involves PI3K-dependent NOS3 activation and Src phosphorylation.FIGURE 7Phosphorylation of Tyr416-Src by S195A and thrombin.

Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and Src participates in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (26Bromann P.A. Korkaya H. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7957-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the EGFR kinase and its downstream effectors PLCγ and CaMKII contributed to the TM transduction pathway. As shown in Fig. 8A, significant phosphorylation of Tyr1068-EGFR, Tyr783-PLCγ1, and Thr286-CaMKIIα occurred in HUVECs stimulated for 30 s by the mutant thrombin S195A. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 reduced EGFR and PLCγ1 phosphorylation but had no effect on Thr286-CaMKIIα autophosphorylation (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, the S195A-activated NO release was inhibited by AG1478 and by KN62, a CaMKII inhibitor (Fig. 8B). The results demonstrate that TM induces NOS3 activation through the EGFR kinase and the CaMKII. As shown above, thrombin activates NO synthesis through both TM and PAR-1. We previously demonstrated that TM negatively modulates PAR-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 cascade (8Olivot J.M. Estebanell E. Lafay M. Brohard B. Aiach M. Rendu F. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the GPCR activators thrombin and histamine inhibit the EGF-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt cascade (28Thors B. Halldorsson H. Clarke G.D. Thorgeirsson G. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 168: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine whether a cross-talk between TM and GPCR exists, we measured NO and Ca2+ responses to thrombin or to histamine after a previous stimulation with the mutant thrombin S195A, thrombin, or TRAP. When cells were prestimulated by S195A, the NO response to thrombin or histamine was not altered (Fig. 9A), indicating that TM signaling does not modulate NOS3 activation by GPCR activators. When cells were prestimulated by thrombin or the PAR-1 agonist TRAP, thrombin-activated NO synthesis was reduced (Fig. 9A, left panel) but that induced by histamine was not (right panel), indicating that PAR-1 signal down-regulates TM-mediated NOS3 activation. Concerning Ca2+ signals, the thrombin-induced Ca2+ peak was reduced following prestimulation by thrombin but not following prestimulation by S195A or TRAP (Fig. 9B, left panel). Interestingly, both Ca2+ peak and plateau evoked by histamine were decreased irrespective of the agonist used to engage TM, i.e. thrombin or S195A (right panel). The results demonstrate that TM mediates a signal able to modulate GPCR-induced Ca2+ signal. Angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial or platelet-derived growth factors, but not EGF, have been shown to increase NOS3 expression (29Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 30Li H. Wallerath T. Forstermann U. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 7: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether TM activated NOS3 transcription. As demonstrated by RT-PCR, the expression of NOS3 mRNA remained unchanged by treatment for 4–18 h with thrombin or S195A (not shown). Similarly, the protein levels did not significantly vary in HUVECS treated for 18 h with thrombin or S195A (116 ± 19 or 124 ± 22% of control, respectively), suggesting that TM-mediated EGFR signaling does not modulate NOS3 expression. We previously demonstrated that the high affinity thrombin-thrombomodulin complex restrains PAR-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 cascade (8Olivot J.M. Estebanell E. Lafay M. Brohard B. Aiach M. Rendu F. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have now shown that thrombin binding to the membrane-bound TM activated NO synthesis through the EGFR kinase and the CaMKII in human endothelial cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the endothelial TM mediates an outside-in signal to activate NOS3 and modulate GPCR-induced Ca2+ signaling. Through its exosite I, thrombin binds to EGF-like domains 5 and 6 of its high affinity receptor TM (3Ye J. Liu L.W. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to its low affinity receptor PAR-1 to activate its proteolysis (6Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar). We observed a biphasic dose-response curve of NO release with detectable NO synthesis from 0.1 nm thrombin. The high affinity receptor responsible for NOS3 activation was saturated with 0.5 nm thrombin, totally inactivated by the anti-TM antibody, and independent of PLCβ. Phosphorylation of PLCβ was detectable from 2 nm thrombin. The low affinity receptor involved in NOS3 activation was saturated with 20 nm thrombin and insensitive to anti-TM antibody. Its signaling is associated with PLCβ activation and a Ca2+ signal similar to that induced by PAR-1 agonist peptide. In HUVECs, increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis have been readily detected at 0.1 nm thrombin (31Ludeman M.J. Kataoka H. Srinivasan Y. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 28"
