https://openalex.org/W2008152503,"The life-threatening complications of sepsis in humans are elicited by infection with Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria. Recently, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major biologically active agent of Gram-negative bacteria, was shown to mediate cellular activation by a member of the human Toll-like receptor family, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. Here we investigate the mechanism of cellular activation by soluble peptidoglycan (sPGN) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), main stimulatory components of Gram-positive bacteria. Like LPS, sPGN and LTA bind to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein CD14 and induce activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in host cells like macrophages. We show that whole Gram-positive bacteria, sPGN and LTA induce the activation of NF-κB in HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 but not in cells expressing TLR1 or TLR4. The sPGN- and LTA-induced NF-κB activation was not inhibited by polymyxin B, an antibiotic that binds and neutralizes LPS. Coexpression together with membrane CD14 enhances sPGN signal transmission through TLR2. In contrast to LPS signaling, activation of TLR2 by sPGN and LTA does not require serum. These findings identify TLR2 as a signal transducer for sPGN and LTA in addition to LPS.

Infection with bacteria may cause sepsis and lead to septic shock, characterized by refractory hypotension and eventually multiorgan failure and death (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev.

Its causative agents are cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria, like peptidoglycan (PGN) 1The abbreviations used are: PGN, peptidoglycan; sPGN, soluble PGN; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; LBP, LPS-binding protein; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). PGN, which predominates the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, is an alternating β (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 4Dziarski R. J. Biol.

LTA is anchored in the membrane by glycolipids found in many Gram-positive bacteria (7Fischer W. Markwitz S. Labischinski H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, isolated PGN and LTA can elicit most of the clinical manifestation of bacterial infection. These bacterial agents stimulate the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and IL-6, and other inflammatory mediators from immune cells, including macrophages, which ultimately cause clinical symptoms (8Gupta D.

Commun. 1997; 233: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The initial event in LPS recognition is its complexation with LPS-binding protein (LBP) in the plasma. This LPS·LBP complex subsequently binds to CD14, which triggers cell activation (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 11Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Because anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies and LPS antagonists were found to inhibit activation of CD14 positive monocytes by PGN and LPS, CD14 was proposed to be the receptor for both PGN and LPS (8Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been demonstrated that the binding of PGN (12Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol.

Because CD14 is present either as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane receptor lacking an intracellular signaling domain or in soluble form in serum (14Bazil V. Baudys M. Hilgert I. Stefanova I. Low M.G. Zbrozek J. Horejsi V. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a transmembrane co-receptor has been postulated in LPS responsive cells, which transduces the LPS signal into the cytoplasm (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Recently, two candidate signal transducing receptors have been identified which are members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, TLR2 and TLR4 (15Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres M.T. Rothe M. J.

Data base searches have identified a family of human Toll homologues, termed Toll-like receptors (22Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C. Nguyen V. Nguyen O. Massa H.F. Eby M. Jasmin A. Trask B.J. Hood L.

A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of TLRs resembles that of the mammalian IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), thereby defining the Toll/IL-1R receptor family. Consistent with this,Drosophila Toll signaling is similar to mammalian IL-1R signaling (26Meister M. Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Several members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family have been shown to activate NF-κB (15Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres M.T.

Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of TLR4 (also termed human Toll) has been shown to induce the activation of NF-κB in mammalian cells, leading to induction of NF-κB-dependent genes including those encoding inflammatory cytokines and the T cell costimulatory protein B7.1 (24Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar). Although the extracellular domains of the IL-1 receptors identify them as members of the IgG superfamily, the extracellular domains of human Toll-like receptors andDrosophila Toll lack IgG domains and share characteristic repeated leucine-rich motives (25Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Because Drosophila Toll participates in innate immune responses in flies, previous studies examined whether members of this family are involved in these responses in mammalian systems. These studies implicated TLR family members TLR2 and TLR4 as mediators of responses to LPS (15Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres M.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 16Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.

Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that PGN and LTA from Gram-positive bacteria can activate cells in a TLR2-dependent manner. A subclone of the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line has been maintained at Tularik, Inc., since 1993 as described (28Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Tissue culture experiments were performed in the presence of 10% certified fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) unless stated otherwise. The serum was not heat-inactivated and contained endotoxin at <10 enzyme units/ml as specified by the manufacturer. Purified preparations of soluble PGN (sPGN) from Staphylococcus aureus Rb were used to stimulate cultured cells (4Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4719-4725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sPGN was isolated by vancomycin affinity chromatography and the purity of sPGN was established by quantitative chemical analysis, silver stain analysis after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluoroautoradiography of sPGN biosynthetically labeled with [14C]alanine. The purity of the sPGN was estimated at ≥98.5%. The average molecular mass was 125,000 Da (4Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4719-4725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Dziarski R. Gupta D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2100-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGN from Streptococcus pyogenes Group A was purchased from Lee Chemicals Inc. (Grayson, GA). LTA preparations fromBacillus subtilis, ATCC 6051, S. pyogenes, strain IID 698, and Streptococcus sanguis, Type I, ATCC10556 were purchased from Sigma. All LTAs applied were prepared using a phenolic extraction procedure (31Fischer W. Koch H.U. Haas R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and tested for LPS contamination by incubation with polymyxin B sulfate (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co., La Jolla, CA). All different PGN and LTA preparations behaved similarly in cell activation experiments. For control stimulation, LPS fromEscherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 prepared by phenol extraction (Sigma) was used. Gram-positive bacteria of the speciesS. aureus ATCC 29213 and B. subtilis pY79 (prototroph SPβs) (kindly provided by Dr. Simon Lynch, Tularik Inc.) were plated on Penassay broth agar culture plates, transferred to Luria broth, and cultured by shaking at 37 °C overnight. Bacteria were pelleted and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of 15-fold concentrated bacterial suspensions were frozen at −80 °C. The cell titer of bacterial suspensions was 6 × 1010 cells/ml for S. aureus and 9 × 109 cells/ml for B. subtilis. Expression plasmids for CD14, TLRs, and the TLR truncation mutant were generated as described earlier (15Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres M.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (3 × 105) were plated in 3.5-cm dishes and transfected on the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) with the indicated amounts of expression vectors, 0.1 μg of ELAM-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (33Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 μg of RSV β-galactosidase plasmid for normalization. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using protocols and reagents from Promega Co. (Madison, WI). Luciferase activities were calculated as fold induction compared with unstimulated vector control. All bar diagrams are shown as the means ± S.E. for one representative experiment in which each transfection was performed in duplicate. Each experiment was repeated at least twice in all cases. LPS, a component of the outer membrane of the envelope of Gram-negative bacteria, is capable of eliciting immune stimulatory effects similar to whole bacteria in the host organism. Activation of NF-κB by LPS in mammalian HEK293 was shown to depend on the expression of TLR2. This finding prompted us to investigate whether Gram-positive bacteria and their immunologically active components PGN and LTA utilize members of the TLR family to signal cellular activation. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB-dependent E-selectin promoter luciferase reporter gene. NF-κB-driven reporter gene activation was observed in cells stimulated with whole Gram-positive bacteria of the species S. aureus and B. subtilis in cells expressing TLR2 but not in cells expressing TLR1 or TLR4 (Fig.1). To investigate whether PGN and LTA were responsible for NF-κB activation induced by whole Gram-positive bacteria, purified sPGN and LTA were used for subsequent experiments. As previously observed for LPS, no significant induction of reporter gene activity was detected after stimulation with sPGN or LTA in cells transfected with control vector alone (Fig.2). In addition, expression of CD14 did not mediate responsiveness to sPGN and LTA in the absence of TLRs (Fig.2). Transient overexpression of TLR4 constitutively activated the reporter gene, and no significant increase in activity was observed upon stimulation with sPGN or LTA (Fig. 2). Overexpression of TLR1 and TLR2 caused only marginal reporter gene activation, which was strongly induced by stimulation with sPGN or LTA only in cells expressing TLR2 but not TLR1 (Fig. 2). Again, this is similar to results obtained for LPS stimulation (15Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres M.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Cells expressing a TLR2 mutant lacking the intracellular domain (TLR2 1–720) did not respond to sPGN or LTA (Fig. 2). Thus, the intracellular domain of TLR2 is essential for signal transduction.Figure 2Effect of mCD14 and TLRs on PGN- and LTA-induced NF-κB activation. Luciferase activities were determined in 3 × 105 HEK293 cells plated in 3.5-cm dishes and transfected with the indicated expression plasmids (0.2 μg) together with ELAM-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (0.1 μg) and 1 μg of RSV β-galactosidase plasmid 24 h after transfection. Cells were either left untreated (open bars) or stimulated with PGN (10 μg/ml; closed bars) or LTA (10 μg/ml; hatched bars) for 6 h before harvest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) sPGN and LTA induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation in TLR2-expressing cells occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). Coexpression of CD14 with TLR2 led to a slight increase in reporter gene activation upon sPGN stimulation. The effect was more pronounced at lower sPGN concentrations (Fig.3 B). Coexpression of CD14 had no significant effect on LTA stimulation (Fig. 3 C). Cellular activation by PGN is CD14-dependent like activation by LPS, whereas LTA induction might be CD14-independent. On the other hand, dependence of cell activation by PGN and LTA on CD14 has been shown for hematopoietic cells on the basis of genetic evidence and CD14 blocking experiments (8Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Cleveland M.G. Gorham J.D. Murphy T.L. Tuomanen E. Murphy K.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hattor Y. Kasai K. Akimoto K. Thiemermann C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells might lack a component of a receptor complex required for full CD14 function. Alternatively the model system in HEK293 cells may resemble a receptor complex for detection of microbial components by cells of nonhematopoietic origin. Although the molecular basis for responsiveness to microbial agents may be similar in both cell types (34Tominaga K. Kirikae T. Nakano M. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), differences in recruitment of CD14 and other components may exist for specific stimuli. It has been demonstrated that LPS signaling is dependent on serum as a source for LBP and/or soluble CD14 (sCD14). Consistent with this, LPS signaling via TLR2 in HEK293 cells is serum-dependent (15Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres M.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar,19Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, removal of serum before stimulation with sPGN or LTA did not inhibit reporter gene activation (Fig. 4, B and C). Under serum-free conditions sPGN and LTA stimulation were even markedly increased compared with serum-containing conditions (Fig. 4,B and C). Serum components might compete for sPGN and LTA binding with cellular receptors and thereby neutralize immunostimulatory activity. In Drosophila, genes encoding antimicrobial peptides are activated by Toll upon fungal infection (21Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar), whereas the Toll homologue 18-wheeler regulates antimicrobial peptide synthesis in response to bacterial infection (35Williams M.J. Rodriguez A. Kimbrell D.A. Eldon E.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6120-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of mammalian signal transducers with similar function was reported (1Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The present study suggests the involvement of TLR2 in the activation of NF-κB by Gram-positive bacteria based on overexpression of TLRs in mammalian HEK293 cells. Our results indicate that TLR2 may not be exclusively a pattern recognition receptor for LPS from Gram-negative bacteria as proposed by others (19Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) but may also act as a receptor for PGN and LTA from Gram-positive bacteria. This does not exclude differential composition of a receptor complex upon stimulation with different microbial components. Genetic evidence from two different mouse strains, LPS hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice, has recently implicated TLR4 (human Toll) to be crucial for immune responses toward Gram-negative infection (16Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar, 17Qureshi S.T. Larivitre L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Interestingly, differences in the cellular response to LPS and components of Gram-positive bacteria were reported for one of these mouse strains. C3H/HeJ mice harbor a single inactivating point mutation of TLR4, which results in hyporesponsiveness to LPS. However, C3H/HeJ mice respond normally to stimulation with preparations from Gram-positive group B streptococci type III as evaluated by NF-κB activation and tumor necrosis factor release (36Medvedev A.E. Flo T. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. Teti G. Vogel S.N. Espevik T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4535-4542PubMed Google Scholar). Thus TLR4 may not be involved in the cellular responses to Gram-positive bacteria. On the other hand, C57BL/10ScCr mice, which lack TLR4 expression, are impaired in interferon-γ release upon stimulation with a variety of microbial agents, whereas C3H/HeJ mice are not (37Freudenberg M.A. Kumazawa Y. Meding S. Langhorne J. Galanos C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced responsiveness to bacterial dextran B512 in C57BL/10ScCr mice may be due to an additional genetic defect as indicated earlier (38Fernandez C. Moller G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1983; 18: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Therefore the contribution of individual members of the TLR family to signaling by bacterial or other microbial stimuli in vivo remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the implication of TLR2 in detection and signal transduction of PGN and LTA by host cells provides further insight into the mechanisms of innate immune response to Gram-positive infection.

The stoichiometric matrix was used to determine the systems characteristics of the metabolic genotype and to assess the metabolic capabilities of H. influenzae. The need to balance cofactor and biosynthetic precursor production during growth on mixed substrates led to the definition of six different optimal metabolic phenotypes arising from the same metabolic genotype, each with different constraining features. The effects of variations in the metabolic genotype were also studied, and it was shown that theH. influenzae Rd metabolic genotype contains redundant functions under defined conditions. We thus show that the synthesis ofin silico metabolic genotypes from annotated genome sequences is possible and that systems analysis methods are available that can be used to analyze and interpret phenotypic behavior of such genotypes.

With the growing availability of defined genotypes, the question arises of whether the genotype-phenotype relation can be studied based on the genomic data. The experience with an increasing number of experimental systems shows that the relation between the genotype of an organism and its overall function is not simple (11Strothman R.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Genomics provides detailed information regarding the composition of an organism's genome, but it does not provide knowledge on the dynamic and systemic characteristics that define the physiological function of a living system. Physiological processes are the result of multiple gene products working in a coordinated fashion, leading to the integrated functions of the system. Thus, the complex relation between the genotype and the phenotype cannot be predicted by cataloging and assigning functions to the genes found in a genome (11Strothman R.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the genome sequence per se does not provide direct information about physiology, the definition of complete genotypes opens the possibility of systematically studying the genotype-phenotype relation using novel experimental and computational techniques. These novel approaches include methods to identify regulatory motifs and coregulated genes (12Fondrat C. Kalogeropoulos A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar, 13DeRisi J.L.

Using the in silico metabolic genotype, we examined the systems characteristics of the metabolic network, studied the optimal phenotypic behavior, and examined the effects of in silicogene deletions on the ability of the metabolic network to support the growth of the cell. The metabolic genotype for H. influenzae was generated using its annotated genome sequence (27Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J. Tomb J.F.

Palsson, submitted for publication. is a method for assessing the capabilities and systemic properties of a metabolic genotype. The fundamentals of FBA have recently been reviewed (32Varma A. Palsson B.O. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 994-998Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 35Bonarius H.P.J. Schmid G. Tramper J. Trends Bio/Technol. 1997; 15: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 36Edwards J.S. Ramakrishna R. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Lee S.Y. Papoutsakis E.T. Metabolic Engineering. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Google Scholar). The following matrix equation describes the steady-state mass balances of the metabolic network and is central to FBA. S·v=b(Eq. 1) where S is the stoichiometric matrix (m × n), v is the vector ofn metabolic fluxes, and b is the vector representing m transport fluxes (i.e. known consumption rates, by-product production rates, and uptake rates). The stoichiometric matrix is derived directly from the defined metabolic genotype (Table I) (m = 343 and n = 488 for H. influenzae). The stoichiometric matrix, S, is underdetermined (n > m), and thus Equation 1 does not have a unique solution. Mathematically, this non-uniqueness is reflected in the null-space for S. All metabolic flux solutions reside in the solution set, which is the null-space translated by a single vector (37Strang G. Linear Algebra and Its Applications. 3rd Ed. Saunders College Publishing, Fort Worth, TX1988Google Scholar). The solution set contains all metabolic flux distributions that satisfy the mass balance constraints (defined by Equation 1). In addition to the mass balance constraints, there are physicochemical constraints on the metabolic fluxes that are defined by linear inequalities (αi ≤ v i ≤ βi). The physicochemical constraints are used to define maximum and minimum flux values. In this analysis αi was set to zero for irreversible fluxes, and in all other cases αi and βi were unconstrained. The intersection of the solution set (mass balance constraints) and the region defined by the linear inequalities (physicochemical constraints) defines the feasible set. The feasible set represents the capabilities of the metabolic genotype, each particular solution must be contained within the feasible set, and the particular solution represents the metabolic phenotype (32Varma A. Palsson B.O. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 994-998Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar,38Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Bio/Technol. Bioeng. 1998; 58: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The genotype properties of interest can be studied by examining the feasible set of the metabolic system. Such an assessment is formulated as a linear programming problem (32Varma A. Palsson B.O. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 994-998Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 35Bonarius H.P.J. Schmid G. Tramper J. Trends Bio/Technol. 1997; 15: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Maximize Z(Eq. 2) whereZ=∑civi=〈c·v〉(Eq. 3) where Z is the objective function, representing a phenotypic property, and c is a vector of weights. LINDO was used to solve the linear programming problems (LINDO Systems, Inc., Chicago). The objective, Z, is maximized subject to the mass balance and physicochemical constraints. The objective functions utilized in this analysis are the maximization of biomass production, ∑allmdm·Xm→vgrowthbiomass(Eq. 4) in which the elements d m are derived from the biomass composition of each metabolite (X m), and the maximization of the production of the charged form of the metabolic cofactors. The biomass composition for Escherichia coli is used in the computations (39Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1990Google Scholar, 40Neidhardt F.C. Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella : Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

It has been shown that the FBA results are not sensitive to biomass composition (42Varma A. Palsson B.O. Bio/Technol. Bioeng. 1995; 45: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and therefore this should not have a significant effect on the results. However, given the flexibility of the approach described herein, thed vector can be adjusted to account for any differences. The phenotype phase diagram was generated using the sensitivity analysis of the linear programming package LINDO. The sensitivity analysis defines the amount by which a given component of the b vector can change without changing the basis solution, and the results were used to construct the demarcations on the phenotype phase diagram. Mathematically, there is a different set of non-zero fluxes in each of the different regions of the phenotype phase diagram, and each set corresponds to a different optimal utilization of the metabolic pathways and a qualitative change in the flux map. The shadow prices, or the dual variables, in a linear programming problem arise from the solution of the dual problem (43Chvatal V. Linear Programming. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1983Google Scholar). These variables are used to interpret the metabolic state of the cell. The shadow prices are interpreted as the intrinsic value of a given metabolite to the cell (44Varma A. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 1993; 165: 477-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The shadow prices also undergo discontinuous changes at the demarcation lines. The systems characteristics of the H. influenzaemetabolic genotype can be studied based on the properties of its stoichiometric matrix. Here we present a study of its 1) connectivity properties, 2) ability to produce charged forms of metabolic cofactors, 3) optimal use of its metabolism to meet the growth requirements, and 4) sensitivity to the loss of gene product function in central intermediary metabolism. The number of metabolic reactions in which each of the 343 metabolites in theH. influenzae in silico metabolic genotype is involved varies across several orders of magnitude (Fig.1). The metabolites can be rank-ordered by the number of reactions in which they participate. H. influenzae metabolism revolves around relatively few highly connected metabolites. The metabolites involved in the largest number of metabolic reactions are ATP, ADP, inorganic phosphate, and pyrophosphate. Even though H. influenzae does not possess the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme to synthesize α-ketoglutarate, α-ketoglutarate is a highly connected metabolite and participates in 17 reactions. Glutamate and glutamine also participate in a relatively large number of metabolic reactions, 31 and 10, respectively. The degree of interconnectivity illustrates how metabolism must be coordinated around a few key metabolites that represent phosphate (energy), carbon, nitrogen, and redox metabolism (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is likely that metabolic regulation will revolve around the careful control of these metabolites. As the above described connectivity characteristics show, the metabolic cofactors play an important role in the function and coordination of cellular metabolism in H. influenzae. Thus, we can expect that an important metric in the comparison of different metabolic genotypes is the ability of the metabolic genotypes to produce charged forms of the cofactors, ATP, NADH, and NADPH, on various carbon substrates. The capabilities of a metabolic genotype to produce these cofactors can be determined by optimizing (using proper weights as shown in Equation 3) their production on a given substrate (45Varma A. Boesch B.W. Palsson B.O. Bio/Technol. Bioeng. 1993; 42: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Theb vector was defined to allow only the single carbon source to enter the metabolic system. Cofactor production capabilities were determined in this way, and the results are summarized in TableII.Table IIOptimal cofactor production in two genomically defined metabolic genotypesCofactorE. coliH. influenzae FructoseGlucoseFructosemol/molmol/molATP20.520.59.3NADH12.011.68.0NADPH11.410.88.0 Open table in a new tab The optimal production of ATP by H. influenzae from fructose (the only carbohydrate for which a PTS transporter was identified in the DNA sequence (27Fleischmann R.D.

Approximately half of this ATP production is the result of substrate level phosphorylation, whereas the other half is produced by oxidative phosphorylation. The maximal production of both NADH and NADPH is 8.0 mol/mol. This cofactor production ability of the H. influenzaemetabolic genotype compares with 20.5 mol/mol maximal ATP production inE. coli, 1The abbreviations used are: FBA, flux-balance analysis; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway. and a maximal production of NADH 11.6 and 12.0, respectively, with fructose and glucose as the energy sources. The maximal production of NADPH is 10.8 and 11.4 mol/mol, respectively, with fructose and glucose as the energy sources. These comparisons show that the reduced metabolic genotype of H. influenzae has a decreased ability to generate charged forms of the metabolic cofactors from the same substrate. The metabolic flux distributions for optimal growth were determined in silico for H. influenzae Rd in defined media. The medium components required for the growth demands of the in silico H. influenzae Rd strain are shown in the legend to Fig.2.

H. influenzae in silico requires multiple substrates for its growth, with fructose and glutamate being the two key substrates. Theb vector describing the uptake of the metabolites is described in the legend of Fig. 2. The optimal use of the metabolic pathways for the growth of H. influenzae on the defined media was determined using established methods (32Varma A. Palsson B.O.

To test this, we measured FFA and glycerol released from adipocytes obtained from normal lean Zucker diabetic fatty rats (+/+) and incubated for 0, 3, 6, or 24 h in either 20 ng/ml recombinant leptin or 100 nm norepinephrine (NE). Whereas NE increased both FFA and glycerol release from adipocytes of +/+ rats, leptin increased glycerol release in +/+ adipocytes without a parallel increase in FFA release. In adipocytes of obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats (fa/fa) with defective leptin receptors, NE increased both FFA and glycerol release, but leptin had no effect on either. Leptin significantly lowered the mRNA of leptin and fatty acid synthase of adipocytes (FAS) (p< 0.05), and up-regulated the mRNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, (CPT-1), and acyl CoA oxidase (ACO) (p< 0.05). NE (100 nm) also lowered leptin mRNA (p < 0.05) but did not affect FAS, PPARα, ACO, or CPT-1 expression. We conclude that in normal adipocytes leptin directly decreases FAS expression, increases PPARα and the enzymes of FFA oxidation, and stimulates a novel form of lipolysis in which glycerol is released without a proportional release of FFA.

Adenoviral transfer of the leptin gene into normal rats causes rapid loss of all visible body fat within 7 days (1Chen G. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14795-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Unlike the ketotic fat loss in starvation or insulin deficiency, in which the fatty acids (FA) 1The abbreviations used are: FA, fatty acid; FFA, free fatty acid; ACO, acyl CoA oxidase; CPT-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α; ZDF, Zucker diabetic fatty. and glycerol are released proportionately from the adipocytes, hyperleptinemic fat loss is unaccompanied by elevations in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels or ketones or by ketonuria (2Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the nonketotic fat loss is that the FAs are oxidized inside the adipocytes. This idea has received further support from the demonstration that the expression of two major enzymes of long chain FA oxidation, acyl CoA oxidase (ACO), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) are strikingly increased in the adipocytes of hyperleptinemic rats during the disappearance of their fat (3Zhou Y.T. Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6386-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Zhou Y.T. Wang Z.W. Higa M.

This finding implies that experimentally induced hyperleptinemia can convert adipocytes from fat-storing cells into fat-burning cells. Most workers in the field believe that leptin acts largely, if not exclusively, via centers in the hypothalamus, suppressing appetite by inhibiting orexic factors such as neuropeptide Y (5Stephens T.W. Basinski M. Bristow P.K. Bue-Valleskey J.M. Burgett S.G. Craft L. Hale J. Hoffmann J. Hsiung H.M. Kriauciunas A. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar) and by increasing thermogenesis via sympathetic innervation of brown adipose tissue (6Scarpace P.J. Matheny M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 259-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seemed possible, therefore, that the disappearance of the fat of white adipocytes might be the result of leptin-induced, adrenergically mediated activation of lipolysis. Yet there is evidence consistent with the possibility that, at least at high concentrations, leptin can act directly on tissues independently of hypothalamic mediation. First, leptin receptors (OB-R), including the full-length isoform, OB-Rb, are expressed in white adipocytes (10McGowen M.W. Artiss J.D. Strandbergh D.R. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Second, leptin has been shownin vitro to reduce the expression of lipogenic enzymes in preadipocytes (8Bai Y. Zhang S. Kim K.S. Lee J.K. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13939-13942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and to increase glycerol release from mature adipocytes (7Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Pauli V. Juge-Aubry C.E. Boss O. Pernin A. Chin W.W. Cusin I. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Burger A.G. Zapf J. Meier C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2858-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Third, if the fat depletion caused by hyperleptinemia is, in fact, caused by norepinephrine through stimulation of sympathetic centers in the hypothalamus, it would be accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma FFA levels (9Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which did not occur in the hyperleptinemic rats. For these reasons, we suspected that the fat loss of hyperleptinemia involved a novel type of leptin-mediated lipolysis that was independent of catecholamines. The following study was designed to test this possibility. Isolation of adipocytes from lean (+/+) and obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats was performed as described previously (9Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, minced epididymal fat pads were digested at 37 °C for 2–3 h in a buffer containing type II collagenase (1 mg/ml), albumin (3.5%), and glucose (0.55 mm). The digestion mixture was swirled and poured through 100-μm nylon mesh into 50-ml conical polypropylene tubes. Cells were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% albumin and cultured for 0, 3, 6 and 24 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and with or without recombinant leptin (kindly provided by Dr. Gayle Yamamoto of Zymogenetics, Inc., Seattle, WA) or norepinephrine. mRNA was semiquantified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Total RNA from adipocytes was extracted using TRIzol Reagent. After treating with RNase-DNase I, reverse transcription was carried out using 1 μg of total RNA. First strand cDNA was PCR-amplified with sequences specific for leptin (5′-GGAGGAATCCCTGCTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCCTGAGGATACCTGG-3′), ACO (5′-GCCCTCAGCTATGGTATTAC-3′ and 5′-AGGAACTGCTCTCACAATGC-3′), CPT-1 (5′-TATGTGAGGATGCTGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCGGAGAGCTAAGCTTGTC-3′), FAS (5′-GGTTGATGGCTCACACACCT-3′ and 5′-TCAACTCACTCGAGGCTCAG-3′), and PPARα (5′-AAGCCATCTTCACGATGCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGGTCCCTGAACA-GTG-3′). The conditions of PCR were as follows: denaturation for 45 s at 92 °C, annealing for 45 s at 55 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C with 30 cycles. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel and were quantified by Southern blot analysis by means of gene-specific 32P-labeled probes for leptin (5′-CGGATACCGACTGCGTGTGTGAAATGTCAT-3′), ACO (5′-GCCTGCACTTTCTTCAGCCATCTTCAACGA-3′), CPT-1 (5′-ACTCTGGTTGGAATCTGA-CTGGGTGGGATT-3′), FAS (5′-AAGAAGCATATGGCTTCAGCTTCAG-CCTCA-3′), and PPARα (5′-ACTCGGTCTTCTTGATGACCTGCAC-GAGCT-3′). The Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) was used for quanti-fication. As a control for RNA quality and quantity, β-actin mRNA was amplified. Glycerol in the medium was measured by the method of McGowen and co-workers (10McGowen M.W. Artiss J.D. Strandbergh D.R. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). For glycerol assay, 200 μl of medium was deproteinated with 20 μl of 5 mperchloric acid. After deproteination, samples were neutralized with 10m KOH (pH 9.5) and placed on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C to remove KClO4precipitate, and glycerol was measured in the supernatant. To measure FFA, 500 μl of medium was extracted with 500 μl of chloroform, dried under N2, and measured using the method of Shimizuet al. (11Shimizu S. Tani Y. Yamada H. Tabata M. Murachi T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A dramatic early effect of adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia in vivo is the disappearance of leptin mRNA from the adipocytes (4Zhou Y.T. Wang Z.W. Higa M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To establish the in vitro biologic activity of the recombinant leptin, we cultured adipocytes in 20 ng/ml of recombinant leptin, which approximates the levels in hyperleptinemic rats. Leptin mRNA had declined significantly (p < 0.05) by 14, 39 and 50% of normal in 3, 6, and 24 h, respectively (Fig.1 A). In adipocytes fromfa/fa rats, there was no effect on leptin mRNA (Fig.1 B). These results establish a direct action of leptin on mature adipocytes. Norepinephrine at 100 nm concentration reduced leptin mRNA by 30% (p < 0.05) in the adipocytes of+/+ rats (Fig. 1 C), confirming earlier observations in 3T3-L1 cells (12Kosaki A. Yamada K. Kuzuya H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1744-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine did not reduce leptin mRNA in the adipocytes of fa/fa (Fig.1 D). Adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia causes down-regulation of the mRNA of the lipogenic enzymes, acetyl CoA carboxylase and FAS. To determine whether leptin can directly down-regulate expression of the FAS gene, we measured its mRNA at 3, 6, and 24 h after culture of adipocytes in 20 ng/ml of recombinant leptin. FAS expression was reduced at all time points (p < 0.05) and at 24 h was only 10% of controls (Fig. 2 A). This was by far the most dramatic of the direct effects of leptin observed in this study. There was no effect on FAS expression in fa/fa adipocytes (Fig. 2 B). Norepinephrine at 100 nmconcentration had no effect on FAS mRNA of adipocytes from either the wild-type (+/+) or fa/fa ZDF rats (Fig. 2,C and D). We had observed previously that adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia dramatically up-regulates the in vivoexpression of the enzymes of FA oxidation, of ACO and CPT-1 in adipocytes and of their transcription factor PPARα, whereas their triacyl glycerol virtually disappears (4Zhou Y.T. Wang Z.W. Higa M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was a direct effect of hyperleptinemia upon the adipocytes, isolated adipocytes of normal (+/+) ZDF rats were cultured in recombinant leptin at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. After 6 h in culture PPARα mRNA had increased 50% (p < 0.05), whereas CPT-1 and ACO mRNA increased ∼2-fold compared with controls (p < 0.05) (Fig.3 A). In similarly treated adipocytes isolated from obese fa/fa ZDF rats, there was no effect on the mRNA of any of the foregoing genes (Fig.3 B). The presence of 100 nm norepinephrine alone had no effect on PPARα mRNA and caused only a minimal increase in ACO and CPT-1 mRNA (not significant) (data not shown). Norepinephrine could not, therefore, have mediated the in vivo effects of leptin on the expression of these enzymes. The foregoing direct effects of leptin on the expression of enzymes of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis were consistent with the hypothesis that the nonketotic fat loss of adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia was the consequence of increased oxidation of FA within adipocytes, coupled with a reduction in lipogenesis. To determine whether the direct action of leptin involves a novel type of lipolytic action that differs from that of norepinephrine, we compared the release of glycerol and FFA from normal rat adipocytes cultured for 6 h in 20 ng/ml of leptin, in 100 nm norepinephrine, or in buffer alone. As shown in Fig.4 A, norepinephrine and leptin each significantly increased glycerol release from adipocytes isolated from +/+ normal ZDF rats (p < 0.05), confirming the observations of Siegrist-Kaiser et al. (7Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Pauli V. Juge-Aubry C.E. Boss O. Pernin A. Chin W.W. Cusin I. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Burger A.G. Zapf J. Meier C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2858-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, whereas norepinephrine elicited the expected rise in FFA, leptin did not increase FFA release. In adipocytes of fa/farats, by contrast, leptin caused no increase in either glycerol or FA, whereas norepinephrine elicited a robust increase in both (Fig.4 B). The foregoing effects of leptin on lipolysis were observed at the unphysiologically high concentration of 20 ng/ml. To determine whether the effect on lipolysis was operative at more physiologic levels of leptin, a dose-response study was done (Fig.5). Five ng/ml of leptin was the lowest concentration that stimulated release of glycerol (p < 0.05). This concentration is at the upper end of the range of plasma leptin levels of rodents and humans (13Sivitz W.I. Walsh S. Morgan D. Donohoue P. Haynes W. Leibel R.I. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 584-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Tasaka Y. Yanagisawa K. Iwamoto Y. Endocr. J. 1997; 44: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There was no effect of leptin on glycerol release from fa/fa adipocytes at any of the concentrations employed. These results provide evidence for multiple direct actions of leptin on mature adipocytes in vitro. Previously, leptin had been shown to reduce expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase and FAS in 3T3-L1 cells (8Bai Y. Zhang S. Kim K.S. Lee J.K. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13939-13942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and to increase glycerol release from normal adipocytes (7Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Pauli V. Juge-Aubry C.E. Boss O. Pernin A. Chin W.W. Cusin I. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Burger A.G. Zapf J. Meier C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2858-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In the present study, the expression of CPT-1 was increased ∼2-fold above the base-line level by 20 ng/ml of leptin, whereas that of the lipogenic enzyme, FAS, was lowered by ∼90%. It is possible that the up-regulation of ACO and CPT-1 mRNA was mediated by the increase in expression of their transcription factor, PPAR-α, which rose 50%. The mechanism by which leptin up-regulates PPARα is not known. The changes in mRNA induced by recombinant leptin in isolated adipocytes correspond qualitatively with all those observed previouslyin vivo in adipocytes of rats with adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia (4Zhou Y.T. Wang Z.W. Higa M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Because norepinephrine failed to induce any of these changes in the cultured adipocytes, it appears that they are the consequences of direct action of leptin on adipocytes rather than of norepinephrine. It should be stressed, however, that direct effects of leptin on adipocytes were at a concentration at 20 ng/ml, which is far above the physiologic levels in normal humans or rodents. A small but significant increase in glycerol was observed in rat adipocytes in response to 5 ng/ml (p < 0.05), which is in the upper end of the physiologic range (13Sivitz W.I. Walsh S. Morgan D. Donohoue P. Haynes W. Leibel R.I. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 584-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Tasaka Y. Yanagisawa K. Iwamoto Y. Endocr. J. 1997; 44: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, Siegrist-Kaiseret al. (7Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Pauli V. Juge-Aubry C.E. Boss O. Pernin A. Chin W.W. Cusin I. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Burger A.G. Zapf J. Meier C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2858-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) reported an effect at 1.8 ng/ml on glycerol release, which is within the physiologic range. Irrespective of the physiologic relevance of these direct effects of leptin upon adipocytes, they do suggest that the pharmacologic strategy of reducing adipocyte fat content by means of direct lipolytic actions of supraphysiologic levels of leptin may be useful (4Zhou Y.T. Wang Z.W. Higa M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the earlier reports (7Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Pauli V. Juge-Aubry C.E. Boss O. Pernin A. Chin W.W. Cusin I. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Burger A.G. Zapf J. Meier C.A. J. Clin.

Commun. 1997; 240: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) indicating that leptin increases glycerol release from rodent adipocytes, FFA had not been measured. The finding here that leptin-induced glycerol release is unaccompanied by FFA release explains the in vivo observation that fat loss occurring during adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia is unaccompanied by a rise in plasma FFA, ketonemia, and ketonuria (2Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). This and the up-regulation of ACO and CPT-1 support the idea that the FFA are oxidized inside the adipocytes rather than exported to the liver for oxidation to ketoacids. This may provide a valuable therapeutic advantage for leptin treatment of massive obesity, because it permits the rapid removal of fat without the ketoacidosis and hyperuricemia that otherwise complicate rapid weight loss induced by diet restriction. The mechanism of leptin-induced lipolysis remains to be elucidated. Clearly it requires a functional leptin receptor, because it was completely absent in adipocytes of fa/fa ZDF rats with defective OB-R, in which norepinephrine elicited a relatively normal lipolytic response. Leptin signal is believed to be transduced via the STAT/JAK pathway (16Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath E.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95.97Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether leptin increases cAMP and whether, like norepinephrine, it activates the hormone-sensitive lipase (17Slavin B.G. Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J.

When Jurkat cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by Fas receptor ligation, cytochrome cwas released from mitochondria, an event that was prevented by the caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (zVal-Ala-Asp-CH2F). Purified caspase-8 triggered rapid cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria in vitro. The effect was indirect, as the presence of cytosol was required, suggesting that caspase-8 cleaves and activates a cytosolic substrate, which in turn is able to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The cytochromec releasing activity was not blocked by caspase inhibition, but was antagonized by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleaved Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, which gains cytochromec releasing activity in response to caspase cleavage. However, caspase-6 and caspase-7 did not cleave Bid, although they initiated cytochrome c release from mitochondria in the presence of cytosol. Thus, effector caspases may cleave and activate another cytosolic substrate (other than Bid), which then promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Mitochondria significantly amplified the caspase-8 initiated DEVD-specific cleavage activity.

At present, 14 mammalian caspase family members have been described. Some, including caspase-8, -9, and -10, contain large prodomains and are initiators of cell death. Other family members, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7, carry small prodomains and are mostly involved in the execution of cell death. When caspases are activated, they cleave a number of key substrates, resulting in their activation or inactivation, which orchestrate the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis (7Lazebnik Y.A.

To search for signals regulating cytochrome c release, caspase-8 and other caspases were tested for their ability to provoke cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Anti-cytochrome c antibody (7H8.2 C12) was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); anti-Fas monoclonal antibody CH-11 was from Kamiya Biomedical Company (Seattle, WA). Anti-actin antibody was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (clone 14) (Aurora, OH). Anti-caspase-3 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Fodrin antibodies were from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Anti-protein kinase C-δ antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Bcl-2 antibodies (clone 124) were from DAKO (Missisauga, Canada). Complete mixture of protease inhibitors was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad assay kit (Hercules, CA). zVAD-fmk (zVal-Ala-Asp-CH2F) was from Kamiya Biomedical Company (Seattle, WA). Colorimetric substrate DEVD-pNA was from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). Anti-mouse HRP linked antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Jurkat cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 20 min on ice, cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer (B pestle/50 strokes). Cell homogenates were spun at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and supernatants were stored at −70 °C until gel electrophoresis. 20–50 μg of cytosolic extracts were loaded onto each lane of an 8, 12, or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 150 mA overnight in transfer buffer (20 mmTris-base, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin, 3% nonfat milk powder, and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 3 h at room temperature. Anti-cytochrome c antibodies were diluted at 1:1000, anti-caspase-3 at 1:2000, anti-Fodrin at 1:2000, anti-protein kinase C-δ at 1 2000, anti-caspase-8 at 1:5, anti-Actin at 1:4000, and anti-Bid at 1:1000 in PBS, 3% nonfat milk powder, and 0.1% Tween-20. The rest of the procedure was done as described previously (37Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The liver of a 6-week-old Balb/c mouse was minced on ice, resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (200 mm mannitol, 50 mmsucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, mixture of protease inhibitors), and homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer and a tight Teflon pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then recentrifuged at 3500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, supernatants and floating lipid layers were aspirated, and the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in Buffer A and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recentrifuged at 5500 × g for 10 min. The last two steps were repeated twice. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer B (200 mm mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 5 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Mitochondria were prepared fresh for each experiment and used within 4 h. Jurkat cells were grown for 3 days in culture in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 200 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 700 μl of ice-cold buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmsodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mmsucrose, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization (B pestle/50 strokes). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants were then further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Alternatively, supernatants were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatants were stored at −70 °C and until used for in vitro apoptosis assays. Bl21(DE3) cells were transformed with the pET29b-BclxLΔC plasmid. Bacteria were grown in 2× TY medium containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were lysed in 150 ml of buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton × 100, 0.5 mm EDTA, containing protease inhibitors). After being frozen and thawed once, the bacterial lysate was sonicated on highest microtip limit for 5 min on ice. Bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × rpm for 75 min and then filtered using a Sterivex-GS filter unit (0.22 μm) (Millipore). Bcl-xL protein was affinity purified by binding to a 2-ml nickel-chelating column and eluted using an imidazole gradient (0–200 mm). Bcl-xL containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA and stored at −70 °C. To purify caspases, transformed BL21 bacteria were grown in 2× TY medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and induced with 0.02 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were lysed in 150 ml of Buffer C (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl). Cleared bacterial lysates were loaded on a 2-ml nickel-chelating column. The column was washed with 70–90 ml of Buffer D (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) and then with 10 ml of Buffer C. Protein was eluted by an imidazole gradient (0–200 mm) in Buffer C, pH 8.0. Standard reactions were carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume with reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 2 mmATP, 1 mm dATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase plus complete mixture of protease inhibitors), 20–50 μg of cytosolic extract, and 5 μg of isolated liver mitochondria. The reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for various time periods, and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Supernatants were further used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or for DEVD cleavage assays. Cytosolic protein (20–100 μg) was diluted in extraction buffer at a final volume of 200 μl in a microtiter plate 100 μm DEVD-pNA substrate (Biomol). Samples were incubated at 37 °C, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a SpectraMax microtiter plate reader at 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. To examine whether or not Fas signaling may go through a mitochondrial pathway, Jurkat T-lymphocytes were treated with agonistic anti-Fas antibodies (CH-11), and cytosolic extracts, lacking mitochondria, were prepared at various times and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cytochrome c accumulated in cytosolic extracts at 2 h after exposure to anti-Fas antibodies, a time when caspase-8 was activated (detected by the 18-kDa active caspase-8 fragment) (Fig. 1, aand b). Following caspase-8 activation and cytochromec release, procaspase-3 became processed at 4 h (recognized by the loss of its pro-form) (Fig. 1 c). Cleavage of the caspase substrates fodrin and protein kinase C-δ was detectable at 2 h (Fig. 1, d and e). zVAD-fmk treatment prevented cytochrome c release, procaspase-8, and procaspase-3 proteolytic processing, substrate cleavage, and cell death (Fig. 1), suggesting that caspase-8 may initiate cytochrome c release in this system. We had previously observed that the activation of caspase-3 by caspase-8 in vitro proceeds identically in the presence or absence of cytosol (29Stennicke H.R. Jürgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether the release of cytochrome c following Fas ligation can contribute to caspase activation. To test the possible role of mitochondria in cell death mediated by Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptors, purified caspase-8 and cytosol were incubated with increasing amounts of mitochondria for various times, and the resulting caspase activity was measured by conversion of the colorimetric substrate, DEVD-pNA. As shown in Fig. 2, caspase-8-induced cleavage activity was low and reached an early plateau after 60 min, when either no or a low amount (1%; v/v) of mitochondria were present. In contrast, the caspase-8-mediated DEVD-specific cleavage activity was significantly elevated in the presence of 5, 10, and 15% (v/v) mitochondrial fraction. Thus, mitochondria enhance caspase-8-induced DEVD-specific cleavage activity, most likely by release of cytochrome c and activation of the Apaf-1-procaspase-9 complex. To examine whether caspase-8 would induce cytochromec release from mitochondria, cytosolic Jurkat T-lymphocyte cell extracts, purified caspase-8 and mitochondria were incubatedin vitro. When cytosol was incubated with mitochondria alone, no cytochrome c release was observed, indicating that the mitochondrial preparation was not releasing cytochrome cnonspecifically (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, when caspase-8 was incubated with the mitochondrial fraction alone, no cytochrome c release was detectable by immunoblotting, indicating that caspase-8 had no direct effect on mitochondria (Fig. 3 B). However, when caspase-8, cytosol, and mitochondria were incubated together, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria within 20 min (Fig. 3 C, lane 4), and reached maximum release at 90 min (Fig. 3 C, lane 7). These results indicate that caspase-8 is capable of mediating cytochrome c release in the presence of cytosolic extract, presumably by proteolytically activating one or several cytosolic cytochrome c releasing factors. To further characterize the caspase-8-induced cytochrome c releasing activity, cytosolic extract from Jurkat cells was filtered to remove proteins that were larger than 10 kDa, prior to incubation with caspase-8, and mitochondria. Fig. 4 A shows a control experiment, in which unfiltered cytosol and mitochondria without caspase-8 were incubated. As shown above (Fig. 3 A), no cytochrome c release was observed under these conditions. On the other hand, incubation of caspase-8 with unfiltered cytosolic extract and mitochondria induced rapid cytochrome c release, detectable after 10 min at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). However, when cytosol was first filtered, caspase-8-induced cytochrome crelease from mitochondria was abolished (Fig. 4 C). These data indicate that the capsase-8-induced cytochrome creleasing activity resides in the cytosol and is likely a protein larger then 10 kDa. Other caspase family members are known caspase-8 substrates (18Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Ni J. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H.

In this study we show evidence that STAT3 is a transcription factor whose activity is modulated by H2O2 in human lymphocytes, in which endogenous catalase had previously been inhibited. H2O2-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 to form sequence-specific DNA-bound complexes was evidenced by immunoblotting of nuclear fractions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and vanadate was found to strongly synergize with H2O2. Moreover, anti-STAT3 antibodies specifically precipitated a protein of 92 kDa that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine upon lymphocyte treatment with H2O2. Phenylarsine oxide, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, and genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, cooperated and cancelled, respectively, the H2O2-promoted STAT3 nuclear translocation. Evidence is also presented, using Fe2+/Cu2+ions, that ⋅OH generated from H2O2through Fenton reactions could be a candidate oxygen reactive species to directly activate STAT3. Present data suggest that H2O2 and vanadate are likely to inhibit the activity of intracellular tyrosine phosphatase(s), leading to enhanced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and hence its translocation to the nucleus.

H2O2 as well as superoxide anions (O⨪2) have traditionally been viewed as potent microbicidal agents (7Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Hallet M.B. The Neutrophil: Cellular Biochemistry and Physiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 97-111Google Scholar). H2O2 is a small, diffusible, and ubiquitous molecule that can be rapidly synthesized, as well as destroyed, in response to several stimuli. It has been proposed that H2O2 is converted into highly reactive ⋅OH radical via Fenton chemistry through its reduction by ferrous/cuprous ions (8Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

STATs (signal transducers andactivators of transcription) are a class of transcription factors bearing SH2 domains that become activated upon tyrosine phosphorylation. STATs are often activated by members of the JAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in response to cytokine stimulation. This activation mechanism involves the SH2 domain-dependent recruitment of the STATs to tyrosine-phosphorylated cytokine receptors. The STATs then become phosphorylated by receptor-associated JAKs, which induces their dimerization via reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction. STAT dimers then enter the nucleus and bind to specific DNA elements, thereby activating the transcription of a number of genes. The JAK-STAT pathway has been the subject of many recent comprehensive reviews (17Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev.

Enhanced phosphotyrosine accumulation could then result from the combined effects of increased phosphorylation and decreased dephosphorylation. Moreover, the DNA binding activity of STATs is known to depend primarily on tyrosine phosphorylation (19Ihle J.N.

Here we show for the first time that STAT3 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s), translocated to the nucleus, and elicited to bind to specific DNA elements upon lymphocyte treatment with H2O2. An additive effect between H2O2 and vanadate was also evidenced suggesting that inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase(s) by pervanadate could take place. The effects of H2O2 were also enhanced by the presence of Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions, which indicates the participation of other chemical reactive species derived from oxygen. These data collectively indicate that STAT3 is a major component of the signaling pathways that become activated by oxidative stress in human lymphocytes. Hydrogen peroxide (30%, v/v), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, Na3VO4, PAO, diamide, genistein, fetal bovine serum, and 1,10-phenantroline were purchased from Sigma Chemical (Madrid, Spain). Ficoll-Hypaque, phosphate-buffered saline, and RPMI 1640 were obtained from Bio-Whittaker (Verviers, Belgium). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and the double-stranded SIE m67 oligonucleotide (5′-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC-3′) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Barcelona, Spain). Interferon-α was purchased from Schering-Plow (Brinny Innishannon, Ireland). Polyclonal antisera directed against STAT1 and STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies (4G10) against phosphotyrosine (free or conjugated to agarose beads) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-STAT5B antibody was kindly provided by Dr. J. O'Shea (Bethesda, MD). Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma Chemical. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation from normal blood donors, following informed consent. Normally, PBL were used immediately after they were obtained. In other cases, PBL were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% O2 for 24 h. For stimulation treatments, the cells were washed with RPMI 1640, resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 10 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated in RPMI 1640 with the reagents indicated in each case and for the specified times at 37 °C. Stimulation was terminated by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and washing once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 400 μm Na3VO4and 400 μm EDTA. In all the experiments in which H2O2 was used, the cells were previously incubated with 25 mm aminotriazole for 30 min to inhibit endogenous catalase activity, and the cells were not washed before H2O2 addition. Stimulated cells were pelleted and lysed in 75 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer A, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and the following inhibitors of phosphatase and protease: 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm PAO, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. The lysates were kept on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants obtained constituted the cytoplasmic fraction, and the nuclei-containing pellets were washed three times with buffer A (35). Standard Laemmli sample buffer was then added to cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and after boiling for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and after blocking nonspecific interactions in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubation with anti-STAT or 4G10 antibodies (diluted 1:1000 in TBST) was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Next, the membranes were washed twice with TBST, and incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase was performed for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBST, immunoreactive bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence assay as described previously (36Carballo M. Márquez G. Conde M. Martı́n-Nieto J. Monteseirı́n J. Conde J. Pintado E. Sobrino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 93-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stimulated cells were pelleted and lysed in 75 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 300 mmNaCl, 100 μm PAO, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 5 mm EDTA. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. For immunoprecipitation, incubation with anti-STAT3 specific antibodies (0.5 μg/70 μl) was carried out with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 40 μl of a (50%) slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads and further incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies covalently attached to agarose (10 μg/70 μl) and a single incubation step performed for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer B, and the proteins were extracted by boiling the pellet in standard Laemmli sample buffer. After resolution by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide), the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting analysis as indicated above. Stimulated cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in hypotonic buffer C, which contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C, the supernatant obtained was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspension of the pellet in 25 μl of high salt buffer (buffer C supplemented with 20% glycerol and 420 mm NaCl), followed by incubation on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants obtained constituted the nuclear extracts. STAT3 DNA binding activity was assayed using the SIE m67 20-base pair oligonucleotide as a probe (see sequence above) and the digoxigenin gel shift assay kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The reactions were performed in 15 μl of a binding buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, and 10 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 1 pmol of digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide and allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. For competition assays, binding reactions were performed in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. The samples were finally electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide native gels at 4 °C in 0.25× TBE buffer. To investigate the changes on the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation status that take place under oxidative stress conditions, PBL cells were treated with H2O2for 2 min, and then STAT3 was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that, whereas the amount of STAT3 protein immunoprecipitated from H2O2-treated and untreated cells was comparable, the phosphotyrosine content of STAT3 was considerably higher in lymphocytes treated with H2O2 (Fig.1 A). In other experiments, cells treated with H2O2 and untreated control cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a high number of proteins underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon H2O2 treatment, as revealed by immunoblotting using the same anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The presence of STAT3 as a 92-kDa protein among these phosphorylated polypeptides was further evidenced by immunobloting with anti-STAT3 antibodies. A detectable signal was only obtained in the immunoprecipitates from cells treated with H2O2, which was virtually absent in control untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). To test whether the H2O2-promoted increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was accompanied by its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, PBL cells treated with H2O2 for different times were lysed, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were subject to immunoblotting analysis using anti-STAT3 antibodies. As illustrated in Fig.2 A, STAT3 was clearly detectable in the nucleus after 10 min of treatment with H2O2, whereas in the cytosol the STAT3 signal at this time was significantly diminished. Nuclear translocation of STAT3 appeared to be completed after 30 min, because no cytosolic STAT3 was detected at this point. In some untreated cell preparations, a certain amount of STAT3 was found in the nuclei, attributable to basal levels of activation in the absence of stimulus. The effect on STAT3 nuclear translocation of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a well known promoter of lymphocyte proliferation, was also analyzed alone or in combination with H2O2. As shown, PHA by itself was able to slightly induce STAT3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2 B, lane 8). This effect was, however, considerably enhanced when PHA acted in combination with H2O2, conditions under which a synergistic effect was found (Fig. 2 C). Recently, it has been documented that the treatment of T lymphocytes with interleukin-2 results in an increase of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, although no such effect was observed to occur in cells treated with PHA for 3 days (37Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.S. Rees R.C. Kaplan D. Shibuya L. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S. Chen Y.Q. Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Present results suggest that PHA enhances the transduction of signals that are required for optimal H2O2 effect. It has been previously proposed that the combination of H2O2 and orthovanadate potently inhibits PTPase activity (25Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26Zor U. Ferber E. Gergely P. Szücs K. Dombradi V. Goldman R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and/or synergistically stimulates insulin-dependent PTK activity (38O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L. Burns C. Smyth M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10306-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in T lymphocytes. Also, the mixture of H2O2 and sodium orthovanadate promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 and activates p56lck and p59fyn tyrosine kinases (23Schieven G. Kirihara J. Myers D. Ledbetter J. Ucken F. Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These facts have been explained in the light of inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) by pervanadate (38O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L. Burns C. Smyth M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10306-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Further experiments were therefore used to analyze whether a decrease in intracellular PTPase activity could be implicated in the H2O2-induced STAT3 nuclear translocation effect. Toward this end, human PBL were treated with orthovanadate, alone or in combination with H2O2, and the nuclear levels of STAT3 were analyzed. Vanadate alone at 100 μm (the maximal dose tested) promoted a slight accumulation of STAT3 in the nucleus (Fig.3 A, lane 5), and H2O2 alone (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–4) induced this STAT3 translocation detectable only at the highest tested concentration (2 mm). However, the combination of vanadate and H2O2 markedly stimulated in a synergistic fashion the nuclear translocation of STAT3, enhancing about 6-fold the effect obtained with 2 mmH2O2 alone. As shown in Fig. 3 A, at 100 μm vanadate combined with a low dose of H2O2, a nuclear translocation of STAT3 took place (lane 6), whereas at higher concentrations of H2O2 an intense nuclear STAT3 signal was observed (lanes 7 and 8). Because the above effects of pervanadate could be due to the inhibition of intracellular tyrosine phosphatase(s), experiments were attempted to analyze whether other reagents known to alter the tyrosine phosphorylation status of proteins could influence the nuclear translocation of STAT3. Because the effect of PAO as a PTPase inhibitor in T lymphocytes is well known (39Garcia-Morales P. Minami Y. Luong E. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9255-9259Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we decided to test its effect on STAT3 nuclear translocation in human PBL. As shown in Fig.4 A, PAO induced a dose-dependent enhancement of STAT3 nuclear translocation, as monitored in nuclear fractions from cells treated with different concentrations of PAO, upon immunoblotting analysis with anti-STAT3 antibodies. It could also be observed that the nuclear levels of this factor reached in the presence of 2 mmH2O2 could be mimicked by 50 μmPAO. Furthermore, PAO and H2O2 were found to act in a synergistic fashion (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lane 5), which suggests that both molecules could be cooperatively acting as inhibitors of intracellular tyrosine phosphatases. Diamide, a compound with oxidative properties (12Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3133-3139PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), was also shown to stimulate the nuclear translocation of STAT3 (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). This drug was reported to induce a marked enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of several cellular proteins (13Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 40Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17131-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), possibly mediated by inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase(s) (13Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 37Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.S. Rees R.C. Kaplan D. Shibuya L. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S. Chen Y.Q. Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In an opposite fashion, genistein, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, produced a partial inhibition of the STAT3 nuclear translocation elicited by H2O2 (Fig. 4 B,lane 6) or diamide (lane 7). However, genistein was unable to counteract the stimulating action of PAO (lane 8). These results clearly suggest that the nuclear levels of STAT3 are balanced by the opposite actions of intracellular PTKs and PTPases. Experiments were also conducted to study the specificity of oxidant-induced STAT nuclear translocation. Immunoblotting analyses of PBL nuclear extracts reveals that H2O2treatment lightly induced the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT5B, although to a lesser extent than that observed for STAT3 (Fig.5). The distinct behavior displayed by these STAT proteins upon cell challenge with H2O2 agrees with recent observations regarding their activation by different cytokines and growth factors (41Tian S.-S. Tapley P. Sincich C. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Lamb P. Blood. 1996; 12: 4435-4444Crossref Google Scholar). In this regard, G-CSF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5B; however, STAT5B can be activated by mutant receptors that lack tyrosine residues (41Tian S.-S. Tapley P. Sincich C. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Lamb P. Blood. 1996; 12: 4435-4444Crossref Google Scholar, 42De Koning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M.Y. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover efficient STAT3 activation requires additional receptor sequences that include Tyr704(42De Koning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M.Y. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After passive diffusion through the plasma membrane, H2O2 can be converted into other active oxygen species, such as O⨪2 and ⋅OH (23Schieven G. Kirihara J. Myers D. Ledbetter J. Ucken F. Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely mode of intracellular ⋅OH radical production is via Fenton chemistry, which involves the reduction of H2O2 by ferrous ions according to the reaction: H2O2 + Fe2+ → ⋅OH + OH− + Fe3+ (8Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Also, cuprous ions are elemental producers of ⋅OH radicals via Fenton reactions (9Gunther M.R. Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Cohen M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have analyzed whether the chemical species generated from H2O2 through Fenton reactions could affect STAT3 nuclear translocation. Fig. 6illustrates that the prior addition of Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions notably enhanced the H2O2-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 (lane 3). By contrast, the pretreatment of cells with 1,10-phenantroline, a chelator of copper and iron ions resulted in cancellation of the STAT3 nuclear accumulation induced by H2O2 (lane 4). These results indicate that the intracellular reduction of H2O2 to yield more reactive oxygen species, such as ⋅OH, could constitute a more efficient mechanism for the positive action of H2O2 on STAT3. The enhancement of the ability of nuclear STATs to bind to specific DNA elements in PBL cells upon cell stimulation by oxidizing agents was assessed through gel mobility shift assays using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a high affinity target sequence for STAT factors. This binding sequence, named m67, was derived from thesis-inducible element (SIE) of the human c-fospromoter (43Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 44Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were thus prepared from PBL challenged with orthovanadate, H2O2, or both and incubated with the digoxigenin-labeled SIE m67 oligonucleotide probe. Fig. 7 A illustrates that H2O2 induced a rapid assembly of complexes able to bind to the SIE m67 probe within PBL nuclei (lane 3). The same effect was observed upon vanadate treatment (lane 2), and a cooperative effect was found to take place between vanadate and H2O2 (lane 4). As a positive control, we also analyzed the effect of interferon-α (18Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), with the same results (lane 5). The shifted band could be competed by an excess of unlabeled SIE m67 oligonucleotide; thus, it indicates that nuclear factor binding was specific (lane 6). However, quite intriguingly, we found that treatment with PAO, despite this compound enhanced STAT3 nuclear translocation, cancelled completely nuclear factor binding to the STAT specific sequence, even below basal levels of binding seen in the absence of H2O2 (data not shown). We cannot offer any explanation for this fact, although it could be related to the hyperphosphorylation of proteins (e.g. STAT3)"
https://openalex.org/W2014269608,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Recent work in this field has been focused upon defining the mechanisms of transcriptional control exacted by members of this superfamily. Using a COOH-terminal region of the human AR in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified Tip60 as an AR-interacting protein. In this report, we show that Tip60, which was originally identified as a coactivator for the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein, can enhance AR-mediated transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner in LNCaP and COS-1 cell lines. In addition, our experiments show that Tip60 can also enhance transactivation through the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in a ligand-dependent manner; thus identifying Tip60 as a nuclear hormone receptor coactivator. Our studies also demonstrate that Tip60 co-immunoprecipitates with the full-length ARin vitro and that, in our system, Tip60 enhances transactivation to levels observed with the coactivators steroid receptor coactivator 1, p300, and CREB-binding protein. The importance of such proteins in enhancing nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transcriptional activation is widely accepted, and this work suggests that Tip60 may have an equally important role to play.

In the nucleus, the ligand-activated receptors bind to their cognate response elements in or near promoter regions of target genes to positively or negatively regulate gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 1Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which specific modulation of target gene expression is achieved by nuclear receptors (NRs) is not clearly defined. Early research indicated that there might be factors common to different receptors required for efficient transcriptional activation. This was demonstrated by the observation that different ligand-bound steroid receptors affected or inhibited transactivation by other NRs. This suggested the sequestration of mutually required cofactors (2Conneely O.M. Kettelberger D.M. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Roy A.K. Clark J. Gene Regulation by Steroid Hormones IV. Springer, New York1989: 220-223Crossref Google Scholar, 3Tasset D. Tora L. Fromental C. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1990; 62: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has led to the identification of several coactivators of NR-mediated transactivation. These coactivators enhance levels of NR transactivation severalfold (reviewed in Refs. 4Pratt W.B. Welsh M.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 83-93Google Scholar and 5Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164PubMed Google Scholar) and display a broad specificity across the superfamily, with the exception of ARA70, which appears to be specific for the AR (6Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The NR-bound coactivator proteins are believed to enhance the stability of the pre-initiation complex, resulting in increased rates of transcription initiation. Direct contacts between pre-initiation complex components and coactivators have been demonstrated, supporting this hypothesis; for example, SRC-1 has been shown to interact with TATA box-binding protein and TFIIB (7Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Misiti S. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3594-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, members of the NR superfamily have also been shown to interact with components of the pre-initiation complex (8Baniahmad A. Ha I. Reinberg D. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8832-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 9Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery that the coactivators SRC-1, p300, and CBP (CREB-binding protein) possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity provided further insight into the regulation of NR transactivation (11Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar,12Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has long been associated with transcriptional activity (13Allfrey V. Faulkner R.M. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), and the subsequently altered nucleosomal structure is believed to facilitate access for additional factors necessary for activation (14Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R. Crane-Robinson C. Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases can reverse the effects on nucleosomal disruption of HAT proteins, leading to repression of gene expression (15Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 272: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 82-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The subsequent demonstration that a histone deacetylase, HDAC1, interacted with the NR corepressors SMRT (18Nagy L. Kao H.-Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) and NCoR (19Alland L. Muhle R. Hou H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) provoked the realization that the transcriptional output directed by a NR from a given gene may be reflected in the position of equilibrium between histone acetylation and deacetylation. Coactivators and corepressors may possess such activities or recruit proteins that do to exact their function. Recent work investigating the progesterone receptor (PR) has shown that when bound by ligand, it exists in stable ternary complexes with SRC-1 and TIF-2 (20McKenna N.J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11697-11702Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Such complexes may exist with other NRs, enhancing the potential for diverse interaction upon ligand binding. In addition, many coactivators have been shown to interact with one another, such as CBP/PCAF (21Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), SRC-1/CBP (22Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose G.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar), SRC-1/p300 (23Yao T.P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and SRC-1/PCAF (11Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Also, multiple NR-interacting domains have been identified in certain coactivators such as SRC-1 (24Onate S.A. Bonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12101-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of such protein interactions therefore suggests that maximal transcriptional activation is likely to require the targeted coupling of hyperacetylated histones with stabilized pre-initiation complexes and that this is likely to be mediated by multimeric, coactivating, HAT-containing protein complexes. The observed complexity of gene expression may be reflected in the composition of these higher-order, activating complexes. In this study, we sought to identify AR-interacting proteins in an attempt to dissect the mechanism by which the AR exacts transcriptional control. Due to the multitude of potential interacting proteins, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system (25Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). This led to the identification of the Tat-interacting protein (Tip60) as an AR-interacting protein. Tip60 was originally reported as a human coactivator for the human immunodeficiency virus type I-encoded TAT protein (26Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and more recent work has shown that it is a member of a family of related genes involved in transcriptional regulation (27Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2054-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we demonstrated that Tip60 acts as a ligand-dependent coactivator for the AR, PR, and ER (estrogen receptor). The level of enhancement observed is comparable to that of SRC-1, p300, and CBP in our system, and, taken together, these results suggest that Tip60 is potentially an important member of the NR coactivator family. Residues 559–918 of the hAR (GenBank accession number m23263) containing the DNA and ligand binding domains were amplified by PCR from pGEM3Z-AR (a gift from S. Liao, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) using primers GGACTCTAGAATGCCCATTGACTATTACTT and TGTTTCTAGAGCTTCACTGGGTGTGGAA and subcloned into pT7-7 viaXbaI sites. This fragment was released byNdeI-BamHI restriction of pT7-7hAR559–918 and subcloned downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) in pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). pAS2-1hAR559–918 was transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A (a gift from P. James, University of Wisconsin). PJ69-4A is an improved two-hybrid strain with an additional nutritional reporter gene that serves to reduce false positives (28James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent tryptophan-positive strain was transformed with 50 μg of a human brain cDNA:GAL4 activation domain fusion library constructed in pACT2 (CLONTECH). 200,000 transformed cells were plated onto media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and adenine, supplemented with 1 μm dihydrotesterone (DHT). Adenine-positive, LacZ-positive, histidine-positive colonies were isolated, and plasmid DNA was prepared and transformed intoEscherichia coli according to the protocol provided byCLONTECH. pACT2 plasmids containing cDNA were identified by colony PCR using primers specific for the LEU2gene contained in pACT2. Specificity of interaction for the hAR was determined by examining the liquid LacZ activity (see below) of cDNA clones in the presence of the GAL4DBD:hAR559–918 fusion protein versus the activity observed in the presence of the GAL4DBD alone. After sequencing and examination of the GenBankTM database, we determined that one interacting clone was encoded by a 1.7-kb cDNA fragment with a 96% identity to Tip60 (GenBank accession number u40989), which maintained the reported open reading frame for Tip60 (25Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment revealed that the identified clone began 70 residues downstream of the NH2terminus. Subsequent two-hybrid screens in our laboratory have identified full-length Tip60 cDNAs as AR-interacting clones, suggesting that the 70 residues absent from our construct did not significantly interfere with the interaction. All Tip60 constructs used in this work are derived from the original 1.7-kb clone. pAS2-1hAR constructs were co-transformed with pACT2Tip60 or pACT2 into PJ69-4A according to the manufacturer's guidelines (CLONTECH). Subsequent Trp-positive, Leu-positive colonies were inoculated in triplicate into selective media and grown at 30 °C overnight in the presence or absence of 1 μmDHT. Samples were diluted to an A 600 of 0.2 and re-grown to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8. Samples were divided into three 1-ml aliquots. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, washed once with buffer Z (0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgSO4) and resuspended in 800 μl of buffer Z containing 21 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. 10 μl of 0.1% SDS were added, followed by 50 μl of chloroform. Samples were vortexed for 1 min and placed at 30 °C, and 200 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in buffer Z) were added. Reactions were timed and terminated upon observing an obvious yellow color or after 1 h via the addition of 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3.A 420 of the samples was determined, and activity was calculated as follows: (A 420 × 1000)/(A 600 × time). All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. hAR fusion proteins for these experiments were constructed as follows; hAR559-918 was constructed as described above. Additional constructs were amplified by PCR using the following primer combinations: hAR1–150 (p1:TCAAGGATCCAAGTGCAGTTAGGGCTGGGA - p3:ACGTGGATCCGGCAGCTGAGTCATCCTCGT), hAR1–300 (p1-p5:CCTAGGATCCCGCCTTCTAGCCCTTTGGTG), hAR559–624 (p6:TATTGGATCCCACCCCAGAAGACCTGCCTG-p9:TCCGGGATCCCAGAGTCATCCCTGCTTCAT), and hAR624–918 (p8:GCCCGGATCCTGAAGAAACTTGGTAATCTG- p10:TAGGGGATCCAATGCTTCACTGGGTGTGGA). PCR products were cloned into the BamHI site of pAS2-1. All fusion constructs were sequenced to confirm maintenance of the open reading frame, and expression was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-AR antibodies (Novocastra). Templates were prepared using a Geneclean kit (Anachem) and resuspended in RNase-free distilled H2O. An in vitro coupled transcription and translation kit (T7-TNT; Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. After completion of the 90-min reaction, samples were combined equally on ice, as indicated. 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml pepstatin) was added to each sample, mixed, and incubated on ice for 30 min. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (PGS) pre-washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer were added to each sample and incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C with rotation to remove any proteins that interacted nonspecifically with PGS. PGS was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was incubated with 2.5 μg of penta-His antibody (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 20 μl of PGS were added to each sample and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 60 min. PGS antibody conjugates were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min, resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 350 mmNaCl), and re-spun. Samples were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (PBS and 0.2% Triton X-100), re-spun, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 45 min with equal loading. The gel was fixed for 30 min (10% propanol and 10% acetic acid), soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film for 4–24 h at −70 °C. Templates used were pT7-7hAR1–918 and full-length Sap-1a in pASG4 (a gift from A. D. Sharrocks, Newcastle University). pRSET-C-Tip60 was constructed via excision of a BamHI fragment from pACT2Tip60 utilizing a BamHI site in the 3′ untranslated region of Tip60 cDNA and cloned in-frame with the hexaHis tag of pRSET-C (R&D Systems). Orientation was determined via restriction analysis and confirmed by sequencing. Cells were cultured for at least 48 h before transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum that had been stripped of steroids by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal. Cells were routinely grown to 60–80% confluence, washed, removed, and seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in fresh medium in 35-mm wells (Corning). After 20 h, cells were washed once with serum-free medium and transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amounts of DNA used are described in the figure legends. After 7 h, cells were washed twice with the appropriate medium and incubated in 2 ml of medium containing steroid or vehicle, as indicated. Mibolerone is used in mammalian experiments with the AR because it is a specific androgen analogue. After 48 h, cells were recovered and assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for the corresponding β-galactosidase activity to give relative activity. β-Galactosidase assays were typically performed in a 96-well plate (Corning) as follows: 10 μl of sample extract were incubated with 80 μl of buffer Z and 10 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml) at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated via the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Na2CO3.A 420 values were obtained using a MR5000 plate reader (Dynatech), and activity was calculated as described above. Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. These cells were routinely subcultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 35-mm wells at least 24 h before transfection. For studies examining the ER and PR, cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin for a period of 8 h and washed, and medium containing vehicle or steroid was added as indicated. Cells were harvested at 72 h after transfection and analyzed as described above. pCMV5Tip60 was constructed via cloning of a BglII fragment from pACT2Tip60 into pCMV5. Expression was confirmed using an anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). hAR1–918 was cloned into the XbaI site of pCDNA3. The following mammalian expression plasmids were gratefully received: RSVhPRB and full-length hSRC-1a in pCR3.1 (M.-J. Tsai; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), pHEGO (wtER; P. Chambon; Institute de Genet/Biology Molec/Cell), pRc/RSVmCBP (R. H. Goodman, Oregon Health Sciences University), and pCMVβ-p300 (D. M. Livingston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The reporter plasmid pMTV-Luc (a gift from R. Vogel, Merck and Co., Inc.) was used for experiments with the AR in COS-1 cells and for experiments with the PR in LNCaP cells. For the ER in LNCaP cells, the reporter plasmid was pVITEREluc (a gift from B. Westley, Newcastle University). In addition, pPSAluc, a reporter construct derived from the PSA promoter, was used for AR-based experiments in LNCaP cells. A 658-base pair fragment containing two androgen-responsive elements was amplified by PCR from the PSA promoter (GenBank accession numbers u37672 and x13940) using primers GTGGAGCTGGATTCTGGGT and CTCAGCTTGACAGTCAGGG. This product was cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen), released viaKpnI/XhoI digestion, and inserted into the corresponding sites in the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic (Promega). For Fig. 6, pSGp53 expressing GAL4DBDp531–42was obtained from A. D. Sharrocks (Newcastle University). The reporter plasmid TK-GAL4UASLuc and the GAL4DBD-expressing plasmid pSG424 were gifts from R. Clifton-Bleigh (Cambridge University). The Tip60:GAL4DBD fusion construct was created by the insertion of theBamHI fragment from pACT2Tip60 into the BamHI site of pSG424 downstream of the GAL4DBD. Correct orientation was determined by sequencing, and expression was confirmed via Western analysis with an anti-GAL4DBD antibody (CLONTECH). Yeast two-hybrid screening, which was originally described by Fields and Song (25Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar), using the AR construct AR559–918 comprising the DNA and ligand binding domains (DBD and LBD, respectively) as bait identified Tip60 as an AR-interacting protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). In an attempt to define the specificity of the interaction with the AR, we examined the association of Tip60 with various GAL4DBD:AR constructs in the yeast two-hybrid system in the presence of 1 μm DHT. AR constructs spanning the first 300 residues (AR1–150 and AR1–300) and the DBD of the AR (AR559–624) failed to interact with the Tip60GAL4AD fusion protein (Fig.1 a), whereas both AR559–918 and AR624–918 interacted specifically with Tip60. Therefore, Tip60 appears to interact specifically with the LBD of the AR. The interaction appeared to be increased significantly with the attachment of the DBD to the LBD, although the DBD of the AR fails to interact by itself. A potential explanation for this observation is that the LBD may be prevented from folding into the optimal conformation for interaction when positioned directly at the COOH terminus of the GAL4DBD. The presence of the DBD may serve to distance the LBD from the GAL4DBD in this scenario, or, alternatively, it may be that the AR DBD is essential for directing or influencing the conformational change upon ligand binding. The interaction of AR and Tip60 is not ligand-dependent (Fig. 1 b) but is enhanced in the presence of ligand in the yeast two-hybrid system. We examined the interaction of the AR regions 559–918 and 624–918 with Tip60 in the presence and absence of 1 μm DHT and found that the interaction was significantly enhanced in the presence of DHT. Values obtained in the absence of DHT for AR559–918 and AR624–918 were similar, indicating that the AR DBD may have a role to play in altering the conformation of the AR upon ligand binding in this system. The majority of interactions reported to date, such as ARA70 with the AR (6Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), have been ligand-dependent. It is therefore interesting that the AR:Tip60 interaction is not ligand-dependent. Significantly, PCAF, a human homologue of the yeast Gcn5 (21Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), has been shown to bind to the AR and ER in a ligand-independent manner and to function as a coactivator for nuclear receptors (29Blanco J.C.G. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.-J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The interaction reported in the yeast two-hybrid system between PCAF and the AR is similar to the interaction observed between Tip60 and the AR in that it is enhanced in the presence of ligand (29Blanco J.C.G. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.-J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus, Tip60 and PCAF may represent a class of coactivators that are complexed with the aporeceptor. It is possible that the ligand-independent Tip60:AR complex could hold the AR in a state of readiness, thus facilitating a rapid activation response upon ligand binding, enabling the directed recruitment of other cofactors to AR-regulated genes. To confirm the interaction data obtained from the two-hybrid system, we sought to determine whether Tip60 could interact with the AR in vitro. Using proteins transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine, we attempted to co-immunoprecipitate the AR with Tip60 using an anti-His antibody recognizing His-tagged Tip60. The transcription factor Sap-1a (Elk4) (30Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), an Ets family-related protein, was included as a control for this experiment. Before immunoprecipitation, labeled HexaHisTip60 was incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate extracts containing Sap-1a or AR, as indicated (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Lanes 1 and3 show the control samples, in which immunoprecipitations were carried out on extracts containing Sap-1a or AR in the absence of Tip60 to determine the levels immunoprecipitated that are not specifically associated with Tip60. Confirmation of the two-hybrid results was obtained via the observation that full-length AR co-immunoprecipitated with Tip60 (lane 8), whereas very low amounts of nonspecific AR were visible in the absence of Tip60 (lane 7). This interaction was not affected by the presence of ligand (data not shown), again a feature previously described for PCAF (29Blanco J.C.G. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.-J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Importantly, Sap-1a did not interact with Tip60 in this experiment, confirming the specificity of the immunoprecipitation procedure because no additional Sap-1a is recovered in the presence of Tip60 (lane 6) versus the absence of Tip60 (lane 5). We also attempted to demonstrate the interaction using anti-AR. In this system, the only anti-AR that works consistently in our hands for the purposes of immunoprecipitation is sc-805 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). However, this proved unsuccessful. Subsequent investigation leads us to believe that the antibody directed against the ligand binding domain and Tip60 compete for AR binding. This phenomenon has been reported for other studies in which antibody against an AR-interacting protein, BAG-1L, failed to co-immunoprecipitate the AR (31Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, our experiment, in combination with the two-hybrid data, provides sufficient evidence for the AR:Tip60 interaction. As stated earlier, Tip60 was previously identified as a coactivator for the human immunodeficiency virus type I-encoded TAT protein. This fact led us to believe that it could act in a similar manner for the AR. We investigated the effect of increasing levels of Tip60 upon AR-dependent transactivation in transiently transfected LNCaP and COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). In LNCaP cells, pPSAluc, a PSA-derived reporter plasmid containing two androgen-responsive elements, was utilized. Co-transfection of the indicated plasmids demonstrated a ligand-dependent enhancement of AR-mediated transactivation by Tip60 (Fig.3 a). In these experiments, Tip60 expression produced a 5-fold enhancement of AR transactivation without any effect on basal transcription. We also investigated the effect of Tip60 on AR-mediated transactivation in COS-1 cells using a reporter plasmid derived from the murine mammary tumor virus promoter pMTVluc (Fig. 3 b). Expression of Tip60 in this context resulted in a ligand-dependent, 3–4-fold enhancement of transcriptional activation without any effect on basal transcription levels. These results demonstrate that Tip60 is a ligand-dependent coactivator for the AR. This effect was observed using two different cell lines and reporter constructs, which provides confidence in the coactivating properties of Tip60. Having outlined the role of Tip60 in AR-regulated promoters, we wished to investigate the role of Tip60 in transcriptional coactivation with other nuclear receptors. pMTVluc was used to study the effect of Tip60 on"

Using information on a related ATPase, DNA gyrase B, we selected three conserved residues in hsp90's ATP-binding domain for mutation. Two of these mutations eliminate nucleotide binding, while the third retains nucleotide binding but is apparently deficient in ATP hydrolysis. We first analyzed how these mutations affect hsp90's binding to the co-chaperones p23 and Hop, and to the hydrophobic resin, phenyl-Sepharose. These experiments showed that ATP's effects, specifically, increased affinity for p23 and decreased affinity for Hop and phenyl-Sepharose, are brought on by ATP binding alone. We also tested the ability of hsp90 mutants to assist hsp70, hsp40, and Hop in the refolding of denatured firefly luciferase. While hsp90 is capable of participating in this process in a nucleotide-independent manner, the ability to hydrolyze ATP markedly potentiates hsp90's effect. Finally, we assembled progesterone receptor heterocomplexes with hsp70, hsp40, Hop, p23, and wild type or mutant hsp90.

Its fundamental importance is underscored by its presence in all species studied, from Escherichia coli to humans, with a remarkable 40% amino acid identity (1Gupta R.S. Mol. Biol.

Additionally, the level of hsp90 expressed in various human and murine tissues represents up to 2% of total protein (3Lai B.-T. Chin N.W. Stanek A.E. Keh W. Lanks K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2802-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and deletion studies in yeast have shown that hsp90 is essential for viability (4Borkovich K.A. Farrely F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The common thread in many of its known activities is the chaperoning of substrate proteins to activate their function. This has been most extensively studied with steroid receptors, where hsp90 is required to fold the hormone-binding domain of these receptors into a conformation with high affinity for steroid (see Ref. 5Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar for a review).

In this paper, we use similar mutants to first analyze their effects on hsp90's interactions with nucleotide and hydrophobic resins, and with the co-chaperones p23 and Hop. Then, we show how alterations in these individual interactions affect the assembly and function of higher-order protein heterocomplexes involved in protein refolding and steroid receptor hormone binding.

For wild type and mutant hsp90 proteins, bacterial pellets containing overexpressed hsp90 were lysed by sonication in 10 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm thioglycerol, pH 7.5, containing a protease inhibitor mixture of 0.1 mmleupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 77 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The soluble lysate fraction was separated by sequential DEAE-cellulose and heparin-agarose column chromatography, followed by Mono Q FPLC (Pharmacia) as described previously (22Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Purified protein was dialyzed and stored in either 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, or 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Protein concentration was determined by scanning densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels containing known standards of hsp90 as determined by amino acid analysis. ATP-Sepharose binding was typically performed with 5 μg of purified hsp90 in a final volume of 200 μl of incubation buffer (IB: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma, currently available as IGEPAL CA-630), and 20 mmNa2MoO4, with or without 5 mm ATP. To this mixture was added 25 μl of γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose resin (provided by Timothy Haystead (Ref. 43Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), commercially available from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) which was washed and pre-equilibrated with IB before use to remove free nucleotides. Samples were then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with frequent mixing to resuspend the resin. After incubation, samples were chilled on ice and the resin was pelleted. Following removal of unbound protein in the supernatant, resin pellets were washed with 3 × 1 ml of cold IB. Bound proteins were eluted from the resin by boiling 2 min in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and resolved by SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). p23 binding assays were typically performed in a final volume of 200 μl of IB (see above) containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 5 mm ATP, and an ATP regeneration system consisting of 10 mm phosphocreatine and 7 units of creatine phosphokinase (both Sigma). Variations in nucleotide content are described for each experiment in the figure legends. Five-10 μg of purified p23 were used along with either 5 μg of purified hsp90 or 50 μl of cell lysate from E. coli BL21 strains overexpressing hsp90. In cases where cell lysate was used, expression of wild type and mutant hsp90s was similar (data not shown). This mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the reactions were chilled on ice and added to approximately 20 μg of anti-p23 monoclonal antibody JJ3 (45Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) bound to 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) for a 1-h immunoprecipitation on ice with frequent mixing. The resin pellets were then washed with 4 × 1 ml of cold IB. Bound proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE as described above. Hop (p60) binding assays were performed in a final volume of 200 μl of IB (see above) supplemented with 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 20 mm Na2MoO4,. Each sample contained 5 μg of purified hsp90. In addition, some samples also contained 5 mm ATP with or without 5 μg of purified p23 as indicated. This mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, samples were chilled on ice and 5 μg of purified Hop was added, along with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose containing 10 μl of F5 antibody against Hop (46Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Hop was then immunoprecipitated on ice for 1 h with frequent mixing. Next, the antibody resin pellets were washed with 4 × 1 ml of cold IB. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above, and the amount of hsp90 co-precipitating with Hop was quantified by scanning densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. In the phenyl-Sepharose binding assay, 5 μg of hsp90 were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 200 μl of IB (see above) containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 20 mm Na2MoO4; with or without 5 mm ATP and the ATP regeneration system described above. Following this incubation, the mixtures were chilled on ice, then added to 25 μl of phenyl-Sepharose (Sigma) for a second incubation for 15 min on ice with frequent mixing to keep the resin in suspension. The resin was then pelleted, and non-binding hsp90 in the supernatant was removed. Phenyl-Sepharose pellets were washed with 3 × 1 ml of cold IB containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 20 mmNa2MoO4. Proteins still bound to the resin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Luciferase refolding assays were performed as described previously (9Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O.

Firefly luciferase (Sigma) at 100 nm in stability buffer (25 mmTricine-HCl, 8 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.8) was denatured at 40 °C for 15 min to <1% of its original activity. It was then diluted 1:10 in Tris buffer (TB: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing 2 mm ATP, an ATP-regenerating system (10 mmphosphocreatine and 3.5 units/100 μl of creatine kinase), and purified chaperone proteins, in a final volume of 35 μl. In addition, some tubes contained the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, National Institutes of Health), at a concentration of 18 μm. This mixture was incubated at 25 °C to promote refolding, which was assayed at each time point by measuring the luciferase activity of a 5-μl aliquot in a luminometer (Turner). The chaperone concentrations used were: 550 nmhsp70, 160 nm ydj-1, 100 nm Hop, and 180 nm hsp90 (calculated as a monomer). Under these conditions, the effect of hsp90 was unchanged by varying its concentration within the range 100–600 nm (data not shown). Chicken oviduct cytosol preparation, progesterone receptor (PR) isolation, and PR complex assembly were largely performed as described previously (8Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and they will only be described in brief here. Chicken oviduct cytosols were prepared at 4 °C by homogenization of frozen oviducts from estrogen-treated chickens in 4 volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmthioglycerol, pH 7.5, containing a protease inhibitor mixture of 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 77 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μm pepsatatin, and 1 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride)). Lipid and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 ×g, followed by 1 h at 110,000 × g, keeping the supernatant and avoiding the lipid layer each time). Cytosol was treated at 4 °C with 0.5 m KCl and 5 mm ATP for 30 min to strip PR of all coprecipitating proteins. Monoclonal antibody PR22 (47Sullivan W.P. Beito T.G. Proper J. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was conjugated to protein A-Sepharose resin (Pharmacia) for use in PR isolation, using 1 mg of antibody/1 ml of resin. Treated cytosol (1.6 ml) was added to 25 μl of antibody resin, and PR was adsorbed by a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C with constant, gentle mixing. Following adsorption, pellets were washed with 3 × 1 ml homogenization buffer and once with 1 ml of IB (see above) to remove unbound proteins. PR complexes were formed by incubation of PR pellets with 20 μg of hsp70, 20 μg of hsp90, 5 μg of Hop, 2 μg of ydj-1, and 5 μg of p23 in a final volume of 200 μl of IB containing 5 mm ATP and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 30 °C with frequent mixing. Where indicated, geldanamycin was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (18 μm). Following incubation, the mixtures were chilled on ice and supplemented with a mixture of 5 nm[1,2-3H]progesterone (1.9 TBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and 100 nm unlabeled progesterone. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing to allow progesterone binding to the receptor. Unbound hormone was washed away with 3 × 1 ml of cold IB. The antibody resin was resuspended in 1 ml of IB, and 100 μl was removed for scintillation counting of bound [3H]progesterone. The remaining resin was pelleted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Protein sequence analyses of type II DNA topoisomerases and the MutL family of DNA repair enzymes revealed the presence of three regions in hsp90's amino-terminal domain containing sequence homology to these proteins (40Bergerat A. deMassy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 41Mushegian A.R. Basset D.E. Boguski M.S. Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5831-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, a predicted structure for this domain of hsp90 suggested similarities with the NH2-terminal domain of the B subunit of DNA gyrase (48Gerloff D.L. Cohen F.E. Korostensky C. Turcotte M. Gonnet G.H. Benner S.A. Proteins. 1997; 27: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This domain of gyrase B is known to contain the ATP binding and hydrolysis functions of the subunit (49Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and its crystal structure has been determined (39Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We used studies of gyrase B's structure and function along with structural and sequence data for hsp90 to find residues in hsp90 which could be involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Magnesium ions are necessary for ATP binding to hsp90 (22Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), providing a possible point for disruption of binding. An asparagine residue (corresponding to Asn50 in chicken hsp90α) interacts with a magnesium ion in the gyrase B crystal structure (39Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and the same interaction is believed to be found in hsp90 (25Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). We changed this residue to alanine, and the corresponding mutant is called N50A. The second residue we altered was an aspartate at position 92. The crystal structures for gyrase B and hsp90 show that this residue hydrogen bonds with the adenine base (25Prodromou C. Roe S.M.

Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) of ATP. The likelihood of its importance is enhanced by the fact that it is a charged residue in an otherwise hydrophobic environment (25Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 26Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Asp92 was changed to an alanine, producing the D92A mutant. Finally, we sought to generate a mutant hsp90 which would bind ATP, but be unable to hydrolyze it. A study of the gyrase B ATPase reaction demonstrated that mutation of a glutamate residue (corresponding to Glu46 in chicken hsp90α) to alanine or glutamine eliminated ATPase activity while still allowing ATP binding (38Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We chose to mutate this residue to alanine, resulting in the E46A mutant. A phylogenetic study of hsp90 proteins shows that the three residues we have selected for mutation are conserved from E. coli to humans (1Gupta R.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 1063-1073PubMed Google Scholar), further indicating their importance. Two of the residues described here have recently been mutated in yeast hsp90 (36Panaretou B. Prodromou C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Those studies demonstrated that changing Asp92 (Asp79 in yeast) to asparagine reduces ATP binding to subdetectable levels, and that changing Glu46 (Glu33 in yeast) to alanine reduces ATPase activity to <1% of wild type while keeping ATP binding comparable to wild type. The effect of these mutations on hsp90 binding to ATP-Sepharose is shown in Fig. 1. In addition to wild type hsp90, only the E46A mutant was capable of binding to the resin. However, it appears that E46A does not bind as well as does wild type hsp90 (compare protein loads to bound protein for each). The inclusion of 5 mm free ATP effectively competes away binding by"

Although others have described an interaction between Tax and a holo-IκB kinase (IKK) complex, the exact details of protein-protein contact are not fully defined. Here we show that Tax binds to neither IKK-α nor IKK-β but instead complexes directly with IKK-γ, a newly characterized component of the IKK complex. This direct interaction with IKK-γ correlates with Tax-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. Thus, our findings establish IKK-γ as a key molecule for adapting an oncoprotein-specific signaling to IKK-α and IKK-β.

Tax is the etiological oncoprotein associated with adult T-cell leukemia (1Uchiyama T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 15-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).

NF-κB is a key regulator of inflammatory responses as well as cell death (20Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 21Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Ambiently, NF-κB exists in the cytoplasm tightly associated with inhibitory proteins, IκBs. Activity of NF-κB is stimulated widely by cytokines, oxidative stress, phorbol ester, and virus infection. One mechanism of NF-κB activation involves site-specific phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36 of IκB-α, followed by its ubiquitination and degradation (20Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M.

Because of potential implications for cellular transformation, it is of interest to understand how transforming viruses activate NF-κB.

Mechanistically, how IKK-α and IKK-β are impinged upon by Tax has not been defined. Here we show that Tax binds to neither IKK-α nor IKK-β but instead contacts directly IKK-γ. We propose that IKK-γ functionally adapts oncoprotein signaling to IKK-α/IKK-β. pHA is a derivative of pM (CLONTECH) in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (BD) has been replaced by an HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). pHA-derived plasmids pHAγ and pHAγΔC contain full-length and C-terminally truncated (amino acids 1–306) human IKK-γ, respectively. pGST-IKK-γ contains IKK-γ cDNA inserted into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pMBP-Tax, pIE-Tax, pIE-Tax mutants (pIEX, pIEX S258A, and pIEX L320G), and pBD-Tax have been described previously (16Semmes O.J.

Recently, full-length cDNA clones for both mouse and human IKK-γ (also termed NEMO) have been isolated (31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Genetically, IKK-γ is linked to Tax activation of NF-κB (31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In assessing this, we considered two other observations. First, IKK-γ contains a striking coiled-coil domain in its 51–353 residues (33Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 40Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 91-96Google Scholar). Second, several other cellular Tax-binding proteins share a characteristically structured coiled-coil domain. Examples include GPS2 (17Jin D.-Y. Teramoto H. Giam C.-Z. Chun R.F. Gutkind J.S. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25816-25823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), ATF4/CREB2 (18Reddy T.R. Tang H. Li X. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2785-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Gachon F. Peleraux A. Thebault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TXBP181/HsMAD1 (10Jin D.-Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.-T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), TXBP151 (19Gachon F. Peleraux A. Thebault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TXBP121/KIAA0445 (GenBankTMaccession number AB007914). Thus, circumstantially, a particular coiled-coil structure likely represents a recognition motif for Tax. Hence, we wondered whether the coiled-coil IKK-γ protein could be a direct Tax adapter that would help to explain NF-κB activation by this oncoprotein. To address this issue, we co-expressed Tax (pIEX) and HA-tagged human IKK-γ (pHAγ) in HeLa cells and performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations (Fig.1 A). HeLa cells transfected singularly with pHAγ abundantly expressed HA-IKK-γ, which was detected easily by direct immunoblotting with a mouse anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 1, α-HA (m)) and by immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-HA antiserum (Fig.1 A, lane 2, α-HA (r)) followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-HA antibody. In HeLa cells co-transfected with pHAγ and pIEX (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 8), HA-IKK-γ was observed in the mouse anti-Tax precipitate (lane 5), and Tax was found in the rabbit α-HA antiserum precipitate (lane 8). These reciprocal findings are consistent with an intracellular Tax-IKK-γ complex. IKK-γ is one component of a larger holo-IKK complex (31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 33Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In view of this, the observed co-immunoprecipitation of IKK-γ and Tax does not exclude the possibility that IKK-γ is simply a passenger protein recovered as a consequence of Tax interaction with another member of the IKK complex. To challenge this possibility, we performed in vitro pull-down assays with GST-IKK-γ and MBP-Tax purified fromE. coli. In agreement with a direct contact between Tax and IKK-γ, Fig. 1 B verified that MBP-Tax bound to GST-IKK-γ (lane 4) but not to GST alone (lane 2). To confirm the association between Tax and IKK-γ within a eukaryotic cell, we checked for interactions in yeast (Fig. 1 C). When BD-Tax was co-expressed in yeast with AD-IKK-γ, we observed that this pair (Fig. 1 C, column 4) conferred >20-fold stimulation over the background β-galactosidase activity induced by each plasmid singularly (Fig. 1 C, columns 1 and2). The interaction measured for Tax and IKK-γ (Fig.1 C, column 4) is comparable with the previously characterized binding between Tax and HsMAD1 (Fig. 1 C,column 6, and Ref. 10Jin D.-Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.-T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Because no IKK homologs have been identified in the complete sequence of the yeast genome, we are reassured that the observed results are unlikely to be consequences of bridging fortuitously supplied by yeast IKKs. Hence, the GST pull-down assays and the yeast two-hybrid results collectively support a direct interaction between Tax and IKK-γ. Tax activates NF-κB (14Ballard D.W. Bohnlein E. Lowenthal J.W.

Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the exact mechanisms for this activation are not fully understood. Based on the above observation, we next asked whether binding of IKK-γ to Tax correlates functionally with Tax activation of NF-κB. Previously, we have constructed and characterized 47 Tax point mutants (16Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypes of two mutants, Tax S258A and Tax L320G, distinguish clearly between activity through the cellular CREB/ATFversus the NF-κB pathways. Thus, Tax S258A activates CREB/ATF but not NF-κB; whereas Tax L320G activates NF-κB but not CREB/ATF (3Rosin O. Koch C. Schmitt I. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. Grassmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6698-6703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used these two mutants to clarify the significance of Tax-IKK-γ interaction for NF-κB activation. HeLa cells were separately co-transfected with pHAγ and pIE vector (Fig. 2, lane 1), pHAγ and pIEX (Tax wild type; lane 2), pHAγ and pIEX S258A (lane 3), or pHAγ and pIEX L320G (lane 4). The equivalent expression of Tax and Tax mutants was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). In parallel, nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity and cytoplasmic IKK activity associated with Tax were assessed by EMSA (Fig. 2 B) and in vitro kinase assay (IKK act.; Fig. 2 C), respectively. Consistent with previous findings (16Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tax L320G activated NF-κB and IKK in a manner similar to wild type Tax (Fig. 2, B and C, comparelanes 4 with lanes 2). By contrast, Tax S258A was defective for this activation (Fig. 2, B and C, compare lanes 3 to lanes 1 and 2). Concordantly, anti-Tax serum (α-Tax; Fig. 2 D) co-immunoprecipitated IKK-β (as detected by immunoblotting with α-IKK-β serum) from cells that expressed Tax or Tax L320G (Fig.2 D, lanes 2 and 4), but not from cells that expressed Tax S258A (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). In the same immunoprecipitations, we also found that Tax or Tax L320G but not Tax S258A associated with HA-IKK-γ (Fig. 2 E). Considered together, these findings correlated Tax/Tax mutant binding to IKK-γ (Fig. 2 E) with nuclear NF-κB activity (Fig.2B), IκB-α phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C), and co-immunoprecipitation with IKK-β (Fig. 2 D). Data presented here and elsewhere are compatible with the following: (a) direct binding of Tax to IKK-γ (Fig. 1); (b) direct/indirect association of Tax with IKK-α and/or IKK-β (Fig. 2 D and Ref. 34Chu Z.-L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); and (c) a Tax-induced increase in IKK activity (Fig.2 C and Refs. 34Chu Z.-L. DiDonato J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Others have shown that IKK-γ can bind IKK-β directly (31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and associates with IKK-α in vivo (33Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, one cannot formally distinguish between a model in which Tax contacts all three IKK-proteins (IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ; Fig.3 A) equally versusanother model in which Tax contacts only IKK-γ, which then intermediates a signal to IKK-α and IKK-β (Fig. 3 B). To define better the details of protein-protein contact, we performed modified protein hybrid assays in yeast (Fig. 3 C). First we sought to determine whether there was a direct contact of Tax with either IKK-α or IKK-β. We co-expressed either BD-Tax and AD-IKK-α (Fig. 3 C, column 2) or BD-Tax and AD-IKK-β (Fig. 3 C, column 3) in yeast. Neither pair showed any increased reporter activity over the background level observed with BD-Tax alone (Fig. 3 C, column 1). By contrast, yeast transformants that co-expressed BD-Tax and AD-IKK-γ showed an activity >10-fold over background (Fig. 3 C, comparecolumn 4 with column 1). These results are most simply interpreted by a direct Tax interaction with IKK-γ but not with IKK-α nor IKK-β (Fig. 3 B). That IKK-γ adapts Tax to either IKK-α or IKK-β is supported by further functional evidence. Thus, if one co-expresses three proteins simultaneously in yeast, either a nonfused IKK-γ with BD-Tax and AD-IKK-α (Fig. 3 C, column 5) or a nonfused IKK-γ with BD-Tax and AD-IKK-β (Fig. 3 C, column 6), then >5-fold IKK-γ-dependent increases in reporter activity are measured (Fig. 3 C, comparecolumns 5 and 6 with columns 1–3). This role for unfused IKK-γ in reconstructing BD-Tax and AD-IKK-α/AD-IKK-β activity is fully consistent with a model in which IKK-γ contacts IKK-α, IKK-β, and Tax independently while bridging a functional interaction between Tax and either IKK-α or IKK-β (Fig. 3 B). Thus, for Tax oncoprotein signaling, IKK-γ is positioned upstream of IKK-α/IKK-β activation and IκB-α phosphorylation. The model deduced from results in yeast can be further tested in mammalian cells. Indeed, if IKK-γ represents an upstream adapter whereas IKK-α/IKK-β represent downstream effectors, then one prediction is that a dominant negative (DN) form of the latter would repress activity from the former. When overexpressed in HeLa cells, IKK-γ conferred a 4-fold activation of an NF-κB-dependent reporter (Fig. 3 D, comparecolumn 2 with column 1). Notably, this activation was abrogated by co-expression of DN mutants of either IKK-α or IKK-β (Fig. 3 D, columns 3–6). We observed that compared with DN IKK-β (Fig. 3 C, columns 5 and6), a higher dosage of DN IKK-α is required for the inhibition of IKK-γ-mediated activation (columns 3 and4). This might be explained by the intrinsic differences in specific kinase-activity for IKK-α and IKK-β (27Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previously, a C-terminal truncated form of IKK-γ (IKK-γΔC) has been described as a DN inhibitor of IKK-γ function (33Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). We used a similarly constructed IKK-γΔC mutant to explore the role of IKK-γ in Tax activation of NF-κB. In HeLa and Jurkat cells, expression of wild type IKK-γ enhanced Tax activation of an NF-κB-dependent reporter (Fig.4, compare group 3 withgroup 2). In contrast, activation by Tax was progressively diminished with increased expression of IKK-γΔC (Fig. 4,groups 4–6, compared with group 2), consistent with a DN inhibition of function. This finding agrees with the demonstration that a genetic defect in IKK-γ led to loss of responsiveness to several NF-κB-activating stimuli including Tax (31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Two salient points emerge from the current work. The first is the unexpected finding of IKK-γ as a direct Tax-binding factor. Previously, several studies have shown an association of Tax with IKK complex (34Chu Z.-L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 35Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Grant M. Connelly M.A. Hambor J.E.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the exact details were not defined. We now show that the functional ability of Tax to activate IKK-α/IKK-β is unlikely to stem from immediate contact but occurs indirectly through binding between Tax and IKK-γ. The second instructive point from this work is that IKK-γ, previously shown to be essential for IKK-α/IKK-β activation of NF-κB (31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F.

Although our work does not directly address how Tax activates IKK-α/IKK-β, the finding that Tax binds IKK-γ but not IKK-α/IKK-β ascribes physical recruitment of Tax into the holo-IKK complex to the functional adapter function suggested for IKK-γ. IKK-γ-tethered Tax protein is further expected to bring Tax-associated kinase(s) (e.g. MEKK-1 and/or NIK (35Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Grant M.

An obvious question raised by our results is why should oncoproteins interact via an adapter rather than directly with the IKK-α/IKK-β kinases? Although this is not completely understood, one suggestive explanation is provoked by our recent finding that the human gene for IKK-γ localizes on the X chromosome (40Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 91-96Google Scholar). If IKK-γ is indeed essential (as has been shown in Refs. 31Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

In the absence of evidence for such, a reasonable deduction is that many yet to be described IKK-associated proteins (another example is IKAP; Ref.32Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) might also provide adapter function. The predicted existence of many adapters could explain specificity and redundancy of signaling that cannot otherwise be easily reconciled if each of the numerously different NF-κB-activating signals all contacted directly IKK-α/IKK-β. Future studies are needed to clarify the identities of other adapters and how they function in dictating specificity of IKK activation. We thank Ko Okumura."

Zinc is an essential component of all cells. It is required for a variety of cellular activities such as metalloenzyme activity, nucleoprotein and nucleic acid structure, and transcription factor interactions. Typically, intracellular zinc is found predominantly (> 95%) bound to high molecular weight ligands such as metalloenzymes, metalloproteins, nucleoproteins, and nucleic acids. Very little zinc is available as free or loosely bound zinc, which we will refer to as “ mobile reactive zinc” (for review, see Refs. 1Reyes J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C401-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1995; 32: 557-578Google Scholar, 3Valley B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol.

The prostate gland of humans and other animals is unique in that it accumulates much higher zinc levels than any other soft tissues in the body. For detailed and extensive reviews of zinc-citrate relationships in prostate, see Refs. 4Franklin R.B. Costello L.C. Naz R.K. Prostate: Basic and Clinical Aspects.

Prostate. 1998; 35: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar. The special functions associated with the high zinc level of the prostate have not been resolved. The ability of the prostate to accumulate high zinc levels is a function of the glandular secretory epithelial cells. Our recent studies (7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with rat prostate lobes have demonstrated that the epithelial cells contain high levels of intracellular zinc, and, most importantly, contain high levels of mitochondrial zinc. The accumulation of zinc results in the inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase activity which minimizes the ability of these cells to oxidize citrate (8Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Kennedy M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28875-28881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This is an important relationship associated with the unique functional and metabolic capability of the prostate to accumulate high citrate levels. This results in a significant portion (about 30%) of the total zinc of citrate-producing prostate cells existing in a chelated form with citrate (9Larue J.P. Morfin R.F. Endocr. Res. 1984; 10: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Larue J.P. Morfin R.F. Endocr. Res. 1984; 10: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Kavanagh J.P. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1983; 69: 359-363Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is in contrast to other cells in which greater than 95% of the intracellular zinc is bound to macromolecules in an immobile form. Animal studies have revealed that the accumulation of zinc in the prostate is regulated by testosterone and prolactin (6Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1998; 35: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Rosoff B. Murphy G.P. Sandberg A.A. Karr J.P. The Prostatic Cell: Structure and Function. Alan R. Liss, New York1981: 447-457Google Scholar). In rats, both hormones increase the cellular and mitochondrial levels of zinc in lateral prostate cells; both hormones decrease the cellular and mitochondrial levels of zinc in ventral prostate cells; and neither hormone has any effect on the zinc levels of dorsal prostate cells or non-prostate cells (7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dorsal prostate and non-prostate cells are not citrate-producing cells, whereas lateral and ventral prostate cells are citrate-producing cells. This raised the important question as to which types of epithelial cell exist in the human prostate in relation to its function of producing, accumulating, and secreting extremely high levels of zinc. Moreover, it is well established that naturally occurring malignant prostate cells lose the ability to accumulate zinc. Despite these important functional and pathological relationships, virtually no information exists concerning the mechanism(s) involved in the accumulation of zinc and its regulation in human prostate epithelial cells. The present report reveals that 1) LNCaP and PC-3 cells (human malignant prostate cell lines) exhibit the capability of accumulating high zinc levels; 2) a rapid zinc uptake transport mechanism is associated with the accumulation of high zinc levels; 3) prolactin and testosterone are positive regulators of the transport mechanism; and 4) LNCaP and PC-3 cells express a hormonally regulated ZIP-type plasma membrane zinc uptake transporter. For these studies we elected to employ the human malignant cell lines LNCaP and PC-3. As presented under “Results,” both cell lines exhibit the capability of accumulating high zinc levels under thein vitro conditions employed; therefore, they are excellent models for studying the mechanisms and regulation of zinc accumulation. Moreover, LNCaP cells exhibit the characteristics of citrate-producing cells with a limiting m-aconitase, whereas PC-3 cells are citrate-oxidizing cells in which m-aconitase is not limiting (13Franklin R.B. Juang H.H. Zou J. Costello L.C. Endocr. J. 1993; 3: 603-607Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, LNCaP cells have a very low tumorigenicity compared with the highly tumorigenic PC-3 cells. Thus, comparative studies in these cell types will offer the future advantage of establishing the zinc relationships to citrate metabolism and malignancy. The conditions for culture and harvesting of the cells were the same as described previously (13Franklin R.B. Juang H.H. Zou J. Costello L.C. Endocr. J. 1993; 3: 603-607Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The culture medium was RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 1The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; HBSS, Hanks' balanced saline solution; HUCL, Human Universal cDNA Library; PRL, prolactin. Generally, at 18 h before cell harvesting, the medium was changed to RPMI 1640 without the addition of FBS to minimize any effect of unidentified components of FBS which might influence the accumulation of zinc. The harvested cells were washed and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and used in the experiments. Transfection of PC-3 cells with androgen receptor was achieved as described previously (14Juang H.H. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12629-12634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For experiments involving total zinc accumulation, the incubation medium was HBSS. Depending upon the experiment, zinc and hormones were added to the medium. After an appropriate incubation period at 37 °C, the cells were quickly centrifuged and washed with HBSS. The washed cells were then digested and prepared for atomic absorption assay of zinc as described previously (7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cellular zinc levels were calculated as ng/mg cell protein. Cell protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Zinc transport was determined by 65Zn rapid uptake by the cells. In these experiments the harvested cells (2–5 × 106) were added to microcentrifuge tubes. Generally, 200 μl of HBSS containing 65ZnCl2 was added to the microcentrifuge tubes. After the appropriate incubation period, 1.5 ml of cold stop solution (250 mm sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH = 7.2) was rapidly added to the microcentrifuge tubes followed by rapid centrifugation. The packed cells were rapidly resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold stop solution and centrifuged. The packed cells were collected in liquid scintillation mixture and 65Zn counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The following procedures were employed to determine the expression of a plasma membrane zinc uptake transporter in the prostate cells. A ZIP family of metal transporters which includes zinc transporters has been identified in plant and yeast cells (16Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 18Zhao H.

S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A putative mammalian zinc transporter (H2O615) has been identified in the Expressed Sequence Tags data base which shares remarkable homology with theArabidopsis ZIP1. ZIP1 is a plasma membrane zinc uptake transporter, and therefore was considered by us to be a prime candidate for expression in prostate cells. The partial cDNA clone (H2O615) was used to screen the Human Universal cDNA Library Array (HUCL) from the Stratagene Corporation. We identified a cDNA clone in the HUCL which hybridized, under high stringency conditions, with the EST partial clone. We designated this HUCL clone “hZIP1” (human ZIP1) which was used to determine the expression of the putative zinc uptake transporter in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The procedures for RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis for the detection of hZIP1 mRNA have been described (20Franklin R.B. Zou J. Gorski E. Yang Y.H. Costello L.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 127: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The zinc accumulation and kinetic experiments were repeated two or more times to ensure the reproducibility of the results, and all assays were run in duplicate or triplicate depending upon the volume of sample available for assay. Without exception, the standard errors within each experiment were less than 5% of the mean values presented under “Results.” Data presented as statistically significant represent ap < 0.05, although most of the statistically significant differences exhibited p < 0.01 values. The reproducibility and consistency of the results are demonstrated by the fact that no repeated experiment deviated from the typical effects presented under “Results.” In the first series of studies we had to determine if LNCaP cells and/or PC-3 cells exhibited the capability of accumulating high zinc levels, which would be representative of the unique zinc-accumulating characteristic of the human prostate. The endogenous level of cellular zinc in LNCaP and PC-3 cells and the accumulation of zinc in cells exposed to zinc added to the medium were established (TableI). The “endogenous ” level is defined as the concentration in the cells grown and maintained in unsupplemented medium with respect to zinc. We assayed the media and found that RPMI/FBS contains about 0.05 μg zinc/ml; when FBS is omitted, the RPMI medium as well as HBSS contains no detectable zinc. The mean endogenous level of zinc in LNCaP cells (248 ng/mg protein) was 51% higher than the level (164 ng/mg protein) in PC-3 cells. Throughout these studies and without exception the endogenous cellular zinc concentration of LNCaP cells was consistently higher than the corresponding zinc level of PC-3 cells. Consequently it is clear that LNCaP cells contain a significantly higher endogenous zinc level than PC-3 cells. When the harvested cells were incubated for 4 h in HBSS medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml zinc (the approximate concentration in plasma) in the form of zinc sulfate, the cellular level of zinc in LNCaP increased by 98% to 493 ng/mg protein; and PC-3 zinc levels increased 118% to 358 ng/mg protein. Thus, both LNCaP and PC-3 cells took up and accumulated zinc from the medium; however, LNCaP cells maintained significantly higher (37%) zinc levels than PC-3 cells in the presence of physiological exogenous zinc levels. In experiment 3 (Table I) we had also included (not shown) zinc measurements in squamous carcinoma cells to represent a non-prostate cell type. The zinc level of the squamous carcinoma cells was 174 ng/mg protein compared with 428 and 306 for LNCaP and PC-3 cells, respectively. Thus, the zinc level of the non-prostate cells was significantly less than the prostate cells. This correlates with the rat studies in which non-prostate cells (kidney and liver cells) contain significantly lower zinc levels than prostate cells (7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Table ITotal cellular zinc levels of LNCaP and PC-3 cellsLNCaPPC-3−Zinc+Zinc−Zinc+ZincExp. 1255 (11)561 (23)aSignificant difference between +zinc and −zinc for LNCaP and PC-3 cells.167 (8)486 (19)aSignificant difference between +zinc and −zinc for LNCaP and PC-3 cells.Exp. 2239 (10)147 (6)Exp. 3428 (20)306 (14)Exp. 4250 (11)492 (22)aSignificant difference between +zinc and −zinc for LNCaP and PC-3 cells.178 (8)283 (14)aSignificant difference between +zinc and −zinc for LNCaP and PC-3 cells.Mean ± S.E.248 (5)493 (34)aSignificant difference between +zinc and −zinc for LNCaP and PC-3 cells.164 (9)358 (64)aSignificant difference between +zinc and −zinc for LNCaP and PC-3 cells.The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS.

The harvested cells were incubated for 4 h in HBSS (−zinc) or HBSS containing 1 μg zinc/ml (+zinc). The values are the means (±S.E.) expressed as ng of zinc/mg of cell protein. We then determined the effects of prolactin and testosterone treatment of the cells on zinc accumulation (TableII). In these experiments the harvested cells were incubated for 4 h in HBSS medium containing 1 μg/ml zinc and 30 nm prolactin, 10 nm testosterone, or vehicle (control). With LNCaP cells, zinc accumulation was increased significantly by both testosterone (+51%) and prolactin (+37%). With PC-3 cells, zinc accumulation was increased significantly by prolactin (+40%), but testosterone had no significant effect. The absence of an effect of testosterone on PC-3 cells might be expected because these cells do not contain androgen receptor; therefore we determined the effect of testosterone on PC-3 cells that were transfected with androgen receptor (Table III). Testosterone treatment increased the accumulation of zinc in the transfected cells by 32% but had no effect on the nontransfected PC-3 cells. Moreover, the zinc levels of untreated transfected and nontransfected cells were the same, so transfection alone had no effect on zinc accumulation. The transfection result is also important because it indicates that the testosterone effect is mediated via a gene-regulated mechanism. Consequently the effect of actinomycin on the hormonal stimulation of zinc accumulation was determined (Table II). With LNCaP cells actinomycin completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of both prolactin and testosterone. With PC-3 cells actinomycin inhibited the effect of prolactin. Because the PC-3 cells were not transfected, testosterone had no effect on zinc accumulation, and actinomycin had no effect. The results indicate that the stimulatory effects of prolactin and testosterone on zinc accumulation involve some aspect of gene expression. Neither testosterone nor prolactin treatment had any effect on the zinc levels of squamous carcinoma cells cells (results not shown); therefore the hormonal effects on the prostate cells exhibit cell specificity.Table IIEffects of prolactin and testosterone on zinc accumulation in LNCaP and PC-3 cellsLNCaPPC-3Cont.+PRL+Test.Cont.+PRL+Test.−Act.428 (21)586 (29)aSignificant difference versus control.650 (32)aSignificant difference versus control.306 (14)429 (18)aSignificant difference versus control.334 (13)+Act.428 (24)450 (22)458 (19)306 (12)309 (12)309 (11)Cells were incubated in HBSS containing 1 μg/ml zinc plus 30 nm prolactin or 10 nm testosterone or vehicle (control), with or without 8 μm actinomycin.

[% change from control.] The protocol for the experiments described above involved the simultaneous incubation of harvested cells for 4 h in medium containing 1 μg/ml zinc and hormone; however it was now important to establish how early the cellular accumulation of zinc would be manifested. To eliminate the hormone induction period from the zinc uptake kinetics, PC-3 cells were pretreated with prolactin-supplemented RPMI medium overnight to maximize the prolactin effect compared with cells maintained in prolactin-free RPMI. The treated and control cells were harvested, washed, and incubated in HBSS containing 1 μg/ml zinc over a period of 60 min. The results (Fig.1) demonstrate that a prolactin-induced increase in zinc accumulation was clearly evident by 60 min. Of special importance is the magnitude of the difference in zinc accumulation by 60 min associated with the hormone effect, a difference of 109 ng/mg protein, which is a 33% increase in total zinc. This is important because less than 5% of the total cellular zinc of mammalian cells is represented by mobile (free or loosely bound) reactive zinc, which would calculate to approximately 20 ng/mg protein. Thus, the difference of 109 ng/mg protein would actually represent an increase of 5-fold in relation to mobile zinc. Obviously, the magnitude of this increase would require that the increase in zinc accumulation must have been initiated very early, probably within minutes, in order for this accumulated difference to be so large by 60 min. The above results indicated that the accumulation of zinc involved a rapid zinc uptake process. To determine this possibility we determined the rapid uptake of 65Zn in PC-3 cells. The results (Fig.2) demonstrate the existence of a rapid uptake mechanism. The zinc uptake rate was greatest within the first 30 s, and the rate declined thereafter. If this rapid uptake process were linked to the zinc accumulation in these cells, we reasoned that the rapid uptake of zinc should exist in both cell types and should be hormone-responsive as is the case with zinc accumulation. In these studies, the harvested cells were divided into two groups: a group that was pretreated by incubation for 3 h in medium containing 30 nm prolactin versus a control group containing hormone vehicle. The results (Fig.3) demonstrate that LNCaP cells also exhibited the existence of a rapid zinc transport mechanism; however, the rapid uptake rate of LNCaP cells was 3–5 times greater than PC-3 cells, which is consistent with higher zinc accumulation in LNCaP cells compared with PC-3 cells. Prolactin pretreatment markedly stimulated the rapid uptake of zinc by LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The effect is more pronounced in LNCaP cells, but in both cases the hormonal increase was about 2-fold. Moreover, the effect of the hormone appeared to involve an increase in the maximal rate of zinc uptake. This too is indicative of an effect on a zinc transporter. The prolactin-induced effect within a 3-h exposure time to prolactin is the same time frame involved in maximal prolactin stimulation of other gene-regulated metabolic activities of prostate cells (4Franklin R.B.

Cells were pretreated for 3 h with HBSS containing 30 nm prolactin, 10 nm testosterone, or vehicle. The pretreated cells were harvested and incubated in HBSS medium containing 1 μg/ml zinc labeled with 65Zn.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In plasma the total zinc concentration is about 1 μg/ml. Of this total, about 34% is firmly bound (mainly to globulin), and 66% is loosely bound, which represents the “mobile” component available for cellular uptake; therefore the rapid uptake of zinc by LNCaP and PC-3 cells over the range of 0.1–2.0 μg/ml zinc was determined (Fig.4). Rapid zinc uptake at 25 °C by LNCaP and PC-3 cells was increased as the extracellular concentration of zinc was increased up to approximately 1.0 μg of zinc/ml. The maximal uptake rate for both cells occurred at about 1.5 μg of zinc/ml. It is also apparent that the rapid uptake process was saturable, which is representative of either an active or facilitative transport process. The rapid transport rates at zinc levels representative of circulating levels of mobile zinc are about three times greater for LNCaP than PC-3 cells. This is consistent with the results described above and is consistent with the capability of LNCaP cells to accumulate higher zinc levels than PC-3 cells. Because of the low 65Zn uptake rates at this low physiological zinc concentration range, we established the diffusion of zinc into the cells. For this we compared the 65Zn rapid uptake of PC-3 cells at 4 and 25 °C (Fig. 4). At 4 °C, the rapid zinc uptake should be the result mainly of the diffusion of zinc into the cells with the zinc uptake by transport being minimal. This is evident in that zinc uptake at 4 °C was linear over the zinc concentration range and exhibited no saturation kinetics. It is readily apparent that the influx of zinc at 4 °C over this physiological range of was minimal in relation to the uptake of zinc at 25 °C. Even at extremely low zinc concentrations (e.g. 0.15–0.3 μg/ml) the rapid transport of zinc into the cells was evident. At the expected normal circulating range of diffusable zinc (0.3–0.9 μg/ml), the cellular uptake of zinc by transport was increased over the diffusion of zinc by 3-fold for PC-3 cells and by 9-fold for LNCaP cells. Collectively these studies demonstrate the existence of a rapid zinc uptake transporter in the prostate cells which is capable of functioning at zinc levels representative of plasma zinc concentrations. We are now conducting kinetic studies to establish the optimal conditions for this rapid zinc transport at which time we will be able to determine accurately the K m andV max for this transporter and the effects of hormonal stimulation on the kinetics. In all of the hormonal studies described above, 10 nmtestosterone and 30 nm prolactin were employed, which proved effective to stimulate zinc uptake in the prostate cells. The normal circulating levels of prolactin and testosterone are approximately 2 nm and 1 nm, respectively. It was important to determine if lower hormonal concentrations were effective in stimulating zinc uptake. TableIV demonstrates that prolactin as low as 0.6 nm significantly stimulated rapid zinc uptake of LNCaP cells, and a dose response occurred as the concentration of prolactin was increased. Testosterone at a concentration of 0.1 nmsignificantly increased the rapid zinc uptake, and a dose response existed. With PC-3 cells, 0.6 nm prolactin also stimulated rapid zinc uptake, while testosterone had no effect as would be expected in these androgen receptor-deficient cells. It is of interest to note that prolactin had a more pronounced effect on stimulation of the rapid uptake of zinc in PC-3 cells compared with LNCaP cells, although LNCaP cells accumulate higher zinc levels. This might be because of the possibility that the rapid transport mechanism is more active in the LNCaP cells in the absence of added hormone, which contributes to the higher endogenous zinc levels of these cells. Nevertheless, these studies demonstrate that both prolactin and testosterone at low physiological levels are effective regulators of zinc uptake in prostate cells. This is consistent with the rat studies in which the combination of in vivo and in vitroexperiments demonstrated that prolactin and testosterone are physiological regulators of zinc accumulation in prostate (7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Table IVEffects of varying concentrations of prolactin and testosterone on the rapid uptake of zinc by LNCaP and PC-3 cellsTreatmentZinc uptake rateLNCaP cellsPC-3 cellsNo hormone28 (2)9 (1)Prolactin0.6 nm35 (2) + 24%aStatistically different versus control.22 (2) + 144%aStatistically different versus control.3.0 nm44 (2) + 57%aStatistically different versus control.6.0 nm47 (2) + 69%aStatistically different versus control.Testosterone0.1 nm40 (2) + 43%aStatistically different versus control.10 (1)1.0 nm53 (3) + 88%aStatistically different versus control.Cells were pretreated for 3 h with hormone or vehicle followed by incubation for 2 min in HBSS containing 65Zn at a zinc concentration of 1 μg/ml.

The uptake rate is ng of zinc/million cells/2 min. The values are the means (±S.E.) and percent increaseversus control (no hormone). The studies described above provided compelling kinetic evidence for the existence of a zinc uptake transporter in prostate cells. The hormonal stimulation and its inhibition by actinomycin of zinc uptake led us to consider that the prostate cells likely expressed a rapid uptake transporter gene. A putative plasma membrane zinc transporter in humans has been identified based on the high homology to theArabidopsis ZIP1 transporter (16Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Grotz N. Fox T. Connmoly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar); therefore we proceeded to determine with the hZIP1 probe if this transporter might be expressed in the prostate cells. Fig.5 demonstrates that both LNCaP and PC-3 cells exhibit expression of the putative hZIP1 transporter. Moreover, the level of the putative ZIP1 mRNA was increased by treatment of both cells with prolactin, indicative of hormonal regulation of ahZIP1 transporter gene. A characteristic of someZIP transporter genes is the down-regulation by exposure of cells to high zinc levels. Fig. 5 reveals that extended exposure of PC-3 cells to zinc resulted in a decrease in the level of ZIP1 mRNA indicative of a down-regulation of gene expression. The down-regulation by zinc adds to the evidence that we were probing the expression of a zinc uptake transporter. The present studies demonstrate that the human malignant prostate cells LNCaP and PC-3 possess the ability to accumulate high zinc levels. The zinc levels of the prostate cells were significantly higher than non-prostate squamous carcinoma cells. This parallels the studies that demonstrated that rat prostate cells contained higher zinc levels than non-prostate (kidney or liver) cells (7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition fibroblast cell types reportedly contain about 0.4 fmol of zinc/cell (2Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1995; 32: 557-578Google Scholar). Estimates of the cell content of zinc in LNCaP cells are minimally (cells grown in “zinc-free” medium) about 1.0 fmol/cell, and in the presence of medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml zinc, about 2.0 fmol/cell. When treated with prolactin or testosterone, the zinc content is increased another 2–5-fold. Clearly, these cells accumulate much higher zinc levels than non-prostate cells. Moreover, in other unpublished studies we have demonstrated that when exposed to extracellular zinc, the accumulation of zinc by PC-3 cells results in the inhibition of their ability to oxidize citrate thereby causing in citrate accumulation. This demonstrates that the accumulated zinc includes a mobile reactive component that enters the mitochondria and inhibits m-aconitase activity (8Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Kennedy M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28875-28881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To protect against the toxic effects of zinc, mammalian cells generally employ defensive mechanisms that prevent the accumulation of mobile reactive zinc (3Valley B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). In contrast, and consistent with their unique function, prostate secretory epithelial cells employ mechanisms that facilitate the uptke and accumulation of zinc. The present studies demonstrate that prolactin and testosterone at physiological concentrations regulate zinc uptake and accumulation in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Studies of zinc and citrate relationships with rat prostate lobes revealed that prostate epithelial cells can be characterized as the following types: V (ventral prostate), L (lateral prostate), and D (dorsal prostate) (3Valley B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1997; 30: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An important distinguishing characteristic is the response of the cells to prolactin and testosterone in the regulation of zinc accumulation. Zinc accumulation is decreased by both hormones in ventral prostate cells, increased by both hormones in lateral prostate cells, and unaffected by either hormone in dorsal prostate and non-prostate cells. Consequently, it became important to establish which cell type(s) exists in human prostate. The present studies reveal that both LNCaP and PC-3 cells exhibit the characteristics of lateral prostate cells. This is significant because rat lateral prostate is homologous to the lateral lobes of the peripheral zone of the human prostate. This region of the prostate is the dominant region for the origin of prostate malignancy from which the LNCaP and PC-3 cells were originally derived; therefore a linkage does exist between these cell lines and rat lateral prostate cells. However a most important relationship is that naturally occurring malignant prostate cells have lost the ability to accumulate zinc, whereas the malignant cell lines exhibit the capability of accumulating zinc. It will be essential to establish the reason whyin situ malignant prostate cells do not accumulate zinc, which will lead to an understanding of the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. The present studies establish that a rapid zinc uptake transport mechanism is associated with zinc accumulation by these cells and that this transport mechanism is regulated by prolactin and by testosterone. The initial kinetic studies indicate that the rapid transport would be highly effective under the conditions reflective of circulating levels of zinc. The most likely expectation is that prostate epithelial cells possess a plasma membrane zinc transporter that permits the rapid uptake of zinc from circulation. This would be similar to the unique aspartate transporter that is involved in the accumulation of high cellular levels of aspartate in prostate cells (21Franklin R.B. Lao L. Costello L.C. Prostate. 1990; 16: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Costello L.C. Lao L. Franklin R.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 39: 515-524Google Scholar, 23Lao L. Franklin R.B. Costello L.C. Prostate. 1993; 22: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We are now proceeding with extensive kinetic studies to establish the characteristics of this zinc transport process. The fact that actinomycin completely abolished the stimulatory effects of both hormones on zinc uptake by LNCaP and PC-3 cells and that androgen receptor was required for testosterone stimulation of zinc uptake provided initial evidence that gene regulation is involved. Moreover, this is consistent with the hormonal regulation of the aspartate transporter and other citrate-related metabolic genes in prostate epithelial cells (4Franklin R.B. Costello L.C. Naz R.K. Prostate: Basic and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 115-150Google Scholar); therefore it seemed most plausible to pursue the possibility that the kinetic demonstration of the rapid uptake of zinc in the prostate cells might be the result of expression of a plasma membrane-associated zinc uptake transporter. However, little information is currently available regarding the expression of zinc uptake transporters in mammalian cells. The expression and operation of zinc transporters that export zinc out of cells and which sequester intracellular zinc into organelles have been identified in some mammalian cells (2Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1995; 32: 557-578Google Scholar, 24Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In contrast, there has been no established identification of any gene expression associated with plasma membrane zinc uptake transporters in mammalian cells. Zinc uptake transporters have been identified in plants, yeast, and other organisms that comprise the homologous ZIP family of transporter genes (16Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 18Zhao H.

Eide, personal communication. The present studies showed that the human homolog, hZIP1, is expressed in LNCaP and PC-3 cells and that the expression is hormonally regulated. This is consistent with the hormonal regulation of the cellular accumulation of zinc and the rapid zinc uptake in these cells. The present results also demonstrate that the expression of hZIP1 is down-regulated by exposure of cells to zinc, and this is characteristic of the zinc regulation of ZIP1 and other zinc uptake transporters. TheArabidopsis ZIP1 has been characterized as a plasma membrane-associated zinc uptake transporter and as a rapid zinc uptake transporter that leads to the cellular accumulation of zinc (19Grotz N. Fox T. Connmoly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Such characteristics are surprisingly similar to the zinc uptake characteristics of LNCaP and PC-3 cells identified in this study. The striking similarities between the kinetic characteristics and hormonal regulation of zinc uptake in the prostate cells and the ZIP transporter provide compelling evidence for the expression and operation of a ZIP1 homolog (hZIP1) in prostate cells. This supports the contention (16Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,19Grotz N. Fox T. Connmoly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) that ZIP family zinc transporter genes are expressed in human cells; however, we cannot yet represent conclusively that the putative hZIP1 transporter is responsible for the rapid uptake transport process that has been identified kinetically in the prostate cells. It is conceivable that more than one zinc uptake transporter, as is the case for yeast and plant cells (16Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 18Zhao H.

The results of the present study now provide the basis for further studies of the kinetic and genetic characterization of the zinc transport mechanism(s) in normal and malignant prostate cells, the mechanism of prolactin and testosterone regulation of zinc transport, the relationship of zinc accumulation in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate malignancy; they also provide a model system to study the mechanisms of zinc transport in mammalian cells in general. We express appreciation to Dr. David Eide (Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri) for valuable input concerning zinc transporter genes and zinc transport mechanisms in eukaryotic cells."

Mutations of discs large(dlg), which encodes a MAGUK in Drosophila,disrupt epithelial cell septate junctions and epithelial cell polarity and cause overgrowth of the imaginal discs (6Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). A related MAGUK, LIN-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans, is also essential in regulating cell junctions and differentiation (7Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K.

This scaffolding function is explained by the structure of MAGUK proteins, which comprise multiple protein-protein interaction domains. MAGUKs contain one or three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a region homologous to yeast guanylate kinase (GK) (1Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Although functions for the PDZ domains of MAGUKs are established, physiological roles for the GK and SH3 domains are less clear (11Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E.

Although the functional implications of MAP1A and GKAP interaction with the GK domain are uncertain, genetic screens have identified several mutations in the GK domain of MAGUKs in invertebrates (7Hoskins R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), indicating that this region is critical for gene function. Genetic studies have determined that the SH3 domains of MAGUKs also are essential (12Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar); however, the molecular functions for the SH3 domains remain elusive. SH3 domains classically mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich sequences (17Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct.

Although this function would appear to fit well with the scaffolding role for MAGUKs, binding partners for their SH3 domains are unknown. Recent studies have shown that SH3 domains in certain tyrosine kinases not only mediate protein-protein interactions, but can also regulate protein function through intramolecular interactions (20Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 21Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we now identify a specific interaction between the SH3 and GK domains within PSD-95. Binding studies with protein fragments of PSD-95 demonstrate that the SH3 and GK domains can bind intrans. However, experiments with intact PSD-95 molecules indicate that intramolecular SH3/GK binding dominates, preventing intermolecular associations. SH3/GK interactions are conserved and occur in both PSD-95 and DLG. All previously identified genetic mutations of the SH3 or GK domains in dlg disrupt the intramolecular binding, correlating the critical functional role for these domains with the SH3/GK interaction. Monoclonal antibodies to PSD-95 (clone 7E3–18; Affinity Bioreagents) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH) and polyclonal antibodies to GKAP (14Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A.

A polyclonal antiserum to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 was raised by immunizing a sheep with a GST fusion protein of amino acids 1–386 of rat PSD-95. Polyclonal antisera to the GK domain of PSD-95 were raised by injecting rabbits with a 14-mer peptide (amino acids 698–711 of PSD-95) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Polyclonal antisera to GFP were raised by injecting guinea pigs with a GST fusion of GFP. All antisera were affinity purified on Affi-Gel-10 columns charged with the immunizing antigen. For yeast two-hybrid experiments, domains of PSD-95 were amplified by PCR with primers containing endonuclease restriction sites, and PCR products were restricted with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into pGBT9 or pGAD424 (CLONTECH). All constructs were sequenced to confirm that inserted nucleotide sequences were correct. The primers for PSD-95 sequences are as follows: PSD-95 SH3 sense, 5′-CGG-GAA-CAG-CTC-ATG-AAT-3′; PSD-95 SH3 antisense, 5′-GGA-GCC-CCA-GTC-CTT-GGC-3′; PSD-95 GK sense, 5′-AAG-GCC-AAG-GAC-TGG-GGC-TCC-3′; PSD-95 GK antisense, 5′-CTA-GAG-TCT-CTC-TCG-GGC-TGG-3′; and PSD-95 GK611sense, 5′-ACC-AGC-GTC-CAG-TCT-GTG-3′. The constructs containing the W470F mutation were assembled by sequential PCR with a codon changed in both the sense and antisense primer from W = TGG to F = TTT: sense, 5′-GAA-GAG-TTT-TGG-CAA-GCA-CGG-CGG-GTG-CAC-TCC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGA-GTG-CAC-CCG-CCG-TGC-TTG-CCA-AAA-CTC-TTC-3′. The SH3 (408–560) constructs (with or without point mutations) were subcloned by excising the SH3 domain at the EcoRI site in the polylinker and the BamHI site in the GK domain from the SH3GK construct and ligating into pGBT9 atEcoRI/BamHI. The constructs containing the SH3 L460P mutation were made by inverse PCR using SAP90:pGEX4T-1 as a template with the following primers: sense, 5′-CAT-GTC-ATC-GAT-GCT-GGT-GAC-GAA-GAG-TGG-TGG-CAA-GCA-3′; and antisense, 5′-ACC-AGC-ATC-GAT-GAC-ATG-AGG-CAC-ATC-CCC-GAA-GCG-GAA-3′. Yeast two-hybrid constructs were then made by using this plasmid as a template for the 95SH3 sense and antisense primers described above. GKΔN109 was constructed by subcloning the DNA fragment between theBamHI site in the PSD-95 GK domain and the BamHI site in the polylinker into the BamHI site in pGBT9. Sequences from DLG, LIN-2, GKAP, and nNOS were also amplified by PCR with primers containing endonuclease restriction sites, restricted with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into pGBT9 or pGAD424. The primers for DLG sequences are as follows: DLG GK sense, 5′-GCA-GCT-AAT-AAT-AAT-CGT-GAT-AAG-3′; DLG GK antisense, 5′-TCA-TAG-AGA-TTC-CTT-GGA-AGG-3′; DLG SH3 sense, 5′-AAA-CAA-CAG-GCT-GCC-CTC-3′; and DLG SH3 antisense, 5′-CTA-CTT-ATC-CAG-ATT-ATT-ATT-AGC-TGC-3′. The primers for LIN-2 sequences are as follows: LIN-2 SH3 sense, 5′-GAT-GCT-CGA-GGT-CAA-GTC-3′; LIN-2 SH3 antisense, 5′-CTA-GAA-CCA-CAT-GCA-GTG-AGT-3′; LIN-2 GK sense, 5′-ACT-CAC-TGC-ATG-TGG-TTC-3′; and LIN-2 GK antisense, 5′-TCA-GTA-GAC-CCA-AGT-GAC-TGG-3′. The primers for GKAP sequences are as follows: GKAP sense, 5′-ATG-ATC-GAC-CTT-TTT-AAG-GCT-3′; and GKAP antisense, 5′-CTG-TAT-CCC-AAT-AGA-TAG-GCA-3′. The nNOS and PSD-95 PDZ1–3 constructs were previously described (4Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). The C-terminal GFP fusion constructs were subcloned by ligating a PCR-amplified sequence of PSD-95 SH3 or GK (with the primers described above) into EGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). Yeast co-transformation, colony lift β-galactosidase filter assays, and ONPG liquid culture assays were done as described in the Matchmaker Library protocol (CLONTECH) with the yeast strain HF7c or SFY526. Growth on His(−) was tested by streaking several individual colonies to −LWH plates. Positives were scored by the presence of individual colonies after 3 days at 30 °C. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-C2 constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies). Transfections were done in six-well culture plates with cells at 50–80% confluence. Two μg of plasmid DNA were used for each transfection. Six h after transformation, the media was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-21 plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. To test for interactions between SH3 and GK domains in vitro, GST fusion proteins were incubated with HEK cell extracts expressing GFP fusion proteins. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (23Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Extracts from transfected HEK 293 cells were prepared from a six-well plate. Cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped from the substrate into resuspension buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA. Cells were sheared with 10 passes through a 25-gauge needle. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, and Triton X-100 was added to 1%. The solution was gently agitated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The soluble fraction of the extracts was removed to new tubes. Three μg of GST protein coupled to Sepharose beads was added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. The protein-coupled GST beads were pelleted by centrifugation and then washed 5 times with 1 ml of resuspension buffer. The beads were resuspended in 5× protein loading buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 12% acrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (4Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Adult rat brain was homogenized in 20 volumes of resuspension buffer. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g to remove the soluble fraction, membranes were solubilized for 30 min in resuspension buffer + 0.5% Triton (Triton Extracts) or + 0.2% SDS (SDS extracts). Triton X-100 was then added to 1% to the SDS extracts to sequester the ionic detergent. Solubilized proteins were recovered by centrifuging the extracts at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed by first adding the appropriate antibody, and then, after a 60-min incubation at 4 °C, adding 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose to precipitate the antibodies. The protein G beads were then washed five times with resuspension buffer and immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered in 5× protein loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. Because SH3 domains can regulate protein function through intramolecular interactions (20Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 21Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we determined whether the SH3 domain of PSD-95 might associate with other domains from the protein. We first evaluated this possibility using the yeast two-hybrid system. Yeast strains HF7c and SFY526 were transformed with appropriate GAL4-fusion expression vectors encoding the SH3 domain of PSD-95 together with either the PDZ, SH3, or GK domains. Using both an assay for β-galactosidase activity and an assay for growth on His(−) plates, we found that the SH3 domain specifically interacts with the GK domain and that the SH3 domain does not interact with the PDZ or SH3 domains (Fig. 1 A). A quantitative liquid culture assay indicated that this association is robust and appears similar in magnitude to the PSD-95 PDZ domain interaction with the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (4Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To verify that the SH3/GK interaction is authentic, we also evaluated binding of protein fragments in vitro. We found that the SH3 domain of PSD-95 fused to GFP, expressed in HEK 293 cells, binds specifically to a bacterial GST fusion protein of the GK domain. Similarly, the GK domain of PSD-95, expressed in HEK cells, interacts with a GST-SH3 fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). The SH3/GK interaction identified here is atypical because the GK domain lacks a P-X-X-P motif that typically binds to SH3 domains (17Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct.

We therefore characterized the structural requirements within the GK domain that are essential for interaction. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that an intact GK domain is required to bind the SH3 domain. The GK domain in PSD-95 comprises amino acids 534–712 (1Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with constructs encoding GK domains that were missing 36 amino acids from the N terminus or 13 amino acids from the C terminus do not turn blue in β-galactosidase assays nor do they form colonies on synthetic media plates lacking histidine (Table I).Table IStructural requirements for the PSD-95 SH3/GK domain interactionGal4 DNA binding hybridGal4 activation hybridβ-Galactosidase activityGrowthInteractions between PSD-95 SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domain deletionsGK-(503–724)SH3-(408–509)+++GKΔN57-(560–724)SH3-(408–509)−−GKΔN109-(611–724)SH3-(408–509)−−GKΔC25-(503–699)SH3-(408–509)−−Interactions between PSD-95 SH3 point mutants and the guanylate kinase-like domainGK-(503–724)SH3 L460P-(408–509)−−SH3 L460P-(408–560)GK-(503–724)−−SH3 W470F-(408–560)GK-(503–724)++SH3-(408–560)GK-(503–724)+++Yeast SFY526 and HF7c cells were co-transformed with expression vectors encoding various GAL4 binding domain and GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins.

Growth on His(−) plates was positive if yeast streaked to −LWH plates produced isolated colonies within 3 days. We also characterized features of the SH3 domain that mediate GK domain binding. Three-dimensional structures of SH3 domains are well characterized and are conserved (18Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Trp-470 of PSD-95 corresponds to an amino acid in other SH3 domains that mediates interaction with proline-containing peptides (23Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Mutation of this tryptophan to phenylalanine typically disrupts SH3/proline-containing peptide interactions without compromising the SH3 domain structure (23Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), but we found it does not abolish SH3/GK binding (Table I). One allele ofdlg, a Drosophila MAGUK, contains a point mutation that changes a conserved leucine in the SH3 domain to proline (16Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We introduced the corresponding mutation, L460P, into the PSD-95 SH3 domain constructs and found it disrupts the SH3/GK domain interaction (Table I). We next asked whether the SH3/GK domain interaction found in PSD-95 is unique or is conserved in other MAGUK proteins. We tested for SH3/GK binding in both Drosophila DLG (6Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), which is highly homologous to PSD-95, and in C. elegans LIN-2 (7Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development. 1996; 122: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a MAGUK that is more distantly related. We found that the SH3 domain from DLG interacts with its GK domain but that the SH3 and GK domains from LIN-2 do not (Fig. 2). Furthermore, SH3/GK domain binding was detected in SH3 and GK combinations between PSD-95 and DLG (Fig. 2). Our inability to detect SH3/GK interactions with the protein domains from LIN-2 either reflects the lower affinity for this interaction within LIN-2 or suggests that this interaction is not a general feature of more distantly related MAGUK proteins. Intermolecular SH3/GK domain binding could mediate multimerization of MAGUKs, whereas intramolecular SH3/GK binding could mediate a regulatory interaction. To determine which mode of binding predominates, we evaluated binding of isolated SH3 or GK domains to intact PSD-95 in vitro. We found that GST fusions of either the SH3 or GK domain alone did not bind to a full-length PSD-95-GFP fusion expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig.3 B). Further, in yeast two-hybrid experiments, no binding was detected between isolated SH3 or GK domains and SH3GK (Fig. 3 A). This absence of binding may indicate that intramolecular SH3/GK binding in intact PSD-95 molecules is highly favored and prevents intermolecular associations. This interpretation predicts that introducing mutations that disrupt the intramolecular binding would facilitate intermolecular binding of isolated SH3 or GK domains to intact PSD-95 or SH3GK. Indeed, we found that an isolated GK domain interacts only with an SH3GK construct that contains a C-terminal GK domain truncation (Fig. 3 A). We also determined, by yeast two-hybrid analysis and with GST-fusion protein binding experiments, that an isolated SH3 domain can bind full-length PSD-95 or SH3GK constructs that contain a disruptive L460P point mutation in the SH3 domain (Fig. 3 B). This latter interaction is specific because an SH3GK construct with both the L460P SH3 mutation and a truncation of the GK domain does not bind to SH3 (Fig. 3 B) As an additional tool to evaluate the SH3/GK domain interaction in PSD-95 protein extracted from brain, we generated an antibody to the last 14 amino acids of the GK domain (amino acids 698–711). We find that this antibody immunoprecipitates PSD-95 from whole brain homogenates solubilized with 0.2% SDS (SDS extracts) but does not immunoprecipitate PSD-95 from brain homogenates solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 alone (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, another antibody directed to the PDZ domains immunoprecipitates PSD-95 equally from both the SDS and Triton extracts (Fig. 4 A). The selective immunoprecipitation of PSD-95 by the GK domain antibody in SDS extracts may indicate that the antibody only interacts with a denatured epitope. Alternatively, the antigenic epitope of the GK domain may not be accessible to the antibody under native conditions because of intermolecular protein interactions, such as with the GKAPs or MAP1A, or because of intramolecular interactions, such as with the SH3 domain. To help distinguish between these possibilities, we evaluated immunoprecipitation of PSD-95, SH3GK-GFP, or GK-GFP expressed in HEK 293 cells, which lack GKAPs and MAP1A. The GK antibody avidly immunoprecipitates GK-GFP in both SDS and Triton extracts (Fig.4 B), indicating that the GK antibody indeed can react with the GK domain in Triton extracts. However, we find that the transfected PSD-95 proteins containing both the SH3 and GK domains immunoprecipitate with the GK antibody only from SDS extracts and not from extracts solubilized with Triton X-100 alone (Fig. 4 C). These results would seem to indicate that, under native conditions, the SH3 domain from PSD-95 masks the GK domain epitope. We next repeated these transfection/immunoprecipitation experiments with constructs that contained the SH3 L460P point mutation, which disrupts SH3/GK binding. Remarkably, introduction of this SH3 domain mutation into constructs containing the SH3 and GK domains restores antigenic accessibility of the GK domain in Triton extracts (Fig. 4 C). Taken together with other data in this study, the simplest model consistent with these results is that intramolecular binding between the SH3 and GK domains of PSD-95 is sensitive to SDS denaturation and that the SH3/GK interaction blocks antigenic access of the GK domain antibody. This parsimonious interpretation would indicate that the intramolecular SH3/GK domain interaction occurs to a significant extent within PSD-95 from both brain and heterologous cells. To determine whether the SH3 domain interaction might regulate GK binding to GKAP or MAP1A, we evaluated the association of wild-type and mutant PSD-95 with GKAP. We co-transfected HEK cells with expression constructs encoding GKAP (13Takeuchi M. Hatam Y. Kirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) together with either full-length PSD-95, GFP-SH3GK, or with PSD-95 or GFP-SH3GK constructs containing the SH3 L460P mutation, which disrupts SH3/GK binding. In extracts from these cells, we immunoprecipitated PSD-95 and evaluated association of GKAP (Fig. 5). We found that GKAP co-immunoprecipitates equally with all these PSD-95 constructs, indicating that SH3/GK binding does not influence GK binding activity. This work identifies a specific intramolecular association between the SH3 and GK domains within PSD-95 and shows that this interaction is conserved in other MAGUK proteins. Although isolated SH3 and GK domains of PSD-95 can bind one another in trans, this intermolecular interaction is not detected between intact PSD-95 molecules or fusion proteins that contain both the SH3 and GK domain. Instead, an intramolecular SH3/GK association appears to predominate within full-length PSD-95 molecules, suggesting a regulatory rather than scaffolding role for the interaction. Several lines of evidence suggest that the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains identified here is likely to play a physiological role in MAGUK function. First, SH3/GK binding is conserved even between the distantly related MAGUK proteins PSD-95 and DLG. Second, genetically identified mutations of the SH3 and GK domains in dlg disrupt the intramolecular SH3/GK association. A point mutation in the SH3 domain that disrupts SH3/GK binding was identified by its strong phenotype (16Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Conversely, C-terminal GK domain truncations that resemble genetic mutations of dlgdisrupt the SH3 domain interaction. These truncations of DLG inDrosophila are lethal in the absence of maternal contribution (16Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It is also intriguing that certain genetic mutants of the SH3 and GK domains of dlg complement one another in mixed heterozygous flies, negating the lethality of the recessive mutations (16Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a MAGUK protein with a mutant SH3 domain will bind in trans to a MAGUK with a GK domain mutation. If such a mixed bimolecular complex restores dlgfunction, this could explain the genetic complementation that has been observed. The SH3 domain interactions described here are atypical. SH3 domains have classically been shown to interact with proline-containing motifs that contain the consensus sequence P-X-X-P (17Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This binding model cannot explain the SH3/GK interactions, as GK domains lack a P-X-X-P motif. Moreover, mutation of the SH3 domain of PSD-95 at the conserved Trp-470 that normally mediates interaction with proline-containing peptides (23Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) does not disrupt SH3/GK binding. Rather than the SH3 domain recognizing a short peptide sequence within the GK domain, our data suggest that SH3/GK binding represents a bi-domain interaction and requires proper folding of both intact motifs. The intramolecular interactions described here are reminiscent of recent studies showing that intramolecular SH3 domain associations mediate autoinhibition of Src and Tec family tyrosine kinases (20Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 21Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the Src family kinase, Hck, the SH3 motif binds to and blocks the catalytic activity of the adjacent tyrosine kinase domain. This intramolecular SH3 domain interaction within Hck is displaced, and tyrosine kinase activity is restored when the Hck SH3 domain binds to an appropriate protein ligand in trans. By analogy, the intramolecular SH3 domain interaction within PSD-95 may regulate the GK domain. While we find that this interaction does not alter GK domain binding to either GKAP (Fig. 5) or MAP1A (data not shown), the SH3 domain may regulate an as yet unidentified catalytic activity of the GK domain. It is also possible that the intramolecular SH3/GK interaction mediates functional interactions between the SH3 domain and other unknown proteins, as studies with DLG in Drosophila have suggested that the GK domain may act as a negative regulator of DLG in controlling cell proliferation (12Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PDZ domains within PSD-95 can negatively regulate GK binding activity (15Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), though the PDZ domains themselves do not bind to GK (15Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the SH3 domain is interposed between the PDZ and GK domains, the SH3/GK interaction described here could play a role in autoinhibition of GK binding by PDZ domains. Alternatively, while our data best support a model in which intramolecular associations between the SH3 and GK domains predominate, it does not eliminate the possibility that other factors present in vivo may facilitate intermolecular interactions that could contribute to the scaffolding functions of PSD-95. We thank Dr. Morgan Sheng for the GKAP antibody and expression constructs and Dr. Wendell Lim for designing the SH3 domain mutants."

CCR5, a receptor for chemokines MIP-1α (LD78α), MIP-1β, RANTES, and MCP2, is of particular importancein vivo as polymorphisms in this gene affect HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS. Moreover, the CCR5 ligands can prevent HIV entry through this receptor and likely contribute to the control of HIV infection. Here we show that a non-allelic isoform of human MIP-1α (LD78α), termed LD78β or MIP-1αP, has enhanced receptor binding affinities to CCR5 (∼6-fold) and the promiscuous β-chemokine receptor, D6 (∼15–20-fold). We demonstrate that a proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1αP is responsible for this enhanced activity. Moreover, MIP-1αP is by far the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date, and importantly, displays markedly higher HIV1 suppressive activity than all other human MIP-1α isoforms examined. In addition, while RANTES has been described as the most potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry, MIP-1αP was as potent as, if not more potent than, RANTES in HIV-1 suppressive assays. This property suggests that MIP-1αP may be of importance in controlling viral spread in HIV-infected individuals.

While an in vivo role for many of these receptors has yet to be demonstrated in the context of HIV infection, CCR5, a receptor for RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), MCP2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-2), and MIP-1α and -β (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and -1β) appears to be critical in HIV pathogenesis as individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for a CCR5 null mutation are relatively resistant to HIV infection and progression to AIDS, respectively (9Samson M.

Thus, while the murine and human forms of the promiscuous β-chemokine receptor D6 (23Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, murine CCR5 binds murine MIP-1α with high affinity but does not recognize the putative human homologue. The basis for this marked selectivity has not previously been addressed, however, it is notable that, while the murine genome contains only one copy of MIP-1α and -β, in humans these two genes have been duplicated and mutated to produce two different non-allelic isoforms which still retain >90% homology (25Irving S.G.

For MIP-1α, these have been called LD78α and -β, with LD78α being the predominant experimentally used isoform and the one shown to interact poorly with the cloned chemokine receptors. Both forms are transcribed (26Nakao M. Nomiyama H. Shimada K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3646-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and can be secreted from mammalian cells (6Cocchi F.

Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, consideration of differences in the putative signal sequences of the two LD78 isoforms by predictive algorithms,2 suggests that there is variation in the site of signal peptidase cleavage between the two isoforms during secretion, and that LD78α is in fact produced without the four anticipated amino-terminal amino acids, ASLA (Fig. 1). Indeed, human MIP-1α has been shown to be produced naturally by CD8+ T cells as a −4 variant with the amino-terminal sequence ADTPT (6Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar,27Bertini R. Luini W. Sozzani S. Bottazzi B. Ruggiero P. Boraschi D. Saggioro D. Chieco-Bianchi L. Proost P. VanDamme J. Mantovani A. AIDS Res. & Hum. Ret. 1995; 11: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have worked extensively with the LD78β isoform (21Dunlop D.J. Wright E.G. Lorimore S. Graham G.J. Holyoake T.L. Kerr D.J. Wolpe S.D. Pragnell I.B. Blood. 1992; 79: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Graham G.J. Freshney M.G. Donaldson D. Pragnell I.B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and numerous amino-terminal sequencing exercises have consistently revealed a “full-length” amino terminus APLAADTPT. Using full-length and truncated variants of LD78α and -β, we show here that the murine/human MIP-1α binding discrepancies are resolved by studying the properties of LD78β which consistently behaves more like murine MIP-1α than does LD78α. It appears therefore that LD78β more accurately represents the functional human homologue of murine MIP-1α and that LD78α should be considered to be a related but functional distinct chemokine. Importantly, we also show that LD78β is the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date. Furthermore, LD78β exhibits a much greater ability to antagonize HIV entry through CCR5 than other forms of human MIP-1α. In fact, LD78β is consistently better at HIV1 antagonism than RANTES, previously described as the most potent CCR5-dependant HIV1 entry inhibitor. We demonstrate that the enhanced activity of LD78β is solely due to the presence of a proline residue at position 2 of the mature protein. We propose renaming LD78α and -β to MIP-1αS and MIP-1αP, respectively, to reflect the importance of this residue in the functional differences between these two proteins. MIP-1αS is “human MIP-1α” purchased from Peprotech, London, United Kingdom. It is derived from the LD78α cDNA and has the amino-terminal sequence of ASLAADTPT. MIP-1αS-4 is human MIP-1α purchased from R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK. It is derived from the LD78α cDNA and starts as ADTPT. MIP-1αP is derived from the LD78β cDNA and was prepared as described previously (28Graham G.J. Freshney M.G. Donaldson D. Pragnell I.B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed APLAADTPT at the amino-terminal. MIP-1αP-4 was produced from a modified LD78β cDNA in bacteria 3A. N. Parker, G. J. Graham, A. R. Sim, S. C. Clark, and I. B. Pragnell, manuscript in preparation. with the amino terminus of ADTPT. CHO cells expressing chemokine receptors were prepared, and binding assays performed, as outlined previously (23Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In short, binding assays were performed using125I-labeled murine MIP-1α at a constant concentration of 600 pm (for D6), 3 nm (for CCR1), or 9 nm (for CCR5), while varying the concentration of unlabeled human MIP-1α competitor protein. Remaining radioactivity bound after 90 min, and three ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline washes, was determined. Each point was done in triplicate, the average taken, and converted into a percentage of radioactivity bound in the absence of any unlabeled competitor chemokine. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND software (29Munson P.J. Robard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells stably expressing human receptors CCR1 and CCR5 were derived by subcloning the cDNAs into pcDNA3 and transfection using Transfectam (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's methods. Stably transfected cells were selected in 0.8 mg/ml G418. To detect ligand-induced calcium ion fluxes, cells were loaded with Fura-2-AM, then, ∼6 × 106 cells were incubated at 37 °C in a continuously stirred cuvette in a Perkin-Elmer LS50 Spectrometer (340 nm (λex); 500 nm (λem)) and fluorescence emission recorded every 100 ms. After 2 min, ligand was added to a defined concentration and fluorescence recorded every 100 ms for a further 2 min. To control for day-to-day experimental variation, a full dose-response curve for LD78β was performed each time a different ligand was tested. 5 × 104 CEMx174-CCR5 cells, pretreated with chemokine for 30 min, were incubated for 4 h with luciferase virus (5 ng of p24), pseudotyped by either JR.FL or ADA according to a previously described protocol (17Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M. DiMarzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B. Peiper S.C. Schall T.J. Littman D.R. Landau N.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Medium was then changed and the luciferase activity measured 3 to 5 days post-infection. The extent of inhibition of HIV entry was determined by comparing luciferase activity of chemokine-treated cells, with untreated cells. For studies with the replication-competent SF162 virus, protocols were similar to those described elsewhere (30Connor R.I. Kuan Chen B. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Briefly, CEMx174-CCR5 cells, or PHA/IL-2-activated PBMC from HIV1 seronegative donors, were pretreated with chemokine then infected overnight at 37 °C with SF162 virus (m.o.i. ∼0.04). The medium was then changed, and the p24 concentration subsequently determined after 5 days at 37 °C using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Percentage inhibition of HIV entry was calculated relative to chemokine-untreated controls. Analysis of the dose-response relationship between the MIP-1α isoforms and other chemokines in binding, calcium flux, and HIV suppressive assays were tested by “log likelihood” methodology essentially as described previously (31Volund A. Biometrics. 1978; 34: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our recent studies of MIP-1α receptors (23Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Yang J. Landau N.R. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that revealed discrepancies between the binding of murine and human MIP-1α, we used the LD78α isoform of human MIP-1α with the amino acids ASLAADTPT at the amino terminus (Fig. 1). The close sequence similarity between LD78α and murine MIP-1α led us to examine the possible amino acid residues that may be responsible for the discriminatory binding of these ligands. The only consistent feature present in the mCCR5 and hD6 ligands but absent in human LD78α is a proline residue at position 2 of the mature protein (Fig.1). The serine residue at position 2 of the LD78α we have used may therefore be preventing optimal receptor interaction. The alternative human MIP-1α isoform, LD78β, however, does have a proline residue in position 2, with two reciprocal serine/glycine swaps in the region between cysteines 3 and 4 being the only other differences between the LD78α and -β proteins (Fig. 1) (25Irving S.G. Zipfel P.F. Balke J. McBride O.W. Morton C.C. Burd P.R. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Nakao M. Nomiyama H. Shimada K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3646-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To simplify the nomenclature, and emphasize the serine/proline residue difference at position 2 in the two isoforms, we henceforth refer to LD78α and -β as MIP-1αS and MIP-1αP, respectively. To test the importance of these isoform differences, we have now compared the ability of MIP-1αP and MIP-1αS to interact with known murine MIP-1α receptors stably expressed on CHO cells (Table I). In addition, we have tested the −4 presumed naturally secreted form of MIP-1αS (see Introduction) as well as the corresponding −4 variant of MIP-1αP to examine the impact of this truncation on receptor interactions. Our results demonstrate (Table I) that in contrast to MIP-1αS and MIP-1αS-4 (K d values of 136 and 133 nm, respectively), MIP-1αP binds with high affinity to murine CCR5 (K d of 1.1 nm). The importance, for this high affinity binding, of the proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1αP is indicated by the fact that MIP-1αP-4 behaves like MIP-1αS and MIP-1αS-4 on murine CCR5 (K d 127 nm). Murine MIP-1α, which carries a proline residue at position 2 of the mature protein, binds to murine CCR5 in a manner similar to that seen with MIP-1αP, suggesting that this human variant behaves more like the murine MIP-1α on CCR5 than does the more common MIP-1αS isoform.Table IMIP-1αP shows high affinity binding to murine CCR5 and D6, but not CCR1MIP-1αSMIP-1αS-4MIP-1αPMIP-1αP-4mMIP-1αmCCR-11343532mCCR-51361331.11270.25mD6>200>2005.5>2000.11Dissociation constants (in nm) for displacement of125I-mMIP-1α from CHO cells expressing murine MIP-1α receptors, by different forms of human and murine MIP-1α. Dissociation constants were calculated using LIGAND software (29Munson P.J. Robard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) from data derived from displacement experiments performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Dissociation constants (in nm) for displacement of125I-mMIP-1α from CHO cells expressing murine MIP-1α receptors, by different forms of human and murine MIP-1α.

Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) from data derived from displacement experiments performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similarly, the presence of the proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1αP allowed it to bind with high affinity to murine D6 (K d 5.5 nm) in contrast to the other three isoforms tested (K d > 200 nm). Again the comparison with murine MIP-1α indicates that the MIP-1αP isoform binds to D6 with an affinity that more resembles murine MIP-1α than does any of the other human variants tested. In contrast to the data obtained with murine CCR5 and D6, studies with murine CCR1 expressing cells indicate that the proline at position 2 is not essential for high affinity binding of the chemokines to this receptor, indeed, the K d observed for the interaction of full-length proteins with murine CCR1 was markedly higher than that seen with the −4 truncated isoforms. Additionally, MIP-1αP demonstrates a substantially higher binding affinity to that seen with murine MIP-1α indicating that the apparent equivalence of MIP-1αP and muMIP-1α on murine CCR5 and D6 does not extend to muCCR1. CHO cells expressing human receptors were also tested and showed similar results (Fig. 2 and Table II). Thus, with human D6, while the MIP-1αP isoform binds with high affinity (K d 5.5 nm), the −4 variants of the two isoforms bind only weakly (K d 77 nm for MIP-1αS-4 and K d 124 nm for MIP-1αP-4) and MIP-1αS does not exhibit an enhanced binding affinity over its −4 variant (Fig. 2 A). Again, as seen with the murine receptors, the Kdof MIP-1αP for D6 is more similar to that of murine MIP-1α than any of the other isoforms tested (Table II). The differences between MIP-1αS and MIP-1αP are, however, somewhat less stark than those seen with the murine receptor. With human CCR5, there is an approximately 4–6-fold higher binding affinity of MIP-1αP (K d 6.2 nm) than is seen for the −4 MIP-1α proteins (K d 25 and 36 nm), and the addition of the ASLA amino acids to MIP-1αS-4 results in a further reduction in binding affinity (Fig.2 B). Curiously, muMIP-1α binds in a manner more similar to that seen with either of the −4 variants than that seen with MIP-1αP. The clear requirement for the proline residue in position 2 for enhanced binding of human MIP-1α to human CCR5 suggests that the simple presence of the analogous residue in murine MIP-1α is insufficient in the context of the other evolutionary changes in this protein, to mediate high affinity binding to human CCR5. Again, in a manner similar to that observed for murine CCR1, the proline at position 2 of MIP-1αP appears to be unnecessary for the interaction of this ligand with human CCR1, with the full-length versions of MIP-1αS and MIP-1αP, showing a consistently lower affinity interaction with human CCR1 than either of the −4 variants (Fig.2 C). Again, in common with the data obtained using murine CCR1, murine MIP-1α binds more like the human −4 variants than either of the two full-length human MIP-1α isoforms (Table II).Table IIMIP-1αP shows high affinity binding to human CCR5 and D6 but not to CCR1MIP-1αSMIP-1αS-4MIP-1αPMIP-1αP-4mMIP-1αhCCR-12010391315hCCR-571366.22529hD664775.51240.92Dissociation constants (in nm) for displacement of125I-mMIP-1α from CHO cells expressing human receptors, by different forms of human and murine MIP-1α.

Dissociation constants were calculated using LIGAND software (29Munson P.J. Robard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). It is important to note that while all the above binding data was obtained from displacement studies utilizing radiolabeled murine MIP-1α and the relevant cold competitor, very similar dissociation constants have been obtained from direct binding studies using radiolabeled human MIP-1α isoforms. To test whether the observed isoform binding variations are also reflected in the dose response for signaling through human CCR5 and CCR1, ligand-induced mobilization of Ca2+ was studied. The transfected CHO cell lines used in the above binding studies are inefficient at fluxing Ca2+ and for this reason we have used stably transfected HEK cells in the Ca2+fluxing studies reported in this paper. Binding analyses using these cell lines indicates that the tested ligands for CCR1 and CCR5 bind with equivalent affinities to the receptors expressed in either CHO cells or HEK cells suggesting the likely equivalence of the receptors expressed on these different heterologous cells types. With full-length proteins on CCR5, half-maximal signaling potency is seen at approximately 10 nm for MIP-1αS and at approximately 500 pm for MIP-1αP (Fig.3 A). The dose-response curves obtained for these two full-length chemokines are highly significantly different (p < 0.0002) indicating, as was seen with the binding studies, that MIP-1αP is a markedly better ligand for CCR5 than MIP-1αS. The MIP-1αS-4 variant shows a slight, but significant (p < 0.001), increase in signaling potency through CCR5 compared with MIP-1αS, while removal of the terminal 4 amino acids from the MIP-1αP isoform significantly reduces its activity approximately 10-fold (p < 0.0002). Dose-response curves obtained using the two −4 variants were not significantly different and half-maximal activity was observed for both at concentrations of approximately 5 nm. The potency of signaling with MIP-1αP is significantly higher (approximately 10-fold; p < 0.001) than that seen with RANTES (half-maximal activity seen at 2.5 nm) and ∼100-fold higher than that seen with MIP-1β (p < 0.0002). MIP-1αP is therefore the most active natural CCR5 agonist described to date. We have detected Ca2+ fluxes with MCP2, which has recently been identified as a CCR5 ligand (32Gong W. Howard O.M.Z. Turpin J.A. Grimm M.C. Ueda H. Gray P.W. Raport C.J. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol.

Murine MIP-1α signaling potency through human CCR5 accurately reflected the binding data with a half-maximal activity being observed at 5 nm, a concentration that was indistinguishable from that seen with either of the −4 variants (data not shown). Signaling through human CCR1 again reflects the results from the binding studies and indicates no significant differences in signaling potency between the full-length isoforms of human MIP-1α which both display half-maximal fluxing capacity at approximately 2.5 nm (Fig. 3 B). The −4 variants, however, while they are not different from each other in calcium fluxing ability, have a significantly higher signaling potency than the full-length peptides (p < 0.02) with half-maximal activity being observed at approximately 750 pm. In our hands, RANTES demonstrates a half-maximal fluxing potency at approximately 15 nm on human CCR1 and is thus significantly less potent than any of the MIP-1α isoforms tested (p < 0.001). Murine MIP-1α mediated a half-maximal flux at approximately 600 pm, again reflecting the similar binding potency of this ligand to the two −4 variants on human CCR1. We have so far been unable to demonstrate a signaling role for human D6 (24Nibbs R.J.B. Wylie S.M. Yang J. Landau N.R. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997;"
https://openalex.org/W2334990949,"Association of breast tumor susceptibility gene products BRCA1 and BRCA2 with the RAD51 recombination protein suggested that cancer could arise through defects in recombination. The identification of NBS1, responsible for Nijmegen breakage syndrome, from the MRE11/RAD50 recombination protein complex also supports this hypothesis. However, our mutation analysis revealed that known members of the RAD52 epistasis group are rarely mutated in human primary cancer. Here we describe the isolation of a novel member of the SNF2 superfamily, characterized with sequence motifs similar to those in DNA and RNA helicases. The gene, designated RAD54B, is significantly homologous to the RAD54 recombination gene. The expression of RAD54B was high in testis and spleen, which are active in meiotic and mitotic recombination. These findings suggest that RAD54B may play an active role in recombination processes in concert with other members of the RAD52 epistasis group. RAD54B maps to human chromosome 8q21.3-q22 in a region associated with cancer-related chromosomal abnormalities. Homozygous mutations at highly conserved positions of RAD54B were observed in human primary lymphoma and colon cancer. These findings suggest that some cancers arise through alterations of the RAD54B function."
https://openalex.org/W2025796648,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are potent inducers of skeletal muscle differentiation and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity is essential for this process. Here we show that IGF-II induces nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) activities downstream from PI 3-kinase and that these events are critical for myogenesis. Differentiation of rat L6E9 myoblasts with IGF-II transiently induced NF-κB DNA binding activity, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and nitric oxide (NO) production. IGF-II-induced iNOS expression and NO production were blocked by NF-κB inhibition. Both NF-κB and NOS activities were essential for IGF-II-induced terminal differentiation (myotube formation and expression of skeletal muscle proteins: myosin heavy chain, GLUT 4, and caveolin 3), which was totally blocked by NF-κB or NOS inhibitors in rat and human myoblasts. Moreover, the NOS substratel-Arg induced myogenesis in the absence of IGFs in both rat and human myoblasts, and this effect was blocked by NOS inhibition. Regarding the mechanisms involved in IGF-II activation of NF-κB, PI 3-kinase inhibition prevented NF-κB activation, iNOS expression, and NO production. Moreover, IGF-II induced, through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway, a decrease in IκB-α protein content that correlated with a decrease in the amount of IκB-α associated with p65 NF-κB.

Skeletal muscle cell differentiation is a highly ordered multistep process that involves the expression of myogenic transcription factors, followed by cyclin kinase inhibitor p21 protein induction, cell cycle arrest, muscle-specific protein expression, and cell fusion to form multinucleated myotubes (1Andrés V.

Because of their myogenic actions, IGFs have been postulated as potential therapeutic tools in conditions characterized by muscle myopathy, atrophy, or muscle injury. In this context, IGFs have been implicated in the regulation of satellite cell function during regeneration, a characteristic response of adult muscle to injury (17Edwall D. Schalling M. Jennische E. Norstedt G. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Levinovitz A. Jennische E. Oldfors A. Edwall D. Norstedt G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, IGFs are pleiotropic growth factors, and they also affect the growth of several tissues other than skeletal muscle. This has led to the analysis of the intracellular myogenic process initiated by IGFs. It is known that IGF-I and IGF-II switch on the myogenic program by activating the IGF-I receptor (19Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. Florini J.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During the last 2 years, the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has emerged as an essential second messenger for skeletal muscle cell differentiation (20Kaliman P. Zorzano A. Trends Cardiovasc.

Moreover, by overexpressing a mutant p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (Δp85) lacking the ability to bind and activate the p110 catalytic subunit (L6E9-Δp85), we showed that the heterodimeric p85-p110 is the PI 3-kinase isoform essential for IGF-induced myogenesis in L6E9 muscle cells (23Kaliman P.

Currently, there is no information regarding the downstream signals activated by IGFs and PI 3-kinase or its PI 3-phosphate products during myogenesis, and we have recently shown that the serine/threonine p70 S6 kinase, a downstream element in several PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling cascades (24Cheatham B.

Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Kaliman P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5042-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Among the signaling events involved in myogenesis, the induction of chick embryonic myoblast fusion in low serum conditions requires NO production and NF-κB activity (27Lee K.H. Baek M.Y. Moon K.Y.

However, the mechanisms that trigger NF-κB and NOS activation in differentiating myoblasts and the involvement of these molecules in biochemical differentiation (i.e. expression of structural and functional muscle markers) remain to be defined. In the present study, we attempted to further characterize the myogenic intracellular pathway depending on IGF-II and PI 3-kinase. We describe here a myogenic signaling cascade initiated by IGF-II that leads to biochemical and morphological skeletal muscle cell differentiation and that involves (i) PI 3-kinase activation, (ii) IκB-α degradation and dissociation from p65 NF-κB, (iii) NF-κB activation, and (iv) iNOS expression and activation. Moreover, we show the ability of the NOS substratel-Arg to induce myogenesis in the absence of IGFs in both rat and human skeletal muscle cells.

The nitric-oxide synthase antibody set containing iNOS, cNOS, and eNOS polyclonal antibodies was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Rat L6E9 myoblasts were grown in monolayer culture in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin). Confluent myoblasts were differentiated by serum depletion in DMEM plus antibiotics with or without IGF-II (40 nm) in the absence or presence of other compounds as indicated for each experiment. Images shown are representative of 10–20 randomly selected microscope fields from each one of at least 10 independent experiments. Cells were photographed after staining the nuclei with Mayer's hemalum solution for microscopy (Merck). Cell fusion was quantified by counting the percentage of nuclei in myotubes from a total of at least 2500 nuclei from 15–25 independent randomly selected microscope fields for each condition tested. Human muscle normal biopsies were minced into small pieces and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Mediatech, Reston, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (MA Bioproducts, Springville, MD), 2% chick embryo extracts (Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD), 50 mm glutamine and gentamycin, as described previously (26Canicio J. Gallardo E. Illa I. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Kaliman P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5042-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to subconfluence and examined to assess the development of myotubes after 6 days in DMEM and antibiotics without or with IGF-II (40 nm), together with other compounds when indicated. Images shown are representative of 10–20 randomly selected microscope fields from each one of three independent experiments, in which each condition was tested in duplicate. For immunofluorescence labeling, cells were grown on 0.1% gelatin-pretreated glass coverslips. Myoblasts or 2-day-old IGF-II induced myotubes were fixed on coverslips and incubated with 30 μl of a 1:100 dilution of primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS, the last one for 15 min, before incubating with the rodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 dilution in 0.5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. Nonspecific controls were carried out in the absence of primary antibody (data not shown). Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS, the last one for 15 min. Finally, coverslips were mounted with immunofluorescence medium. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 7,5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, supplemented with 1% Nonidet-P40. Cell extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and 50 μg of the solubilized proteins was loaded. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Gels were blotted into Immobilon in buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3. Following transfer, the filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.02% sodium azide. Proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminiscence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) except for β1-integrin, which was detected using125I-protein A for 3 h at room temperature. Quantification of protein expression was performed by scanning densitometry of at least three independent experiments for each condition. Cells were scraped and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm vanadate, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 0.5 mg of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-p65 NF-κB or nonimmune controls (not shown). Antibodies were preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h and washed twice in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, before being incubated with the solubilized proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunopellets were washed three times in the same buffer before being resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot using polyclonal antibodies against anti-IκB-α, as described above. NF-κB-DNA binding activity was analyzed in total cellular extracts made in Totex lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin) (33Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Supernatants from a 15 min 10,000 × gcentrifugation were collected. The NF-κB probe was a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB-binding site of the interleukin-2 gene promoter (5′-GATCCAAGGGACTTTCCATG-3′). Totex extract samples (70 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 30 ng of poly(dI·dC) and 5 μl of 5× NF buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol 0.4 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) in a final volume of 25 μl. The end-labeled probe was then added for a further incubation of 25 min at 25 °C. The specificity of the bands detected was verified by adding 10–100-fold excess of competing unlabeled NF-κB probe. NF-κB-unrelated oligonucleotide probe controls did not show any specific binding activity (data not shown). The NO production was determined by assaying for nitrite and nitrate accumulation in the culture media. Briefly, following treatment of the cells with the indicated agents, culture media were filtered with 0.2-μm filters, and 80 μl of each sample was treated with nitrate reductase and its cofactors to convert all of the nitrate to nitrite before applying 100 μl of the Griess reagent (0.5% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 1% sulfanylamidein, 2.5% phosphoric acid). Absorbance was measured at 543 nm, and nitrite concentration was determined using a standard curve of sodium nitrite concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 nmol/ml. During the process of L6E9 myoblast differentiation, IGF-II caused the induction of skeletal muscle protein markers such as the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4, the isoform 3 of caveolin, which is a component of the distrophin complex, and the myosin heavy chain (Fig. 1 a). The expression of these proteins increased with the time of exposure to IGF-II, being maximal at day 4, when a fully morphological differentiation is achieved (23Kaliman P. Canicio J. Shepherd P.R. Beeton C.A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We observed that IGF-II induced as an early myogenic marker the expression of iNOS (Fig. 1 a). At differentiation day 1, IGF-II induced 2.3 ± 0.2-fold (n = 3) increase in iNOS expression compared with myoblasts maintained in DMEM alone, and a progressive decrease in its expression was observed from day 1 to day 4. As a control, we examined the expression levels of β1-integrin, a nonmuscle-specific plasma membrane protein, that remained unaltered during IGF-II-induced differentiation (Fig. 1 a). Taking into account that iNOS expression is tightly regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB, we analyzed the DNA binding activity of NF-κB on total cell extracts from myoblasts differentiated in the absence or presence of IGF-II. Fig. 1 b shows that the NF-κB DNA binding activity was increased by IGF-II in a way that correlated in time with the profile of iNOS expression. Maximal activation was detected at 24 h, when the level of NF-κB DNA binding activity induced by IGF-II was 2.6 ± 0.3-fold (n = 3) over controls (DMEM-treated cells). No significant differences in NF-κB DNA binding activity were observed at shorter differentiation times (data not shown and see Fig.3 a). NF-κB activation by IGF-II was sensitive to inhibitors of IκB phosphorylation or degradation such as sodium salicylate (10 mm) (Fig. 1 c) or PDTC (100 μm) (data not shown) (34Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 35Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). By using these NF-κB inhibitors, we determined that IGF-II-induced iNOS expression was totally dependent on NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 d,upper panel). Moreover, IGF-II-induced iNOS expression at day 1 correlated with IGF-II-dependent NO production, as measured by nitrite/nitrate accumulation in the cell culture media; the IGF-II-induced NO production was dependent on NF-κB activity, because it was completely blocked by NaSal or PDTC (Fig. 1 d,lower panel). Results presented above indicate that NF-κB-dependent iNOS expression and activity are early events during myogenesis induced by IGF-II. We next tested the relevance of this IGF-II-induced pathway for muscle differentiation. L6E9 myoblast differentiation was induced with IGF-II (40 nm) in the absence or presence of NF-κB or NOS inhibitors, and after 4 days the expression of differentiation parameters was analyzed (Fig. 2,a–c). The IGF-II induction of muscle markers such as GLUT4 or caveolin 3 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by NF-κB inhibitors PDTC (Fig. 2 a) or NaSal (Fig.2 b) and by NOS inhibitors NNA (Fig. 2 c) orN G-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (data not shown). At the morphological level, subconfluent myoblasts incubated for 4 days in a medium containing DMEM supplemented with IGF-II formed large multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 2 d). In these conditions, the percentage of nuclei in myotubes induced by IGF-II was 66 ± 3% (a total of 2555 nuclei were counted from 19 randomly selected microscopic fields), whereas in the presence of DMEM alone only 9 ± 2% nuclei were in myotubes (a total of 2538 nuclei were counted from 21 randomly selected microscopic fields). When IGF-II-induced cell fusion was analyzed in the presence of NF-κB inhibitors such as NaSal (10 mm) or PDTC (50 μm) or in the presence of nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors such as NNA (5 mm) orN G-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (data not shown), a total blockade of the IGF-II myotube formation capacity was observed (no myotube formation was seen in any of at least 10 independent experiments performed under each of these conditions) (Fig. 2 d). The involvement of NF-κB activation in IGF-II-induced myogenesis was also detected in myoblast primary cultures derived from human skeletal muscle biopsies; human myoblasts responded to IGF-II by activating cell fusion, and this effect was blocked by the addition of sodium salicylate (Fig. 2 e) or PDTC (data not shown). As very little or no expression of iNOS is detected in L6E9 cells in the absence of IGF-II, we analyzed whether L6E9 cells expressed other NOS isoforms because both cNOS and the eNOS isoforms have been detected in other skeletal muscle models (36Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 742-752Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 37Kobzic L. Stringer B. Balligand J.L. Reid M.B. Stamler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We detected the expression of cNOS in both L6E9 myoblasts and myotubes by immunofluorescence (Fig.3 a), whereas very low levels of type III NOS (eNOS) were detected (data not shown). As a control, we analyzed the expression of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor expression, which as expected, was only detected in nuclei from myotubes (Fig. 3 a). Based on these observations, we analyzed whether the NOS substrate l-Arg was able to mimic IGF-II ability to induce biochemical and morphological myoblast differentiation. We incubated subconfluent L6E9 myoblasts with the NOS substrate, l-Arg (5 mm), to generate NO in the absence of exogenous IGF-II addition. We observed that after 24 h of incubation, l-Arg induced a NO production similar to that induced by IGF-II, which was totally blocked by the NOS inhibitor NNA (Fig. 3 b). l-Arginine (5 mm) induced a high level of morphological differentiation of L6E9 cells (46 ± 4% of nuclei into myotubes from a total of 2099 nuclei in 18 randomly selected microscopic fields) (Fig. 3 c). This effect was specific for the NOS substrate, because in the same conditions the basic amino acidl-Lys did not induce additional cell fusion to that observed with DMEM alone (12 ± 2% of nuclei into myotubes from a total of 3158 nuclei in 22 randomly selected microscopic fields). Similar effects were observed in myoblast primary cultures derived from human skeletal muscle biopsies, where l-Arg but notl-Lys induced multinucleated myotube formation (Fig.3 d). l-Arg also led to the expression of muscle-specific protein markers such as caveolin 3, myosin heavy chain, and GLUT4, at levels comparable with those observed with IGF-II (IGF-II and l-Arg induced 2.6 ± 0.3- and 2.2 ± 0.4-fold increase over DMEM controls, respectively, in muscle-specific protein expression, n = 3) (Fig. 3 e). Moreover, the effect of l-Arg on biochemical differentiation was dependent on NOS activity because it was totally blocked by the NOS inhibitor NNA, whereas no induction of muscle-specific proteins was observed in the presence of l-Lys (5 mm) in the same conditions (Fig. 3 e). We have recently reported that the p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is an essential mediator of IGF-II-myogenic actions (23Kaliman P. Canicio J. Shepherd P.R. Beeton C.A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Indeed, either overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of p85 PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit or treatment of L6E9 myoblast with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked the IGF-II-dependent myogenic program. Results presented above indicate that NF-κB and iNOS activation are also critical for IGF-II-induced myogenic program. Therefore, we next evaluated whether the differentiation cascade involving IGF-II/NF-κB/iNOS was dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. To this end, L6E9 myoblast differentiation was induced with IGF-II in the absence or presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Fig.4 shows that the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (20 μm) blocked the IGF-II-induced peak of NF-κB activation (Fig. 4 a), the IGF-II induction of iNOS expression (Fig. 4 b), and the IGF-II-induced NO production (Fig. 4 c). In all, these results indicate that IGF-II requires PI 3-kinase to induce NF-κB and iNOS activation. We next analyzed the mechanism involved in the activation of NF-κB by IGF-II and PI 3-kinase. A primary level of control for NF-κB is through interaction with the inhibitory protein IκB, and most of NF-κB activators tested induced IκB-α degradation (38Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of IGF-II on IκB-α protein levels in L6E9 myoblasts. We observed an up-regulation in the expression of both IκB-α and the p65 subunit of NF-κB after 12 h of IGF-II treatment compared with cells incubated in DMEM alone. The IGF-II-induced increase in protein levels was 2.0 ± 0.1- and 1.5 ± 0.1-fold (n = 3) for IκB-α and p65, respectively (Fig. 5 a, IGF-IIversus DMEM at 12 h). From 12 to 24 h of treatment, IGF-II induced a 39 ± 4% (n = 3) decrease in IκB-α total cell content without any detectable alteration in the expression levels of p65 (Fig.5 a, IGF-II, 24 h versus 12 h). IGF-II-induced decrease in IκB-α levels was inhibited when differentiation was carried out in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Thus, at 24 h of IGF-II treatment, IkB-α protein content was 1.7 ± 0.3-fold (n = 3) higher in the presence than in the absence of PI 3-kinase inhibitor (Fig.5 b, IGF-II+LY294002 versus IGF-II at 24 h). Immunoprecipitation of myoblast lysates with an anti-p65 antibody co-immunoprecipitated IκB-α (Fig. 5 c). After 16 h of IGF-II treatment, the amount of IκB-α associated with p65 was similar in the absence or presence of LY294002 (data not shown). However at 24 h, the amount of IκB-α associated with p65 was 1.8 ± 0.2-fold (n = 3) higher in the presence of IGF-II and LY294002 than in the presence of IGF-II alone. It is interesting to note that the increase in IκB-α and p65 expression detected at 12 h of IGF-II treatment remained unaffected by LY294002 in three independent experiments (for IκB-α, Fig. 5, a and b, 12 h lanes; for p65, data not shown). These results suggest that during the first 12 h of treatment, IGF-II up-regulated the expression of IκB-α and p65 NF-κB subunit in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner (Fig. 5,a and b, 12 h lanes); during the following 12 h, IGF-II induced a decrease in IκB-α protein content and the activation of NF-κB by dissociation of p65 from IκB-α through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway (Fig. 5,b and c, 24 h lanes). Results presented here define a model for the IGF-II-induced myogenic pathway, in which PI 3-kinase, NF-κB, and NOS activities are critical elements. Our data show that IGF-II-induced myogenesis can be blocked by either PI 3-kinase inhibitors, NF-κB inhibitors, or NOS inhibitors. Several lines of evidence indicate that PI 3-kinase, NF-κB, and iNOS are elements of a common myogenic cascade: (i) IGF-II-induced NF-κB activation was blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibition, (ii) IGF-II-induced iNOS expression correlated in time with the activation of NF-κB and was blocked by either PI 3-kinase or NF-κB inhibitors, and (iii) IGF-II-induced iNOS expression was accompanied by an IGF-II-induced NO production that was blocked by PI 3-kinase, NF-κB, or NOS inhibitors. An early event in the IGF-II-induced differentiation program was the increase in IκB-α and the p65 NF-κB subunit protein content. These data are consistent with the evidence that NF-κB and IκB are components of a mutual regulatory system in which the levels of one component control the activity or quantity of the other (39Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). After 24 h of IGF-II treatment, a transient peak of NF-κB DNA binding activity was observed that correlated with a decrease in IκB-α protein levels. It has been reported that differentiation of skeletal muscle cells in a medium containing low serum concentration induced a down-regulation of the activity of NF-κB and other proliferating transcription factors (40Lehtinen S.K. Rahkila P. Helenius M. Korhonen P. Salminen A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1996; 229: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The authors did not consider the effects of IGFs in their systems, and they established from their data that there was a causative relation between NF-κB down-regulation and myogenesis. However, the authors did not examine whether the NF-κB activity detected after 24 h in a low serum differentiation medium, even if it was lower than that observed during proliferation, was necessary for differentiation. Indeed, this appears to be the case, because consistent with our observations for rat and human myoblasts differentiated with IGF-II, Lee et al. (28Lee K.H. Kim D.G. Shin N.Y. Song W.K. Kwon H. Chung C.H. Kang M.-S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that chick embryonic myoblasts require NF-κB activity to fuse in a low serum-containing differentiation medium. The effect of IGF-II in modulating NF-κB activity in L6E9 myoblasts appears to be tightly regulated by PI 3-kinase activity. Our results indicate that PI 3-kinase is required for NF-κB activation during myoblast differentiation through a mechanism that involves IκB-α degradation. The peak of NF-κB DNA binding activity after 24 h of IGF-II treatment was blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibition, and this correlated in time with higher amounts of IκB-α protein and higher amounts of inactive p65 NF-κB complexed with IκB-α in the presence of LY294002 than those detected in control myoblasts. Our results suggest a biphasic effect of IGF-II in modulating NF-κB activity in L6E9 myoblasts: during the first 12 h, IGF-II induced the up-regulation of IκB-α and p65 expression in a PI 3-kinase-independent way, and from 12 to 24 h, IGF-II induced the dissociation of IκB-α from p65 and the degradation of IκB-α through PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanisms. We interpret the complexity of these results as an example of the diversity of signals that can be elicited when a growth factor activates a tyrosine kinase receptor and generates a set of distinct second messengers in the cell. In this particular case, the expression of p65 and IkB-α is induced by IGF-II through yet undefined signaling pathways that do not involve PI 3-kinase activity. In contrast, the degradation of IkB-α and its dissociation from p65 require PI 3-kinase activity. In this latter case, it is tempting to hypothesize that PI 3-kinase could be acting upstream from the IkB kinases responsible for NF-κB activation. Indeed, many if not all activators of NF-κB have been reported to induce degradation of IκB-α (41Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) by activating IκB kinases that phosphorylate IκB-α on serines 32 and 36 within the N-terminal regulatory domain (43DiDonato J.A.

This is the most probable mechanism by which IGF-II and PI 3-kinase induce NF-κB activation in differentiating myoblasts, because we did not detect any IGF-II-induced IκB-α tyrosine phosphorylation, which represents a proteolysis-independent mechanism for NF-κB activation (data not shown) (48Imbert V.

Potential kinases acting between PI 3-kinase and IkB kinases during IGF-II myogenesis could be the protein kinase B and some PKC isoforms that are activated by PI 3-kinase products (49Cross D.A.E.

We show here that iNOS expression and activation are early events during IGF-II-induced myogenesis. Moreover, we describe here the ability of the NOS substrate l-Arg to induce myogenesis in the absence of IGFs in both rat and human skeletal muscle cells. The identification of direct targets for NO action in myogenesis is a matter of current interest, and one gene that may be regulated by NO in skeletal muscle cells is the Cdk inhibitor p21. It has been reported that NO blocks the cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition by inhibiting Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and that the p21 induction is involved in the Cdk2 inhibition (54Ishida A. Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Nojima H. Ogata J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10050-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A causative role for NO action in nerve growth factor-induced cell cycle exit and differentiation of PC12 neuronal cells has been reported (55Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that NO diffusion from the producer cell could promote cessation of growth in adjacent cells, contributing to synchronization of development from precursor cells. The expression of Cdk inhibitor p21 and cell cycle exit are prerequisites for myogenesis, and these events, which are both induced by IGF-II in L6E9 cells, may be mediated by NO (1Andrés V. Walsh K.

Results presented here suggest that IGF-II-dependent myoblast differentiation can be mimicked by l-Arg treatment, both at the biochemical and at the morphological level, and this ability ofl-Arg to induce myogenesis in the absence of IGFs may contribute to the development of new strategies for the treatment of myopathies.

https://openalex.org/W1983884349,"We investigated whether the renal brush border Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 exists in assemblies with other proteins in native kidney membranes. To this end we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against affinity purified NHE3 protein complexes. Hybridomas were selected based on ability to immunoprecipitate NHE3. One of the resulting mAbs (10A3) labeled a high molecular mass (>200 kDa) protein and stained primarily the coated pit region of the proximal tubule in a manner similar to that described for megalin (gp330). We then confirmed that both mAb 10A3 and a known anti-megalin mAb immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted the same protein, namely megalin. mAb 10A3 specifically co-precipitated NHE3 but not villin or NaPi-2 from solubilized renal membranes, indicating specificity of the NHE3-megalin interaction. When immunoprecipitations were performed using either 10A3 or anti-NHE3 mAb 2B9 after separation of solubilized renal proteins by sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation, we found that NHE3 exists in two states with distinct sedimentation coefficients, a 9.6 S megalin-free form and a 21 S megalin-bound form, and that when NHE3 assembles with megalin, epitopes within the carboxyl-terminal 131 amino acids of NHE3 are blocked.

Transporters often exist as components of multimeric protein complexes that stabilize their localization in specific membrane domains and/or ensure proximity to signaling pathways (13Barth A.I.

Recent studies have shown that two homologous proteins known as NHE-RF (Na+/H+ exchangerregulatory factor) and E3KARP (NHE3kinase Aregulatory protein) play critical roles in the cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 (16Weinman E.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Both proteins have PDZ domains that may interact directly with NHE3 or may be adapters that link NHE3 to the cytoskeleton (18Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Much of the data provided by these studies have been derived from experiments in cell culture or from yeast two-hybrid analysis. We therefore investigated whether NHE3 exists in assemblies with other proteins in native kidney membranes. We report that the sedimentation coefficient for NHE3 solubilized from renal brush border membranes is greater than predicted for monomeric NHE3, indicating the presence of multimeric complexes. Moreover, by use of a strategy involving the generation of monoclonal antibodies to immunopurified NHE3 complexes, we find that a significant pool of NHE3 exists in association with the putative scavenger receptor megalin. In a previous paper we described in detail the development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to a restricted region of the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 (9Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A.

By immunocytochemistry, all three mAbs stained the brush border of proximal tubule cells (9Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J.

A polyclonal antibody, raised in guinea pigs to fpNHE3–702-832, was also used in this study. This antibody is also specific for NHE3 (19Rutherford P.A. Pizzonia J.H. Biemesderfer D. Abu-Alfa A.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain), used at 10 μg/ml, was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (heavy and light chain-specific), goat anti-mouse (γ chain-specific), or goat anti-rabbit (heavy and light chain-specific) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco CA) and used at 0.5 μg/ml. Adult male New Zealand White rabbits (Gabrielle Farms, Woodstock, CT) were sacrificed by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (Butler Co., Columbus, OH). Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) or microsomes were prepared from renal cortex as described previously (7Biemesderfer D. Pizzonia J. Abu-Alfa A. Exner M. Reilly R. Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F736-F742PubMed Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors (Sigma) pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μg/ml), and EDTA (1 mm) each were included in the preparation. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Velocity gradient sedimentation was carried out according to Copeland et al.(23Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Rabbit renal microsomes were solubilized in lysis buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm MES, 30 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were applied to the top of 5–25% continuous sucrose gradients. Sucrose solutions were prepared with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation for 12 h at 4 °C at 40,000 rpm in an SW 41 rotor, the gradients were fractionated by hand from the top. Sucrose concentrations of each fraction were calculated from the refractive index. Sedimentation coefficients were determined by comparison to standard proteins with known S values (aldolase,s 20,w = 7.3; catalase,s 20,w = 11.3; horse spleen apoferritin,s 20,w = 16.5; and bovine thyroglobulin,s 20,w = 19.3), or by using the formulas 20,w = ΔI/ω2 t where I is the time integral, ω is rotor speed (radians/s), and t is time, as described by Griffith (24Griffith O.M. Techniques of Preparative, Zonal, and Continuous Flow Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA1983Google Scholar). Buffers (Tris and MES), Triton X-100, and apoferritin were purchased from Sigma. Aldolase, catalase, and thyroglobulin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. An anti-NHE3 affinity matrix was prepared by cross-linking affinity purified mAb 2B9 to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with dimethylpimelimidate dihydrochloride (Sigma) according to the “two layer” method described by Schneider et al. (25Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a bridging antibody. For purification of native NHE3 complexes, brush border membrane vesicles were solubilized at 4 °C in 0.1% octyl glucoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Samples were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were applied to the affinity matrix and allowed to incubated overnight in the cold (4 °C). The column was washed extensively with solubilization buffer and monitored for protein by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a Gilford Spectrophotometer 260 (Gilford Instruments, Inc., Oberlin, OH). When the wash buffer was determined to be free of unbound protein, bound NHE3 complexes were eluted using glycine HCl (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized to pH 7.4 using 1 m Tris base. When the efficiency of the column was analyzed by immunoblotting samples of the unbound flow-through and of the acid eluant, we found that most (>90%) of the total NHE3 had been bound to the column (data not shown). BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were immunized intraperitoneally with affinity purified rabbit NHE3 complexes from 1 mg of BBMV using a pertussis/alum protocol (26Kashgarian M. Biemesderfer D. Caplan M. Forbush B.D. Kidney Int. 1985; 28: 899-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Animals were boosted by injecting intraperitoneally the same amount of antigen in PBS. Mice whose serum showed specific reactivity to renal brush borders by immunocytochemistry were selected for fusion. Spleen cells were fused with Ag8 cells and grown according to established procedures (9Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selected hybridomas were cloned and subcloned by limiting dilution using Cloning FactorTM (IGEN, Inc., Rockville, MD). mAbs were purified from hybridoma supernatants by affinity chromatography using protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's protocols. Purified mAb (1–10 mg/ml) to which was added BSA at 1 mg/ml was stored in 50% glycerol/PBS at −20 °C. ELISAs were performed as described previously (4Reilly R.F. Hildebrandt F. Biemesderfer D. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Aronson P.S. Slayman C.W. Igarashi P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1088-F1094PubMed Google Scholar). As antigen, BBMV (protein concentration 30 mg/ml) were diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 100 μl applied to each well of 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Kennebunk, ME), and the plates allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C. The following day the plates were washed 4× in PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton X-100) and once in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS/BSA/Triton X-100) to block nonspecific antibody binding. After blocking for 10 min, 25 μl of hybridoma supernatant was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed 4× in PBS/Triton X-100 and once in PBS/BSA/Triton X-100. Bound antibody was detected by incubation for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain specific;Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:2000 in PBS/BSA/Triton X-100. The plates were washed 5× in PBS/Triton X-100 and once in distilled water, and bound horseradish peroxidase was detected with o-phenylenediamine (Sigma). The optical density was measured at 492 nm using a Titretek Multiskan MCC/340 spectrophotometer. Immunoprecipitation of soluble renal proteins was performed essentially as described previously (27Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Renal membranes (BBMV or microsomes) were solubilized at 4 °C in TBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and EDTA as described above. The samples were subjected to either low speed (15,000 × g for 10 min) or high speed (200,000 ×g for 1 h) centrifugation using a table top (HermleTM model Z230 m, National Labnet Co., Woodbridge, NJ) centrifuge or a Beckman ultracentrifuge, respectively. To the above supernatants were added primary antibody, approximately 50 μg for mAbs or 10 μl of serum. Primary antibodies were allowed to incubate at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected using 5 mg/sample of protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed 5× in solubilization buffer and then incubated in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C, and the samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Although we have found that heating NHE3 increases its tendency to form aggregates (see Fig.5), heating is necessary in these experiments in order to completely reduce IgG to monomeric heavy and light chains. Protein samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to PVDF (Millipore Immobilon-P) at 500 mA for 6–10 h at 4 °C with a TransphorTM transfer electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) and stained with Ponceau S in 0.5% trichloroacetic acid. Immunoblotting was performed as follows. Sheets of PVDF containing transferred protein from entire gels were incubated first in Blotto (5% non-fat dry milk in PBS (pH 7.4)) for 1–3 h to block nonspecific binding of antibody, followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody. Primary antibodies, diluted in Blotto, were used at dilutions ranging from 1:1000 to 1:5000. The sheets were then washed in Blotto and incubated for 1 h with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in Blotto. After washing 3× in Blotto, 1× in PBS (pH 7.4), and 1× in distilled water, bound antibody was detected with the ECLTMchemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In some experiments (see Figs. 1, 2, and 5), PVDF blots were reprobed with additional primary antibodies after stripping away the first antibody. This was accomplished by incubating the PVDF sheets in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris (pH 6.9) for 60 min at 70 °C.Figure 2Sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation: sedimentation coefficients of renal Na/H exchangers. Rabbit renal cortical microsomes (7 mg) were solubilized in 10 ml of MES buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 1 h, 1 ml of the supernatant was applied to the top of a 5–25% sucrose gradient, and the gradient was centrifuged in a Ti41 rotor at 40,000 for 12 h at 4 °C. 0.75-ml fractions were collected, and 100 μl of each were prepared for immunoblotting. Blots were probed first for NHE1 (upper panel) using mAb 4E9, then stripped and probed with a polyclonal antibody for NHE3 (lower panel). The locations of standard proteins (aldolase, catalase, apoferritin, and thyroglobulin) are shown at the bottom of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rabbits were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital injected intravenously, and the kidneys were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde/lysine/periodate fixative (29McClean W. Nakane P.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 22: 1077-1083Crossref Scopus (3187) Google Scholar) as described previously (30Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). Fixed tissue was processed and stained using the immunoperoxidase method exactly as described previously (30Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F55-F67PubMed Google Scholar). When screening hybridomas, the culture supernatant or hybridoma media, which served as controls, were used undiluted for labeling. Thin sections of Epon-embedded tissue were examined using a Zeiss 910 electron microscope. Our initial studies were designed to establish the optimal conditions for solubilizing the apical Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 from rabbit renal membranes. In these experiments, rabbit renal microsomes were solubilized with several nonionic (Triton X-100, octyl glucoside, and C12E8) or zwitterionic (CHAPS) detergents and then subjected to differential centrifugation. The resulting fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. For comparison, we assessed the solubility of both NHE3 and the basolateral Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE1, which is also expressed at high levels in rabbit renal cortex (8Biemesderfer D. Reilly R.F. Exner M. Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F833-F840PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed solubility based on the presence of protein in the supernatant following centrifugation. In this study, low speed centrifugation is defined as 15,000 × g for 10 min, and high speed centrifugation is carried out at 200,000 ×g for 1 h. Therefore, the presence of a protein in the high speed supernatant indicates complete solubilization. In Fig.1, lane 1 represents proteins present in the low speed pellet, lane 2 the high speed pellet, and lane 3 the high speed supernatant. As indicated in Fig. 1, the solubility properties of NHE1 and NHE3 are different. Although NHE1 can be detected in the high speed pellets following CHAPS and octyl glucoside solubilization, most of this isoform is soluble (present in the high speed supernatant) in Triton X-100 and C12E8 (Fig. 1, panel A). In contrast, NHE3 was completely insoluble (present in the pellets) when we used CHAPS or octyl glucoside and was only partially soluble in Triton X-100 and C12E8 (Fig. 1, panel B). Such detergent insolubility of membrane proteins has frequently been shown to result from specific protein-protein (cytoskeletal) (14Nelson W.J. Veshnock P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1751-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or protein-lipid (31Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar) interactions. Studies of Na+/H+ exchangers expressed in cell culture have shown them to form homomultimeric assemblies (32Fafournoux P. Noel J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, since the data presented in Fig. 1 suggested that NHE3 may interact with other brush border proteins, we next sought to estimate the size of the native renal Na+/H+ exchangers. To this end, we determined the sedimentation coefficients of NHE1 and NHE3 using sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation (Fig.2). In these studies, the high speed Triton X-100 supernatant, prepared as described for Fig. 1, was applied to the top of 5–25% sucrose gradients, and the samples were centrifuged for 12 h as described under “Materials and Methods.” The distribution of the Na+/H+exchangers (NHE1 and NHE3) in the gradient was determined by probing immunoblots of the fractions with isoform-specific antibodies. Their sedimentation coefficients were calculated and compared with standard proteins with known S values (Fig. 2). NHE1 sedimented as a single discrete peak with a sedimentation coefficient of approximatelys 20,w = 6.5. In contrast, NHE3 had a very broad distribution with a significantly higher sedimentation coefficient. These data suggest that NHE3 exists in multimeric assemblies under these conditions. Moreover, the broad distribution of NHE3 in the gradient suggests that these assemblies are heterogeneous. In order to evaluate further the possibility that NHE3 exists in assemblies with other proteins, we generated mAbs to the native NHE3 complex as a strategy to identify proteins that specifically associate with the Na+/H+ exchanger. The NHE3 transporter complex, solubilized with C12E8, was isolated using an affinity column prepared with mAb 2B9 raised to the carboxyl terminus of rabbit NHE3 (9Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were immunized and boosted with the column eluate purified from approximately 1 mg of rabbit brush border membrane vesicles. Hybridomas were prepared using standard protocols, and their supernatants were screened using successive assays that included ELISA, immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation. Our goal was to first identify mAbs that were capable of immunoprecipitating native NHE3. Once these were identified, each antibody was characterized in order to determine if it was specific for NHE3 or an associated protein. Of the approximately 180 hybridomas that were positive by ELISA to rabbit brush border membranes, we identified 10 mAbs that stained the brush border of the proximal tubule by immunocytochemistry and that immunoprecipitated NHE3 from Triton X-100 or C12E8-solubilized brush border membrane vesicles. In order to identify mAbs that were directed to NHE3, we performed immunoblotting experiments using microsomes prepared from LAP cells that had been transfected with NHE3 or other isoforms of NHE as controls (6Pizzonia J.A. Biemesderfer D. Abu-Alfa A.K. Wu M.-S. Exner M. Isenring P. Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F510-F517PubMed Google Scholar, 7Biemesderfer D. Pizzonia J. Abu-Alfa A. Exner M. Reilly R. Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F736-F742PubMed Google Scholar). Only one of the 10 mAbs (3G11) labeled NHE3 by immunoblotting (data not shown). This mAb also cross-reacted with NHE1, indicating that its epitope is shared between the two isoforms. Of the remaining 9 mAbs, one mAb (10A3) has been characterized in detail, and these studies are presented below. Although mAb 10A3 immunoprecipitated NHE3 (see Fig. 5), when used for immunoblotting it labeled a very large molecular weight protein that migrated by SDS-PAGE above the 200-kDa standard near the top of the 7.5% gel (Fig.3, panel A). When used for immunocytochemistry, this mAb also exhibited a unique staining pattern. As seen by immunoelectron microscopy in Fig. 3,panel B, although some staining was detected on microvilli, most of the staining was restricted to the coated pit region of the brush border of proximal tubules. No staining was observed in the controls (data not shown). These observations raised the possibility that the 10A3 antigen may be the putative scavenger receptor megalin, which is located most abundantly in the coated pit region of the renal brush border (33Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and which has a predicted molecular mass of over 500 kDa (34Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether mAb 10A3 and a well characterized anti-megalin mAb (DC6) (35Orlando R.A. Exner M. Czekay R.P. Yamazaki H. Saito A. Ullrich R. Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) would immunoprecipitate the same protein from solubilized renal microsomes. Indeed, as indicated by the solid arrow in Fig.4, both 10A3 and DC6 immunoprecipitated the same protein that was visualized on the immunoblot by staining with both antibodies. This large (>200 kDa) protein was not precipitated by a control mAb (anti-vil"

A consensus sequence (Arg259–Lys273) present in the terminal region of third cytoplasmic loop of the seven-transmembrane β2-adrenergic receptor couples preferentially to Gs; phosphorylation of Ser262by cAMP-dependent protein kinase decreases coupling to Gs and enhances coupling to Gi1 (15Okamoto T.

In the present study, we have used peptide fragments corresponding to the N-terminal, C-terminal, and middle regions of the cytoplasmic domain of NPR-C to determine the locus of G protein binding and activation. A 17-amino acid peptide of the middle region (Arg469–Arg485), which possesses the consensus sequence B-B. . . . . …B-B-X-X-B, was shown to bind selectively to Gi1 and Gi2, activate PLC-β3 via the βγ subunits, and inhibit adenylyl cyclase in similar fashion to the selective NPR-C ligand, cANP4–23. A C-terminal peptide (Gly479-Ala496), which included theB-B-X-X-B motif at its N-terminal, inhibited activation by the stimulatory peptide and cANP4–23. Four peptide fragments corresponding to the N-terminal region (Peptide 1, Arg460–Arg470), C-terminal region (Peptide 2, Gly479–Ala496), and middle region (Peptide 3, Ile467–Arg482; and Peptide 4, Arg469–Arg485) of the 37-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of NPR-C were synthesized by the solid phase method and highly (95–99%) purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Chiron Technologies) (Fig.1). The lyophilized synthetic peptides were dissolved in distilled water. Muscle cells were isolated from guinea pig tenia coli by sequential enzymatic digestion, filtration, and centrifugation as described previously (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Teng B.Q. Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G342-G351PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the cells were allowed to disperse spontaneously for 30 min and then harvested by filtration through 500-μm Nitex and centrifuged twice at 350 ×g for 10 min. In some experiments, the cells were permeabilized by incubation for 5 min with saponin (35 μg/ml) in a low Ca2+ (100 nm) medium as described previously (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in saponin-free medium with 1.5 mm ATP and ATP-regenerating system (5 mmcreatine phosphate and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). Dispersed muscle cells were cultured as described previously (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Teng B.Q.

The muscle cells in confluent primary cultures were trypsinized, replated at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml, and cultured under the same conditions. All experiments were done on cells in first passage. G proteins selectively activated by the synthetic peptides were identified by an adaptation of the method of Okamotoet al. (18Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as described previously (19Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min, the membranes were solubilized at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES medium (pH 7.4) and 1% CHAPS. The membranes were incubated with 60 nm[35S]GTPγS in a medium containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μm EDTA, and 10 mmMgCl2 for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of peptides (100 μm). The reaction was stopped with 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl medium (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μm GTP, and the solubilized membranes were incubated for 2 h on ice in wells precoated with specific antibodies to Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, Gsα, and Gq/11α. The wells were washed three times with phosphate buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the radioactivity from each well was counted. PLC activity was determined as described previously (19Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4695-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by a modification of the method Uhing et al. (21Uhing R.J. Prpic V. Jiang H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2140-2146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in membranes from cultured tenia coli muscle cells prelabeled with myo[3H]inositol. The assay was initiated by addition of 0.4 mg of membrane protein to 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 nm free Ca2+, 100 μm GTP, 5 mmphosphocreatine, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, in a total volume 0.4 ml. After incubation at 31 °C for 60 s, the reaction was terminated with 0.6 ml 25% trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was extracted four times with 2 ml of diethyl ether, and the amount of labeled inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase counted. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity at time 0 (100–150 cpm) was subtracted from all values. PLC activity was expressed as counts/min/mg of protein. Cyclic AMP was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin (10 μm) was added to 0.5 ml of cell suspension (106 cells/ml) in the presence of 10 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, either alone or in combination with various peptides (100 μm). The reaction was terminated after 60 s. The results were expressed as picomoles/106 cells. Contraction was measured in permeabilized muscle cells by scanning micrometry, as described previously (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 0.25-ml aliquot of cells (104 cells/ml) was added to 0.1 ml of medium containing cANP4–23 (1 μm) or various concentrations of partial peptide sequences, and the reaction was terminated after 30 s with 1% acrolein. The effect of the partial peptide sequences on maximal contraction induced by cANP4–23 was also determined. Under each condition, the lengths of treated muscle cells were compared with the lengths of untreated control cells. Contraction was expressed in micrometers as the mean decrease in cell length from control. 125I-cAMP, [35S]GTPγS, and myo[3H]inositol were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; polyclonal antibodies to G proteins and PLC-β isoforms from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and all other chemicals from Sigma. The ability of peptide sequences to activate specific G proteins in solubilized tenia coli smooth muscle membranes was determined from the increase in the binding of [35S]GTPγS.Gα complexes to the corresponding Gα antibodies. At a concentration of 100 μm, Peptide 4 (Arg469–Arg485:RRTQQEESNLGKHRELR; basic residues in bold) significantly increased the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gi1α (216 ± 22%) and Gi2α (347 ± 53%), but not to Gi3α, Gsα, or Gq/11α (Table I). Peptide 4 possessed two N-terminal Arg residues and a C-terminalB-B-X-X-B motif, where B and X are basic and non-basic residues, respectively. Peptide 3 (Ile467–Arg482: IERRTQQEESNLGKHR), which lacked the full C-terminal motif of Peptide 4, was less effective increasing the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gi1α and Gi2α by 94 ± 15% and 57 ± 14%, respectively. Peptide 1 (Arg460–Arg470) and Peptide 2 (Gly479–Ala496) had no effect.Table IBinding of [ 35S]GTPγS · Gα complexes to Gα antibodies (cpm/mg protein)Gi1α AbGi2α AbGi3α AbGsα AbGq/11α AbGTPγS alone2348 ± 3032296 ± 1801390 ± 3701842 ± 2631811 ± 431+Peptide 12288 ± 3632586 ± 1921545 ± 3001850 ± 2001925 ± 421+Peptide 22552 ± 2232880 ± 3861470 ± 3501950 ± 2281952 ± 450+Peptide 33692 ± 463ap < 0.05.4450 ± 512bp < 0.01 for difference from GTPγS alone.1545 ± 4441886 ± 2451906 ± 473+Peptide 47427 ± 524bp < 0.01 for difference from GTPγS alone.10282 ± 1452bp < 0.01 for difference from GTPγS alone.1967 ± 4042571 ± 3281943 ± 517CHAPS-solubilized membranes were incubated for 20 min with [35S]GTPγS alone or with various synthetic peptides and then added to wells precoated with various Gα antibodies (Ab).

Values are means ± S.E. (cpm/mg protein) of four experiments. The selective NPR-C ligand, cANP4–23, also increased the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gi1α and Gi2α by 87 ± 11% and 164 ± 9%, respectively, but not to Gi3α, Gsα, or Gq/11α. Peptide 4 (10 μm) enhanced cANP4–23-induced activation of Gi1 and Gi2 to 187 ± 7% (p < 0.01) and 289 ± 15% (p < 0.01), respectively. Peptide 3 enhanced activation of only Gi1 to 102 ± 11%. In contrast, the C-terminal Peptide 2 decreased cANP4–23-induced activation of Gi1 and Gi2 to 28 ± 14% (p < 0.01) and 52 ± 8% (p < 0.01), respectively, whereas Peptide 1 had no effect. The ability of the peptides to stimulate basal PLC-β activity ([3H]inositol phosphate formation) in membranes derived from cultured tenia coli smooth muscle cells paralleled their ability to activate Gi1 and Gi2. Peptide 4 increased basal PLC-β activity in a concentration-dependent fashion (0.1–100 μm) with an EC50 of 1.3 ± 0.4 μm, whereas Peptide 3 was only effective at the highest concentration (100 μm) (Fig. 2). The N-terminal Peptide 1 and the C-terminal Peptide 2 had no effect on basal PLC-β activity (Fig. 2). cANP4–23 increased PLC-β activity in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 0.8 ± 0.2 nm and a threshold concentration of <1 pm. Peptide 4, at an EC50 concentration of 1 μm, augmented the PLC-β response to cANP4–23, shifting the concentration-response curve to the left (Fig.3). In contrast, Peptide 2 (10 μm), which had no effect on basal PLC-β activity, inhibited the PLC-β response to cANP4–23, shifting the concentration-response curve to the right (Fig. 3). The effects of various concentrations of Peptide 4 and Peptide 2 on the maximal PLC-β response to cANP4–23 were also tested. As shown in Fig. 4, Peptide 4 augmented the maximal response to cANP4–23 in a concentration-dependent fashion (maximal increase: 43 ± 5%, p < 0.01), whereas Peptide 2 inhibited the maximal response to cANP4–23 in a concentration-dependent fashion (maximal inhibition: 30 ± 3%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). Peptides 1 and 3 had no effect on the PLC-β response to cANP4–23. A panel of specific antibodies was used to identify the PLC-β isozymes activated by Peptide 4. Pretreatment of muscle membranes for 1 h with a maximally effective concentration (10 μg/ml) of PLC-β3 antibody inhibited PLC-β activity stimulated by Peptide 4 by 84 ± 3% (Fig. 5), whereas pretreatment with PLC-β1, PLC-β2, and PLC-β4 antibodies had no significant effect (range of inhibition: 8 ± 13% to 11 ± 12%). Pretreatment for 1 h with a maximally effective concentration (10 μg/ml) of a common Gβ antibody inhibited PLC-β activity stimulated by Peptide 4 by 78 ± 2% (Fig. 5), whereas pretreatment with Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, Goα, and Gq/11α antibodies had no significant effect (range of inhibition: 10 ± 12% to 14 ± 16%) (Fig. 5). As shown previously for smooth muscle receptors coupled to Gi or Go (19Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 47: 1172-1179Google Scholar), activation of PLC-β3 conforms to a pattern of preferential activation of this PLC-β isozyme by the βγ subunits of inhibitory G proteins. The ability of Peptides 1–4 to induce contraction paralleled their ability to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Contraction was measured in saponin-permeabilized tenia coli smooth muscle cells by scanning micrometry and expressed as mean decrease in muscle cell length from control. Peptide 4 induced contraction in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 0.4 ± 0.1 μm and a maximal contraction of 22.6 ± 0.4 μm, whereas Peptide 3 was effective only at high concentrations (maximal contraction 7.2 ± 0.5 μm) (Fig.6). Peptides 1 and 2 had no significant effect on muscle cell length. However, when added in combination with Peptide 4, Peptide 2 (100 μm) inhibited Peptide 4-induced maximal contraction by 60 ± 8% (p < 0.01). cANP4–23 induced contraction of muscle cells in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 0.6 ± 0.3 nm and a threshold concentration of 1 pm. Peptide 4, at a near-EC50 concentration of 0.1 μm, augmented contraction induced by cANP4–23, shifting the concentration-response curve to the left (Fig.7). In contrast, Peptide 2 (1 μm), which had no effect on contraction, inhibited contraction induced by cANP4–23, shifting the concentration-response curve to the right (Fig. 7). The effects of various concentrations of Peptide 4 and Peptide 2 on maximal contraction induced by cANP4–23 were also tested. As shown in Fig. 8, Peptide 4 augmented contraction induced by cANP4–23 in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, Peptide 2 inhibited contraction induced by cANP4–23 in a concentration-dependent fashion with a maximal inhibition of 52 ± 6% (Fig. 8). Peptides 1 and 3 had no effect on cANP4–23-induced contraction. Freshly dispersed smooth muscle cells were used to examine the ability of Peptides 1–4 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation. At a concentration of 100 μm, Peptide 4 and Peptide 3 inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP (19.1 ± 1.1 pmol/106 cells) by 64 ± 4% and 23 ± 4%, respectively, whereas Peptides 1 and 2 had no effect (Fig.9 A). cANP4–23 (0.1 μm) also inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP by 59 ± 4%; the inhibition by cANP4–23 was accentuated to 84 ± 3% (p < 0.01) in the presence of Peptide 4 and attenuated to 35 ± 4% (p < 0.01) in the presence of Peptide 2 (Fig. 9 B). This study shows that a 17-amino acid sequence in the middle region (Arg469–Arg485) of the 37-amino acid intracellular domain of the NPR-C accounts for the ability of this single-transmembrane receptor to activate pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in various tissues (2Anand-Srivastava M.B. Trachte G.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 455-497PubMed Google Scholar, 7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19324-19329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The sequence possesses two N-terminal basic residues (Arg469, Arg470), and the C-terminal motif,B-B-X-X-B (whereB = basic and X = nonbasic residue) (Fig. 1). A synthetic peptide with this sequence (denoted Peptide 4 in this study) activated selectively Gi1 and Gi2in tenia coli smooth muscle, stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis by activating PLC-β3 via the βγ subunits of both G proteins, inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity via the α subunits, and induced muscle contraction, mimicking in all instances the properties of the selective NPR-C ligand, cANP4–23. The peptide also enhanced the ability of cANP4–23 to activate Gi1 and Gi2, stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, induce contraction, and inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP. The effects of Peptide 4 alone and in combination with cANP4–23 were concentration-dependent. A C-terminal peptide (denoted Peptide 2), which included theB-B-X-X-B motif at its N-terminal (Fig. 1), had no effect by itself but it blocked activation of Gi1 and Gi2 and all cellular responses induced by Peptide 4 and by cANP4–23, suggesting that Peptide 2 bound to, but did not activate Gi1 and Gi2, thus acting as a competitive inhibitor of G protein activation. The ability of Peptide 2 to inhibit responses to Peptide 4 and cANP4–23 was concentration-dependent. The muscle cells were highly sensitive to cANP4–23 (EC500.8 ± 0.2 and 0.6 ± 0.3 nm for activation of PLC-β and stimulation of muscle contraction, respectively). At an EC50 concentration, Peptide 4 augmented the PLC-β and contractile responses to all concentrations of cANP4–23 (Figs. 3 and7). The augmentation was additive suggesting additional recruitment of Gi1 and Gi2 by Peptide 4. Peptide 2 inhibited PLC-β and contractile responses to all concentrations of cANP4–23 (Figs. 3 and 7). The synthetic peptides were designed to include or exclude specific residues in the stimulatory consensus sequence. Thus, Peptide 1, which included at its C terminus the two arginine residues present in the N terminus of Peptide 4, had no effect. Peptide 3, which closely resembled Peptide 4 and included the two N-terminal arginine residues but only a part (i.e. B-B) of the C-terminalB-B-X-X-B motif, was only partially active at the highest concentrations (100 μm), emphasizing the requirement for a complete N-terminal motif. Peptide 2, which retained the completeB-B-X-X-B motif at its C terminus, maintained the ability to bind but not activate G proteins: the pattern emphasized the significance of the location of the B-B-X-X-Bmotif at the C terminus, as well as the requirement for N-terminal arginine residues. As noted above (1Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 2Anand-Srivastava M.B. Trachte G.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 455-497PubMed Google Scholar), NPR-C, unlike NPR-A or NPR-B, is devoid of an intracellular guanylyl cyclase domain. Its truncated intracellular sequence possesses a Gi1/Gi2 binding domain that induces activation or inhibition of other effector enzymes. Activation of NPR-C in tenia coli smooth muscle causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of PLC-β3, resulting in stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+release and muscle contraction (8Murthy K.S.

The activation of PLC-β3 is mediated by the βγ subunits of Gi1 and Gi2; this conforms to a pattern of preferential activation of this PLC-β isozyme by the βγ subunits of inhibitory G proteins, as shown for other smooth muscle receptors coupled to Gi1(somatostatin-3 receptors; Ref. 22Murthy K.S.

Unlike tenia coli smooth muscle cells, gastric and intestinal smooth muscle cells express eNOS (9Teng B.Q. Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G342-G351PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NPR-C in these cells results in preferential activation of eNOS by Gi1/Gi2; the formation of nitric oxide causes sequential activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase and results in muscle relaxation (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although NPR-C is devoid of a membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase domain, its activation by natriuretic peptides can result in relaxation of gastric and intestinal muscle that expresses a G protein-dependent, constitutive NOS (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Teng B.Q. Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G342-G351PubMed Google Scholar). It is probable that the same 17-amino acid consensus sequence represented by Peptide 4 is responsible for the ability of NPR-C to bind Gi1 and Gi2 in gastric smooth muscle and preferentially activate eNOS and inhibit adenylyl cyclase (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1409-C1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potency of the Gi2/Gi1-activating sequence of NPR-C (EC50 ∼1 μm for activation of PLC-β3 and ∼0.5 μm for stimulation of muscle contraction) was similar to that of the Gi2-activating sequence located in the C-terminal region of the multitransmembrane polycystin-1 receptor (14Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The potency of both sequences may be related to the presence of dual N-terminal arginine residues and arginine or lysine residues in the C-terminal motif. As noted by Okamoto et al. (11Okamoto T. Katada T. Murayama Y. Ui M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), substitution of one basic residue for another altered the potency of the Gi2-activating sequence of IGF II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor in the order of arginine > lysine > histidine. Preferential activation of Gi2 appears to be a common feature of the intracellular consensus sequences not only of NPR-C, but also of the polycystin-1 and the IGF II receptors (11Okamoto T. Katada T.

A similar consensus in the terminal region of the third cytoplasmic loop of the β2-adrenergic receptor couples preferentially to Gs; phosphorylation of Ser262 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase decreased affinity for Gs and enhanced coupling to Gi1 (15Okamoto T.

It is possible that phosphorylation of serine residues in the middle or C-terminal regions of the intracellular domain of NPR-C could alter its coupling to G proteins. NPR-C is the predominant natriuretic peptide receptor in visceral and vascular smooth muscle and possesses high affinity for all natriuretic peptides (7Murthy K.S. Teng B.Q. Jin J.G. Makhlouf G.M.

Binding of these peptides to NPR-C, as a prelude to their recycling and degradation, activates G protein-dependent pathways linked to several effector enzymes. In smooth muscle cells (e.g. gastric and intestinal smooth muscle) that express eNOS, G protein activation leads to NO formation and muscle relaxation. In smooth muscle cells devoid of eNOS (e.g. tenia coli), G protein activation leads to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and muscle contraction."

SERT is the major binding site in the brain for antidepressant drugs, and it also binds amphetamines and cocaine. The ability of various molecular chaperones to interact with a tagged version of SERT (Myc-SERT) was investigated using the baculovirus expression system. Overexpression of Myc-SERT using the baculovirus system led to substantial quantities of inactive transporter, together with small amounts of fully active and, therefore, correctly folded molecules. The high levels of inactive Myc-SERT probably arose because folding was rate-limiting due, perhaps, to insufficient molecular chaperones. Therefore, Myc-SERT was co-expressed with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) molecular chaperones calnexin, calreticulin and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), and the foldase, ERp57. The expression of functional Myc-SERT, as determined by an inhibitor binding assay, was enhanced nearly 3-fold by co-expressing calnexin, and to a lesser degree on co-expression of calreticulin and BiP. Co-expression of ERp57 did not increase the functional expression of Myc-SERT. A physical interaction between Myc-SERT-calnexin and Myc-SERT-calreticulin was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. These associations were inhibited in vivo by deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of N-glycan precusor trimming that is known to prevent the calnexin/calreticulin-N-glycan interaction. Functional expression of the unglycosylated SERT mutant, SERT-QQ, was also increased on co-expression of calnexin, suggesting that the interaction between calnexin and SERT is not entirely dictated by theN-glycan.

SERT is of particular pharmacological interest, because it is the primary binding site in the brain for antidepressant drugs, and it also interacts with cocaine and amphetamines (4Ritz M.C. Cone E.J. Kuhar M.J. Life Sci. 1990; 46: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 5Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1817-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). All members of this family share two structural characteristics, namely 12 putative transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop between transmembrane domain 3 and transmembrane domain 4. This particular loop is glycosylated in all members of the family, although the number of potential N-glycans varies between 1 and 4, and the sites of glycosylation are not absolutely conserved. SERT has two N-glycans in this region, and their importance for its activity has been tested by altering the consensusN-glycosylation sequence from Asn-X-Ser/Thr to Gln-X-Ser/Thr; deletion of both N-glycosylation sites in SERT neither changed the K m for serotonin uptake nor the K d for binding of the inhibitor RTI55 (6Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the number of functional molecules of SERT/cell decreased to 5% that of the levels of fully glycosylated SERT, suggesting thatN-glycosylation plays an important role in either the initial folding of SERT or for its stability in the membrane (6Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family were later shown to share this characteristic with SERT (7Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In addition to N-glycosylation, the large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 may also contain a disulfide bond between two Cys residues 8 amino acids apart. Alteration of either Cys residue severely reduced cell surface expression of functional SERT or the dopamine transporter, but replacement of both Cys residues led to only a slight reduction in activity (10Wang J.B. Moriwaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 1995: 1416-1419Google Scholar, 11Chen J.-G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The two Cys residues proposed to form the disulfide bond are absolutely conserved throughout this neurotransmitter transporter family, suggesting that the disulfide bond may be another essential structural feature for efficient, stable, cell surface expression.Molecular chaperones are a diverse collection of proteins that interact transiently with unfolded and misfolded proteins, thus preventing improper protein-protein interactions until the protein folds correctly (reviewed in Refs. 12Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M.

Sci. 1994; 19: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When the protein reaches its final correct three-dimensional structure, the molecular chaperone is released. If the protein never folds correctly, then the interaction between the molecular chaperone and the misfolded protein may be more stable (12Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev.

Most molecular chaperones, including immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), interact directly with the polypeptide chain of the unfolded protein (23Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but two molecular chaperones (calnexin and calreticulin) have been shown to interact primarily with a precursor N-glycan attached to the proteins (24Hammond C.

Calnexin contains a single transmembrane domain that anchors it to the ER, where it is thought to play a crucial role in retention of misfolded proteins (24Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc.

Despite being related at the sequence level, calreticulin and calnexin often show different binding characteristics to an unfolded protein (27Vassilakos A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol.

The protein disulfide isomerase ERp57 also acts only on N-glycosylated proteins (32Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 33Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but this is because of its recruitment by either calnexin or calreticulin (34Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The requirement of the neurotransmitter transporters for N-glycosylation for efficient functional expression suggests that N-glycan-specific molecular chaperones and foldases may be involved in their synthesis. In this paper we test this hypothesis by the co-expression of calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 with SERT in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system.The baculovirus expression system is currently used to overexpress many glycosylated integral membrane proteins in sufficient quantities for purification and structural studies (35Grisshammer R. Tate C.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 315-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 36Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Expression of SERT in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses normally results in about 500,000 copies/cell of functional SERT (determined by a binding assay using the cocaine analogue 125I-RTI55) and substantially greater amounts of inactive transporter (6Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of inactive, unglycosylated, transporter increases dramatically after day 2 post-infection when there is no further increase in the amount of functional SERT expressed. One explanation for this is that the folding of SERT, presumably co-translational (37Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), has become uncoupled from membrane insertion and protein translation. If folding has become the rate-limiting step during the overexpression of SERT, then increasing the amounts of specific molecular chaperones or foldases that help SERT to fold could increase the amount of functional SERT expressed. Consequently, a selection of different folding assistance factors, including the N-glycan binding molecular chaperones (calnexin, calreticulin), an Hsp70 family member (BiP), and the foldase ERp57 were co-expressed with SERT in insect cells to examine their roles in the generation of active SERT. The specific folding factors required by SERT in vivo are not yet known, so any molecular chaperones or foldases that improve the overexpression of functional SERT in insect cells can be regarded as potential candidates for assisting the folding of SERT in native tissues.DISCUSSIONThe serotonin transporter is a complex integral membrane protein composed of 12 transmembrane regions that requiresN-glycosylation for efficient folding and stability (6Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the presence of a putative disulfide bond for activity (11Chen J.-G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the production of Myc-SERT is enhanced by at least three molecular chaperones. The interactions between Myc-SERT and the molecular chaperones was investigated in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. The presence of large quantities of inactive Myc-SERT expressed in insect cells suggested that folding might be rate-limiting for the production of functional Myc-SERT using the baculovirus expression system. In this study, the role of molecular chaperones in generating active Myc-SERT was investigated, and we found that co-expression of three molecular chaperones increased the amount of functional SERT expressed. The role of these chaperones may be to retain Myc-SERT in a folding-competent conformation and prevent nonspecific aggregation. Calnexin was the most successful of the co-expressed molecular chaperones, improving functional Myc-SERT expression by nearly 3-fold. Smaller increases in functional Myc-SERT expression were also seen on co-expression of calreticulin and BiP. In addition, specific interactions between Myc-SERT and calnexin, and Myc-SERT and calreticulin, were confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. It was not possible to demonstrate an interaction between BiP and Myc-SERT in the same way because of nonspecific interactions in the immunoprecipitation. The N-glycan-specific protein disulfide isomerase, ERp57, did not increase functional Myc-SERT expression either in the presence or absence of other molecular chaperones.Increased expression of functional Myc-SERT was a consequence of molecular chaperone activity and not because of increases in transcription or translation. This was apparent from Western blots of membranes prepared from cells co-expressing Myc-SERT and the molecular chaperones calnexin and BiP (Fig. 2). The levels of unglycosylated and glycosylated Myc-SERT did not increase in parallel with the increases in functional Myc-SERT determined from inhibitor binding, suggesting that the increases were because of better folding of Myc-SERT in the presence of molecular chaperones. In fact co-expression of calnexin and/or BiP actually decreased the amount of inactive Myc-SERT expressed. This was particularly apparent on co-expression of Myc-SERT, calnexin, and BiP, where on day 1 p.i., glycosylated and unglycosylated Myc-SERT represented 8 and 3%, respectively, of the control levels on a Western blot, despite containing equal amounts of functional SERT. A number of possible mechanisms could explain this decrease in nonfunctional Myc-SERT expression, including increased proteolysis of misfolded Myc-SERT or perhaps decreased rates of translation because of better coupling between folding and translation.The simplest explanations for the large increase in functional Myc-SERT expression on co-expression of calnexin are that there is little or no calnexin expressed in insect cells or that insect calnexin does not interact with Myc-SERT. This was suggested from expressing Myc-SERT in the presence of dNJM. The generation of the monoglucosylatedN-glycan precursor is prevented by dNJM; hence, dNJM is expected to prevent calnexin from interacting with Myc-SERT in vivo, as we have observed. However, in the absence of co-expressed calnexin, dNJM has little effect on functional Myc-SERT expression, suggesting that the folding of Myc-SERT in insect cells is not dependent on an insect calnexin. At this stage, it cannot be determined whether there is no endogenous insect calnexin in the cells or whether there is calnexin and that it does not interact with Myc-SERT like mammalian calnexin. Western blots of insect cell membranes using antibodies to mammalian calnexin showed weakly cross-reacting proteins, but it is not clear whether they represent calnexin homologues. Sf9 cells may not be the only insect cells to lack calnexin activity, because this has also been reported for aDrosophila cell line (53Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).The large increase in levels of functional Myc-SERT caused by co-expressing calnexin warranted a further investigation of the interaction between them. Therefore, an unglycosylated SERT mutant, SERT-QQ, was co-expressed with calnexin. Surprisingly, calnexin was capable of increasing the functional expression of SERT-QQ. Co-immunoprecipitations suggested that there was no measurable interaction between calnexin and SERT-QQ. However, this does not mean that there was never any transient association between SERT-QQ and calnexin, because any such interaction may well have been disrupted by digitonin solubilization before immunoprecipitation. This would be likely if calnexin interacted with SERT via its transmembrane region, as has been suggested for the association between calnexin andP-glycoprotein (54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The interaction between SERT-QQ and calnexin also seemed to be inhibited by dNJM. The most straightforward conclusion is that dNJM can interact directly with calnexin and prevent its function as a molecular chaperone; this may not be surprising given that glucosidase II, which is inhibited by dNJM, recognizes the identical monoglucosylated N-glycan precursor as calnexin. An alternative explanation is that a small proportion of SERT-QQ isN-glycosylated, but this seems unlikely as there are no other consensus N-glycosylation sites predicted to be in SERT facing the ER lumen, including the rarely used consensus Asn-X-Cys (see for example Ref. 55Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11397-11404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results could also be explained by an indirect effect of calnexin on SERT-QQi.e. calnexin improved the folding of another unidentified molecular chaperone in insect cells that then helped SERT-QQ to fold.The experiments described in Fig. 1, a–c all use a tagged version of SERT (Myc-SERT), with the tags at the N and C termini predicted to be in the cytoplasm. The molecular chaperones and foldases BiP, CRT, and ERp57 are all present in the ER lumen and, therefore, cannot interact directly with tags. The functional domain of calnexin is in the ER lumen, but it also has a single transmembrane domain and a short C-terminal domain that is in the cytoplasm. Thus the tags on SERT could only potentially interact directly with the C terminus of calnexin. However, although the C terminus of calnexin is essential for the proper localization of calnexin in the ER, it is not believed to be required for function of calnexin (34Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Given the intracellular distribution of the molecular chaperones, it was surprising that the presence of the tags on SERT affected the ability of molecular chaperones to improve the expression of the transporter (Fig. 1). In addition, the amount of functional Myc-SERT per cell does not differ appreciably from the amount of functional untagged SERT per cell when they are expressed independently. Yet co-expression of calnexin with Myc-SERT led to a 3-fold improvement in functional activity as compared with a 1.4-fold improvement in expression of untagged SERT. It is possible that the tags on SERT are having a subtle effect on either the folding pathway or kinetics of folding, which provide a greater opportunity for the co-expressed molecular chaperones to bind and have an effect. Presumably, in the absence of additional tags, SERT can be folded sufficiently using the molecular chaperones naturally found in insect cells, and additional molecular chaperones therefore have little effect.We have shown that the folding of Myc-SERT in vivo can be assisted by the molecular chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, and BiP. In addition, it has recently been shown that the foldase NinaA, a membrane-bound peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase fromDrosophila, can increase the cell surface expression of the dopamine transporter (56Lenhard T. Reilander H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a homologue of SERT. Elucidating the role of molecular chaperones and foldases in the folding of SERT will not only lead to an understanding of how complex membrane proteins fold, but it will also help us to overexpress proteins for subsequent purification and structural analysis. Many membrane proteins are expressed very poorly in heterologous expression systems (35Grisshammer R. Tate C.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 315-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 36Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and this may be a direct consequence of the lack of specific molecular chaperones in the cell lines used. Alternatively, there may be insufficient amounts of molecular chaperones to cope with the high level of protein translation induced in most heterologous expression systems. For example, recombinant IgG secretion from insect cells is enhanced by co-expressing BiP or protein disulfide isomerase (57Hsu T.A. Betenbaugh M.J. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 58Hsu T.A. Watson S. Eiden J.J. Betenbaugh M.-J. Prot. Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, co-expressing multiple molecular chaperones simultaneously has not been successful, suggesting that their relative levels of expression may require careful modulation. The inclusion of several chaperones and foldases on one virus, and the use of vectors including lower strength promoters, such as IE1 or the basic protein promoter, may help to rectify this limitation. The serotonin transporter (SERT) 1The abbreviations used are: SERT, serotonin transporter; SERT-QQ, unglycosylated serotonin transporter mutant; dNJM, 1-deoxynojirimycin; CXN, calnexin; CRT, calreticulin; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; RTI55 (β-CIT), 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST, Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20; p.i., post-infection. 1The abbreviations used are: SERT, serotonin transporter; SERT-QQ, unglycosylated serotonin transporter mutant; dNJM, 1-deoxynojirimycin; CXN, calnexin; CRT, calreticulin; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; RTI55 (β-CIT), 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST, Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20; p.i., post-infection. is a member of a small family of integral membrane proteins that transport neurotransmitters and osmolytes into cells by coupling uptake to the influx of Na+ and Cl− ions down their concentration gradients (reviewed in Refs 1Borowsky B.

SERT is of particular pharmacological interest, because it is the primary binding site in the brain for antidepressant drugs, and it also interacts with cocaine and amphetamines (4Ritz M.C. Cone E.J. Kuhar M.J. Life Sci. 1990; 46: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 5Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1817-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). All members of this family share two structural characteristics, namely 12 putative transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop between transmembrane domain 3 and transmembrane domain 4. This particular loop is glycosylated in all members of the family, although the number of potential N-glycans varies between 1 and 4, and the sites of glycosylation are not absolutely conserved. SERT has two N-glycans in this region, and their importance for its activity has been tested by altering the consensusN-glycosylation sequence from Asn-X-Ser/Thr to Gln-X-Ser/Thr; deletion of both N-glycosylation sites in SERT neither changed the K m for serotonin uptake nor the K d for binding of the inhibitor RTI55 (6Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the number of functional molecules of SERT/cell decreased to 5% that of the levels of fully glycosylated SERT, suggesting thatN-glycosylation plays an important role in either the initial folding of SERT or for its stability in the membrane (6Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family were later shown to share this characteristic with SERT (7Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol.

In addition to N-glycosylation, the large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 may also contain a disulfide bond between two Cys residues 8 amino acids apart. Alteration of either Cys residue severely reduced cell surface expression of functional SERT or the dopamine transporter, but replacement of both Cys residues led to only a slight reduction in activity (10Wang J.B. Moriwaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 1995: 1416-1419Google Scholar, 11Chen J.-G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2323767042,"HGF/NK2, a naturally occurring truncated HGF isoform, antagonizes the mitogenic and morphogenic activities of full length HGF, but stimulates cell scatter, or the motogenic response to HGF. We studied postreceptor signaling by these HGF isoforms in the human breast epithelial cell line 184B5, and in murine myeloid progenitor 32D cells transfected with c-Met, the human HGF receptor (32D/c-Met). HGF stimulated DNA synthesis in 184B5 and 32D/c-Met cells, while HGF/NK2 was mitogenically inactive, despite the ability of HGF/NK2 to stimulate c-Met autophosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in both cell systems. In 184B5 cells, HGF stimulated sustained MAPK activation, while activation by HGF/NK2 declined rapidly. In contrast, both isoforms activated MAPK with rapidly attenuated kinetics in 32D/c-Met cells. In both cell systems the increased motility observed in response to either HGF or HGF/NK2 treatment was more potently blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin, than by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK1). These data suggest that (1) alternative HGF isoforms signaling through c-Met generate both common and distinct biological responses, (2) the extent and duration of ligand-stimulated c-Met and MAPK activities are dependent on the cellular context and are not predictive of mitogenic signaling, and (3) in at least some HGF target cells, the activation of both MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways is insufficient for mitogenesis elicited through c-Met."
https://openalex.org/W2051285216,"Nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-1 appears to be important for the expression of several respiratory genes, but there is no direct evidence that NRF-1 transduces a physiological signal into the production of an enzyme critical for mitochondrial biogenesis. We generated HeLa cells containing plasmids allowing doxycycline-inducible expression of uncoupling protein (UCP)-1. In the absence of doxycycline, UCP-1 mRNA and protein were undetectable. In the presence of doxycycline, UCP-1 was expressed and oxygen consumption doubled. This rise in oxygen consumption was associated with an increase in NRF-1 mRNA. It was also associated with an increase in NRF-1 protein binding activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a functional NRF-1 binding site from the δ-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase promoter. Respiratory uncoupling also caused a time-dependent increase in protein levels of ALA synthase, an early marker for mitochondrial biogenesis. ALA synthase induction by respiratory uncoupling was prevented by transfecting cells with an oligonucleotide antisense to the region of the NRF-1 initiation codon; a scrambled oligonucleotide with the same base composition had no effect. Respiratory uncoupling increases oxygen consumption and lowers energy reserves. In HeLa cells, uncoupling also increases ALA synthase, an enzyme critical for mitochondrial respiration, but only if translatable mRNA for NRF-1 is available. These data suggest that the transcription factor NRF-1 plays a key role in cellular adaptation to energy demands by translating physiological signals into an increased capacity for generating energy."
https://openalex.org/W2133241367,"Prostate carcinoma (PCA) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in American men. PCA at advanced stages can both proliferate abnormally and resist apoptosis. Among the many known signal transduction pathways, phosphatidylinositide-3′OH kinase (PI3-kinase) has been shown to play an important role in cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. In this study, we investigate the involvement of Etk/Bmx, a newly discovered tyrosine kinase that is a substrate of PI3-kinase, in protection of prostate cancer cells from apoptosis. Parental LNCaP cells and two derivative cell lines, one overexpressing wild type Etk (Etkwt) and the other expressing a dominant negative Etk (EtkDN), were used to study the function of Etk. The cells were treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), a newly approved cancer treatment which employs a photosensitizer and visible light to produce an oxidative stress in cells, often leading to apoptosis. Our results indicate that PDT induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells, as measured by DNA fragmentation and by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and moreover, the extent of apoptosis was much reduced in Etkwt cells as compared to LNCaP or EtkDN cells. Assay of overall cell viability confirmed that Etkwt cells were considerably less sensitive to PDT than were the parental LNCaP or EtkDN cells. Similar results were found in response to thapsigargin (TG). A specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase, LY294002, abolished Etk activity and markedly increased TG-induced PARP cleavage. The results suggest that Etk/Bmx is an efficient effector of PI3-kinase and that the newly described PI3-kinase/Etk pathway is involved in the protection of prostate carcinoma cells from apoptosis in response to PDT or TG."

Our results showed that the primary Rev binding site is a core stem-loop RNA molecule of 30 nucleotides that bound Rev at a 1:1 ratio, whereas the 244-nucleotide full-length RRE bound four Rev monomers. At high Rev concentrations, additional binding of Rev to RRE was observed with ratios of more than 10:1. Because RRE mutants that lacked the core binding site and were inactive in vivobound Rev nonspecifically at these concentrations, the real stoichiometric ratio of Rev-RRE is probably closer to 4:1. Binding affinity of Rev for RRE was approximately 10−10m, whereas the affinity for the core RNA was about 10−11m, the difference being due to the contribution of low affinity binding sites on the RRE. Mathematical analysis suggested cooperativity of Rev binding, probably mediated by the Rev oligomerization domains. C-terminal deletions of Rev had no effect on RRE binding, but truncation of the N terminus by as few as 11 residues significantly reduced binding specificity.

According to their model, the larger RRE is deemed to act as a “molecular rheostat,” which binds multiple Rev monomers up to a functionally optimal threshold of 10–12 Rev monomers per RNA molecule. Furthermore, although a number of groups have demonstrated that a single Rev monomer bound to a high affinity site on the RRE, after which additional Rev molecules were recruited through protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions (20Cochrane A.W. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 881-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Tiley L.S. Malim M.H. Tewary H.K. Stockley P.G. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Rev-RRE interaction has been extensively studied, a number of fundamental questions remain to be answered. These include whether Rev acts solely to transport RRE-containing RNA to the cytoplasm or also actively inhibits splicing, the precise number of Rev monomers bound to each RRE, whether Rev monomers bind sequentially or in oligomeric form and whether this binding is cooperative, and precise knowledge of the various rate constants of Rev-RRE binding. We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements (see Refs. 63Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 64Malmqvist M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar for review) to determine the kinetics of Rev-RRE binding. We developed a novel approach to bind RNA to the sensor surface. Rev in solution was then passed through the flow cell under conditions that allowed Rev-RRE interaction. The accumulation of macromolecules on the sensor surface alters the refractive index of the solution in the vicinity of the surface, which is detected and quantified by the instrument, Biacore 2000 (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Depending on the binding conditions, initial velocity or steady-state kinetic data can be collected in real time. Our results show that RRE can be subdivided into the following: 1) a minimal site that interacts with one molecule of Rev, 2) a core site that can bind at least two Rev monomers, and 3) the full-length RRE that binds four Rev molecules. With excess Rev concentration, additional binding to other low affinity sites was observed. The high affinity interactions were very strong and specific, with K D values in the 10−10 to 10−11m range. Finally, this method can be used to rapidly and conveniently investigate RNA-protein interactions in general and was quite useful in rapidly evaluating the effects RNA and protein mutations on the binding, as well as inhibitors of these interactions. The RRE element had been subcloned form the proviral plasmid pNL432 (positions 7749–7992, 244 base pairs) as described (47Holland S.M. Ahmad N. Maitra R.K. Wingfield P. Venkatesan S. J.

Full-length RNA tagged at the 3′-end with (A)18 was purified by hybridization to oligo(dT)25 linked magnetic beads (Dynal Corp., A.S., Oslo, Norway) as follows. The beads (50 μl) were washed twice as described by the manufacturer in deionized water and once in hybridization buffer (30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 450 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and suspended in 25 μl of the same buffer. Freshly transcribed RNA (1 μmol) in 25 μl of hybridization buffer was added to the beads and incubated with occasional mixing for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were immobilized with a magnet and washed twice with 100 μl of fresh hybridization buffer. Bound RNA was eluted by adding 50 μl of deionized water and incubating for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were again immobilized using a magnet and the eluted RNA was ethanol precipitated and made up to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mmEDTA). HIV-1 Rev and Nef proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli from the thermally inducible coliphage λ pL promoter and purified as described (66Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Payton M.A. Venkatesan S.M. Misra M. Steven A.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Before use in these experiments, the previously purified Rev protein was reassessed by gel electrophoresis and gel filtration under denaturing conditions. The RRE RNA binding potential was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and filter binding assays as described (47Holland S.M. Ahmad N. Maitra R.K. Wingfield P. Venkatesan S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5966-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Holland S.M. Chavez M. Gerstberger S. Venkatesan S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3699-3706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo functional potential of Rev protein and Rev domain peptides were determined by protein transfection (67Cochrane A.W. Chen C.H. Kramer R. Tomchak L. Rosen C.A. Virology. 1989; 173: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in Rev-dependent HIV-1 gag expression assay essentially as described (47Holland S.M. Ahmad N. Maitra R.K. Wingfield P.

Wild type Rev fused to MS coliphage-2 coat protein (MS2-C) and mutant versions of Rev in the same context were expressed in E. coli (68Venkatesan S. Gerstberger S.M. Park H. Holland S.M. Nam Y.-S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7469-7480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), molecularly tagged to maltose-binding protein. For SPR use, the maltose-binding protein moiety was excised by protease X digestion and further purified as described (68Venkatesan S. Gerstberger S.M. Park H. Holland S.M. Nam Y.-S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7469-7480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different Rev peptides used in this study were purified by two cycles of reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on C18 columns, and their purity was checked by automated Edman degradation through 30 or 40 cycles and mass spectrometry. RRE RNA binding potential of individual peptides was also determined by EMSA and filter binding assay in the presence of heparin, but without tRNA competitor (47Holland S.M. Ahmad N. Maitra R.K. Wingfield P. Venkatesan S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5966-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Holland S.M. Chavez M. Gerstberger S. Venkatesan S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3699-3706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Biacore 2000TM instrument was used throughout this study. A 5′-biotin U-(dT)18 oligomer (5 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl) was bound to the surface of streptavidin-coated sensor chips (Biacore Inc.) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 10 min. The chips were then washed 5 times with 25 μl each of 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 5 μl/min to stabilize the surface prior to the binding of RNA. (A)18 containing RRE RNAs were immobilized in each flow cell by hybridization to the 5′-biotin U-(dT)18oligomer in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 450 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) at a flow rate of 1 μl/min at 25 °C. The duration of each injection was varied depending on the surface RNA density that was desired for each individual experiment. All RNAs were activated by sequential incubation at 42 °C, at room temperature, and on ice, each for 10 min in running buffer prior to injection over the sensor chip. Following RNA loading, 20 μl of protein dissociation buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) was passed over the surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min to ensure that all RNAs were tightly bound. In general, RNA chips with between 10 response units (RUs) (low density) and 200 RUs (high density) immobilized RNA were used in the various experiments. Purified protein in running buffer was passed over the RNA surface through multiple rounds at a flow rate of 10–100 μl/min depending on whether data pertaining to steady-state or initial velocity conditions were to be collected. Bound proteins were completely removed after each round of injection by passing 20 μl of dissociation buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min over the sensor surface. This treatment did not remove more than 1% of bound RNA over the course of the experiment. To regenerate the surface, the RNA was completely removed by injecting 75 μl of 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 25 μl/min, allowing the sensor chip to be reused multiple times. Nonlinear fitting of the primary sensogram data was used to calculate the association and dissociation rate constants using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Biacore Inc.) and as recommended (69O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 70Schuck P. Minton A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constants,k d1 andk d2, for two parallel dissociation reactions, were derived for Rev binding to RRE, RRE/T, and RRE/HH using the equation, R(t)=R1e−kd1(t−to)+(Ro−R1)e−kd2(t−to)(Eq. 1) where R(t) is the response at timet (in seconds), R o is the total response at the start of dissociation at t o,R 1 is the contribution toR 0 from component 1, (R o −R 1) is the contribution to R ofrom component 2. The association rate constants,k a1 andk a2, for Rev binding to two ligand components on RRE, RRE/T, and RRE/HH were then derived using the equation, R(t)=Req1(1−e−(ka1C+kd1)(t−to))+Req2(1−e−(ka2C+kd2)(t−to))(Eq. 2) where R eq1 andR eq2 are the steady state response levels for components 1 and 2, respectively, C is the molar concentration of the analyte, and t o is the start time for association. The dissociation rate constant,k d, for Rev binding to the single site on RRE/SLIIB was derived using the eq"

The antibody-induced inactivation of PAI-1 labeled with the fluorescent probeN,N′-dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) ethylene diamine (NBD) at P9 in the RCL caused a fluorescence enhancement and shift identical to those accompanying the spontaneous conversion of the P9·NBD PAI-1 to the latent form. Like latent PAI-1, antibody-inactivated PAI-1 was protected from cleavage by elastase. The rate constants for MA-33B8 binding, measured by NBD fluorescence or inactivation, were similar (1.3–1.8 × 104m−1 s−1), resulting in a 4000-fold faster inactivation at 4.2 μm antibody binding sites. The apparent antibody binding rate constant, at least 1000 times slower than one limited by diffusion, indicates that exposure of its epitope depends on an unfavorable equilibrium of PAI-1. Our observations are consistent with this idea and suggest that the equilibrium involves partial insertion of the RCL into sheet A: latent, RCL-cleaved, and tPA-complexed PAI-1, which are inactive loop-inserted forms, bound much faster than active PAI-1 to MA-33B8, whereas two loop-extracted forms of PAI-1, modified to prevent loop insertion, did not bind or bound much more weakly to the antibody.

Its most prominent features are the major, 5-stranded β-sheet A, which can accommodate an additional strand in position 4, and a flexible reactive center loop (RCL) of about 20 residues denoted P15-P5′ (1Schechter I.

The acyl-enzyme complex is stabilized by insertion of the cleaved RCL as strand 4 of β-sheet A, accompanied by a translocation of the acylated enzyme from its initial binding site to its “locking” site. If RCL insertion is hindered by mutating the P14 threonine to an arginine (5Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by blocking position 4 of β-sheet A with a peptide analog of the P14-P7 part of the RCL (6Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27942-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), PAI-1 becomes a substrate that is completely hydrolyzed at the scissile bond by its target proteinases. PAI-1 is the only serpin known to fold spontaneously to an inactive latent form (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symerski J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and the t ½ for this conversion is 9.5 h at 25 °C and pH 7.4 (6Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

In this process, the P15-P3 portion of the RCL, which is normally exposed at the apex of the molecule, is inserted as strand 4 in β-sheet A, forcing the remainder of the loop, including the reactive center, to adopt an extended conformation alongside the protein scaffold. The term “latent” was introduced because PAI-1 traditionally has been isolated in the inactive form, and its activity was partly restored by transient treatment with chaotropic agents (9Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the absence of such treatment, however, formation of latent PAI-1 is a virtually irreversible process (6Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27942-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1 has greater thermal stability than native PAI-1 (10Katagiri K. Okada K. Hattori H. Yano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and its reactive center is unreactive with proteinase. Another marker for the conversion is that in the latent form, the RCL is protected from cleavage by elastase (11Wu K. Urano T. Irata H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of murine monoclonal antibodies against the human tPA·PAI-1 complex have been documented with respect to their effect on the structure and function of PAI-1: one type inactivates PAI-1 so it neither forms a covalent complex with its target enzymes nor is hydrolyzed at the scissile bond; the second type inactivates PAI-1 by making it a substrate for its target proteinases (12Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present work focuses on one particular antibody of the first type, denoted MA-33B8, which has been observed to inactivate PAI-1 rapidly (13Shore J.D. Debrock S. Day D.E. Verhamme I. Declerck P.J. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins.in: Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 425. Plenum Press, New York1996: 300-301Google Scholar). Studies using a phage-displayed library of PAI-1 peptides or site-directed mutagenesis have failed to identify the epitope for MA-33B8 2P. Declerck., S. Debrock, and N. Vleugels, unpublished observations. 2P. Declerck., S. Debrock, and N. Vleugels, unpublished observations. and the mechanism by which it inactivates PAI-1 remains obscure. Binding of the antibody can shield the reactive center bond in PAI-1 from proteinase by one of two mechanisms. We must assume either that antibody binding interferes sterically with binding of the proteinase or that antibody binding induces a conformational change that translocates the reactive center into a shielded position, which would be the case if the active-to-latent conversion was triggered by the antibody. We have previously shown that the S338C mutant PAI-1, with the cysteine at P9 in the RCL, and labeled with NBD at the mercapto group (P9·NBD PAI-1), responds to the spontaneous conversion to the latent form by a marked increase and a distinct blue shift of the NBD fluorescence and that these changes are caused by loop insertion (8Shore J.D.

The fluorescence enhancement is consistent with a translocation of the NBD probe from a solvent exposed environment of the extracted RCL of active PAI-1 to the more shielded position in the latent form between apolar groups in the tip of the helix F loop and β-sheet A, respectively. Similar fluorescence changes were observed after reacting P9·NBD PAI-1 with tPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and trypsin, as well as with elastase, all of which cleave the RCL and trigger insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A, whereas no changes resulted from complexing P9·NBD PAI-1 with trypsin and tPA after these had been inactivated by converting their catalytic triad serine residues to dehydroalanine and alanine, respectively (8Shore J.D.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the antibody-accelerated inactivation of P9·NBD PAI-1 occurs concomitant with changes in the NBD fluorescence that were within experimental error identical to those characterizing the spontaneous inactivation of the labeled mutant. We also show that the differences between active and latent PAI-1 in susceptibility to hydrolysis by elastase are reproduced by the antibody-induced inactivation of PAI-1. Using either the fluorescence increase of P9·NBD PAI-1 or the inactivation of wild type PAI-1 as a signal, we measured second order rate constants for MA-33B8 binding of the order of 104m−1 s−1. The second order rate constants determined for the antibody antigen interaction usually fall within the range 106-107m−1 s−1 (15Björquist P. Ehnebom J. Inghardt T. Deinum J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Rajpal A. Taylor M.G. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), approaching the limit set by molecular diffusion. The much lower rate constant for binding MA-33B8 to PAI-1 suggests an extra step in the binding of MA-33B8 to PAI-1, involving an unfavorable conformational change in PAI-1. To determine whether this conformational change involves loop insertion, various loop-inserted forms of PAI-1, as well as two loop-exposed variants with a documented reduced rate of loop insertion, were tested for their ability to compete with P9·NBD PAI-1 for binding to MA-33B8. These measurements revealed a striking difference in reactivity, consistent with antibody binding to a site on PAI-1 that is exposed only when the RCL is inserted into β-sheet A. Studies involving the complexes of P9·NBD PAI-1 with heparin and vitronectin indicate that binding of these ligands does not interfere with binding of MA-33B8. If not otherwise indicated, spectral and kinetic measurements were performed at pH 7.4 and 25 °C in a reaction buffer containing 0.1m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000. Fluorescence measurements were performed using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength used for studying NBD fluorescence was 480 nm. Sample cuvettes were coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 to reduce protein adsorption. Protein analysis by SDS-PAGE was performed under nonreducing conditions according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Pancreatic elastase and analytical grade buffer chemicals were from Sigma. Commercial USP heparin (M r 16,000) was from Diosynth BV (Oss, The Netherlands), and native vitronectin was from Dr. D. Mosher (University of Wisconsin). SpectrozymetPA(methyl-sulfonyl-d-cyclohexyltyrosyl-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide) was from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Chromatography materials were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The octapeptide NAc-TVASSSTA was provided by the University of Michigan Protein Facility (Ann Arbor, MI). Human wild type PAI-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pET24d (9Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The T333R (P14 Arg) and S338C (P9 Cys) PAI-1 single mutants, as well as a PAI-1 carrying both mutations, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis as described elsewhere (9Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PAI-1 was purified and separated into the active and latent forms according to a previous report from this laboratory (18Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PAI-1 protein concentrations were measured at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 0.93 ml mg−1 cm−1 and a M r of 43,000 (19Vaughan D.E. Declerck P.J. Reilly T.M. Park K. Collen D. Fasman G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mercapto group of the P9 Cys PAI-1 mutant was labeled with NBD (Molecular Probes) as described previously (8Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To quantitate latent PAI-1, formed in storage or handling, unlabeled and P9·NBD-labeled PAI-1 preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after reaction with excess two-chain tPA. Unlabeled and P9·NBD PAI-1 were complexed with the octapeptide NAc-TVASSSTA as described elsewhere (6Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27942-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and excess peptide was removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column. In the preparation with native PAI-1, latent PAI-1, formed in the process, was removed by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (18Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Analysis of the product by SDS-PAGE, before and after addition of tPA, indicated that it was free of active PAI-1 and contained less than 1% (latent) PAI-1 that was not hydrolyzed by tPA. The PAI-1·octapeptide complex is very stable and does not release the octapeptide even during prolonged dialysis (6Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27942-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or after cleavage of the RCL by plasminogen activators, as demonstrated below. PAI-1 hydrolyzed at the P3-P4 peptide bond in the RCL was prepared with elastase, using 50 μm PAI-1 and 50 nm enzyme. Elastase was removed by affinity chromatography on immobilized heparin (9Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which binds PAI-1 but not elastase. The tPA·PAI-1 complex was generated by incubation of PAI-1 (5 μm) with two-chain tPA (8 μm) for 30 min in the reaction buffer at room temperature. Excess tPA was inactivated by treatment with p-amidino-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm). Human recombinant tPA (Activase®) was a gift of Dr. B. Keyt (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). The predominantly single-chain enzyme was converted to the two-chain form by treatment with immobilized plasmin (18Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody was raised against the tPA·PAI-1 complex as described previously (12Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was purified from ascitic fluid by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (20Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkins C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). The antibody protein concentration was determined at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1.3 ml mg−1cm−1 and a M r of 150,000. The antibody binding site concentrations is given as normality (n), assuming two independent and noninteracting binding sites on each molecule. Unlabeled wild type and P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.3–0.5 μm) were incubated separately with MA-33B8 (2.8–4.2 μn) in reaction buffer at room temperature. At timed intervals, a sample from each incubation was withdrawn and added to excess tPA. Residual active PAI-1 was determined based on the depression of the activity of tPA toward the chromogenic substrate SpectrozymetPA and plotted against time. The latent form of P9·NBD PAI-1 was obtained by incubation of active P9·NBD PAI-1 (2.5 μm) in a sealed and foil-wrapped Eppendorf tube at 25 °C for 5 days at pH 8.2 in 0.1 m Bicine, 0.1m NaCl, 0.1% sodium azide (6Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27942-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The content of the tube was assayed for residual inhibitory activity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE after incubation with tPA at pH 7.4. Antibody-induced inactivation of the labeled mutant was achieved by incubating P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.1 μm) with excess MA-33B8 (0.4 μn) and was complete after 20 min. Active P9·NBD PAI-1 and the spontaneously inactivated and MA-33B8-inactivated P9·NBD PAI-1 were adjusted to 0.1 μm in the reaction buffer, and the 500–600 nm fluorescence emission spectrum of each species was recorded. The effect of MA-33B8 (0.4 μn) on the NBD fluorescence of spontaneously latent P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.1 μm), as well as on that of the octapeptide-complexed and P14 Arg variants of P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.1 μm), was studied by recording the respective emission spectrum before and after adding antibody. The P9·NBD PAI-1 used in this study was obtained from the same stock. The rate of the fluorescence increase induced by treating P9·NBD PAI-1 with MA-33B8 was measured at 529 nm as a function of antibody concentration up to 3 μn, keeping P9·NBD PAI-1 at 0.03–0.3 μm to maintain first order conditions. The corresponding rate constants were evaluated by nonlinear least squares fitting of a single exponential to the fluorescence progress curves. The apparent second order rate constant for antibody binding was determined by plotting the rate constants against the concentration of MA-33B8. P9·NBD PAI-1 and MA-33B8 were reacted at essentially equimolar concentrations (0.18 and 0.17 μm, respectively), and the time course of the NBD fluorescence increase was monitored at 529 nm in the absence and presence of unlabeled latent PAI-1 at concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 1.2 μm. In separate experiments, P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.1 μm) and MA-33B8 (0.08 μn) were mixed, and the time course of the NBD fluorescence increase was monitored in the absence and presence of each of the following unlabeled PAI-1 forms: active PAI-1 (0.1 μm), PAI-1 in complex with NAc-TVASSSTA (1 μm), elastase-cleaved PAI-1 (0.1 μm), and the tPA·PAI-1 complex (0.1 μm). Similarly, the fluorescence increase of P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.2 μm) reacting with MA-33B8 (0.19 μm) was monitored in the absence and presence of intact P14 Arg PAI-1 (2 μm). Direct binding studies were performed based on the strong affinity of the MA-33B8 FC region for protein A. Latent and peptide-complexed PAI-1 were added to vials containing a slight excess of MA-33B8 (3 μn) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, adjusted to 0.15 m ionic strength with NaCl. The respective mixture (600 μl) was passed over 1 ml of protein A-Sepharose (HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. The column was rinsed with the equilibration buffer, and material that eluted was collected. The antibody was subsequently eluted with a pulse of 0.1 m citric acid adjusted to pH 3 with NaOH. Void and antibody fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with excess tPA at pH 7.4. The susceptibility of various PAI-1 forms to hydrolysis by elastase was tested by incubating mixtures of inhibitor (1 μm) and enzyme (0.1 μm) for 20 min at room temperature. The reactions were quenched with SDS (1%) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The species tested were active wild type and P9·NBD PAI-1, latent PAI-1, and the antibody-inactivated wild type and P9·NBD PAI-1 forms. The latter were generated by preincubating the respective active PAI-1 form with MA-33B8 (3 μn) for 20 min. P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.17 μm) was reacted with MA-33B8 (0.17 μn), in the absence and presence of heparin (5 μm), and the resulting fluorescence enhancement monitored as a function of time using the SLM 8000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. PAI-1 was preincubated with heparin, and the reactions were initiated by adding the antibody. As a control, heparin and P9·NBD PAI-1 were reacted in the absence of antibody. Similarly, the fluorescence enhancement caused by reacting MA-33B8 (0.08 μm) with P9·NBD PAI-1 (0.1 μm) was monitored both in the absence and presence of 1 μmvitronectin. To probe the effect of vitronectin on PAI-1 stability, active native and P9·NBD PAI-1 (1.5 μm) were incubated with vitronectin (5 μm), and the activity of the two PAI-1 forms toward tPA was determined at timed intervals. The effects of MA-33B8 on wild type and P9·NBD PAI-1 were compared by incubating the respective PAI-1 form with excess MA-33B8 and measuring residual inhibitory activity as a function of time. Fig. 1 demonstrates that with 4.2 μn MA-33B8, the antibody-induced inactivation of wild type and P9·NBD PAI-1 occurred at comparable rates, corresponding to inactivation rate enhancement factors of 4000 and 8000, respectively. The larger factor for P9·NBD PAI-1 derives from its 2-fold lower rate of spontaneous inactivation. Based on the rates of inactivation of wild type and P9·NBD PAI-1 induced by excess MA-33B8 at three different concentrations, the apparent second order rate constant for antibody binding to the respective PAI-1 form was 1.8 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 0.2 × 104m−1s−1. To compare the inactive forms of P9·NBD PAI-1 generated in the absence and presence of antibody, respectively, the emission spectra of P9·NBD PAI-1 before and after complete spontaneous or MA-33B8-induced inactivation were recorded. The data in Fig.2 show that antibody-induced inactivation of P9·NBD PAI-1 causes changes to the NBD emission spectrum within experimental precision identical to the changes observed following spontaneous inactivation of P9·NBD PAI-1 (i.e. a 13-nm blue shift of the emission maximum and a 6.7-fold fluorescence enhancement). The NBD fluorescence of latent P9·NBD PAI-1 was not affected by addition of MA-33B8. The spontaneously and antibody-induced inactive forms of P9·NBD PAI-1 were compared also with respect to hydrolysis by elastase. Data in Fig.3 B show that when subjected to catalytic amounts of elastase and treated with SDS, active P9·NBD PAI-1 releases a ∼3-kDa peptide, consistent with hydrolysis of the P3-P4 RCL peptide bond, as previously reported for hydrolysis of wild type PAI-1 by elastase (11Wu K. Urano T. Irata H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following inactivation by antibody, neither native PAI-1 nor P9·NBD PAI-1 was hydrolyzed by elastase (Fig. 3 C). The time course of the NBD fluorescence increase triggered by reacting 0.1 μm P9 NBD PAI-1 with 0.08 μn MA-33B8 is shown in Fig.4. The first order rate constant for a set of such curves increased linearly with antibody concentration up to 3 μn, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 4,inset). The concentration dependence gave an apparent second order rate constant for antibody-induced fluorescence enhancement of 1.3 × 104m−1s−1, similar to the value of 1.4 × 104m−1 s−1 presented above and calculated based on the rate of inactivation of P9·NBD PAI-1 induced by the antibody. Data presented above indicate that MA-33B8 binding to PAI-1 promotes insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. To determine whether there is a reciprocal enhancement of antibody binding when the RCL is preinserted into sheet A, unlabeled active PAI-1 and RCL-inserted variants of the inhibitor were compared for their ability to compete kinetically with P9·NBD PAI-1 for binding to MA-33B8. When PAI-1, P9·NBD PAI-1, and MA-33B8 were mixed in equimolar proportions, the amplitude of the NBD fluorescence progress curve was decreased to about half of that registered in the absence of the wild type inhibitor (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that P9·NBD and wild type PAI-1 compete equally for binding to MA-33B8. The loop-inserted wild type PAI-1 forms (i.e. latent, elastase-cleaved, and tPA-bound), on the other hand, decreased the amplitude of the NBD fluorescence progress curve in a stoichiometric fashion. This is most convincingly shown by the set of curves displayed in Fig. 6, which exhibit a linear decrease in the MA-33B8-induced fluorescence enhancement of P9·NBD PAI-1 with the concentration of latent PAI-1. It is also demonstrated by the proportionate depression of the reaction of MA-33B8 with P9·NBD PAI-1 by the other loop-inserted PAI-1 forms shown in Fig. 5. The stoichiometric effect indicates that binding of the loop-inserted PAI-1 forms to MA-33B8 is faster than binding of active PAI-1 by a factor considerably larger than 10, that is, that the corresponding second order rate constants are close to or exceed 106m−1 s−1.Figure 6Stoichiometric suppression of MA-33B8-induced inactivation of P9· NBD PAI-1 by latent PAI-1. A, the fluorescence enhancements recorded after reacting 0.18 μmP9·NBD PAI-1 with 0.17 μn MA-33B8 in the absence (topmost trace) and presence of 0.06, 0.12, 0.15, and 1.2 μm latent PAI-1 (traces in descending order).B, the amplitudes of the curves in A plotted against the concentration of latent PAI-1. The regression line indicates complete suppression of the fluorescence enhancement at a concentration of latent PAI-1 equal to that of antibody binding sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess directly the constraints against loop insertion in PAI-1 caused by mutating the threonine at P14 in the RCL to an arginine or by binding the NAc-TVASSSTA octapeptide to position 4 in sheet A, these modifications were introduced into P9·NBD PAI-1. This enabled loop insertion to be monitored by means of the NBD fluorescence. As anticipated based on the effects of the same modifications on wild type PAI-1, the modified P9·NBD PAI-1 forms were substrates for tPA and hydrolyzed completely at the scissile bond. Following hydrolysis, insertion of the RCL was extremely slow with P14 Arg P9·NBD PAI-1 (k obs = 2.3 h−1) and too slow to be measured with the peptide-complexed P9·NBD form. In contrast, the RCL of inhibitory P9·NBD PAI-1 inserts with a rate constant of 3.4 s−1 in the reaction with saturating tPA (8Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The comparatively slow binding of MA-33B8 to active PAI-1 could be caused by an unfavorable equilibrium in PAI-1 that exposes the epitope in a conformation of the inhibitor associated with insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. To investigate this possibility, the competitive binding measurements were extended to include P14 Arg PAI-1 and PAI-1 in complex with NAc-TVASSSTA, which, by inference from the data presented above on the corresponding variants of P9·NBD PAI-1, are prevented from inserting the RCL into β-sheet A at a significant rate. With the P14 Arg PAI-1, no effect on the rate of"

We have investigated two hypotheses: (a) p73 is mutated in diverse types of human cancer, and (b) p73 is functionally redundant with p53 in carcinogenesis so that mutations would be exclusive in these two genes. The entire coding region and intronic splice junctions of p73 were examined in 54 cancer cell lines. Three lung cancer cell lines contained mutations that affected the amino acid sequence. One amino acid substitution was in a region with homology to the specific DNA binding region of p53 and two microdeletions were outside the region of homology. Two of the cell lines with p73 mutations also carried p53 mutations. Although our results are inconsistent with the two hypotheses tested, p73 mutations may contribute infrequently to the molecular pathogenesis of human lung cancer."

The structure of the first sub-library ([Arg27]PBAN27–33NH2, termed the Ser sub-library) was based on the active C-terminal hexapeptide sequence (Tyr-Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-NH2) of PBAN1–33NH2, which was found to comprise its active core.

It is well established that the activation of multiple receptors by the same peptide arises from the ability of a given peptide to exist in different interchangeable bioactive conformations (1Kessler H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1982; 21: 512-523Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). To attain receptor selectivity it is, therefore, essential to restrict the conformational space of a peptide so it can attain one bioactive conformation. Cyclization is an important and attractive way to restrict the conformational space of peptidic structures (1Kessler H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1982; 21: 512-523Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Conformationally restricted peptides containing medium and long range cyclizations have been mainly prepared following the same modes of cyclization of naturally occurring peptides. These include end-to-end, side-chain-to-side-chain, and side-chain-to-end (2Gilon C. Halle D. Chorev M. Selinger Z. Byk G. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These modes of cyclization involve modifications of side chains and ends which in many cases are essential for bioactivity, and therefore their modification causes loss of activity. Also, these modes of cyclization are not sufficient to screen effectively the conformational space available for a linear peptide with a given sequence. To overcome these limitations, we have introduced two methods called backbone cyclization (2Gilon C. Halle D. Chorev M. Selinger Z. Byk G. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and cycloscan (3Gilon C. Muller D. Bitan G. Salitra Y. Goldwasser I. Hornik V. Ramage R. Epton R. 24th EPS. Mayflower Scientific, Edinburgh, Scotland1998: 423-424Google Scholar). Backbone cyclization is a general method by which a conformational constraint is imposed on peptides through the connection of theN α and/or C α atoms in the peptide backbone to each other or to side chains or to the carboxyl and amino ends (2Gilon C. Halle D. Chorev M. Selinger Z. Byk G. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, the cyclization can be performed while retaining the functionality and the activity of the side chains. Backbone cyclization allows nine new modes of cyclization in addition to the four modes in naturally occurring peptides.

Synthetic procedures have been developed to incorporate these building units into peptides using the solid phase methodology (7Byk G. Halle D. Zeltser I. Bitan G. Selinger Z. Gilon C. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Gilon C. Huonges M. Matha B. Gellerman G. Hornik V. Rosenfeld R. Afargan M. Amitay O. Ziv O. Feller E. Gamliel A. Shohat D. Wanger M. Arad O. Kessler H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The advantages of backbone cyclization over the naturally occurring modes of cyclization are because of the immense variability of spatial orientation of the constitute residues which result from the multiple anchoring points within a chain or between chains. This allows us to screen the conformational space of a given peptide in an extremely efficient manner. Furthermore, most of the modes of backbone cyclization do not involve chemical modifications of side chains which are essential for biological activity. Backbone cyclization has been shown previously to convert peptides into selective and metabolically stable peptidomimetics with enhanced biological activity as compared with the linear parent peptide (7Byk G. Halle D. Zeltser I. Bitan G. Selinger Z. Gilon C. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Gilon C. Huonges M. Matha B. Gellerman G. Hornik V. Rosenfeld R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A rapid method for the disclosure of a BBC peptide that closely resembles a unique agonistic or antagonistic bioactive conformation can be obtained by the screening of BBC libraries (cycloscan) (3Gilon C. Muller D. Bitan G. Salitra Y. Goldwasser I. Hornik V. Ramage R. Epton R. 24th EPS. Mayflower Scientific, Edinburgh, Scotland1998: 423-424Google Scholar). Two such libraries were described: biased and random. In our study we used the biased library approach. The biased library is composed of a BBC peptide in which the primary sequence of the active linear peptide is retained and the members of the library differ solely in their conformation. The diversity of the biased library (also termed “sequence-biased cycloscan”) resides in: (i) the modes of backbone cyclization (2Gilon C. Halle D. Chorev M. Selinger Z. Byk G. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); (ii) the position of the backbone bridge along the peptide sequence; (iii) the size of the bridge; and (iv) the chemistry of the bridge. Biased libraries of BBC peptide allow systematic screening of broad ranges of the conformational space available to a given linear peptide. In this study we present the application of sequence-biased cycloscan for the disclosure of small BBC agonists and antagonists of the insect pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) which regulates, among other functions (for a review, see Ref. 11Gade G. Prog. Chem. Org. Natural Products. 1997; 71: 1-128Google Scholar), sex pheromone biosynthesis in female moths (12Raina A.K. Klun J.A. Science. 1984; 225: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13Raina A.K. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1993; 38: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Altstein M. Gazit Y. Dunkelblum E. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 22: 153-168Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sexual communication between sexes in Lepidopteran species is mediated mainly by sex pheromones (15Baker T.C. Experientia (Basel). 1989; 45: 248-262Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Roelofs W.L. Carde R.T. Birch M.C. Pheromones. North-Holland Publishing Co., 1974: 96-114Google Scholar). Sex pheromones are volatile compounds that are used by Lepidopteran insects to attract potential mates from a distance. In Lepidoptera, sex pheromones are synthesized and secreted from specialized glandular cells that are located in the inter-segmental membrane between the eighth and ninth abdominal segments (17Percy-Cunningham J.E. MacDonald J.A. Prestwich G.D. Blomquist G.J. Pheromone Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York, NY1987: 27-75Google Scholar). Sex pheromones play an important role in the elicitation of mating behavior in moths and are, therefore, crucial for successful mating and maintenance of reproductive isolation. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie sex pheromone production is of major interest and importance. In 1984 it was first reported (12Raina A.K. Klun J.A. Science. 1984; 225: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) that sex pheromone production inHelicoverpa zea female moths is controlled by a cerebral neuroendocrine factor which was termed PBAN. Since then, the presence of PBAN has been demonstrated in a variety of moths as well as in non-lepidopteran species, and its mode of action has been studied in many laboratories (for review, see Refs. 11Gade G. Prog. Chem. Org. Natural Products. 1997; 71: 1-128Google Scholar, 13Raina A.K. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1993; 38: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, and 14Altstein M. Gazit Y. Dunkelblum E. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 22: 153-168Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To date, four different PBAN molecules have been isolated from three different moth species, and their primary structures have been determined (18Raina A.K. Jaffe H. Kempe T.G. Keim P. Blacher R.W.

Examination of the primary structure of all four peptides revealed that they share a high degree of homology. Detailed structure-activity relationship studies (SAR), using synthetic PBAN and shorter peptides derived from its sequence, have revealed that the C-terminal pentapeptide, Phe-Xxx-Pro-Arg-Leu-NH2(Xxx = Ser), which is identical in all PBAN molecules, is the active core required for biological activity (22Altstein M.

In addition, it has been found that this C-terminal pentapeptide (where Xxx = Ser, Gly, Thr, Val) is homologous with the C-terminal pentapeptide sequence of other families of insect neuropeptides: the pyrokinins (PK) and the myotropins (MT) (myotropic peptides isolated from Leucophaea maderae and Locusta migratoria) (32Schoofs L.

The above mentioned group of neuropeptides has been designated recently the pyrokinin/PBAN family. The members of this family have been found to be responsible for a variety of physiological and behavioral functions such as: contraction of the locust oviduct (32Schoofs L. Holman M.G. Nachman R.J.

Insect Physiol. 1990; 36: 427-432Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Despite the intensive studies of the bio-activity of this family of peptides with respect to sex pheromone biosynthesis and the other functions, very little is known about the endogenous mechanism and the structural, chemical, and cellular basis of their activity. It is still not known which endogenous peptide(s) mediates each of these functionsin vivo, whether each function is mediated by a different peptide and if each peptide mediates one or several functions. It is also not clear which receptors mediate these functions, what are their characteristics, and whether the receptors share functional homologies. A promising approach for resolving these issues is the use of receptor-selective agonists and/or antagonists, as was demonstrated previously for vertebrate neuropeptides (46Laufer R. Gilon C. Chorev M. Selinger Z. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 47Laufer R. Gilon C. Chorev M. Selinger Z. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2805-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Backbone cyclization and cycloscan provides a good solution for this issue by introducing conformational constraint into peptides and thus, acquiring them with higher selectivity because of the restricted conformational space which can be recognized only by one receptor. Backbone cyclization also acquires peptides with higher potency, enhanced metabolic stability, and improved bioavailability. The advantages introduced by backbone cyclization and cycloscan as well as the availability of bioassays for the pyrokinin/PBAN family of peptides (23Altstein M. Gazit Y. Ben-Aziz O. Gabay T. Marcus R. Vogel Z. Barg J. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 355-370Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 39Nachman R.J. Holman M.G. Haddon W.F. Arch. Insect. Biochem.

Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 853-858Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (which are required to obtain the essential information for the design of BBC peptides and specificity for the desired biological effects), led us to combine both approaches for the generation of receptor-selective agonists and antagonists. In this study we report the generation of highly potent, conformationally constrained BBC heptapeptide agonists and antagonists which fully inhibit one of the functions mediated by PBAN: sex pheromone biosynthesis in the female moth Heliothis peltigera. Fmoc-protected amino acids with standard side-chain protecting groups as well as resins and reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Novabiochem (Laufelingen, Switzerland). Ultrapure quality solvents were obtained from Basker. Other reagents were obtained from Aldrich. Building units for BBC peptides were prepared as described previously (6Muller D. Zeltser I. Bitan G. Gilon C. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). BBC peptide libraries were synthesized as described before (9Bitan G. Sukhotinsky I. Mashriki Y. Hanani M. Selinger Z. Gilon C. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were synthesized by the Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis methodology (50Houghten R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar) on Rink Amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine Resin (loading 0.55 mmol/g) using Fmoc chemistry and N-methylpyrrolidone as solvent. The following BBC building units were used: t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-NH(CH2)n-N(Fmoc) CH2-COOH (n = 2, 3, 4, 6). Couplings were performed for 2 h by a preactivated solution of 3-fold excess of Fmoc amino acids or building units with bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP) and 6-fold excess of diisopropylethylamine for 5 min inN-methylpyrrolidone. Deprotection of the Boc protecting group from the N(amino alkyl) group of the building units was carried out with Cl3SiI, prepared in situfrom SiCl4 and NaI in ACN: dichloromethane (1:1). On resin, cyclization was achieved by 6-fold excess of 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and repeated four times. The peptides were removed from the resin with concomitant side chain deprotection by 90% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with addition of scavengers (H2O:ethanedithiol:thioanisole, 2.5:2.5:5%). The resin was removed by filtration and the TFA evaporated to dryness by stream of nitrogen. The residue was extracted three times with ether to remove the scavengers. The dry crude peptide was dissolved in water and lyophilized. The crude peptides were purified by preparative HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis of hydrolisates. All peptides gave the expected mass and were pure by analytical HPLC.

Agonistic activity of BBC peptides was determined by monitoring the ability of the injected peptides (at 1 nmol, unless otherwise indicated) to induce sex pheromone biosynthesis in females (in the absence of PBAN1–33NH2). Females injected with 1 nmol (unless otherwise indicated) of PBAN1–33NH2 served as a reference for agonistic activity. Antagonistic activity was determined by monitoring the ability of the BBC peptides (at 1 nmol) to inhibit sex pheromone biosynthesis evoked by 0.5 pmol of exogenously injected PBAN1–33NH2. Females injected with 0.5 pmol of PBAN1–33NH2 served as a reference for maximal stimulation, and those injected with 0.1 m phosphate buffer served to determine the basal pheromone biosynthesis at photophase (which did not exceed 20 ng/female). Pheromone glands were excised 2 h post-injection, and sex pheromone was extracted and quantified by capillary gas chromatography as described previously (22Altstein M. Dunkelblum E. Gabay T. Ben-Aziz O. Schafler I. Gazit Y. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 30: 309-317Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with a minimum of ten females per treatment. Detailed SAR studies, using synthetic Hez-PBAN and shorter peptides derived from its sequence, revealed that the C-terminal pentapeptide/PBAN that is common to all members of the pyrokinin/PBAN family comprises the active core required for biological activity (22Altstein M.

https://openalex.org/W2093006848,"A brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (GEP) for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF) was purified earlier from bovine brain cytosol. Cloning and expression of the cDNA confirmed that the recombinant protein (p200) is a BFA-sensitive ARF GEP. p200 contains a domain that is 50% identical in amino acid sequence to a region in yeast Sec7, termed the Sec7 domain. Sec7 domains have been identified also in other proteins with ARF GEP activity, some of which are not inhibited by BFA. To identify structural elements that influence GEP activity and its BFA sensitivity, several truncated mutants of p200 were made. Deletion of sequence C-terminal to the Sec7 domain did not affect GEP activity. A protein lacking 594 amino acids at the N terminus, as well as sequence following the Sec7 domain, also had high activity. The mutant lacking 630 N-terminal amino acids was, however, only 1% as active, as was the Sec7 domain itself (mutant lacking 697 N-terminal residues). It appears that the Sec7 domain of p200 contains the catalytic site but additional sequence (perhaps especially that between positions 595 and 630) modifies activity dramatically. Myristoylated recombinant ARFs were better than non-myristoylated as substrates; ARFs 1 and 3 were better than ARF5, and no activity was detected with ARF6. Physical interaction of the Sec7 domain with an ARF1 mutant was demonstrated, but it was much weaker than that of the cytohesin-1 Sec7 domain with the same ARF protein. Effects of BFA on p200 and all mutants with high activity were similar with ∼50% inhibition at ≤50 μm. The inactive BFA analogue B36 did not inhibit the Sec7 domain or p200. Thus, the Sec7 domain of p200, like that of Sec7 itself (Sata, M., Donaldson, J. G., Moss, J., and Vaughan, M. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 4204–4208), plays a role in BFA inhibition as well as in GEP activity, although the latter is markedly modified by other structural elements.

Six mammalian ARFs have been cloned and grouped in three classes based on deduced amino acid sequence, size, gene structure, and phylogenetic analysis: class I, ARFs 1, 2, and 3; class II, ARFs4 and 5; class III, ARF6 (3Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). ARFs are inactive when GDP is bound. Activation, which requires replacement of bound GDP with GTP, is accelerated by guanine nucleotide exchange proteins or GEPs that can serve as regulators of ARF activity (3Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Yeast Sec7 contains a so-called Sec7 domain of ∼190 amino acids that are 50% identical to an analogous sequence in the bovine p200 GEP. Other ARF GEPs known to contain Sec7 domains include Gea1 and 2 from S. cerevisiae (11Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.

A. 1998; 95: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), exhibited GEP activity. Two types of ARF GEP have been distinguished by their susceptibility to inhibition by brefeldin A (BFA), a macrocyclic lactone synthesized from palmitate by a variety of fungi (15Harri E. Loeffler W. Sigg P. Stahelin H.P. Tamm H. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1963; 46: 1235-1243Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and initially identified as an antiviral agent (16Tamura G. Ando K. Suzuki S. Takatsuki A. Arima K. J. Antibiot. 1968; 21: 160-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After it was found that BFA inhibits an early step in secretion causing retention of secretory and membrane proteins in the ER of many cells (17Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar), it became an important tool for the study of intracellular vesicular trafficking. These BFA effects result from its interference with ARF activation as a consequence of inhibition of ARF GEP (18Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 19Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar).

The BFA-sensitive GEPs are all relatively larger molecules than those that are insensitive, but the only apparent sequence similarity among all of the GEPs is in the Sec7 domains. To identify structural determinants of GEP activity and BFA sensitivity, several truncated mutants of p200 were assayed, and the physical interaction of two of them with a mutant ARF1 was evaluated by gel filtration. As reported here, the Sec7 domain itself exhibited GEP activity, albeit, 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of intact p200, and the activity was inhibited by BFA. All observations were consistent with the conclusion that elements of amino acid sequence N-terminal to the Sec7 domain enhance its GEP activity and its ability to form a stable complex with Δ13ARF1. [35S]GTPγS (1,250 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc., BFA from Epicenter, phosphatidylserine and GTPγS from Sigma, and Pfu polymerase from Stratagene. The baculovirus expression kit was from PharMingen. Rapid-Ag-Stain Kit from ICN was used for silver staining. The Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1 (Arg62-Asp249) was synthesized as a His6 fusion protein and purified as described by Meacci et al. (13Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl.

A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) are published. Structures of p200 mutants are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The ΔC cDNA was made by ligation of two DNA fragments that result from cleavage at a SpeI restriction site at position 1737. One fragment was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 200A (8Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), using forward primer 5′-CAAACATATTCATATGACTAGTAAATGATCTGT and reverse primer (G54) 5′-GATTGTCATCGCGGCCGC TCATTTCATTGATATCTTTTTTC, followed by digestion of the product with SpeI andNotI. G54 introduced a NotI site (underlined) after the stop codon (bold). The other fragment was excised from plasmid A (8Morinaga N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with NdeI and SpeI. The two fragments were ligated in-frame through their SpeI sites into NdeI- and NotI-digested baculovirus transfer vector (pAcHLT-C). ΔCΔ520 was made similarly by ligation of two DNA fragments using the SpeI site. One fragment was amplified from plasmid ΔC using forward primer 5′-CAAAACACACATATGGATGCAGATTGAGGT and reverse primer 5′-TTGACACTAAGCATTCTAAACC (G53). The product was digested withNdeI (underlined site in forward primer) and SpeI (internal site in amplified DNA). The other DNA fragment was made by digestion of ΔC plasmid with SpeI and NotI. The two fragments were ligated into pAcHLT-C, which had been digested withNdeI and NotI. ΔCΔ570 was amplified from ΔC plasmid by polymerase chain reaction using forward primer 5′-AAACATATGTTGTGACTTAAATG (NdeI site underlined) and reverse primer G54. The amplified DNA was first subcloned into pCRscript Amp SK(+) and, after verification of the sequence by automatic sequencing, the DNA was excised withNotI and NdeI and subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector, pAcHLT-C, which had been digested with NdeI and NotI. ΔCΔ594, ΔCΔ630, ΔCΔ660, and ΔCΔ697 were amplified by the same procedure as ΔCΔ570 using reverse primer G54, with forward primers 5′-CCCAAGGCATATGGAGTCAGGAACTTGGTA, 5′-GGAGCAACATATGGTATGTGAATCCCAACTC, 5′-CCAGAGACCATATGCAGATACGGAAGTTTAAA, and 5′-TCGAAGTCCTCATATGGCAGAAAGAAATAATAG, respectively. Underlined sequence is an NdeI site. Plasmid DNA was purified using Wizard Plus SV Minipreps (Promega) from 10 ml of LB broth culture containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) that had been incubated overnight at 37 °C. An ABI373 DNA sequencer was used for DNA sequencing. p200 and mutant proteins were synthesized in Sf9 cells as His6-tagged fusion proteins and purified using Ni-NTA (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose). Sf9 cells (1 × 106/3 ml medium) transfected with 1 μg of Baculogold DNA and 3 μg of each recombinant baculovirus transfer vector were incubated at 27 °C for 5 days before 1 ml of the supernatant was transferred to fresh Sf9 cells (1–2 × 107/15 ml medium) and incubated for 3 days. Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 100 mmNaCl and protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by freezing and thawing twice and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 ×g, 15 min). Presence of recombinant protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and the clear lysate was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA, which was then transferred to a column and washed with 30 ml of 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmPefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove loosely bound proteins. His6-tagged proteins were eluted either with 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA or with wash buffer containing 400 mmimidazole, pH 6.0, immediately neutralized, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3, 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 30 mm NaCl (or without MgCl2 for experiments like those in Figs. 7 and 8). Proteins (∼4–120 μg/ml) were stored in small portions at −20 °C in the same medium. Purity of the mutant proteins ranged from 60 to 90%. The purified ΔCΔ570 migrated a ∼39–41-kDa doublet on SDS-PAGE.Figure 8Effect of Mg2+ concentration on association of Δ13ARF1 and C-1Sec7 .Δ13ARF1 (540 pmol) was incubated with C-1Sec7 (450 pmol) in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 plus 2 mmEDTA (A) or 2 mm MgCl2 plus 0.1 mm EDTA and GTPγS (B) for 1 h at 37 °C before gel filtration and analysis of column fractions. Optical density of C-1Sec7 (●) and Δ13ARF1 (○), is reported as described in the legend to Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether stable complexes were formed, Δ13ARF1 and ΔCΔ697, ΔCΔ570, or C-1Sec7 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in TNDSA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride) containing either 1 mm MgCl2 plus 2 mm EDTA or 2 mm MgCl2 plus 0.1–0.5 mm EDTA and 4 μm GTPγS with 140 μg of bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 250–500 μl. The mixture was then applied to a column (0.9 × 44 cm) of Ultrogel AcA54 equilibrated and eluted with TNDSA buffer containing 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m NaCl and either low MgCl2buffer (1 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm EDTA) or high MgCl2 buffer (2 mm MgCl2with 1 mm EDTA), depending on the prior incubation conditions. After elution of 11.5 ml, fraction collection was begun. Samples (45 μl) of fractions (0.33 ml) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 14 or 16% gels, followed by silver staining and quantification of stained bands by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer S1). Amount of each protein is reported as percentage of the total recovered in all fractions. All observations were replicated with at least two preparations of recombinant protein. GEP activity of mutant proteins was assayed by quantifying GTPγS binding to a partially purified mixture of native ARFs (predominantly ARFs 1 and 3) or other ARF preparation, as indicated. ARF and purified His6-tagged recombinant proteins were incubated with 4 μm[35S]GTPγS (∼5 × 106 cpm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2 with 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 20 μg of phosphatidylserine at 30 °C for 20 min unless otherwise indicated, in a total volume of 100 μl. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose filters followed by washing six times (1 ml each) with ice-cold buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) and 5 ml of scintillation fluid were added to each filter for radioassay. Routine assays contained phosphatidylserine because without it GTPγS binding to ARF was very low and GEP activity of p200 was not detected, as reported for a ∼55-kDa GEP purified from rat spleen cytosol (21Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-tagged p200 and mutant proteins (Fig.1) were initially evaluated by their effects on GTPγS binding to a mixture of native ARF1 and ARF3. As the Sec7 domain of the BFA-insensitive ARNO had been shown to have ARF GEP activity (12Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), the mutant ΔC was constructed to eliminate the 964 amino acids C-terminal to the Sec7 domain. Its activity was almost identical to that of p200 (Fig.2 A). Because the yield of p200 was always much lower than that of the mutants, 0.7 pmol was the largest amount used for the experiment in Fig. 2. Deletion from ΔC of the indicated numbers of amino acids at the N terminus yielded proteins ΔCΔ520, ΔCΔ570, ΔCΔ594, ΔCΔ630, ΔCΔ660, and ΔCΔ697 (the Sec7 domain). The activity of ΔCΔ570 was quite similar to those of p200 and ΔC, reaching a maximum with ∼1 pmol (Fig. 2 A). Although ΔCΔ520 was not dramatically less active, the activity of two different preparations was consistently less than that of ΔCΔ570. The activity of ΔCΔ594 was also distinctly less than that of ΔCΔ570 and similar to that of ΔCΔ520 (Fig. 2 A). The three mutants with N-terminal deletions of 630, 660, and 697 amino acids (Fig. 2 B), however, had activities less than 1% those of the most active constructs (p200, ΔC, ΔCΔ570). The GEP activity was concentration-dependent, although maximal effects of the mutants with very low activity were not established even with amounts of >100 pmol (Fig. 2 B). In the experiment shown in Fig.2 B, binding of GTPγS was 2.0 ± 0.28 pmol with 400 pmol of ΔCΔ697 (the Sec7 domain). The low rate of binding of GTPγS to ARF alone in the absence of GEP was essentially constant for 60 min at 30 °C (Fig.3). Addition of p200 or ΔC (0.4 pmol) increased the initial rate similarly, but the magnitude of the effect began to diminish before 20 min. Both ΔCΔ630 and ΔCΔ697 (40 pmol) had lesser effects on rate that were essentially terminated in 20 min (Fig. 3). Relative GEP activities of p200 and several mutants are summarized in Table I. GEP activity is expressed as GTPγS binding (to 10 pmol of the native ARF1/ARF3 mixture) per pmol of each GEP protein, based on data from experiments like those in Fig.2 in the range in which binding was proportional to the amount of protein added. Most striking was the decrease in activity, 2 orders of magnitude, occasioned by the removal of 36 N-terminal amino acids from ΔCΔ594 to yield ΔCΔ630. Further truncation, producing ΔCΔ630, ΔCΔ660, and the Sec7 domain itself (ΔCΔ697), had no further effect on activity (Table I).Table IEffect of p200 and mutants on GTPγS binding to ARF1 and ARF3GEP proteinnGTPγS bound (pmol/pmol GEP)p200 (3)62.67 ± 0.73ΔC (2)22.60 ± 1.99ΔCΔ520 (2)31.50 ± 0.63ΔCΔ570 (2)33.07 ± 0.29ΔCΔ594 (1)21.24 ± 0.35ΔCΔ630 (2)60.02 ± 0.00ΔCΔ660 (1)20.03 ± 0.01ΔCΔ697aSec7 domain of p200.(3)80.02 ± 0.01Stimulation of binding of [35S]GTPγS to 10 pmol of ARF by each GEP protein was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GEP activity is the increment in GTPγS binding to ARF induced by the GEP protein expressed as picomoles of GTPγS per pmol of GEP protein, based on data from experiments in which binding was proportional to the amount of GEP used.

In subsequent studies, recombinant p200, as well as ΔCΔ570, consistently exhibited GEP activity with mARF5 (Table II), although it appeared to be not as good a substrate as class I ARFs 1 and 3. None of four different preparations of recombinant myristoylated ARF6, including one synthesized in Sf9 cells that was a substrate for C-1Sec7 (29Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), appeared to be a substrate for p200 or ΔCΔ570 (Table II). Thus, we may conclude that under the assay conditions used, p200 is a GEP for class I ARFs 1 and 3, and might also function with ARF5 (class II), but seemingly not with ARF6 (class III). Non-myristoylated ARFs 1, 3, and 5 were always utilized less effectively than their myristoylated counterparts (Table II), as has been noted for other GEP preparations (21Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J.

Decreasing the incubation temperature to 22 °C increased the stability of both ΔCΔ697 (Fig. 4 A) and ΔCΔ570 (Fig. 4 B), facilitating demonstration of the major difference in their specific activities and the ∼90% inhibition by BFA, which did not inhibit cytohesin-1 or its Sec7 domain (Fig. 4 C). As noted before (29Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the specific activity of C-1Sec7 was significantly greater than that of intact cytohesin-1, and was also less stable. As shown in Fig. 5, the activities of p200, ΔC, ΔCΔ570, and ΔCΔ594 were inhibited ≥50% by 50 μm BFA. Although certain mutants appeared to be somewhat less sensitive (likely because of instability), all were inhibited by BFA (Fig. 5). Percentage inhibition by BFA, which does not affect basal exchange, is lower when the fractional contribution of non-catalyzed exchange to the total is increased, e.g. when inactivation of GEP occurs during an assay. Inhibition by BFA was specific inasmuch as 200 μm B36, an inactive analogue, failed to inhibit p200 or ΔCΔ697, whereas 200 μm BFA caused 100% inhibition of p200 and ∼40% inhibition of the mutant (Fig. 5). Because the ARNO Sec7 domain had been reported to form a stable complex with Δ17ARF1 (22Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we investigated the association of Δ13ARF1 with the p200 deletion mutants ΔCΔ570 and ΔCΔ697 (the putative p200 s7 domain). GTPγS binding to 13ΔARF1 was stimulated ∼8-fold by C-1Sec7 independent of PS, but not by ΔCΔ570 (TableIII). Both did activate native ARF1/ARF3 in the presence of PS, but not in its absence (Table III). By prolonging the incubation (without PS) to 1 h with 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm EDTA it was shown that 10 pmol of ΔCΔ697 increased GTPγS binding to 62 pmol of Δ13ARF1 from 2.4 ± 0.05 to 3.9 ± 0.15 pmol (mean ± one-half the range, n = 2). Similarly, in parallel assays that included PS, binding was increased from 2.4 ± 0.11 to 3.8 ± 0.03 pmol by ΔCΔ697, consistent with the absence of phospholipid effects on the function of ARF mutants lacking the N-terminal α-helix (22Paris S.

https://openalex.org/W2324412866,"p27[KIP1] (p27) is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, involved in the negative regulation of G1 progression in response to a number of anti-proliferative signals. In this study we show, in growing mouse hybridoma (7TD1) and human myeloma (U266) cell lines, that p27 is highly expressed but slightly upregulated when cells are arrested, regardless to the phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, the specific blockade of these cells in early G1 phase reveals the induction of a protein of 23 kDa (p23) specifically recognized by polyclonal anti-p27 antibodies raised against the NH2 terminal part of p27 but not by anti-p21[CIP1] antibodies. Experiments using caspase inhibitors strongly suggest that p23 results from the proteolysis of p27 by a 'caspase-3-like' protease. This cleavage leads to the cytosolic sequestration of p23 but does not alter its binding properties to CDK2 and CDK4 kinases. Indeed, p23 associated in vivo with high molecular weight complexes and coprecipitated with CDK2 and CDK4. We demonstrate by transfection experiments in SaOS-2 cells that p23 induces a G1 phase growth arrest by inhibition of cyclin/CDK2 activity. In summary we describe here a caspase-cleaved form of p27, induced in absence of detectable apoptosis and likely involved in cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1975460720,"Interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) regulate proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of target cells. Receptors for these cytokines consist of a cytokine-specific alpha subunit and a common shared beta c subunit. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta c is thought to play a critical role in mediating signal transduction events. We have examined the effect of mutation of beta c tyrosines on the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways. Activation of protein kinase B (PKB) required JAK2 and was inhibited by dominant-negative phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K). Overexpression of JAK2 was sufficient to activate both protein kinase B (PKB) and extracellular regulated kinase-1 (ERK1). Tyrosine 577 and 612 were found to be critical for the activation of PKB and ERK1, but not activation of STAT transcription factors. Activation of both PKB and ERK have been implicated in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis. We generated GM-CSFR stable cell lines expressing receptor mutants to evaluate their effect on these processes. Activation of both PKB and ERK was perturbed, while STAT activation remained unaffected. Tyrosines 577 and 612 were necessary for optimal proliferation, however, mutation of these tyrosine residues did not affect GM-CSF mediated rescue from apoptosis. These data demonstrate that while phosphorylation of beta c tyrosine residues 577 and 612 are important for optimal cell proliferation, rescue from apoptosis can be mediated by alternative signalling routes apparently independent of PKB or ERK activation."

Function of this enzyme in mouse T lymphocytes is to transfer ADP-ribose groups from NAD to arginine residues, exposed on the extracellular domain of cell surface molecules. As a consequence, T cell responses are modulated. To explore the precise action of the enzyme, the T cell lymphoma EL-4 was transfected with the ART-1 gene, and its effects were examined. It is shown that ART-1 ADP-ribosylates distinct cell surface molecules, causing inhibition of T cell receptor signaling, concomitant to suppression of p56 lck kinase activation. These effects are explained by failure of T cell receptors and co-receptors to associate into a contiguous and functional receptor cluster.

These effects are explained by failure of T cell receptors and co-receptors to associate into a contiguous and functional receptor cluster. Post-translational protein modifications constitute a central mechanism in cellular signal transmission. Although this has been long known in case of intracellular signaling pathways, it has not yet been documented for signal transmission on the outer cell membrane. That such regulatory mechanisms might exist is suggested by the presence of cell surface enzymes with specificity for peptides in the extracellular milieu. However, proof that these enzymes regulate cell surface receptor function by modifying them is still lacking. We recently described an ecto-enzyme on mouse cytotoxic T cells, named ART-1, that functions as an ADP-ribosyltransferase, attaching ADP-ribose groups to arginine residues of cell surface molecules (1Wang J. Nemoto E. Kots Y. Kaslow H.R. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4048-4058PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, T cell functions such as cytolytic activity and cell proliferation are inhibited (1Wang J. Nemoto E. Kots Y. Kaslow H.R. Dennert G. J.

EL-4 cells were incubated in 1 mm NAD for 3 h at 37 °C, seeded at 105cells/200 μl/well into 96-well flat bottom plates in complete DMEM, and then stimulated with 125 ng/ml phorbol ester (PMA) and 100 μm calcium ionophore (CIO). Receptor ligation was induced with 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 (500A2) and 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 (37.51) (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Culture supernatants were assayed 20 h later for IL-2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). To induce inositol phosphates, cells were labeled in complete DMEM medium with 30 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 4 h (107 cells/ml). During the last 2 h, 1 mm NAD was added. After washing, cells were resuspended in complete DMEM medium containing 1 mmNAD and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells (107cells/ml) were activated by adding anti-CD3 (500A2, 2 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (37.51, 10 μg/ml), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Cell pellets (107 cells) were lysed and analyzed for inositol phosphates as described (2Nemoto E. Stohlman S. Dennert G. J.

The following antibodies were used to precipitate kinases: anti-p56 lck mAb (lck-3A5, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), anti-p59 fyn mAb, anti-ZAP70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were treated with 1 mm NAD for 3 h at 37 °C and then incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3εmAb (500A2) on ice for 30 min. After washing, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled cross-linking secondary goat anti-hamster antibodies and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% NaN3, cells were either stained with 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled anti-CD45 mAb (30F11.1, PharMingen) diluted in PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 for 30 min on ice or permeabilized with 1% saponine and stained with rabbit anti-human lck antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) diluted in PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 for 30 min on ice, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson, West Grove, PA). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were spread onto glass slides, mounted, and examined by confocal microscopy. To examine the function of ART-1, its gene was expressed in a mouse T cell lymphoma lacking this enzyme (6Yu Y. Okamoto S. Nemoto E. Dennert G. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). EL-4 cells were chosen because they possess TCRs whose ligation induces IL-2 secretion. Fig.1 A shows that PMA and CIO stimulate secretion of large quantities of IL-2 in EL-4 as well as its ART-1 transfectant C17. Addition of ART-1 substrate, NAD, at concentrations as high as 1000 μm exerts little effect on IL-2 secretion in either cell line. The high NAD concentration is physiologically relevant, because cell lysis caused by cytotoxic lymphocytes could result in local concentrations of this magnitude. The failure then of high NAD concentrations to inhibit cytokine secretion demonstrates that NAD is not toxic. To examine whether ART-1 and its substrate have effects on receptor-mediated cell activation, cells were incubated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to induce receptor ligation and IL-2 secretion. It is seen in Fig. 1 B that NAD has no effect in EL-4 cells, but there is a significant suppression of IL-2 secretion in C17 cells. To show that this effect depends on cell surface ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, C15, a transfectant expressing the ART-2/Rt6.1 gene, and therefore only one-fifteenth of cell surface enzyme activity of C17 was used: In C15 cells no suppressive effect of NAD on receptor-induced IL-2 secretion was demonstrable (data not shown). Therefore, ART-1 transfectants expressing high enzyme activity are sensitive to NAD-mediated regulation. The ART-1 enzyme effect likely occurs on the level of receptor-mediated cell activation, raising the question of whether the enzyme modifies CD3 and/or CD28 and thereby inhibits signal transmission. To find out, cells were incubated with 32P-NAD, and cell lysates were analyzed for labeled proteins. It is seen that EL-4 lysates are not labeled, whereas C17 lysates contain several labeled molecules (Fig.2 A). Using a panel of antibody for immunoprecipitation, strongly labeled molecules were identified as the CD11a and CD18 chains of LFA-1 in addition to CD44 and CD45. Weaker labeling is seen with CD27 and CD43 (Fig. 2 A). No labeling was demonstrable in other molecules expressed on EL-4 cells,i.e. CD29, CD40L, CD54, and CD62L (data not shown), nor was there labeling in CD28 (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3ε, which precipitates both CD3ε and CD3ζ chains and therefore the intact CD3 complex, did not reveal any labeled proteins (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Moreover, immunoprecipitations with anti-TCRα, anti-TCR β, or anti-CD3 γ,δ,ε,ζ using various antibodies all failed to uncover labeling in these chains (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). Therefore, TCR-mediated cell activation is inhibited by ART-1 in the apparent absence of ADP-ribosylation of TCR/CD3 and CD28 chains. Ligation of the CD3/TCR complex induces activation of receptor-associated protein phosphokinases, phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1, generation of inositol-phosphates, and mobilization of calcium (5Samelson L.E.

To examine whether these early events in TCR signaling are regulated by ART-1, the induction of inositol phosphates and activation of TCR-associated phosphokinases was assayed. It is seen in Fig. 1 C that NAD has no effect on induced levels of inositol phosphates in EL-4 cells, but there is a very strong inhibition in C17 cells. To examine the activation of TCR-associated protein phosphokinases, autophosphorylation of p56 lck, p59 fyn, and ZAP70 was assayed (5Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luone E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4358-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 11Weber J.R. Bell G.M. Han M.Y. Pawson T. Imboden J.B. J. Exp.

It is seen in Fig. 2(C, D, and E) that in exponentially growing EL-4 and C17 cells not stimulated by receptor ligation, NAD has no effect on kinase activities, although there is some suppression of p56 lck autophosphorylation in C17 cells. When cells are activated by receptor ligation a significant increase in p56 lckand somewhat smaller increase in p59 fyn and ZAP70 autophosphorylation is seen (Fig. 2, C, D, andE). These increases are not affected by NAD in EL-4 cells. In C17 cells, however, NAD suppresses p56 lckautophosphorylation activity, induced by receptor ligation, to the level of nonstimulated controls (Fig. 2 C). A similar result is seen with ZAP70 but not with p59 fyn (Fig. 2, Dand E), hence ART-1 action involves an early step in receptor signaling, i.e. a reaction preceding the generation of inositol phosphates and p56 lck activation. Circumstantial evidence suggests that activation of p56 lck is the consequence of cell surface receptor rearrangements in the contact zone between T cell and antigen presenting cell. This reorganization culminates in formation of a receptor cluster between the two cells, which serves to stabilize cell contact and facilitates contact between p56 lck and CD45, which activates p56 lck by dephosphorylation (13Koretzky G.A.

The demonstration therefore (Fig. 2 A) that several of these molecules, i.e. CD45, LFA-1, CD43, and CD44 are ADP-ribosylated, raises the intriguing possibility that inhibition of TCR signaling is caused by interference of ADP-ribosylated co-receptors with formation of a functional signal transmitting TCR cluster. This possibility was investigated by examining antibody-induced cap formation on a single cell level as a model for T cell APC interaction. Cells were incubated with anti-CD3, followed by a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody and examined by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Results in Fig. 3 A show that CD3 ligation in the absence of NAD induces very large caps in EL4 and C17 cells. To visualize the association of TCRs with p56 lck, permeabilized cells were reacted with anti-p56 lck and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. It is seen that p56 lck co-localizes with CD3 in the cap. Virtually identical results are seen in EL4 cells, incubated with NAD. In C17 cells, however, the presence of NAD inhibits formation of the cap, and only small aggregates of CD3 and p56 lck molecules are discernable. Therefore, in NAD-treated C17 cells there is inhibition of formation of a cap, containing CD3 and p56 lck molecules. These effects are also demonstrable, albeit less dramatically, under conditions in which receptor clustering is induced with one antibody only (Fig. 1), mediating receptor cross-linking via engagement with Fc receptors on adjacent cells. Results in Fig. 2 C had shown that NAD inhibits CD3/CD28-mediated activation of the p56 lck kinase in C17 cells; therefore we predict that the interaction between p56 lck and CD45 is likely disturbed. The possibility that ADP-ribosylation of CD45 inhibits its phosphatase activity and is therefore responsible for the effect was found not to be the case (data not shown). An alternative explanation is that association of CD45 with the kinase is inhibited. It is seen in Fig. 3 B that a CD3 cap that contains CD45 is formed in both EL-4 and C17 cells in the absence of NAD. However, in the presence of NAD cap formation is inhibited in C17 cells, and only small aggregates of CD3 and CD45 are discernable. Therefore, formation of a signal transmitting cap containing CD3, CD45, and p56 lckdoes not take place in NAD-treated cells expressing ART-1. These results provide conclusive evidence that the inhibitory action of NAD in TCR-mediated activation of cells expressing ART-1 occurs at the level of transmembrane signaling. The inability of the TCR complex to transmit signals can now be explained by the failure of ADP-ribosylated co-receptors to aggregate with the TCR to form a functional signaling structure. Our demonstration that ADP-ribosylation of cell surface molecules causes inhibition of transmembrane signaling uncovers an entirely novel mechanism of cell regulation in which cell surface receptors rather than their ligands are modified by an ecto-enzyme. The modification alters the ability of receptors to associate and to form a functional cell surface cluster. Hence, ADP-ribosyltransferases represent a new family of cell surface enzymes able to regulate T lymphocyte function by modulating receptor association and transmembrane signaling."

Crystals of the synthetase grown in the presence of IMP, hadacidin, NO3−, and Mg2+, then soaked with ppGpp , reveal electron density at the GTP pocket which is consistent with guanosine 5′-diphosphate 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate. Unlike ligand complexes of the synthetase involving IMP and GDP, the coordination of Mg2+ in this complex is octahedral with the side chain of Asp13 in the inner sphere of the cation. The cyclic phosphoryl group interacts directly with the side chain of Lys49 and indirectly through bridging water molecules with the side chains of Asn295 and Arg305. The synthetase either directly facilitates the formation of the cyclic nucleotide or scavenges trace amounts of the cyclic nucleotide from solution. Regardless of its mode of generation, the cyclic nucleotide binds far more tightly to the active site than does ppGpp . Conceivably, synthetase activity in vivo during the stringent response may be sensitive to the relative concentrations of several effectors, which together exercise precise control over the de novosynthesis of AMP.

Conceivably, synthetase activity in vivo during the stringent response may be sensitive to the relative concentrations of several effectors, which together exercise precise control over the de novosynthesis of AMP. Escherichia coli and other bacteria that undergo nutritional stress, for instance amino acid starvation, synthesize guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate (ppGpp) 1The abbreviations used are: ppGpp, guanosine 3′,5′-bis(diphosphate), pppGpp, guanosine 3′-diphosphate 5′-triphosphate, ppG2′:3′p, guanosine 5′-diphosphate 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate; alanosyl-AICOR, l-alanosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: ppGpp, guanosine 3′,5′-bis(diphosphate), pppGpp, guanosine 3′-diphosphate 5′-triphosphate, ppG2′:3′p, guanosine 5′-diphosphate 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate; alanosyl-AICOR, l-alanosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide. and guanosine 5′-triphosphate 3′-diphosphate (pppGpp). These nucleotides in turn dramatically influence a broad range of metabolic activities (stringent response), impairing the synthesis of DNA, rRNA, tRNA, proteins, nucleotides, and phospholipids and concomitantly stimulating amino acid biosynthesis and several other functions (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Rily M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1495Google Scholar). Evidently the stringent response stems from a severe shortfall, relative to the demands of ribosomal protein biosynthesis, in one or more of the aminoacylated tRNAs. During the stringent response in E. coli, pools of ATP and GTP decrease, but concentrations of pppGpp and ppGpp rise to millimolar levels. The reduction in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides putatively is a consequence of direct inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase and IMP dehydrogenase by ppGpp (2Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B.

The mechanism of inhibition by ppGpp, however, remains unsettled. ppGpp may inhibit the synthetase by binding to an allosteric site, as suggested by its noncompetitive inhibition with respect to GTP (6Gallant J. Irr J. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5812-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pao C.C. Dyess B.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Reported here are crystal structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli complexed with IMP, NO3−, Mg2+, hadacidin, and guanosine 5′-diphosphate 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate (hereafter the ppG2′:3′p complex), and with IMP, NO3−, Mg2+, hadacidin, and GDP (hereafter the GDP complex). Hadacidin, a fermentation product of Penicillium frequentans(9Kackza E.A. Gitterman C.O. Dulaney E.L. Folfers K. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), is a competitive inhibitor (K i∼10−6m) with respect to aspartate (10Clark S.W. Rudolph F.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Even though ppGpp was used as a ligand in crystal soaking buffers, the electron density in the guanine nucleotide pocket is consistent only with ppG2′:3′p. Evidently, ppG2′:3′p binds with much greater affinity to the synthetase than does ppGpp. Crystals either absorb a minor impurity of the cyclic nucleotide from solution or the synthetase itself transforms ppGpp to ppG2′:3′p. Regardless of its mechanism of formation, the ppG2′:3′p complex here represents the first structure of an effector of the stringent response with one of its target enzymes. Results here and from past investigations raise the possibility of several effectors of the stringent response acting in a coordinated way to modulate synthetase activity. The synthetase was prepared as described previously from a genetically engineered strain of E. coli (12Wang W. Gorrell A. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16000-16004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The enzyme was at least 95% pure on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hadacidin was a generous gift of Drs. Fred Rudolph and Bruce Cooper, Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University. All other reagents came from Sigma. Crystals were grown by the method of hanging drops under conditions similar to those employed in previous work (13Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For reasons provided below, acetate was excluded from the crystallization droplets, and in preparing crystals for ppGpp soaks, GDP was omitted as well. Droplets (total volume, 12 μl) contained equal parts of an enzyme solution (HEPES (30 mm), IMP (4 mm), hadacidin (4 mm), GDP (either 0 or 4 mm), and protein (18 mg/ml) at pH 6.8) and a crystallization buffer (polyethylene glycol 8000 (16% w/v), cacodylic acid/sodium cacodylate (100 mm, pH 6.5), magnesium nitrate (100 mm)). The pH of the droplets was 6.5. Wells contained 500 μl of crystallization buffer. Crystals of approximately 0.8 mm in all dimensions, belonging to the space group P3221, grew in about 1 week. The omission of GDP and/or acetate had no significant effect on unit cell parameters; the crystalline complexes here are isomorphous to previously published ligand complexes of the synthetase. ppGpp (preparation 33A) was prepared as described previously (14Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 245: 2039-2318Google Scholar). The sample was checked for purity by thin layer chromatography, using polyethyleneimine plates and 1.5 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4 (14Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 245: 2039-2318Google Scholar). Synthetase crystals, grown in the absence of guanine nucleotides, were exposed for 12 h to a solution containing polyethylene glycol 8000 (18% w/v), cacodylic acid/sodium cacodylate (100 mm, pH 6.5), magnesium nitrate (100 mm), IMP (2 mm), hadacidin (2 mm), and ppGpp (1 mm). A soaked crystal then was transferred sequentially at 10-min intervals to fresh solutions, which contained the components above along with glycerol at concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% (v/v). Glycerol is a cryoprotectant of adenylosuccinate synthetase crystals. After passing through the glycerol equilibration steps, a single crystal was mounted and flash-frozen to 100 K. Possible degradation of ppGpp under conditions employed in soaking crystals was monitored by thin layer chromatography (14Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 245: 2039-2318Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken at intervals of 2, 5, 12, and 36 h from a solution containing Mg(NO3)2 (100 mm), hadacidin (2 mm), cacodylic acid/sodium cacodylate (100 mm, pH 6.5), and ppGpp (2 mm), spotted on polyethyleneimine plates, and developed in 1.5 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4). Parallel time courses were run in the absence and presence of adenylosuccinate synthetase at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (approximately a 40 μm subunit concentration). GTP and ppGpp were used as standards in thin layer chromatography. The developed plates were inspected for UV-absorbing components. A series of solutions, obtained by the dilution of guanine nucleotide standards of known concentration, were processed by the chromatographic procedure above, in order to determine the detection limit for guanine nucleotides. Data from single crystals of the GDP complex and the ppG2′:3′p complex were collected on a Siemens area detector at 100 K and were reduced by XENGEN (15Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).

Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ligand models were fit to omit electron density maps, followed by a cycle of refinement using XPLOR (16Brünger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar).

Refinement parameters for ppG2′:3′p were based on those of GTP and the crystal structures of 2′:3′-monophosphate nucleotides (18Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. B. 1978; 34: 1520-1524Crossref Google Scholar). In early rounds of refinement, models were heated to 2000 K and then cooled in steps of 25–300 K. In later rounds of the refinement, the systems were heated to 1000 or 1500 K and cooled in steps of 10 K. After the slow-cool protocol was complete (at 300 K), the models were subjected to 120 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, followed by 20 steps of individual B-parameter refinement. Individual B-parameters were subject to the following restraints: nearest neighbor, main chain atoms, 1.5 Å2; next-to-nearest neighbor, side chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; nearest neighbor, side chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; and next-to-nearest neighbor, side chain atoms, 2.5 Å2. Criteria for the addition of water molecules were identical to those of previous studies (5Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. 1956; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) indicates an uncertainty in coordinates of 0.30 Å. The amino acid sequence used in refinement is identical to that reported previously (22Poland B.W. Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y. Kim K.H. Harris E.M.S. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

A overview of the ppG2′:3′p complex is in Fig. 1, and a schematic of ppG2′:3′p is in Fig. 2. Gln10 is the only serious violation of the Ramachandran plot as identified by PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The conformation of Gln10 is enforced by its hydrogen bonding environment as described in previous work (22Poland B.W. Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y. Kim K.H. Harris E.M.S. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Thermal parameters vary in the GDP and ppG2′:3′p complexes from 10 to 64 Å2 and 10 to 65 Å2, respectively. The variation in thermal parameters as a function of residue is comparable to that of other structures of the ligated synthetase (5Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Supperposition of the GDP complex onto the ppG2′:3′p complex results in a root mean square deviation of Cα coordinates of 0.3 Å, comparable to the estimate of coordinate uncertainty.Figure 2Schematic of ppG2′:3′p showing atom labels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Conditions of crystallization for the GDP complex reported here differ from those of an earlier study (13Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the elimination of acetate from the crystallization buffers. Acetate and GDP synergistically inhibit the synthetase, as does nitrate and GDP (25Markham G.D. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6184-6189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the combination of GDP/nitrate exhibits greater synergism than GDP/acetate, the total concentration of acetate in the previous study was some 40-fold higher relative to the nitrate anion, hence the potential exists for substantial competition between nitrate and acetate for the putative γ-phosphoryl pocket of GTP. The GDP complex presented here provides data to higher resolution relative to that of the previous GDP complex (2.3 as opposed to 2.8 Å), and more significantly, the active site in the vicinity of the nitrate anion has stronger electron density and lower thermal parameters. The average distance of the six oxygen atoms nearest to the Mg2+ (TableII) in the present GDP complex has decreased by 0.16 Å relative to the former complex. Most significantly the distance between Mg2+ and OD1 of Asp13 has fallen from over 3.0 Å in the GDP complex from acetate buffer to 2.7 Å in the GDP complex without acetate. In the acetate-free buffer, the synthetase-bound Mg2+ exhibits quasi-octahedral coordination, rather than the square pyramidal coordination of the ligated complex in acetate buffer. In addition His41 now interacts through a bridging water molecule with Glu221, whereas in the acetate buffer no water molecule is evident, and His41 exhibits an elevated set of thermal parameters. The elimination of acetate, then, results in the tighter coordination of Mg2+ and a more ordered active site in the immediate vicinity of the γ-phosphoryl pocket. As the ppG2′:3′p complex described below comes from an acetate-free buffer, the GDP complex without acetate reported here serves as a basis of comparison.Table IISelected contacts involving ligands of the GDP and ppG2′:3′p complexesLigand atomContact atomDistance, ppG2′:3′p complexDistance, GDP complexÅÅIMPO-6Nitrate N32.952.81Gln224 NE22.752.74N-1Asp13 OD13.072.63N-7Gln224 NE23.352.74O-2′Val273 O2.712.73Arg303NH22.572.98O-1AArg143NH1aResidue from symmetry related monomer.2.913.20O-2AAsn38ND23.113.32Thr239 OG12.722.67O-3AThr129 N2.912.66Thr129OG12.862.64Mg2+GDP O1A2.192.17GDP O2B2.092.08Hadacidin O2.082.19Nitrate O22.302.48Asp13OD12.472.73Gly40 O2.041.95HadacidinOMg2+2.082.19OBAsp13 OD13.063.11Asp13OD22.562.73Arg305 NH23.002.76Arg305 NE3.253.12OD1Thr301OG12.782.85Arg303 NH22.882.71OD2Thr300 N3.103.20Thr301N2.792.88Thr301 OG12.892.99NitrateO-1Lys16 NZ3.113.27Gln224 N2.722.61O-2Mg2+2.32.48Gly40N2.822.73O-3Asp13 N2.943.10Lys16 NZ2.542.56N-3IMP O-62.952.81ppG2′:3′pN-1Asp333OD13.152.81N-2Asp333 OD22.802.78O-6Lys331 N3.103.20Ser414OG2.522.52Gly416 N3.343.32O-2′Wat605 O3.502.53O-4′Lys331 NZ3.433.11O-5′Thr42 N3.40Arg305NH13.80O-1AMg2+2.292.17Arg305 NH23.033.14O-2AThr42N3.26Arg305 NH13.21O-1BGly17 N2.862.77His41ND12.972.85O-2BMg2+2.092.08His41 ND13.362.92O3-BGlu14N3.323.47Gly15 N3.063.03Lys16 N2.952.74O-11Lys49NZ2.65bCorresponding atom not present in GDP.a Residue from symmetry related monomer.b Corresponding atom not present in GDP. Open table in a new tab The conformation of the synthetase in the ppG2′:3′p complex is essentially identical to that of the GDP complex (Fig.3 and Table II). Interactions of IMP, nitrate, and hadacidin are unchanged from previous structures. Significant differences occur, however, in the ligation of Mg2+ and at the guanine nucleotide pocket. Within the uncertainty of the coordinates, Mg2+ exhibits octahedral coordination, in contrast to the GDP complex, where it exhibits quasi-octahedral coordination. The oxygen atoms that define the equatorial plane of the Mg2+ (one each from 5′-α- and 5′-β-phosphoryl groups of ppG2′:3′p, from NO3−, and from the N-formyl group of hadacidin) average to 2.1 Å, as opposed to 2.3 Å for the corresponding bonds in the GDP complex (Table II). In the GDP complex, OD1 of Asp13 tightly hydrogen bonds (2.6 Å) to N-1 of IMP and is 2.7 Å from the Mg2+. In the ppG2′:3′p complex, however, the distance between OD1 of Asp13 and N-1 of IMP is 3.1 Å, whereas the distance separating the Mg2+ and OD1 of Asp13 is 2.5 Å. Evidently, the synthetase coordinates Mg2+ more tightly in the ppG2′:3′p complex than in the GDP complex; the tighter coordination occurring, however, at the expense of a weakened interaction between Asp13 and N-1 of IMP. The significance of the above to the mechanism of catalysis and inhibition of the synthetase is discussed below. The difference electron density in the guanine nucleotide pocket clearly indicates an analog of GDP (Fig.4). Although electron density similar to that of the GDP complex is present for the base and 5′-pyrophosphoryl moieties, additional electron density extends from both the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the stringent effector. The density can accommodate a single phosphoryl group but not the pyrophosphoryl group expected at the 3′ position. A difference map, based on observed data from the effector and GDP complexes, and calculated phase angles from the GDP complex, reveals a strong and well defined peak of electron density in the vicinity of the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of GDP (Fig.4). The positive difference density overwhelms any negative difference density due to water molecules bound to the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of GDP. Hence the bound nucleotide cannot be GDP. Furthermore, a 3′ (or 2′)-phosphoryl group cannot occupy the density without causing severe steric conflict with the remaining 2′ (or 3′)-hydroxyl group of the ribose. The only acceptable fit to the electron density was provided by ppG2′:3′p. Thermal parameters for the refined cyclic nucleotide are comparable to those of the surrounding protein, suggesting full occupancy of the ligand at the guanosine pocket. The synthetase recognizes the 5′-pyrophosphoryl group and the guanine base of GDP and ppG2′:3′p in the same manner. Atom O-6 of the cyclic nucleotide interacts with OG of Ser414 and backbone amide 331. Endocyclic N-1 and exocyclic N-2 of the base hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp333. The 5′-β-phosphoryl group of ppG2′:3′p interacts with backbone amides 15, 16, and 17, the side chain of His41, and bound Mg2+. The 5′-α-phosphoryl group interacts with the Mg2+, backbone amide 42, and Arg305. The ribose moiety of ppG2′:3′p, however, differs significantly in location and conformation relative to that of GDP (Fig. 4). The 5′-α-phosphoryl group of ppG2′:3′p rotates ∼120o around the torsion angle defined by atoms PB, OA, PA, and O-5′, displacing the entire ribose moiety approximately 1 Å toward loop 42–53. (Loop 42–53 undergoes a 9-Å conformational change upon ligation of the synthetase active site.) As a consequence, the cyclic 2′:3′-phosphoryl group hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Lys49 (that side chain is disordered in the GDP complex), and forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asn295 and Arg305. A water (Wat605), common to all the ligated structures of the synthetase, hydrogen bonds to backbone carbonyl groups 42 and 417, and to atom O-2′ of GDP in the GDP complex. In the ppG2′:3′p complex O-2′ is now 3.5 Å from the water molecule, bridging backbone carbonyls 42 and 417. The torsion angle O-5′–C-5′–C-4′–C-3′ (γ by convention) is −77o (-synclinal), the torsion angle O-4′–C-1—N-9—C-4 (χ by convention) is −118o(anti), both comparable to those of the GDP complex (γ = −66o and χ = −82o). The five-member ring (O-2′–P-1–O-3′–C-3′–C-2′) is nearly planar, and its angles, bond lengths, and ribose ring pucker (C-2′-endo and C-3′-exo) are comparable to those of cyclic nucleotides, observed in high resolution crystal structures (19Lapper R.D. Smith I.C.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 2880-2884Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Reddy B.S. Saenger W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. B. 1978; 34: 1520-1524Crossref Google Scholar). ppG2′:3′p is putatively an intermediate in the degradation of ppGpp (26Lipmann F. Sy J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1976; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ppGpp is acid- and alkali-labile but relatively stable at neutral pH. The stability of ppGpp was monitored by thin layer chromatography in solutions of composition indicated under “Materials and Methods.” No detectable hydrolysis product of ppGpp appeared up to 36 h in aliquots without adenylosuccinate synthetase. Nor did a hydrolysis product appear under the same conditions in the presence of the synthetase at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The minimum concentration of guanine nucleotide detectable by the chromatographic protocol is approximately 80 μm. Hence hydrolysis products of ppGpp could be present in the original sample or any of the solutions used to monitor the hydrolysis of ppGpp at a level of up to 4 parts per 100 and still escape detection. Under the conditions of our crystallographic studies ppGpp does not undergo significant hydrolysis. Two possibilities, then, can account for the appearance of ppG2′:3′p in the guanine pocket of the synthetase: either the crystalline synthetase scavenges a minor (and undetectable) impurity of the cyclic nucleotide from our sample of ppGpp or the synthetase itself facilitates the conversion of ppGpp to the cyclic nucleotide. As no build-up of the cyclic nucleotide was observed in the presence of the synthetase, the putative enzyme-mediated process must occur without appreciable turnover. For the latter scenario, ppGpp must bind to the guanine pocket and undergo cyclization, producing an inhibitor that does not readily dissociate from the synthetase. As a means of better understanding a possible enzyme-mediated mechanism, one can model a transition state complex for the cyclization of ppGpp in the guanine nucleotide pocket (Fig.5). Mg2+ (total concentration of 100 mm) must be associated with the 3′-pyrophosphoryl group of ppGpp under the conditions of crystal soaks. The water molecule, which bridges backbone carbonyls 42 and 417 and hydrogen bonds with the 2′-hydroxyl of GDP (Table II), may act as a weak catalytic base and abstract a proton from the 2′-OH of ribose (Fig. 5). The activated O-2′ atom then attacks the 3′-α-phosphoryl group, displacing the 3′-β-phosphoryl group. The side chain of Lys49, as well as the Mg2+ associated with the 3′-pyrophosphoryl group, would stabilize the development of negative charge on the leaving group and/or the transition state. Lysyl side chains in analogous positions are critical to the catalytic function of adenylate kinase and GTPases in general. Regardless of its mode of formation, ppG2′:3′p must bind at least 200-fold more tightly than does ppGpp to the active site of the synthetase, assuming the cyclic nucleotide is 4% of the concentration of ppGpp in soaking solutions and that the K i for ppGpp is 50 μm. The estimated K i for ppG2′:3′p (∼10−7m) compares favorably to the tightest known inhibitors of the synthetase, alanosyl-AICOR (∼10−7m (27Siehl D.L. Subramanian M.V. Walters E.W. Lee S.-F. Anderson R.J. Toschi A.G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) and hydantocidin 5′-phosphate (∼10−8m (28Tyagi A. Cooney D. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4390-4397PubMed Google Scholar)). The enhanced binding of ppG2′:3′p may arise from the following three sources. (i) Cyclization of the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of the ribose reduces conformational freedom of the nucleotide and hence reduces the entropic penalty associated with ligand binding. (ii) The 2′:3′-phosphoryl group provides additional opportunities for strong hydrogen bonds with the synthetase. (iii) The active site Mg2+ has octahedral coordination, whereas in GDP complexes its coordination is square pyramidal (13Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or quasi-octahedral (see above). In fact, an octahedrally coordinated metal cation appears as well in the complex of the tight binding inhibitor hydantocidin 5′-phosphate (29Poland B.W. Lee S.-F. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Asp13 interacts directly with IMP in GDP complexes (see above) and evidently in the absence of an IMP-Asp13interaction (as in the hydantocidin 5′-phosphate complex (29Poland B.W. Lee S.-F. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) or a weakened IMP-Asp13 interaction (as here in the ppG2′:3′p complex), Asp13 favors direct coordination to the Mg2+. Octahedral coordination of the active site Mg2+, then, may be a hallmark of tight binding inhibitors of the synthetase. Such inhibitors are of potential significance in chemotherapy and the development of herbicides (27Siehl D.L. Subramanian M.V. Walters E.W. Lee S.-F. Anderson R.J. Toschi A.G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Tyagi A. Cooney D. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4390-4397PubMed Google Scholar). A cyclic nucleotide at the guanine nucleotide pocket does not explain competitive inhibition between ppGpp and IMP and noncompetitive inhibition between ppGpp and GTP, as observed in two investigations (6Gallant J. Irr J. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5812-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Pao C.C. Dyess B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 677: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such phenomena could arise from impure preparations of the synthetase (8Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2579-2581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, ppGpp could bind to a site distinct from the guanine nucleotide pocket. Synthetase dimers, for instance, putatively bind IMP with an affinity 100-fold greater than that of synthetase monomers. Hence, ppGpp will inhibit competitively with respect to IMP and non-competitively with respect to GTP, by binding to a site that blocks dimerization of the synthetase. The existence of such a site is inferred by covalent modification of the synthetase by pyridoxal phosphate (30Dong Q. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6235-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and guanosine-5′-O-[S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thiophosphate) (31Moe O.A. Baker-Malcolm J.F. Wang W. Kang C. Fromm H.J. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9024-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) at a cluster of basic residues, exposed in synthetase monomers, but buried between monomers in the synthetase dimer. The experimental protocol developed here reveals ppGpp interactions at the guanine nucleotide pocket (consistent with all kinetics investigations (6Gallant J. Irr J. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5812-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pao C.C. Dyess B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 677: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2579-2581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) but does not probe for a ppGpp-binding site at the buried interface between subunits of the synthetase dimer. Potent inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase in vivotypically impedes growth of the organism. The pur A −, E. coli cell line grows poorly, even in rich medium. Hydantocidin (which is transformed in plants to the tight binding synthetase inhibitor, hydantocidin 5′-phosphate) is a potent herbicide (27Siehl D.L. Subramanian M.V. Walters E.W. Lee S.-F. Anderson R.J. Toschi A.G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alanosyl-AICOR and hadacidin are antibiotics (9Kackza E.A. Gitterman C.O. Dulaney E.L. Folfers K. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,28Tyagi A. Cooney D. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4390-4397PubMed Google Scholar), the latter having only the synthetase as a known target. Hence, if the stringent response is ultimately a coordinated attempt by E. coli to limit its own growth under unfavorable conditions, then the synthetase is an appropriate target. Even though ppGpp is an effective inhibitor of the synthetase at its physiological concentration during the stringent response, other effectors (pppGpp and ppG2′:3′p) may also influence synthetase activity. The transformation of ppGpp into ppG2′:3′p, perhaps at the active site of the synthetase, suggests a parallel and more potent mechanism of inhibition, which may be temporally distinct from the inhibition by ppGpp. pppGpp, putatively the first nucleotide generated during the stringent response, could be an inhibitor of the synthetase, its 5′-γ-phosphoryl group being transferred to IMP while the cyclization reaction occurs at the guanine pocket. The result would be an active site complex of 6-phosphoryl-IMP and ppG2′:3′p. The combination of the synthetase with GTP and 6-thio-IMP has resulted in the formation of a stable complex of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP at the active site (5Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15200-15205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combination of IMP and GTP leads to the analogous 6-phosphoryl-IMP complex (32Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Hence, the double chemical transformation of pppGpp at the active site of the synthetase is well within the realm of possibility. Alternatively, if pppGpp is a simple substrate of the synthetase, then in vivo inhibition would depend on the relative concentrations and affinity constants of pppGpp and ppGpp, as well as the concentration of the cyclic effector. Hence the inhibition of the E. coli synthetase by stringent effectors may be far more complex than the competition of ppGpp for the active site."
https://openalex.org/W2334714672,"An abnormal stimulation of cAMP signaling cascade has been implicated in various human carcinomas. Since the agents activating GSα-mediated signaling pathways have been shown to increase in vitro proliferation of prostate cancer cells, present studies examined the GSα-mediated signaling in tumorigenicity and invasiveness of PC-3M prostate cancer cells. PC-3M cells were stably transfected with plasmids containing either wild type (GSα-WT) or constitutively active (gsp mutant of GSα or GSα-QL) cDNAs. The stable transfectants were then tested for: (1) colony formation in soft agar; (2) cell migration and penetration of basement matrix in an in vitro invasion assay; and (3) the ability to form tumors and metastases in nude mice. PC-3M cells expressing GSα-QL protein displayed 15-fold increase in their ability to migrate and penetrate the basement membrane as compared to parental PC-3M cells or those expressing GSα-WT. GSα-QL transfectants also displayed a dramatically greater rate of growth in soft agar, and greater tumorigenicity and metastasis forming ability when orthotopically implanted in nude mice. All mice receiving PC-3M cells produced primary tumors within 5 weeks after implantation. However, the cells expressing GSα-QL displayed a significantly faster tumor growth as assessed by prostate weight (greater than 20-fold as compared to PC-3M cells), and produced metastases in kidneys, lymph nodes, blood vessels, bowel mesentery and intestine. Interestingly, expression of GSα-WT reduced the ability of PC-3M cells to form tumors in nude mice. These results suggest that persistent activation of GSα-mediated signaling cascade can dramatically accelerate tumorigenesis and metastasizing ability of prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1583418025,"Live-attenuated human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) are candidates for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) vaccine. Based on the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model for AIDS, loss-of-function (e.g. deletion of accessory genes such as nef) has been forwarded as a primary approach for creating enfeebled, but replication-competent, HIV-1/SIV. Regrettably, recent evidence suggests that loss-of-function alone is not always sufficient to prevent the emergence of virulent mutants. New strategies that attenuate via mechanisms distinct from loss-of-function are needed for enhancing the safety phenotype of viral genome.

We have constructed an HIV-1 genome carrying the cDNA of a proteolysis-resistant nuclear factor-κB inhibitor (IκB-αS32/36A) in the nef region. HIV-1 expressing IκB-αS32/36A down-regulates viral expression and is highly attenuated in both Jurkat and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We provide formal proof that the phenotypic and attenuating characteristics of IκB-αS32/36A permit its stable maintenance in a live, replicating HIV-1 despite 180 days of forced ex vivopassaging in tissue culture. As compared with other open-reading frames embedded into HIV/SIV genome, this degree of stability is unprecedented. Thus, IκB-αS32/36A offers proof-of-principle that artifactually gained functions, when used to attenuate the replication of live HIV-1, can be stable.

Recent results have raised concerns about the safety of such live-attenuated viruses because of the emergence of virulent mutants (7Baba T.W. Jeong Y.S. Pennick D. Bronson R. Greene M.F.

Hence, it is reasonable that new mechanistically distinct strategies should be considered in combination with loss-of-function to develop safe live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Stable attenuation of lentivirus is difficult. Reasons for this include the high mutability of retroviruses as a consequence of poor fidelity in reverse transcription and high rates of viral replication. Virus replication is one of several parameters used to measure HIV disease progression. To this end, endowing the viral genome with an inhibitory function that represses replication is, in principle, a valid strategy for attenuation.

The prevalence of NF-κB sites in all HIV isolates (24) suggests that NF-κB function is fundamentally important for virus replication and represents an attractive target to attenuate HIVs. NF-κB is regulated by IκB inhibitors (25Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). In response to activating stimuli, IκB proteins become phosphorylated, ubiquinated, and degraded by proteasomes. This releases active NF-κB complexes leading to transcriptional activation of responsive genes. An IκB-α mutant protein, IκB-αS32/36A (defective for serine 32- and serine 36-phosphorylation), was previously shown to resist proteolysis (26Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 27Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκB-αS32/36A was found to be a particularly potent inhibitor of NF-κB-dependent gene transcription (26Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 27Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Here, we have investigated the feasibility of a stable bimodal attenuation of HIV-1 through both gain- and loss-of-function. We show that a proteolysis-resistant dominant negative IκB-α molecule (IκB-αS32/36A) can be inserted into nef of HIV-1, is maintained in the viral genome despite prolonged passaging in tissue culture, and contributes to a strong attenuation of HIV-1. These results indicate that gain-of-function should be considered together with loss-of-function in strategies for constructing safe live-attenuated HIV-1 vaccine candidates. In addition, they demonstrate that NF-κB inhibition is a major target for HIV-1 attenuation. pNLΔnef was generated by replacing the first 117 nucleotides of nef sequence of pNL4–3 (28Adachi A.

This resulted in the frameshift of the remaining nef sequence. cDNAs for IκB-α and IκB-αS32/36A were amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer flanked bySalI site and a 3′-primer flanked by the FLAG sequence followed by stop codon and XbaI site. The 5′-primer was 5′-ACGCGTCGACATGTTCCAGGCGGCCGAGCGC-3′; the 3′-primer was 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCTAACGTCAGACGCTGGCCTCCAAA-3′. The PCR products for IκB-α and IκB-αS32/36A were digested with SalI and XbaI and ligated into pNLΔnef to generate pNLIκB-wt and pNLIκB-M, respectively. IκB-αS32/36A was also cloned in antisense orientation using a 5′-primer flanked byXbaI site and a 3′-primer flanked by SalI site to generate pNLIκB-as. Molecular clones were confirmed by DNA restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 3 mm glutamine. Viral stocks were produced by transfecting 293T cells (5 × 106) with viral plasmids (10 μg) using calcium phosphate. Forty hours later, the cell culture supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and measured for RT activity. 293T cells were transfected with viral plasmids (10 μg) and were lysed in RIPA buffer 24 h later. Proteins (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Filters were blotted with AIDS patient serum or with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and anti-IκB-α antiserum recognizing the amino acids 51–64 of IκB-α (gift from N. Rice, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD) using Western-Light Chemiluminescent Detection System (Tropix, Bedford, MA). 293T cells were transfected with viral plasmids (10 μg) using calcium phosphate, and total RNA was isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction 3 days after transfection. RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase from Promega (2 units/50 μg of RNA) at 37 °C for 15 min, extracted by phenol:chloroform (25:24) and precipitated in ethanol. RNase protection assay was performed using RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, aliquots of 10 μg of RNA from different samples were hybridized with 105 cpm of HIV-1 and actin RNA probes for 15 h at 44 °C. Yeast RNA was used as control. Samples were treated with RNase A (2.5 units/ml) and RNase T1 (100 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, precipitated in ethanol, resuspended in gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS), and separated by electrophoresis on 8 m urea, 8% acrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA. HIV-1 antisense probe to the pNL4–3 sequence from +350 to +535 nt corresponding to NF-κB, Sp1, TATAA, and TAR sequences of HIV-1 LTR was transcribed from the T7 promoter in the pGEM LTR vector. Protected HIV-1-specific bands of 80 and 185 bp correspond to the 5′-LTR (+455 to +535 nt of pNL4–3 sequence) and the 3′-LTR (+9425 to +9610 nt of pNL4–3 sequence), respectively. Actin antisense probe was transcribed using T7 RNA-polymerase from vector pTRI-β-actin-125-human (Ambion). Protected actin transcript corresponds to a band of 127 bp. T7 RNA polymerase-derived transcripts were produced by using the Riboprobein vitro Transcription System (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized to CAT activity measured from co-transfections with pBLCAT2 (2 μg), which contains thecat gene fused to the herpes simplex virus tkminimal promoter, followed by CAT assay (23Mallardo M.

Jurkat cells (2 × 106) were co-transfected with pNL-Luc-R−E− plasmid (29Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) (1 μg) and pNLIκB-as or pNLIκB-M plasmids (5 μg) using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Amounts of transfected DNA were equalized with pcDNA3.1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfected cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 3 mm glutamine with soluble CD4 (10 μg/ml) to inhibit multiple rounds of infection. Cell extracts were prepared at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection and analyzed for luciferase activity using Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 3 mm glutamine. PBMCs were stimulated with PHA (0.5 μg/ml) or mAb OKT3 (1 μg/ml) in RPMI 1640 with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 3 days and then washed and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum with interleukin-2 (20 units/ml). Cells were infected with equivalent doses of viral stocks normalized by RT activity. Cell supernatants were collected every 3 days for RT assay; equal volumes of fresh medium were replaced into the cultures at the same time. Viral RNA was purified from cell culture supernatants using QIAampViral RNA kit (Qiagen). RNA extracts (1 μg) were reverse transcribed, and PCR was amplified using Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The IκB-αS32/36A sequence was amplified with primers flanking the cDNA insert from +8732 to +8749 nt (5′-primer; env region) and from +9017 to +9034 nt (3′-primer; nef region) of pNL4–3. As control, the integrase region was amplified with 5′-primer from +4339 to +4359 nt and 3′-primer from +4894 to +4914 nt of pNL4–3. Amplification was carried out according to the following protocol: incubation at 50 °C for 30 min, preheating at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. Cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-p24 mouse monoclonal antibody (Ortho Diagnostic, Raritan, NJ) and Annexin-V-Fluos (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Flow cytometry was performed with a Coulter Epics XL Cytometer. Ten thousands cells were analyzed under each condition. To determine whether the attenuation of HIV-1 could be obtained via cis-expression of a proteolysis-resistant inhibitor of NF-κB, FLAG-tagged IκB-αS32/36A cDNA was positioned in sense and antisense orientations into nef of HIV-1 pNL4–3 generating pNLIκB-M and pNLIκB-as genomes, respectively (Fig. 1 A). As a control, an otherwise isogenic molecular clone of pNL4–3 expressing the proteolysis-sensitive wild-type IκB-α (pNLIκB-wt) cDNA was also constructed (Fig. 1 A). These insertions also resulted in the deletion of 39 amino acids from the N terminus of Nef and a translational frameshift for the remaining Nef-encoding codons. Hence, the chimeric genomes gained an IκB-αS32/36A function coupled with a simultaneous loss of Nef function. From these molecular genomes, different virus stocks were generated through independent transfections of 293T cells. Expression in the transfected cells of HIV-1 proteins and the heterologous IκB-cDNAs was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, B and C). To assess the functional impact of IκB-αS32/36A in the context of HIV-1 gene expression, viral transcription in 293T cells transfected individually with pNL4–3, pNLΔnef, pNLIκB-M, pNLIκB-as, or pNLIκB-wt was analyzed by RNase protection assays. Viral RNAs were efficiently produced from all genomes except for the IκB-αS32/36A-expressing virus, pNLIκB-M (Fig. 2 A). This finding points to a strong inhibition of LTR-directed transcription by IκB-αS32/36A. A normalized simultaneous co-transfection into cells of pNLIκB-M genome with pNL4–3 genome fused to the luciferase reporter gene still resulted in markedly reduced viral transcription (Fig. 2 B). The inhibitory mechanism is likely to be a dominanttrans-repressive effect from the IκB-αS32/36A protein rather than a cis-destabilizing phenomenon arising as a consequence of an insertion into nef. This is further supported by the fact that the insertion of IκB-α cDNA either in antisense orientation, or as wild-type sequence does not inhibit viral expression (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and8). Repressed expression would have been expected if there were a cis insertional effect.Figure 2IκB-αS32/36A represses HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription. Panel A, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated viral plasmids (10 μg). Transfection efficiencies were normalized based on the co-transfection with 2 μg of pBLCAT2. Total RNAs were quantitated by RNase protection assay 72 h after transfection. Viral RNAs were measured as 3′-LTR and 5′-LTR protected fragments. Cellular actin-mRNA was quantitated in parallel.

Results are representative of three independent experiments. Panel B, Jurkat cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1, pNLIκB-as, or pNLIκB-M plasmids (5 μg) together with pNL-Luc-R−E− reporter plasmid (1 μg). Luciferase assay was performed in cell lysates at the indicated time. Luciferase activity is expressed as arbitrary light units per 100 μg of protein. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, the replication properties of the recombinant HIV-1 genomes were measured. We monitored for viral growths in established (Jurkat) and primary (PBMCs) T-cells. Based on normalized amounts of input viruses, NLIκB-M was found to be highly attenuated in Jurkat cells when compared with the NLΔnef and NLIκB-as (Fig.3 A). A reduced replication capacity was also observed for NLIκB-M in human PBMCs stimulated either with anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (Fig. 3 B) or PHA (Fig.3 C). In parallel, the chimeric HIV-1 which expresses the proteolysis-sensitive wild-type IκB-α produced a replication profile that was only slightly attenuated when compared with control NLIκB-as virus (Fig. 4,A–C). Taken together, these results indicate a critical contribution of proteolysis-resistant mutant IκB-α toward attenuated viral growth.Figure 4Wild-type proteolysis-sensitive IκB-α poorly attenuates HIV-1 replication. Jurkat cells (panel A), PBMCs stimulated with mAb OKT3 (panel B), and PBMCs stimulated with PHA (panel C) were infected with NLIκB-M, NLIκB-as, or NLIκB-wt viruses and measured for viral production as detailed in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, IκB-αS32/36A was shown to enhance the apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (30Beg A.A.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). Because tumor necrosis factor-α is produced during HIV-1 infection (33Wright S.C. Jewett A. Mitsuyasu R. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 99-104PubMed Google Scholar, 34Poli G. Kinter A. Justement J.S. Kehrl J.H. Bressler P. Stanley S. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), we asked whether a pro-apoptotic effect of IκB-αS32/36A might account, in part, for attenuation of viral growth. To this end, Jurkat cells infected separately with NL4–3, NLIκB-M, or NLIκB-as viruses were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of p24 and for binding to annexin V, a marker of an early event in apoptosis (35Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Because of the different viral growth kinetics, to account fully for equivalent levels of virus production, cell samples were analyzed at variant times post-infection. As shown in Table I, the percentage of apoptotic cells among p24-positive population was 17 and 13% for NL4–3 and NLIκB-as, respectively, at day 10 post-infection, as compared with 19% for NLIκB-M at day 18 post-infection. Thus, the expression of IκBαS32/36A did not affect apoptosis significantly because the percentage of apoptotic cells among those infected with NL4–3, NLIκB-as, or NLIκB-M was similar.Table IFlow cytometric analysis of Jurkat cells infected with NL4–3, NLIκB-as, or NLIκB-MCellsp24+p24−Annexin V−Annexin V+Annexin V−Annexin V+Day 10 post-infectionNL4–3 infected771643NLIκB-as infected6810184NLIκB-M infected318313Uninfected0.40.5918.1Day 18 post-infectionNL4–3 infected869122NLIκB-as infected552439NLIκB-M infected194.56313.5Uninfected1.41.68413The cells were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression of p24, as marker of viral infection, and for binding to annexin V, as marker of apoptosis.

Virol. 1997; 71: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One indication of such a loss in gained function would be a change in the kinetics of replication in later (compared with earlier) passages of viruses. In examining NLIκB-M virus after prolonged culturing in cells, we noted that its attenuated phenotype bred true despite extended re-passaging (Fig. 5, A–C). No changes in replication phenotype were observed with up to 180 days (9 passages) of continuously forced propagation in ex vivo tissue cultures. This stability of IκB-αS32/36A contrasts sharply with documented findings in other systems where rapid deletion of gained function commenced as early as 48 h after viral passaging (36Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To verify biochemically that this phenotypic stability was from the maintenance of IκB-αS32/36A in nef, RT-PCR analysis of virion RNAs was performed using samples isolated after various times of culturing in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 D). Viral RNAs from first passage (20 days in culture) as compared with sixth (120 days in culture) and ninth (180 days in culture) passage were indistinguishable, providing no evidence for deletion of IκB-αS32/36A (Fig. 5 D, comparelanes 5–7). Thus, by contrast with other cDNAs inserted into nef (36Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Giavedoni L.D. Yilma T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gundlach B.R. Linhart H. Dittmer U.

Various approaches have been proposed for generating live-attenuated HIV-1 (39Letvin N.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Based on findings from the SIV model of AIDS, loss-of-function (e.g. deletion of accessory genes such as nef, vpr, and U3) has been forwarded as a primary approach for creating enfeebled, but replication-competent, HIV/SIV (1Daniel M.D. Kirchhoff F.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regrettably, recent evidence indicates that loss-of-function alone is not always sufficient (and is perhaps largely insufficient) to prevent virulence (7Baba T.W. Jeong Y.S. Pennick D. Bronson R. Greene M.F. Ruprecht R.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 8Wyand M.S. Manson K.H. Lackner A.A. Desrosiers R.C. Nat.

Med. 1999; 5: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Hence, one is faced with either abandoning live-attenuated virus as a potential route for HIV-1 vaccine or devising another approach which is mechanistically distinct from and could be used additively with loss-of-function in attenuating the AIDS virus. Attenuation of HIV-1 by gain-of-function was first broached four years ago (40Kestler H.W. Jeang K.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1219PubMed Google Scholar). However, an issue that has impeded the useful application of gain-of-function is uncertainty over the stability of functions added to a replicating HIV-1 genome. To date, all exogenous open-reading frames, such as thymidine kinase, γ-interferon, interleukin-2 (36Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Giavedoni L.D. Yilma T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gundlach B.R. Linhart H. Dittmer U. Sopper S. Reiprich S. Fuchs D. Fleckenstein B. Hunsmann G. Stahl-Hennig C. Uberla K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), when artifactually embedded into the HIV-1/SIV genome have been unstable to prolonged ex vivo passaging, suggesting a rule of rapid deletion of gained genes upon virus replication. However, because the sampling size for gained functions has been small, it remains unclear whether this is indeed a universal rule. Our findings from IκB-αS32/36A formally challenge the rigidity of this rule. An ability by viruses in general and by HIV-1 specifically to maintain stably gained functions should not be inherently surprising. For example, piracy of large numbers of cellular genes by herpesviruses has been well documented (see Ref. 41Nicholas J. Ruvolo V. Zong J. Ciufo D. Guo H.G. Reitz M.S. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1963-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references cited therein). In simple animal retroviruses, only Gag, Pol, and Env open-reading frames are required for virus propagation. Hence, the evolution of tat, rev, nef, vpu, vif, and vpr in the existing HIV-1 genome represents likely illustrations of how this virus has anciently through natural means acquired and continues to maintain stably added reading frames. Conceivably, IκB-αS32/36A has certain cellular characteristics that benefit the virus-cell interaction during HIV-1 replication. What might be the propitious characteristics specified by IκB-αS32/36A await further investigation. It is possible that the inhibition of virus transcription by IκB-αS32/36A allows the cell to survive HIV-1 infection, while cell killing occurs in the case of recombinant viruses that carry exogenous genes which do not confer virus attenuation. A second possible explanation for the insert stability in NLIκB-M is that IκB-αS32/36A could provide an “anti-mutator” effect to the chimeric HIV-1 genome. This “anti-mutator” effect would confer a relative resistance to the deletion of the gained function. In this regard, the expression of a dominant negative IκB-α has been shown to correct aberrant DNA synthesis which causes genetic instability in ataxia telangectasia cells (42Jung M. Zhang Y. Lee S. Dritschilo A. Science. 1995; 268: 1619-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we demonstrate here the feasibility of a gain-of-function strategy for stably attenuating live HIV-1. Specifically, we show that the addition of IκB-αS32/36A to an HIV-1 genome conferred a highly attenuated replication phenotype that is genetically stable for a minimum of 180 days of growth in tissue culture. Attenuated replication in ex vivo tissue culture is by no means a perfect predictor of in vivo viral robustness; however, the unprecedented observation that emerges from IκB-αS32/36A is its durability in settings where other artifactually gained open-reading frames (36Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Giavedoni L.D. Yilma T. J.

An important extension to the experiments here would be to explore thein vivo stability of IκB-αS32/36A in chimeric SIVs propagated in macaques. However, the fact that transcription from the SIV LTR is not ruled by NF-κB in the same manner as that from the HIV-1 LTR (43Ilyinskii P.O. Simon M.A. Czajak S.C. Lackner A.A. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zhang J. Novembre F. Rabson A.B. Virus Res. 1997; 49: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 45Pohlmann S. Floss S. Ilyinskii P.O. Stamminger T. Kirchhoff F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5589-5598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) undermines the feasibility of such a heterologousin vivo test for IκB-αS32/36A. In this regard, further studies on SIV LTR-driven transcription are warranted to identify analogous cellular inhibitors of SIV replication. That not withstanding, the findings from IκB-αS32/36A represent a first-step proof that gain-of-function could be a stably useful approach for attenuation. This first step should spur further stepwise exploration for other useful attenuating markers that might be more amenable to incremental testing in nonhuman primate models. If so, a combination approach that incorporates gain-of-function with loss-of-function could possibly contribute toward the development of a live-attenuated HIV-1 vaccine."

On cells expressing R288A receptor, all the G-CSF mutants except E19A showed reduced mitogenic activity, indicating that Glu19 of G-CSF interacts with Arg288 of the receptor. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: CRHM, cytokine receptor homologous module (containing an N-terminal (BN) and a C-terminal (BC) domain); FNIII, fibronectin type III-like; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF-R, G-CSF receptor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF; WT, wild type; IL, interleukin; (R288A)GR, mutant G-CSF-R in which Arg288 is replaced by Ala; WT-GR, wild-type G-CSF-R; gp, glycoprotein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody. is a member of a family of cytokines that have a four-α-helical bundle structure, with the four helices conventionally labeled A–D from the N terminus (1Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The structures of human, bovine, and canine G-CSF have been determined by x-ray crystallography (2Hill C.P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8453-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to the four main α helices, there is a short 310helix in the A–B loop. The main biological activities of G-CSF are the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells of the neutrophil lineage (6Nicola N. Dexter T.M. Garland J.M. Testa N.G. Colony Stimulating Factors: Molecular and Cellular Biology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 77-109Google Scholar, 7Layton J.E. Nicholson S. Basser R. Cebon J. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc, Greenwich, CT1997: 557-612Google Scholar). These responses are initiated by interaction with a specific receptor (G-CSF-R) which is expressed on neutrophils, their precursors, and some leukemic cell lines (6Nicola N. Dexter T.M. Garland J.M. Testa N.G. Colony Stimulating Factors: Molecular and Cellular Biology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 77-109Google Scholar, 7Layton J.E. Nicholson S. Basser R. Cebon J. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. Jai Press Inc, Greenwich, CT1997: 557-612Google Scholar). Binding of G-CSF causes receptor dimerization and activation of signaling cascades such as the Jak-STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (8Avalos B.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 761-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor extracellular region comprises six structural domains as follows: an N-terminal immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, followed by a cytokine receptor homologous module (CRHM) (containing two fibronectin type III-like (FNIII) domains as follows: an N-terminal “BN” and a C-terminal “BC” domain) and three further FNIII domains (9Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorenson E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This domain structure is closely related to that of gp130, the shared signal transducer of the IL-6 family of cytokines (11Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), with which the G-CSF-R shares 46% sequence similarity in the extracellular region (12Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J.L. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The CRHM and Ig domain of the G-CSF-R have been implicated in ligand binding by deletion analysis (10Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and mapping of neutralizing mAbs (13Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas the three membrane-proximal FNIII domains are not required for ligand binding but may be important for receptor stability and/or signal transduction (10Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 14Horan T.P. Martin F. Simonet L. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies of a soluble form of the extracellular region of the receptor show that a 2:2 complex of ligand and receptor form in solution (15Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but the structure of the complex is currently unknown. The BN and BC domains of the G-CSF-R have been expressed individually, and each has been shown to bind G-CSF with low affinity (about 10−7m) in a 1:1 complex (16Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Anaguchi H. Hiraoka O. Yamasaki K. Naito S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27845-27851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The structure of BC has been determined recently by NMR spectroscopy, and the data indicated that the F–G loop of this domain is likely to be involved in ligand recognition (18Yamasaki K. Naito S. Anaguchi H. Ohkubo T. Ota Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether there are one or two ligand-binding sites on the G-CSF-R. Horan et al. (14Horan T.P. Martin F. Simonet L. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) concluded that there is probably one ligand-binding site with dimerization caused by receptor-receptor interaction. On the other hand, studies on the complexes formed with G-CSF and two soluble receptor fragments (Ig-BN and the CRHM) indicated that each G-CSF-R in the complex has two binding sites for G-CSF, one in the CRHM and one requiring the Ig domain (19Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, this study established that the Ig domain of the G-CSF-R is required for receptor dimerization (19Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Ig domain of gp130 is required for receptor complex formation and signaling by interleukin-6 (IL-6) (12Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J.L. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We recently identified several residues in the CRHM that interact with G-CSF (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), forming a binding site similar to the growth hormone receptor-binding site (21de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Of these residues, Arg288 in the F–G loop of the BC domain appeared to be the most important for G-CSF binding, in agreement with the study of Yamasaki et al. (18Yamasaki K. Naito S. Anaguchi H. Ohkubo T. Ota Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This large, positively charged residue might interact with a negatively charged Glu or Asp residue in G-CSF. Mutagenesis studies of G-CSF have identified several charged residues that are important for receptor binding, including Glu19, Lys23, Glu46, and Asp112 (22Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In both these studies, Glu19 in the A helix of G-CSF was identified as particularly important and appeared to be a possible candidate for interaction with Arg288. In the present study, to identify which G-CSF residues interact with Arg288 in the receptor, we have mutated Glu19, Lys23, Glu46, and Asp112 and compared the activity of these G-CSF mutants on cells expressing wild-type (WT) and mutant (R288A) receptors. In addition, to clarify further whether there are one or two binding sites on G-CSF, a chimeric receptor was constructed in which the Ig domain of gp130 replaced the G-CSF-R Ig domain. This chimera was used to determine whether the above G-CSF residues interacted with the CRHM-binding site or the putative Ig domain-binding site. Human G-CSF mutants were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar), and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing the complete G-CSF cDNA. The G-CSF mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as described previously (25Zsebo K.M. Cohen A.M. Murdock D.C. Boone T.C. Inoue H. Chazin V.R. Hines D. Souza L.M. Immunobiology. 1986; 172: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Samples of mutant and WT rhG-CSF were analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography to confirm homogeneity. The human G-CSF-R mutants were prepared as described previously (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To generate the Ig domain chimeric receptor (gp130-Ig)GR, EcoRV restriction enzyme sites were introduced in both the G-CSF-R and gp130 between the Ig and CRH domains as described for the G-CSF-R (12Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J.L. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol.

Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (oligonucleotide for gp130, 5′-GGAATCACAATAATTAGCGGATATCCTCCAGAAAAA-3′). ABstXI-EcoRV fragment of gp130 was ligated with anEcoRV-XbaI fragment of G-CSF-R intoBstXI- and EcoRV-digested pcDNA1Amp (Invitrogen, The Netherlands). The chimeric receptor was excised withHindIII and XbaI and ligated with linkers that contained XbaI and HindIII sites. The receptor was then subcloned into the XbaI site of pEFBOS expression vector (26Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The chimera encoded residues Met1–Gly123 of gp130 followed by residues Tyr98–Phe813 of the G-CSF-R (residues numbered as in Ref. 27Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Mizushima S. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8702-8706Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The receptors were transfected into the murine pro-B cell line, Ba/F3 (28Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), as described previously (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Analysis of receptor expression by flow cytometry was performed as described previously (13Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using the following mAbs: LMM741, which binds to the G-CSF-R FNIII domains (13Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), LMM775, which binds to the G-CSF-R Ig domain (13Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and GPZ35, which binds to gp130 (29Taga T. Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Miki D. Hamaguchi M. Davis S. Shoyab M. Yancopoulos G.D. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10998-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Tyr1,3-hG-CSF (provided by Kirin, Japan) was iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described previously (13Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ability of each batch to bind was at least 60%, and the specific activity was 4–10 × 107 cpm/μg as determined by self-displacement analysis (30Calvo J.C. Radicella J.P. Charreau E.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Binding affinity of G-CSF mutants was determined by titration of mutants in the presence of125I-Tyr1,3-G-CSF (∼100 pm for WT-GR and 200 pm for (R288A)GR, (R288E)GR, and (gp130-Ig)GR). Data were analyzed with the “drug” section of the LIGAND program (31Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing WT and mutant G-CSF-R was determined by measuring incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) as described previously (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because we believed that the evidence for two separate ligand-binding sites in the G-CSF-R was stronger than the evidence for a single site, we first wanted to determine which of the G-CSF residues Glu19, Lys23, Glu46, or Asp112 were required for binding to each site. Initially we deleted the Ig domain, to leave only the CRHM site, but found that this receptor was poorly expressed and apparently not folded correctly as determined by mAb binding (13Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore a chimeric receptor containing the Ig domain of the related receptor chain gp130 ((gp130-Ig)GR) was constructed and expressed in Ba/F3 cells. This construct expressed well and was tested for binding of anti-gp130 and anti-G-CSF-R mAbs (Fig.1 A). As expected, cells expressing (gp130-Ig)GR bound the mAb against the G-CSF-R FNIII domains (LMM741) but not the mAb against the G-CSF-R Ig domain (LMM775). The recognition site of GPZ35 on gp130 was not previously known. Staining of (gp130-Ig)GR with this mAb establishes that it recognizes the Ig domain. The chimera bound WT G-CSF with reduced affinity (see below) but had no detectable activity in a proliferation assay (Fig.1 B), suggesting that the receptor cannot dimerize correctly. To determine which of the mutated amino acid residues of G-CSF interacted with the CRHM site, binding of mutant G-CSFs to (gp130-Ig)GR was determined by cold competition with radiolabeled WT G-CSF (Fig.2). (E46A)G-CSF bound to (gp130-Ig)GR with a similar affinity (K d = 0.50 nm) to WT G-CSF (K d = 0.42 nm), indicating that this residue was not required for binding to the CRHM site and probably interacts with the Ig domain. No competition was detected with (E19A)G-CSF and only very weak inhibition with (K23A)G-CSF (K d = 11 nm) and (D112A)G-CSF (K d = 72 nm), showing that these residues were required for interaction with (gp130-Ig)GR, presumably with the CRHM site. Binding of WT G-CSF to the complementary chimera (GR-Ig)gp130 (12Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J.L. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was not detected (data not shown). To determine whether any of the G-CSF residues selected for mutation interacted with Arg288 in the CRHM of the receptor, we compared the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing the WT-GR with cells expressing (R288A)GR in response to the mutant G-CSFs. Typical results are shown in Fig. 3, and the mean EC50 values from two independent experiments are summarized in Table I. The mutant G-CSFs have been compared with WT G-CSF by calculating the mutant/WT EC50ratios (Table I). In the case of the WT-GR, the mutations resulted in a reduced proliferation response of 10–70-fold, with the exception of (D112A)G-CSF. As shown by the ranges given by the data, the two experiments gave somewhat different EC50 values; however, the mutant/WT G-CSF ratios from each experiment were very similar (range <10%, excluding D112A which was 50%). With (R288A)GR, we were unable to add sufficient mutant G-CSF to reach plateau responses in some cases, because of the large effects of some mutant combinations; thus some EC50 estimates are approximate. Nevertheless, it is clear that (E19A)G-CSF gave a similar response to WT G-CSF in cells expressing (R288A)GR, whereas the other G-CSF mutants gave a substantially reduced response. The effect of combining each of the K23A, E46A, and D112A G-CSF mutations with the (R288A)GR mutation was greater than would be predicted from the individual effects of the G-CSF and G-CSF-R mutations. If the G-CSF and receptor mutations behaved independently, the mutant/WT ratios (Table I) should have been similar for the WT and R288A receptors.Table IProliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing WT-GR or (R288A)GR in response to G-CSF mutantsG-CSF mutantReceptorRecoveryaRecovery of G-CSF at the end of culture determined by ELISA.WT-GR(R288A)GREC50nmbData are means ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 3.Mut/WTcRatio of the EC50 of mutant G-CSF/WT G-CSF.EC50nmbData are means ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 3.Mut/WTcRatio of the EC50 of mutant G-CSF/WT G-CSF.%bData are means ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 3.WT0.026 ± 0.0151.07.7 ± 0.81.040 ± 2E19A0.25 ± 0.139.613 ± 0.31.798 ± 51K23A1.9 ± 1.171NRdNo response detected.7.5 ± 1.4E46A0.58 ± 0.3322>530>6915 ± 4D112A0.055 ± 0.0462.1>210>2860 ± 25a Recovery of G-CSF at the end of culture determined by ELISA.b Data are means ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 3.c Ratio of the EC50 of mutant G-CSF/WT G-CSF.d No response detected. Open table in a new tab To determine whether any of the G-CSF mutations affected the stability of the G-CSF mutants in culture, recovery of WT G-CSF and the mutants from the culture supernatant after 48 h incubation was determined by ELISA (modified from Ref. 32Campbell I.K. Novak U. Cebon J. Layton J.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1238-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery of WT G-CSF was 40% and recoveries of (E19A)G-CSF and (D112A)G-CSF were greater than WT (TableI). Recovery of (K23A)G-CSF was 7.5% and (E46A)G-CSF was 15%; therefore, only a small fraction of the reduced activity of these mutants could be explained by reduced stability. Binding of the mAb used in the ELISA was not affected by the G-CSF mutations (data not shown). To determine whether the effects of the mutations on proliferation could be explained by changes in binding affinity, binding of the G-CSF mutants to Ba/F3 cells expressing WT-GR or (R288A)GR was compared. Typical inhibition curves for the binding of 125I-Tyr1,3-G-CSF in the presence of increasing concentrations of mutant or WT G-CSF are shown in Fig.4. The mean K d values from two independent experiments with each receptor and G-CSF combination is given in Table II. Fig.4 A shows that the G-CSF mutations had only slight effects on the affinity of binding to the WT-GR. The K23A, E46A, and D112A G-CSFs bound less well to (R288A)GR than did WT G-CSF, showing that these G-CSF residues interacted with residues other than Arg288on the receptor CRHM or Ig domain (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, (E19A)G-CSF bound as well as WT G-CSF to (R288A)GR, indicating that Glu19 interacts with Arg288 of the receptor. As observed with the proliferation data (Table I), the mutant/WT ratios of the binding affinity of K23A, E46A, and D112A G-CSFs to (R288A)GR were greater than the corresponding ratios with WT-GR, suggesting a synergistic effect of receptor and G-CSF mutations.Table IIBinding of G-CSF mutants to Ba/F3 cells expressing WT-GR or (R288A)GRG-CSF mutantReceptorWT-GR(R288A)GRKdnmaData are mean ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 4.Mut/WTbRatio of K d for mutant G-CSF/WT G-CSF.KdnmaData are mean ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 4.Mut/WTbRatio of K d for mutant G-CSF/WT G-CSF.WT0.045 ± 0.0081.00.37 ± 0.03cData are mean ± S.D. of three assays, including data shown in Fig. 4.1.0E19A0.050 ± 0.0041.10.29 ± 0.030.78K23A0.077 ± 0.0151.70.95 ± 0.112.5E46A0.076 ± 0.0031.73.32 ± 0.86cData are mean ± S.D. of three assays, including data shown in Fig. 4.8.9D112A0.060 ± 0.0031.34.06 ± 0.8510.9a Data are mean ± range of two assays, including data shown in Fig. 4.b Ratio of K d for mutant G-CSF/WT G-CSF.c Data are mean ± S.D. of three assays, including data shown in Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab If the interaction of Glu19 of G-CSF with Arg288 of the receptor were predominantly electrostatic, we would predict that charge reversal mutations would have a greater effect than charge-to-alanine mutations and that simultaneous charge reversal of both residues might restore the interaction. The proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing WT-GR, (R288A)GR, or (R288E)GR in response to WT, E19A, and E19R G-CSFs is shown in Fig. 5 and Table III. With WT-GR, (E19R)G-CSF had a profoundly reduced activity compared with (E19A)G-CSF (2000-fold less active), presumably due to charge repulsion between the two Arg residues. Recovery of (E19R)G-CSF from culture supernatant was 70%, as measured by ELISA; thus reduced stability did not explain the low activity. However, with (R288A)GR, this effect disappeared and all three G-CSFs behaved similarly, as would be expected when the charge interaction was removed. This result also shows that the E19R mutation did not have a detectable effect on the folding of the mutant G-CSF. The response of (R288E)GR to WT G-CSF was only slightly reduced in comparison with the response of (R288A)GR, suggesting that the expected charge repulsion effect was only slight. However, neither removal of the G-CSF charge in (E19A)G-CSF nor charge reversal in (E19R)G-CSF improved the response of (R288E)GR. The binding affinities of the various combinations were also determined and compared with the proliferation responses (TableIII). The effects on binding affinities were substantially less than the effects on proliferation, as we have observed previously (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This was particularly marked for (E19R)G-CSF with WT-GR.Table IIIProliferation and binding affinity of charge reversal mutants on Ba/F3 cells expressing G-CSF-R constructsWT-GR(R288A)GR(R288E)GREC50 nmKdnmEC50 nmKdnmEC50 nmKdnmG-CSFWT0.019 ± 0.009aMean ± S.D. of three assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.0.051 ± 0.013aMean ± S.D. of three assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.5.6 ± 1.30.39 ± 0.03aMean ± S.D. of three assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.19 ± 30.66 ± 0.09E19A0.14 ± 0.010.059 ± 0.016aMean ± S.D. of three assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.9.8 ± 0.790.31 ± 0.05aMean ± S.D. of three assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.40 ± 40.62 ± 0.05E19R270 ± 1350.35 ± 0.019.0 ± 00.30 ± 0.0115 ± 20.32 ± 0.003Mutant/WT ratiobRatio with respect to WT G-CSF and WT-GR.WT1.01.02907.6100013E19A7.41.25206.1210012E19R14,0006.94705.97906.3Mean ± range of two assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.a Mean ± S.D. of three assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5.b Ratio with respect to WT G-CSF and WT-GR. Open table in a new tab Mean ± range of two assays using one cell line expressing each receptor, including data from Fig. 5. In the absence of any structural data about G-CSF in complex with its receptor, we sought to identify the region of G-CSF that interacted with a previously described receptor-binding site in the CRHM (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), by using G-CSF mutants. We also investigated whether the Ig domain of the G-CSF-R contains a binding site for G-CSF. Our data show that Glu19, Lys23, and Asp112 in G-CSF interact with the CRHM, whereas Glu46 appears to interact with the Ig domain of the G-CSF-R (shown schematically in Fig.6). We conclude that G-CSF has two distinct receptor-binding sites and that the G-CSF-R has two binding sites for G-CSF. With respect to the CRHM-binding site, the G-CSF residues Glu19 and Lys23 in the A helix and Asp112 in the C helix form part of a charged binding patch defined by mutagenesis (22Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that is equivalent to growth hormone site II (21de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Of the residues interacting with the CRHM, we conclude that only Glu19 in the A helix interacts with Arg288 of the receptor. The large loss of activity of (E19R)G-CSF in comparison with (E19A)G-CSF shows that Glu19probably makes an electrostatic interaction with Arg288. Glu19 is sandwiched between Lys16 and Lys23 in the A helix (2Hill C.P. Osslund T.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), creating a net single positive charge in this region that the charge reversal (E19R) converts to a triple positive charge. This large change in charge could explain the substantial loss of activity of (E19R)G-CSF with the WT-GR. It is interesting that the binding affinity for this combination was not proportionately reduced (Table III), suggesting that the mechanism responsible for the loss of activity in this case is different from that with (R288A)GR, which had a similar binding affinity but not as great a loss of activity with any of the G-CSF mutants. The charge reversal mutation of the receptor, (R288E)GR, did not have as great an effect as the charge reversal mutation of G-CSF. It seems likely that the receptor has folded slightly differently to accommodate the substitution, thus reducing its effect. Arg288 is in the F–G loop of the BC domain, which was observed to be highly flexible in an NMR study (18Yamasaki K. Naito S. Anaguchi H. Ohkubo T. Ota Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, Glu is a smaller residue than Arg, thus rearrangement of the F–G loop may be possible when two Glu residues are involved in the complex (WT-G-CSF and (R288E)GR) but not when there are two Arg residues ((E19R)G-CSF and WT-GR). Similar electrostatic interactions have been described in the human GM-CSF-receptor complex (33Rajotte D. Cadieux C. Haman A. Wilkes B.C. Clark S.C. Hercus T. Woodcock J.A. Lopez A. Hoang T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1939-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Tavernier J. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the IL-4·IL-4 receptor α chain complex (35Wang Y. Shen B. Sebald W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Arg280 in the α-chain of the GM-CSF-R makes an electrostatic interaction with Asp112 in the D helix of GM-CSF (33Rajotte D. Cadieux C. Haman A. Wilkes B.C. Clark S.C. Hercus T. Woodcock J.A. Lopez A. Hoang T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1939-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas Glu21 in the A helix probably interacts with Tyr365, His367, and Ile368 of the β-common receptor chain (34Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Tavernier J. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). IL-4 binding to the IL-4 receptor α chain involves a patch of charged residues on the A and C helices that is likely to interact with charged residues on the receptor (35Wang Y. Shen B. Sebald W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In other cases such as the growth hormone-receptor complex, the most important interactions are hydrophobic (36Clackson T. Wells J.A. Nature. 1995; 267: 383-386Google Scholar). The binding of (E46A)G-CSF and (D112A)G-CSF to (R288A)GR revealed synergy or cooperativity between the receptor and G-CSF mutations, because the combined effect was substantially greater than predicted from the effect of each individual mutation. This observation suggests that a single mutation may be partially compensated for by the neighboring residues making alternative contacts in the receptor-ligand complex. However, when there are two mutations, compensatory contacts may no longer be possible, leading to greater conformational perturbation in the complex than was seen with single mutations. The two recently reported mutagenesis studies of G-CSF differ in their conclusions about whether there are one or two receptor-binding sites (22Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both agree that there is a binding site involving charged residues on the A and C helices of G-CSF, and our data on the effects of mutating Glu19 and Lys23 in helix A and Asp112 in helix C further confirm this. Reidhaar-Olsonet al. (22Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) proposed a second binding site in G-CSF involving Lys40, Phe144, Val48, and Leu49. These residues, other than Lys40, are hydrophobic, suggesting that this site may interact with a hydrophobic region of the receptor. Like Lys40, Val48, and Leu49, Glu46 is in the 310 helix in the A-B loop of G-CSF (2Hill C.P. Osslund T.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and may thus form part of this second binding site. Although Young et al. (23Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) found no evidence that Lys40 was important, they did not test the other residues. We also have found no biological effect of a K40A mutation (data not shown), but the effects of (E46A)G-CSF provide support for the existence of a second binding site involving the 310 helix of G-CSF and the Ig domain of the receptor (site III in Fig.6). Alternatively, the residues in site III may not interact directly with the receptor but may be important structurally for stabilizing the complex with the G-CSF-R. The chimeric receptor (gp130-Ig)GR was not able to transduce a proliferative signal in response to G-CSF, although it appeared to be folded correctly and bound G-CSF, albeit with reduced affinity. The reduction in binding affinity in itself did not account for the lack of response because (R288A)GR had a similarly reduced binding affinity and was able to transduce a response. We conclude that exchange of the Ig domain has removed a ligand-binding site, creating a receptor that cannot dimerize and contains a single ligand-binding site in the CRHM. This is consistent with previous studies of soluble G-CSF-R domains showing that the Ig domain is necessary for receptor dimerization (19Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, our data on (E46A)G-CSF suggest that the Ig domain interacts specifically with site III on G-CSF, rather than with the Ig domain of the second G-CSF-R, to cause dimerization (Fig. 6). A recent study using Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy detected a conformational change in G-CSF following receptor binding which likely reflects change of the 310 helix to an α-helix, consistent with the suggestion that this region is important in the G-CSF·G-CSF-R complex (37Li T. Horan T. Osslund T. Stearns G. Arakawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our proposed G-CSF-R complex has many similarities with the complex proposed for IL-6 with the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130 (38Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this hexameric complex (consisting of two molecules each of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130), IL-6 has three sites that are important for complex formation as follows: site I that binds to the IL-6R (39Savino R. Lahm A. Giorgio M. Cabibbo A. Tramontano A. Ciliberto G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4067-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and sites II and III that contact gp130 (40Brakenhoff J.P.J. de Hon F.D. Fontaine V. ten Boekel E. Schooltink H. Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Content J. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 86-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ciapponi L. Graziani R. Paonessa G. Lahm A. Ciliberto G. Savino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31249-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Site II comprises residues in helices A and C, and site III includes residues at the beginning of the D helix and residues in the AB loop of IL-6. G-CSF has a binding site equivalent to site II in IL-6 (22Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and may have a site equivalent to site III (this study and Ref. 22Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus the topology of the G-CSF·G-CSF-R complex may resemble that of the IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 complex, without the IL-6R and the interaction with site I. In both cases, the Ig domain is required for formation of a signaling complex (10Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J.L. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We propose that G-CSF first binds through site II to the CRHM of one receptor. This binding induces a conformational change in G-CSF and the G-CSF-R that allows interaction of the Ig domain of the second receptor with the 310 helix region and possibly the N terminus of the D helix of G-CSF (site III), resulting in receptor dimerization and formation of a 2:2 (G-CSF·G-CSF-R) complex. There is evidence from other studies that both G-CSF and the G-CSF-R undergo conformational changes in the receptor complex (15Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Li T. Horan T. Osslund T. Stearns G. Arakawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have not been able to detect binding of G-CSF to the Ig domain in a chimeric receptor, (GR-Ig)gp130 (12Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J.L. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the proposed requirement for a conformational change in G-CSF and/or the G-CSF-R for binding to occur. In addition, it suggests that the CRHM is the main ligand-binding site. There is some evidence that the growth hormone receptor also undergoes conformational changes after ligand binding that are required for biological responsiveness (42Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M.

Thus, receptor activation by cytokines may require more than simply achieving physical proximity of signal transducing receptor components. Our model of G-CSF·G-CSF-R complex formation accounts for the published data pertaining to the structure of this complex (15Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J.

https://openalex.org/W2056415323,"CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein, is one of the major tyrosine phosphoproteins detected in primary leukemic neutrophils from patients with CML. CRKL binds directly to BCR/ABL through its N-terminal SH3 domain, suggesting it may be involved in BCR/ABL signal transduction. However, the biological function of CRKL in either normal or leukemic cells is still largely unknown. In this study, we have examined the effects of overexpressing full length or deletion mutants of CRKL in hematopoietic cell lines. Full length, SH2- and SH3(N)-domain deletion mutants of CRKL were transfected into an interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, and 3 – 5 individual sublines which stably overexpressed each transgene were obtained [Ba/F-CRKL, Ba/F-CRKLΔSH2, and Ba/F-CRKL ΔSH3(N)]. The growth properties of these transfected cells in the presence or absence of IL-3 were not different from mock transfected or untransfected Ba/F3 cells. However, Ba/F3 cells overexpressing full length CRKL, but not deletion mutants of CRKL, were found to have an increase in their ability to bind to fibronectin-coated surfaces. Further, expression of full length, but not ΔSH2- or ΔSH3-CRKL deletion mutants, was found to alter cell morphology on fibronectin-coated plates, an effect which was further enhanced by certain kinds of stress stimuli, such as ionizing radiation. Similar results were obtained when CRKL was transiently overexpressed in Ba/F3 cells, and were also obtained in a second IL-3 dependent hematopoietic cell line, 32Dcl3. Adhesion to fibronectin was blocked by anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody, but overexpression of CRKL did not affect surface expression of β1 integrins, nor did it spontaneously induce expression of the β1 integrin `activation' epitope recognized by the 9EG7 monoclonal antibody. These data suggest a role for CRKL in signaling pathways which regulate adhesion to fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2069328603,The G2-M checkpoint in the cell cycle is identified with a set of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PD) cycles involving Cdc25 and the maturation-promoting factor (MPF); these PD cycles are coupled in a way that generates an instability. This instability arises out of a transcritical bifurcation which could be exploited by the G2 DNA damage checkpoint pathway in order to arrest or delay entry into mitosis. The coupling between PD cycles involving Wee1 and MPF does not lead to an instability and therefore Wee1 may not be a crucial target of the checkpoint pathway. A set of PD cycles exhibiting transcritical bifurcation also possesses the integrative ability of a checkpoint for 'checking' that prerequisites are satisfied prior to the next cell cycle event. Such a set of coupled PD cycles is suggested to be a core mechanism of cell cycle checkpoints.
https://openalex.org/W2090987576,"Single base mispairs and small loops are corrected by DNA mismatch repair, but little is known about the correction of large loops. In this paper, large loop repair was examined in nuclear extracts of yeast. Biochemical assays showed that repair activity occurred on loops of 16, 27, and 216 bases, whereas a G-T mispair and an 8-base loop were poorly corrected under these conditions. Two modes of loop repair were revealed by comparison of heteroduplexes that contained a site-specific nick or were covalently closed. A nick-stimulated repair mode directs correction to the discontinuous strand, regardless of which strand contains the loop. An alternative mode is nick-independent and preferentially removes the loop. Both outcomes of repair were largely eliminated when DNA replication was inhibited, suggesting a requirement for repair synthesis. Excision tracts of 100–200 nucleotides, spanning the position of the loop, were observed on each strand under conditions of limited DNA repair synthesis. Both repair modes were independent of the mismatch correction genes MSH2, MSH3,MLH1, and PMS1, as judged by activity in mutant extracts. Together the loop specificity and mutant results furnish evidence for a large loop repair pathway in yeast that is distinct from mismatch repair.

Together the loop specificity and mutant results furnish evidence for a large loop repair pathway in yeast that is distinct from mismatch repair. DNA mispairs can be categorized as either single-base mispairs such as G-T or loops, in which one strand harbors extra nucleotides. Loops can arise in vivo as polymerase slippage events (1Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 2Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18251-18254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) within repeating elements or between duplicated sequences. These looped mispairs are precursors for insertion mutations if the loop resides on the newly replicated strand or for deletion mutations if the template strand contains the heterology. Thus one biological consequence of loop repair is to reduce mutation rates of insertions and deletions. Looped mispairs can also occur during genetic recombination. Processing of loop-containing recombination intermediates plays an important role in gene conversion of insertions and deletions (reviewed in Ref. 3Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 407-521Google Scholar) and provides a second, biologically significant role for loop repair. Given the richness of repeating elements and duplicated sequences in eukaryotes, genetic stability of these organisms is particularly dependent on the ability to repair loops of varying sizes. Small loops are processed by mismatch repair in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian systems (reviewed in Refs. 4Kunkel T.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 6Modrich P.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 411-448Google Scholar), but little is known about the processing of large loops. The definition of small and large is dependent on the experimental system, as described below. In prokaryotes, small loops are substrates for mismatch correction, but large loop repair is absent or occurs inefficiently. In vivoexperiments with Escherichia coli and pneumococcus indicate that loops up to 4 nt 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotides; bp, base pairs; kb, kilobase pairs; C, complementary DNA strand; V, viral DNA strand. 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotides; bp, base pairs; kb, kilobase pairs; C, complementary DNA strand; V, viral DNA strand. are corrected by mismatch repair, whereas heterologies of 5 bases or more are usually poorly corrected (8Dohet C. Wagner R. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3395-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Gasc A.M. Garcia P. Baty D. Sicard A.M. Mol. Gen.

If repair is elicited by a nearby mismatch, large loops will undergo correction (11Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This co-correction of large loops suggests that they are poorly recognized in bacteria, rather than being inherently resistant to correction. In vitro experiments indicate a similar loop size spectrum for mismatch repair. MutS protein binds loops of 1–4 nt but not a 5-base loop (10Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mismatch repair-dependent correction in E. coli extracts is efficient for loops up to 7 nt but repair is very low for 8–22-base heterologies (12Fang W. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus loop repair in prokaryotes seems limited to small heterologies, and correction is dependent on mismatch repair. Exceptions have been reported in which large loops are processed at low levels in E. coli (13Dohet C. Dzidic S. Wagner R. Radman M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Fishel R. Kolodner R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3046-3052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized below, eukaryotic mismatch repair is active on loops up to about 12–13 nt. In contrast to bacteria, however, a number of experiments indicate that eukaryotes also repair large loops, a possibility that was suggested previously (5Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests that mismatch repair and large loop repair are distinct pathways but that their correction activities overlap partially for certain loop sizes. When transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plasmids harboring 8- or 12-base heterologies undergo loop correction (15Bishop D.K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Repair is partially reduced but not eliminated by mutation in the mismatch repair gene PMS1 (16Bishop D.K. Williamson M.S. Fogel S. Kolodner R.D. Nature. 1987; 328: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Examination of the mutation rates of microsatellite and minisatellite repeats indicates that loops of 1–13 nt are efficiently repaired by mismatch repair, as mutations in MSH2, MSH3, MLH1, orPMS1 lead to increased mutation rates for these repeats (17Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 18Strand M. Earley M.C. Crouse G.F. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, mutation rates of repeating elements of 16 or 20 bp are unaffected by mutations in MSH2, MSH3, orMSH6 (19Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Correction of strand slippage events between small tandem repeats in the DNA polymerase pol3-t mutant also depends on the size of the loop and on the mismatch repair genesPMS1, MSH2, and MSH3; loops of 1 or 7 nt are efficiently processed by mismatch repair, whereas loops of 31 or 61 bases are not targets for this repair system (21Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative to large loop repair, it has been suggested that recombinational repair may function to correct certain types of replicational errors arising in replication-impaired backgrounds such as pol3-t orrad27 (22Tran H.T. Degtyareva N.P. Koloteva N.N. Sugino A. Masumoto H. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5607-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L.

Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to possible loop processing by double-strand break recombination, the evidence in this paper and another (25Littman S.J. Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) provides direct evidence for repair of large loops. Certain alleles appear to undergo correction by an unusual, low efficiency process; transformation with a 38-base heterology arising from one such exceptional allele resulted in an apparent low level of repair that was reduced by mutations in MSH2 orMSH6 (26Luhr B. Scheller J. Meyer P. Kramer W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Large loop repair is also active during yeast meiosis. Most large (>15 bp) insertions or deletions undergo gene conversion at normal levels (27Fink G.J. Styles C.A. Genetics. 1974; 77: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nag D.K. White M.A. Petes T.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Nag D.K. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1991; 129: 669-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with correction of a looped intermediate (reviewed in Ref. 3Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 407-521Google Scholar). Looped intermediates can be visualized directly if they are capable of forming stable hairpin heteroduplexes during yeast meiosis (30Nag D.K. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.-P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Such hairpins are poorly corrected in yeast (28Nag D.K. White M.A. Petes T.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Nag D.K. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1991; 129: 669-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but co-correction is observed if a well repaired mismatch is near the hairpin (32Detloff P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One loop repair activity was revealed by examination of gene conversion of a 26-bp non-palindromic insertion. Gene conversion (and, by inference, loop repair) was reduced in msh2 orrad1 mutants but was unaffected by rad2 orrad14 mutations (33Kirkpatrick D.T. Petes T.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). No other mismatch repair mutants were reported in this study. Evidence from mammalian systems is also consistent with co-existence of small loop mismatch repair and a distinct large loop repair system. Heteroduplexes with loops up to 283 nt are efficiently repaired when transformed into mammalian cells (34Ayares D. Ganea D. Chekuri L. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions have been drawn from recombination experiments (37Bollag R.J. Elwood D.R. Tobin E.D. Godwin A.R. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1998; 148: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the loops tested were smaller. Microsatellite instability measurements andin vitro assays indicate that loops of 1–4 bases are substrates for mismatch repair (reviewed in Refs. 4Kunkel T.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 6Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Conversely,in vitro assays on loops of 8 or 16 nt were repaired independently of human MLH1 function (40Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In another study (41Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), loops of 5–27 bases were corrected in extracts defective in human MSH2. Complementation experiments with purified hMutSα or hMutSβ proteins indicated a reduced dependence on the purified proteins as the loop size was increased. These authors (41Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) attributed large loop repair to a pathway distinct from mismatch repair. The evidence from yeast and mammalian systems provides indirect support for a large loop repair system that is independent of mismatch repair. In this paper we furnish biochemical evidence for large loop repair in yeast. Efficient in vitro correction was observed for loops of 16, 27, and 216 nt. Substrate specificity was indicated by little to no correction of an 8-base loop or a G-T mispair. Large loop repair required DNA synthesis and was independent of the mismatch repair genesMSH2, MSH3, PMS1, and MLH1. A recent paper by Modrich and colleagues (25Littman S.J. Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) provides biochemical evidence for a similar function in extracts from human cells. Standard reagents, including molecular biology grade CsCl, were obtained from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite resin was a product of Bio-Rad. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs or Stratagene. Exonuclease V was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Enzymatic reactions were performed as recommended by the manufacturers. Rad1 protein and Rad10 protein were the generous gifts of A. Tomkinson (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio). f1 phage MR1, MR3, MR9, MR11, MR24, MR30, and MR33 were kindly provided by P. Modrich (Duke University). DNA from these phage was used to create heteroduplex molecules as described below. The details of loop sequence and location are provided by Littman et al. (25Littman S.J. Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An additional phage variant with a 16-bp insertion in the EcoRI site of MR11 was created in our laboratory by insertion of a duplex oligonucleotide. The resulting phage, MR11+16, contains the sequence 5′ AATTGCTAGCAAGCTT 3′ on the viral strand as confirmed by DNA sequencing. The underlined sequence encodes a site forNheI. Both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA from the f1 phage were purified from E. coli strain JM101 (F′ traD36 lacI q Δ (lacZ)M15 proA + B + /supE thi Δ(lac-proAB)) using published procedures (42Corrette-Bennett S. Lahue R.S. Henderson D. DNA Repair Protocols. 113. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 121-132Google Scholar). Heteroduplexes were prepared by slight variations of the method of Lu et al. (43Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as described (42Corrette-Bennett S. Lahue R.S. Henderson D. DNA Repair Protocols. 113. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 121-132Google Scholar, 44Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded DNA harboring the desired sequence on the complementary (C) strand was linearized with Sau96I. In some cases, HincII was used for linearization. The linear product was mixed with a 10-fold excess (w/w) of single-strand circular DNA containing the viral (V) strand sequence. NaOH denaturation and subsequent neutralization resulted in heteroduplex formation. Two consecutive hydroxyapatite columns were used to remove the bulk of the excess single-strand DNA. Linear homoduplex contaminants were removed by treatment with exonuclease V (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Heteroduplexes were further purified on one or two CsCl gradients in the presence of ethidium bromide. To create substrates that are covalently closed on both strands, the nicked heteroduplexes were treated with DNA ligase. The resulting covalently closed molecules were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The DNA was subsequently released from the gel slice by treatment with β-agarase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Final heteroduplex preparations were ≥98% pure, as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nicked heteroduplexes prepared by the method described in the previous paragraph contain a nick 114 bp 5′ to the loop. In one experiment, the nick was placed 797 bp 5′ to the loop by cleavage of the double-stranded DNA with HincII instead ofSau96I. Heteroduplex formation and purification were performed the same way for both types of nicked substrate. Heteroduplexes were created by combining the respective C and V strands from the following f1 phage: G/T, MR3 and MR1 (45Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); C8, MR 33 and MR 24 (41Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); V16, MR11 and MR11+16 (this work); C27, MR9 and MR11; V27, MR11 and MR9; V216, MR11 and MR30 (25Littman S.J. Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for C27, V27 and V216. In our nomenclature, the C or V designates the strand containing the loop, and the numeric descriptor indicates the number of bases in the loop. Yeast strains used in this study were either DY6 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2 trp1 prb1-1122 pep4-3 prc1-407; from B. Jones, Carnegie-Mellon University via T. Hsieh, Duke University) or isogenic derivatives. Gene disruptions to yieldmsh2::Tn10LUK msh3::TRP1 andpms1Δ mlh1::URA3 derivatives were performed by two rounds of single-step protocols (46Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), whereas therad1::URA3 strain arose from a single round of disruption. Knock-out plasmids were kindly provided by R. Kolodner (University of California at San Diego) for MSH2, M. Liskay (Oregon Health Sciences University) for MLH1, and L. Prakash (University of Texas Health Sciences) for RAD1. Knock-out plasmids for PMS1 and MSH3 were created in our laboratory. All derivatives were confirmed by Southern blotting and by appropriate genetic tests. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Wang et al. (47Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fifteen liters of cells were grown to an A 600 of approximately 2.0 and harvested, and spheroplasts were prepared by incubation with Zymolyase 100T (ICN Pharmaceuticals). Washed spheroplasts were lysed by homogenization with a Yamato LSC Homogenizer (model LH-41). Nuclei were isolated by differential centrifugation, and nuclear proteins were extracted by addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2m. Following removal of intact nuclei, protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Dialyzed protein was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (48Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. All loop repair assays were performed as described here unless otherwise noted. The 15-μl reaction mixture contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mmglutathione, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm each dNTP, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 24 fmol (0.1 μg) of looped substrate. When repair to both strands was being evaluated, the reaction was doubled; the DNA was split in half prior to restriction digestion. In some experiments, dNTPs were omitted with or without the addition of dideoxy-NTPs (0.1 mm each). The repair reaction was initiated by the addition of 50–100 μg of yeast nuclear protein with subsequent incubation at 30 °C for 60 min. In some cases 5 pmol of purified Rad1p (with or without 6 pmol of Rad10p) was added to the reaction mix at time 0. Quenching of the reaction was achieved by the addition of 30 μl of 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. For negative controls, the EDTA solution was added prior to the nuclear extract, and the samples were placed on ice. Following incubation, the substrate was purified by phenol and ether extractions, ethanol precipitation, and drying under vacuum. Each sample was resuspended in 14 μl of restriction buffer (1× Buffer 2, 1× acetylated bovine serum albumin; New England Biolabs). All restriction digests contained 6 units ofBsp106I (Stratagene) to linearize the DNA. Repair that led to removal of the loop was evaluated by addition of 5 units ofEcoRI for substrates C27, V27, V16, and V216. Repair in favor of the loop was evaluated with 2.5 units of NheI. For the C8substrate, the corresponding digests utilized 3 units ofXcmI or 6 units of XhoI. Repair of the G-T mispair was tested with HindIII or XhoI, as described (45Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the restriction digestions were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Unless otherwise noted, the gels were stained in a 1:10,000 dilution of Vistra Green dye (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and densitometric analysis of repair efficiencies was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager using the Blue Fluorescence/Chemiluminescence mode. Repair activity was measured as DNA present at 3.1 + 3.3-kb bands divided by the total heteroduplex recovered and then converted to femtomoles of loop repaired per h per mg of yeast nuclear protein. For conventional photographic purposes, the gel was subsequently stained in a solution of 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The analysis of the excision tracts is based on published methods (25Littman S.J. Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 49Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excision intermediates were trapped by the omission of exogenous dNTPs from the reaction, resulting in the inhibition of repair synthesis. In the analysis of the complementary strand, the amount of DNA was doubled (to 48 fmol) to increase the sensitivity of detection. Following restriction bySspI, the samples were separated by electrophoresis through a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (45 mm Tris borate, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 8.3 m urea) and subsequently electrotransferred to a Hybond-N filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and UV cross-linked. DNA oligonucleotide probes were 5′-end-labeled and used to visualize regions of interest on both the viral and the complementary strands of the substrate. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: oBL222 (ATTGTTCTGGATATTACCAG) corresponding to the MR11 viral strand nucleotides 5216–5235 and oBL223 (CTGGTAATATCCAGAACAAT) and oBL224 (ATTCGCGTTAAATTTTTGTT) corresponding to MR11 complementary strand nucleotides 5235–5216 and 5915–5896, respectively. Analysis was performed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Loop repair was examined using a biochemical assay. Loop-containing DNA molecules were created with defined size and location of the heterology (Fig.1 A). We use a nomenclature in which the letter C or V indicates the presence of the loop on the complementary or viral strand, respectively. The numeral indicates the loop size in nucleotides. Thus C27 refers to a 27-base loop on the complementary strand (Fig. 1 A). The two strands carry different restriction enzyme sites. For example, C27 has anNheI site within the looped complementary strand but anEcoRI sequence on the unlooped viral strand. For V27, the loop containing the NheI site resides on the viral strand. The presence of the heterology prevents cleavage by either enzyme. If the loop undergoes correction upon incubation with yeast cellular proteins, repair can be assessed by the acquisition of restriction sensitivity. In our analysis, unrepaired DNA migrates as a 6.4-kb linear molecule, whereas repair products are observed at 3.3 and 3.1 kb. The precise sizes of the DNA bands vary slightly depending on the size of the loop. The strandedness of repair is also revealed by this analysis. For example, correction of C27 toNheI sensitivity indicates repair in favor of the loop, whereas cleavage by EcoRI is specific for loop removal. Another cis-acting feature of these heteroduplexes is the presence or absence of a site-specific nick on the C strand, 114 bp 5′ from the loop. These substrates are referred to as nicked or covalently closed, respectively. Repair activity on nick-containing C27 and V27heteroduplexes is demonstrated in Fig. 1 B. The lanes marked0 min are negative controls where repair was prevented by the addition of EDTA prior to addition of extract. Subsequent scoring for restriction enzyme sensitivity showed little or no DNA migrating at the position of the repair products. In contrast, incubation for 60 min with yeast nuclear proteins resulted in significant repair of the 27-nt loop. Repair of the C27 molecule to anEcoRI-sensitive form is shown in the 4th lane, indicating correction that removed the loop on the nick-containing strand. There was little if any repair on the closed, viral strand (toNheI sensitivity). Correction of the V27substrate led to substantial repair on both strands (last 2 lanes), a characteristic that is considered in more detail below. Repair of the C27 and V27 molecules was dependent on the protein concentration in the assay (data not shown). Based on the results in Fig. 1, it seemed likely that large loop repair was occurring in yeast extracts. This activity was also specific for the loop size, as shown in Table I and Fig.2. The specific activity of correction toEcoRI sensitivity was about equal for C27, V27, and V216 (Table I), suggesting that loops in this size range are readily repaired. As shown in Fig. 2, correction of V16 (3rd and 4th lanes) also occurred at similar levels to V27 (1st and2nd lanes), whereas heteroduplexes containing a C8 loop or a G-T mispair yielded little or no repair under these conditions (5th to 8th lanes). The small amount of repair of C8 in the 5th laneof Fig. 2 is considered in more detail later. The general lack of repair for C8 and G-T suggests specificity of the reaction for large loops but not smaller heterologies, with a cut-off somewhere between 8 and 16 nt. The negative results with the G-T mispair and the C8 loop also argue against nonspecific reactions, such as random excision and resynthesis or simple loop clipping by endonucleases. Had either of these nonspecific pathways been operative, there should have been correction of the G-T mispair and/or the C8 loop. To test if C8 repair were being inhibited by a diffusible substance in the heteroduplex preparation, a mixing experiment was performed in which nicked V27 and C8 loop substrates were prese"

https://openalex.org/W1964017918,"A region of 150 kb has been analysed around a previously isolated, lymphoma associated, translocation breakpoint located at chromosome band 11q23. This balanced and reciprocal translocation, t(11;14)(q32;q23), has been shown to result in the fusion between chromosome 11 specific sequence and the switch γ4 region of the IGH locus. The LPC gene, encoding a novel proprotein convertase belonging to the furin family, has been identified in this region. In order to characterize further the region surrounding the translocation, we have determined the detailed structure of LPC. Here we show that LPC consists of at least 16 exons covering 25 kb, and that there is a partial duplication, involving mobile genetic elements and containing LPC exons 13 – 17 in a tail – tail configuration at 65 kb downstream. Since the chromosomal breakpoint lay between these two structures, the intervening region was further analysed and shown to contain at least two unrelated genes. The previously known SM22 gene was localized close to the 3′ tail of LPC. Furthermore, we identified the gene encoding the α2 subunit of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (Pafah1a2) at the chromosomal breakpoint. The position of another previously identified breakpoint was also located to within the first intron of this gene. Altogether, our results give evidence of a genomic instability of this area of 11q23 and show that Pafah1a2 and not LPC is the gene disrupted by the translocation, suggesting that deregulated Pafah1a2 may have a role in lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973730508,"The arginine at position 148 is highly conserved in the inward rectifier K+ channel family. Increases of external pH decrease the single-channel conductance in mutant R148H of the Kir2.1 channel (arginine is mutated into histidine) but not in the wild type channel. Moreover, in 100 mm external K+, varying external pH induced biphasic changes of open channel noise, which peaks at around pH 7.4 in the R148H mutant but not in the wild type channel. The maximum single-channel conductances are higher in the wild type channel and R148H mutant at pH 6.0 than those in the R148H mutant at pH 7.4. However, the maximal conductance is achieved with much lower external [K+] for the latter. Interestingly, the single-channel conductances and open channel noise of the wild type channel at pH 6.0 and the R148H mutant at pH 6.0 and 7.4 become the same in [K+] = 10 mm. These results indicate that the residue at position 148 is accessible to the external H+ and probably is involved in the formation of two K+ binding sites in the external pore mouth. Effective repulsion between permeating K+ ions in this area requires a positive charge at position 148, and such K+-K+ interaction is the essential mechanism underlying high K+ conduction rate through the Kir2.1 channel pore.

Inward rectifier K+ channels are important in maintaining stable resting membrane potentials and controlling excitability of many cells. The physiological function of these channels is closely related to their unique inward rectification mechanisms, which allow much larger inward current than outward current through the channels. Another important “asymmetrical” feature of the inward rectifier K+ channels is that external but not internal K+ seems to interact with and thereby activate the channel (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying inward rectification have been ascribed to voltage (V m)-dependent blockade by internal cations such as Mg2+ (2Matsuda H. Saigusa A. Irisawa H.

(Lond.). 1996; 494: 363-376Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ion permeating process itself, namely interactions between K+ ions and between the permeating K+ ion and the inward rectifier K+ channel, is less characterized. The arginine at position 148 is highly conserved in the inward rectifier K+ channel family and seems to play an important role in the K+ ion permeation process. Kubo (7Kubo Y. Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 73-83PubMed Google Scholar) showed that mutation of the arginine at position 148 into tyrosine (R148Y) in the cloned inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir2.1) (8Kubo Y. Baldwin T. Jan Y. Jan L. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) resulted in a reduction of the [K+]o-dependent activation of inward currents and a negative shift of the conductance-voltage relationship. Sabirov et al. (9Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that although mutation of the arginine at position 148 into histidine (R148H) resulted in no channel activity, coexpression of the mutant with the wild type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; 148⊕, the positive charge at position 148; NMG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; pS, picosiemens. cRNA demonstrated populations of channels with reduced single-channel conductances (γ). Moreover, the single-channel conductance is dramatically increased in a recently cloned inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir7.1) when the neutral amino acid methionine at position 125 (the equivalent position of the arginine at site 148 in Kir2.1) was mutated into a positively charged amino acid (10Krapivinsky G. Medina I. Eng L. Krapivinsky L. Yang Y. Clapham E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All these studies suggest that the positive charge at position 148 (148⊕) in the inward rectifier K+ channel family is important in determining K+ ion conduction and channel activation, yet detailed mechanisms underlying the effects of arginine at position 148 with a positive charge on K+ ion permeation through the Kir2.1 channel pore remain unexplored. With successful expression of the Kir2.1 mutant R148H inXenopus oocytes, we studied the effect of pHo and [K+]o on the single-channel conductance and the open channel “noise” in WT channel and R148H mutant. We found that the side chain of the amino acid at position 148 is accessible to the external H+. Also, the amino acid at position 148 probably is involved in the formation of a set of two K+ binding sites in the external pore mouth. Effective repulsion between permeating K+ ions in this area requires a positive charge at position 148, and such K+-K+ interaction may be an important mechanism underlying high K+ conduction rate through the Kir2.1 channel pore. Mouse macrophage Kir2.1 in pCDNAI/Amp (generously provided by Dr. Lily Jan (University of California at San Diego)) digested withHindIII and StuI was sublconed into theHindIII-SmaI sites in pALTER/Tet (Promega, Madison, WI). Site-directed mutation was then generated using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis systems (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutant DNA was sequenced with the ABI PrismTM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to confirm the presence of histidine at position 148. The WT Kir2.1 subcloned in pBSIISK(+) (a generous gift from Drs. Scott A. John and James N. Weiss) and R148H DNAs were linearized with NotI andScaI, respectively, and approximately 1 μg of purified linear DNA was used for in vitro T7 (for WT DNA) and Sp6 (for R148H DNA) transcription reactions (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Dallas, TX). Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (11Shieh R. Chang J. Arreola J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2313-2322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, Xenopus oocytes were isolated by partial ovariectomy from frogs anesthetized with 0.1% aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. The day after isolation, Xenopus oocytes were pressure-injected with either 10–100 pg of WT cRNA or 100–1000 pg of R148H cRNA. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in Barth's solution containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mmCa(N2O6), 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, 20 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.6, and used 1–3 days after RNA injection. Single-channel currents were recorded at room temperature (22–24 °C) on cell-attached or inside-out patches (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Heher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Glass electrodes were pulled using a horizontal electrode puller (Sutter, Novato, CA) from borosilicate glass tubing (WPI Inc., Saratoga, FL). The diameters of the pipettes ranged from 1 to 5 μm. The command voltage pulses and data acquisition functions were processed using a Pentium 100 computer, a DigiData board, and pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Data were sampled at 5–10 kHz and filtered at 1–5 kHz. For experiments performed in cell-attached patches, the pipette solution contained 100 mm KCl + KOH, 2 mm EDTA. For experiments carried out in inside-out patches (except for Fig. 7; see Fig. 7 legend), the pipette and internal solutions were always kept symmetrical and both contained x mm KCl + KOH, 2 mm EDTA, where x = 10–1000. Forx = 10–100, 90 mm ofN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG) was also added. Because the single-channel conductances obtained with 100 mm [K+] and 100 mm[K+] + 90 mm [NMG] are similar, NMG was not added for solutions containing [K+] > 100 mm. Because it has been shown that channels formed from coexpression of the WT and R148H subunits are sensitive to external divalent cations (9Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in this study we used pipette solutions containing no divalent cations. The patch electrode solution was pH-buffered by the following buffers: 5 mm MES for pHo < 7.0; 5 mm HEPES for 7.0 ≤ pHo≤ 8.0; 5 mm CHES for pHo > 8.0. The rundown of channel activity was avoided by treating the inside-out patches with 25 μm ofl-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Sigma) (11Shieh R. Chang J. Arreola J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2313-2322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,13Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Single-channel current amplitude was measured by manually placing a cursor at the center of the closed or the open state levels and from amplitude histograms. To compare the degree of open channel noise in the WT channel and R148H mutant under various recording conditions, current variance (ς) of single-channel recordings was calculated for the open and closed states using the Clampfit basic statistics: σ=1N−1∑i=1N(xi−x¯)2(Eq. 1) where x̄ is the mean of the samples, andN is the sample number. x̄ was calculated from a segment in the open or closed level current of the sample sweeps (187–506 sample points). The open channel current variance from a sweep was normalized to the closed level current variance of the same sweep, and the normalized ς(O)/ς(C) values were then used to compare the magnitude of open channel noise among different experimental conditions. Averaged data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's independent t test was used to assess statistical significance. Fig.1 A shows a series of sample current traces recorded at testing pulses in a cell-attached patch containing one single R148H mutant channel at pHo 7.0. Fig.1 B shows the single-channel current amplitude histogram demonstrating a single predominant conducting state. The averaged single-channel current-voltage (i-V m) relationship is plotted in Fig. 1 C. Thei-V m relationship of the R148H mutant remains inwardly rectifying, and no outward single-channel current is recorded. After successful expression of the R148H mutant in Xenopus oocytes, we explored the role of 148⊕ in K+ permeation. First we examined whether the histidine residue is accessible to external H+ and thus the charge at position 148 can be controlled by varying pHo. Fig.2 A shows the single-channel currents recorded at V m = −140 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV at various pHo in the WT channel and R148H mutant. Changes of pHo have little effect on the single-channel current in the WT channel, yet the single-channel current amplitude becomes smaller at higher (more alkaline) pHoin the R148H mutant. At low pHo, the single-channel current in the mutant is almost comparable with (although still slightly smaller than) the current in the WT channel. As pHo is increased, the single-channel current of the R148H mutant decreases in a pHo-dependent manner. The averaged single-channel currents recorded from several patches similar to that shown in Fig.2 A are plotted against membrane potentials and are shown in Fig. 2 B. The i-V mrelationships are very similar at pHo 5.0 to 6.5. Further increase of pHo decreases single-channel conductance in a pHo-dependent manner. Fig. 2 C shows that the conductance of the WT channel is little affected by changes in pHo, which is consistent with previous studies (9Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant is sensitive to pHo. The γ-pHo relationship can be described by a simple one-to-one binding curve with a pK a of 7.3, and γ varies between 26 and 7 pS. These findings strongly support that the side chain of histidine at position 148 can be protonated by external H+, and 148⊕ seems to enhance K+ ion permeation through the Kir2.1 channel pore. The effect of pHi on the R148H mutant was also examined. Fig. 3 shows that changes of pHi from 6.0 to 9.0 do not produce any change of the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant. Thus the histidine at position 148 seems to be accessible only to external H+ but not to internal H+. To determine whether the amino acid at position 148 is located within the electrical field, V mdependence of the effects of pHo on the single-channel current of the R148H mutant was examined. At each V m, the averaged single-channel currents recorded at different pHowere normalized to those at pHo 6.0 (Fig.4 A). The normalizedi-pHo relationships are similar at differentV m. Fig. 4 B shows that the pK a values determined from thei-pHo relationships in Fig. 4 A remain very similar at different V m. The lack ofV m dependence of pK a suggests that the amino acid at position 148 is probably located outside the electrical field. It is interesting to note that other than single-channel conductances, the open channel noises also vary with pHo in the R148H mutant. For example, it is evident in Fig. 2 A that the open channel noise increases when pHo is increased from 5.0 to 7.4. However, further increases of pHo result in a decrease in open channel noise. To compare open channel noise we calculated single-channel current variance at the open channel level and then normalized it to that at the closed level in the same sweeps (for details see under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 5demonstrates the normalized variance of single-channel currents in the WT channel (Fig. 5 A) and in the R148H mutant (Fig.5 B) at different pHo. The open channel noise varies with pHo in a biphasic manner and is peaked at pHo 7.4 in the R148H mutant, whereas the open channel noise remains small and does not change with pHo in the WT channel. The biphasic change of the open channel noise in the R148H mutant seems to indicate that the unitary conductance of the mutant channel quickly fluctuates between two levels. The two levels probably are correlated with protonation and deprotonation of residue 148 of the channel, because the fluctuation is smallest either at pHo 6.0 (where the channel is mostly in the protonated and high conductance state) or at pHo 9.0 (where the channel is mostly in the deprotonated and low conductance state) yet is most prominent at pHo 7.4, the pK a of the histidine residue at position 148 in the R148H mutant (Fig. 4). We have demonstrated that histidine at position 148 of the R148H mutant can be accessed by H+ from the external space and that protonation of this site may have a significant effect on ion permeation through the Kir2.1 channel. The biphasic effect of pHo on the open channel noise furthermore argues for a direct rather than an indirect or allosteric effect of 148⊕ on K+ permeation through the Kir2.1 channel (see “Discussion” for details). A direct effect of a positive charge (148⊕) on the permeating K+, a positively charged ion, most likely would be an elevation in the free energy experienced by K+. Because the single-channel conductance is higher in channel with 148⊕, what is likely to be elevated is the minimum rather than the maximum of the energy profile. Because an increase in energy minimum may be manifested as a decrease in binding affinity for K+ in the pore, we investigated the effects of varying [K+] on the single-channel conductance of the WT channel and R148H mutant. The i-V mrelationships were measured in symmetrical [K+] ranging from 10 to 1000 mm in inside-out patches exposed to internal Mg2+- and polyamine-free solutions. Fig.6 shows thei-V m curves for the WT channel at pHo 6.0, R148H mutant at pHo 6.0, and R148H mutant at pHo 7.4 (panels A–C, respectively). Fig.6 D plots the single-channel conductance against [K+] (γ-[K+] plot) for the WT channel at pHo 6.0, R148H mutant at pHo 6.0, and R148H mutant at pHo 7.4. For the WT channel at pHo 6.0, the single-channel conductance steeply increases as [K+] is increased and reaches a plateau of ∼53 pS with aK d = 49 mm. The [K+] dependence of the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant at pHo 6.0 is similar to the WT channel except that the single-channel conductance saturates at 35 pS with aK d = 30 mm. In contrast, the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant at pHo 7.4 saturates at ∼14 pS. Because the single-channel conductance is already ∼10 pS in 10 mm [K+], it is plausible that the K d for K+ binding in the R148H mutant is smaller than 10 mm (an accurate estimate of K d is difficult in this condition because it is hard to accurately measure the single-channel conductance with [K+] < 10 mm). Thus the affinity between K+ and the R148H mutant channel pore seems to be higher at pHo 7.4 than at pHo 6.0. This is consistent with the foregoing prediction that 148⊕ elevates the energy minimum experienced by the permeating K+ in the pore. It is also interesting to note in Fig. 6 D that the single-channel conductances for the three experimental conditions are the same in [K+] = 10 mm. If the increased open channel noise in 100 mm [K+] (Fig. 5) is indeed ascribed to the fluctuations of the single-channel conductance between two conducting levels and thus results in the decreased conductance of the R148H mutant in 100 mm[K+] at pHo 7.4, it would be desirable to check whether the open channel noises would also be the same in 10 mm [K+]o in different experimental conditions, just like the single-channel conductance. Fig.6 E shows this is indeed the case. The open channel noises are about the same for the WT channel at pHo 6.0, R148H mutant at pHo 6.0 and R148H mutant at pHo 7.4 in 10 mm [K+]. Moreover, the open channel noises in these conditions are all small and similar to the noises in the WT channel and R148H mutant at pHo 6.0 in 100 mm[K+]o. Thus the effect of protonation at position 148 in the R148H mutant, or 148⊕, on K+ conductance seems to be different in different bulk K+ concentration, suggesting that the free energy profile of the permeating K+ ion in the pore actually varies with bulk K+concentration. We have demonstrated that 148⊕ has a significant effect on ion permeation through Kir2.1 channel pore, and the effect is closely correlated with bulk K+concentration. Because the results in Fig. 6 are obtained in symmetrical [K+] and the results in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 suggest that the residue at position 148 is located in the external pore mouth, it is desirable to further examine whether it is external K+ or internal K+ that is crucial for the effect of 148⊕ on K+ permeation. Fig.7 shows the effects of asymmetrically varying [K+] on the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant at pHo 7.4. In these experiments, the pipette solution contained either 10 or 100 mm [K+], and the inward currents were recorded at variousV m in inside-out patches perfused with either 10 mm [K+] or 100 mm[K+]. The results indicate that the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant is dependent on [K+]o but not internal [K+] ([K+]i). The V mindependence of the effect of pHo (Fig. 4) and the lack of effect of pHi (Fig. 3) as well as [K+]i(Fig. 7) on the single-channel conductance of the R148H mutant all suggest that position 148 is located very close to the external pore mouth. In this study, we report successful expression of the Kir2.1 mutant R148H in Xenopus oocytes. We find that to obtain the same level of functional channel expression, the amounts of the R148H cRNA injected into the Xenopus oocytes have to be about 10–100 times more than those of the WT cRNA. The fact that the R148H mutant retains inward rectification (because ofV m-dependent block of the channels by intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines), sensitivity to extracellular Ba2+ block (data not shown), and K+ selectivity (9Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggests the absence of major conformational changes caused by the mutation. Our results show that the side chain of the amino acid residue at position 148 is accessible to external H+ and that this amino acid is probably located outside the electrical field. Furthermore, protonation of this position is essential for a faster transportation of permeating K+ions. Because changes of pHo from 5.0 to 9.0 do not have any significant effect on the single-channel conductance of the WT channel (Fig. 2), external H+ (or OH−) binding to a part of the channel other than at position 148 probably can be neglected as a first approximation in the discussion of the findings here. Basically there are two possible mechanisms underlying the effect of pHo at position 148: protonation-deprotonation at this position may have an indirect or allosteric effect on channel protein and thus on K+ permeation, or it may have a direct effect on K+ permeation through the Kir2.1 channel pore. If pHo modulated K+ permeation through the pore by an allosteric effect, the single-channel conductance in the R148H mutant at pHo 6.0 presumably should have a more constant relationship with that at pHo 7.4 in any given [K+]. It is therefore difficult to envisage why the single-channel conductances would be the same for the R148H mutant at pHo 6.0 and 7.4 in 10 mm [K+] yet are quite different in 100 mm or higher [K+]o (Fig. 6 D). Moreover, in Figs.2 A and 5 we have noted that pHo has an effect on both the open channel noise and the single-channel conductance. Most interestingly, the open channel noise has a biphasic change. When pHo is increased from 6.0 to 7.4 the open channel noise increases. However, further increasing pHo results in a decrease in the open channel noise. With an allosteric model, it is hard to envisage the biphasic effect on the open channel noise by pHo. Also, with a sampling interval of 100 μs, we still could not resolve the open channel noise into discrete conducting states, indicating that the effect of protonating the channel has very fast kinetics. Because protein conformational change usually is a much slower process, it seems unlikely that an allosteric effect involving large scale protein conformational changes is responsible for the pHo effect in the R148H mutant. In contrast to the indirect or allosteric model, a direct effect of external H+ on K+ ion conduction seems much more plausible. A direct effect of protonation-deprotonation in the pore will certainly fit the very fast kinetics of the modulatory effect of external H+ (revealed by the increased open channel noise). In view of higher single-channel conductance in channels with 148⊕ (Fig. 2), we have argued that the direct effect of 148⊕ may involve elevation of some energy minimum rather than energy maximum of the permeating K+ ion. The findings in Fig. 6 are also consistent with the notion that direct protonation of the pore at residue 148 elevates some free energy minimum of the K+ ion in the pore. It is very interesting, then, that the effect of protonation of position 148 in the R148H mutant (the positive charge at position 148, 148⊕) on K+ ion conductance or the free energy profile of permeating K+ may be so different in different [K+]o (Figs. 6 and 7). Because changes of free energy minimum of permeating K+ ion by protonation-deprotonation of the R148H mutant channel pore (manifested as increased open channel noise at pHo 7.4) are evident only in high (100 mm) but not in low (10 mm) [K+]o, it seems that 148⊕ would have a significant effect on K+ ion permeation only when the pore is “crowded” with permeating K+ ions. In other words, ion-ion interaction is very likely to be involved in the effect of 148⊕ on K+ ion permeation, which would in turn imply simultaneous existence of at least two permeating K+ ions around position 148. We therefore propose that there is a set of ligand groups around position 148 in the external pore mouth to accommodate two permeating K+ ions (Fig.8). When the ligand at position 148 has an uncharged histidine (Fig. 8 B), the ligand may participate in coordinating the partly dehydrated permeating K+, and the set of ligands represents two “complete” binding sites for K+ ions. Because the energy minimum is always low, theK d and maximal single-channel conductance are both small. However, when the ligand at position 148 is positively charged (Fig. 8 C), it can no longer participate in coordinating K+ ions. The sites are now somewhat insufficient to accommodate two K+ ions, and the second K+would have to adopt a position (site b in Fig.8 A) competing for some coordinating ligands with the first K+ (at site d in Fig. 8 A). Both theK d for loading the second K+ tosite b in Fig. 8 A and the maximal single-channel conductance would therefore be larger. When [K+]ois low (e.g. ≤ 10 mm) there would be no significant occupancy by the second K+ of site b (whose apparent K d with site d already occupied by a K+ presumably is ∼49 mm, Fig. 6 D). The permeation of K+ thus would always happen on an “unenhanced” basis whether position 148 is charged or not (if there is little occupancy of site b by the other K+ ion there would be no significant ion-ion interaction to enhance the exit of the K+ at site d). The unitary conductance and open channel noise level would therefore remain very similar in 10 mm[K+]o, no matter whether it is WT channel or R148H mutant, and no matter whether pHo is 6.0 or 9.0. The multi-ion nature of inward rectifier K+ channels has been supported by several lines of evidence including anomalous greater fraction effect (15Hagiwara S. Miyazaki S. Krasne S. Ciani S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a flux-ratio exponent of 2.2 (16Stampe P. Arreola J. Perez-Cornejo P. Begenisich T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), steepV m-dependent block by monovalent ions (17Hagiwara S. Miyazaki S. Rosenthal N.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 621-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and V m- and [K+]o-dependent inward rectification (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether and how these multiple K+ ions in the pore interact with each other. In this study, we add a new line of evidence for the multi-ion nature of the Kir2.1 channel pore. Furthermore, we suggest that the interaction between the permeating K+ ions near position 148 is essential for rapid transportation of the K+ ion through the pore and that position 148 probably is directly involved in or close to a set of two K+ binding sites in the external pore mouth. The arginine residue at position 148 is highly conserved in the Kir family, and it is likely that this highly conserved arginine at position 148 will also influence K+ permeation through other inward rectifier K+ channels in a way similar to what is described in this study. The existence of a set of two closely associated K+ binding sites in the external mouth of the Kir2.1 channel is intriguing, because it is very similar to what is described for the l-type Ca2+ channels (18Kuo C.C. Hess P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 629-655Google Scholar, 19Kuo C.C. Hess P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 657-682Google Scholar, 20Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to see whether this is a more general attribute in the molecular design of these cationic channels in the future. In addition to the set of K+ binding sites located near the external mouth of the pore, it has recently been suggested that K+ and Ba2+ may compete for a binding site located in the electrical field in the Kir2.1 channels (11Shieh R. Chang J. Arreola J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2313-2322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further characterization of how K+ ions in these different binding sites interact with each other or with the channel may provide us a more complete picture of the ion permeation process through the pore of the Kir2.1 channel.

https://openalex.org/W2006262832,"According to the Lorenz et al. (Lorenz, M., Poole, K. J., Popp, D., Rosenbaum, G., and Holmes, K. C. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 246, 108–119) atomic model of the actin-tropomyosin complex, actin residue Asp-311 (Glu-311 in yeast) is predicted to have a high binding energy contribution to actin-tropomyosin binding. Using the yeast actin mutant E311A/R312A in the in vitro motility assays, we have investigated the role of these residues in such interactions. Wild type (wt) yeast actin, like skeletal α-actin, is fully regulated when complexed with tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn). Structure-function comparisons of the wt and E311A/R312A actins show no significant differences between them, and the unregulated F-actins slide at similar speeds in thein vitro motility assay. However, in the presence of Tm and Tn, the mutation increases both the sliding speed and the number of moving filaments at high pCa values, shifting the speed-pCa curve nearly 0.5 pCa units to the left. Tm alone (no Tn) inhibits the motilities of both actins at low heavy meromyosin densities but potentiates only the motility of the mutant actin at high heavy meromyosin densities. Actin-Tm binding measurements indicate no significant difference between wt and E311A/R312A actin in Tm binding. These results implicate allosteric effects in the regulation of actomyosin function by tropomyosin. According to the Lorenz et al. (Lorenz, M., Poole, K. J., Popp, D., Rosenbaum, G., and Holmes, K. C. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 246, 108–119) atomic model of the actin-tropomyosin complex, actin residue Asp-311 (Glu-311 in yeast) is predicted to have a high binding energy contribution to actin-tropomyosin binding. Using the yeast actin mutant E311A/R312A in the in vitro motility assays, we have investigated the role of these residues in such interactions. Wild type (wt) yeast actin, like skeletal α-actin, is fully regulated when complexed with tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn). Structure-function comparisons of the wt and E311A/R312A actins show no significant differences between them, and the unregulated F-actins slide at similar speeds in thein vitro motility assay. However, in the presence of Tm and Tn, the mutation increases both the sliding speed and the number of moving filaments at high pCa values, shifting the speed-pCa curve nearly 0.5 pCa units to the left. Tm alone (no Tn) inhibits the motilities of both actins at low heavy meromyosin densities but potentiates only the motility of the mutant actin at high heavy meromyosin densities. Actin-Tm binding measurements indicate no significant difference between wt and E311A/R312A actin in Tm binding. These results implicate allosteric effects in the regulation of actomyosin function by tropomyosin. The contraction of vertebrate striated muscle is regulated by the thin filament-associated proteins tropomyosin (Tm) 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; S1, myosin subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; HMM, heavy meromyosin; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; S1, myosin subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; HMM, heavy meromyosin; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. and troponin (Tn), which modulate the interaction of actin and myosin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (2Ebashi S. Endo M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1968; 18: 123-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Each Tm molecule associates with one Tn molecule and seven actin monomers. The amino acid sequence of Tm contains a pattern of charged and uncharged amino acids that repeats 14 times along its length (3McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As each pair of repeats corresponds to an actin monomer along the actin filament, it has been inferred that the binding of Tm to actin is dominated by electrostatic interactions (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Tn is composed of three subunits: TnT, TnI, and TnC. The TnC subunit binds Ca2+ and confers calcium sensitivity to the actin-Tm-Tn system. According to the three-state model of thin filament regulation (4McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), the actin-Tm-Tn complex can assume three structural states: blocked, closed, and open. In the blocked state there is a very low incidence of myosin binding. When Ca2+ binds to TnC, the Tm-Tn complex shifts to the closed state, uncovering additional myosin weak binding sites on the actin filament. The increase in weak binding and the initial strong binding of myosin induce Tm-Tn to shift from the closed (where it prevents myosin strong binding) to the open state. According to this model, the azimuthal shift of Tm-Tn around the axis of the actin filament sterically regulates myosin binding to actin.Despite the elegance of the three-state model, it cannot explain well the findings of earlier acto-S1 ATPase solution studies (5Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Williams D.L.J. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E.

Results from these studies describe the ability of Tm alone to both inhibit, at low S1 concentrations, actin-activated S1 ATPase rates and to potentiate the reaction at intermediate, nonsaturating concentrations of S1. Although inhibition can readily be explained using the steric block model, the potentiation suggests the presence of an allosteric component in actomyosin regulation.The Ca2+-induced Tm-Tn movement on actin was first indicated by x-ray diffraction studies (8Huxley H.E.

Squire J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy has also been used to directly visualize this shift in Tm-Tn position (11Wakabayashi T.

Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) identified the positions for the Tm-Tn complex on actin in the presence and absence of Ca2+. A high resolution model of the Tm-F-actin complex was proposed by Lorenzet al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) on the basis of their x-ray fiber diffraction investigation. According to these authors, Tm alone and Tm-Tn in the presence of Ca2+ reside in the same closed-state orientation on the actin filament. In this study Lorenz et al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) predict that 16 actin residues participate in the electrostatic interactions between F-actin and Tm and calculate their ΔG contributions to this interaction. Our choice of residue 311 as a suitable starting point to test the predictions of this model and to gain additional insight into Tm regulatory function was based on two criteria. First, according to Lorenz et al.(1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) residue 311 has a relatively high energy contribution to actin-Tm interaction, and secondly, there is a viable yeast actin mutant at this location: E311A/R312A (20Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).In this study, we compared the regulation and function of wt and E311A/R312A yeast actins, as well as their interaction with Tm, in thein vitro motility assays, equilibrium binding experiments, and acto-S1 ATPase measurements. The results of our work support an allosteric explanation of the role of Tm in the regulation of actomyosin interaction.DISCUSSIONThe goal of this study was to test predictions of the Lorenzet al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) model of the actin-Tm complex in the closed state. According to this model, actin residue 311 contributes significantly to the closed-state interaction of actin and Tm. Our initial hypothesis, based on the above model, was that a mutation at this residue should reduce the affinity of Tm for actin by about 4-fold and thus destabilize the closed-state binding of Tm to the mutant actin. This, in turn, would be reflected in an altered Ca2+sensitivity of the regulated mutant actin filaments in the in vitro motility assays.As a first step, we established that wt yeast actin is fully regulated by Tm-Tn (38Gerson J.H. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 57Google Scholar). Thus, one important result of this work is that regulation can be conveniently studied using yeast actin in thein vitro motility assays. Korman and Tobacman (39Korman V. Tobacman L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 347Google Scholar) have also shown yeast actin to be fully regulated in acto-S1 ATPase studies. These results pave the way for regulation experiments using mutated yeast actins.The main result of this work is that in the in vitromotility assay, the regulated 311/312 mutant actin filaments move faster at high pCa values than do regulated wt actin filaments. Because structural and functional comparisons of the two actins did not reveal any significant differences, these motility results indicate an increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the regulated 311/312 actin filaments.At first glance, these results appear consistent with the prediction of Lorenz et al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) regarding the role of actin residue 311 in actin-Tm binding. According to the McKillop and Geeves (4McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) three-state model, the binding of Ca2+ to Tn induces conformational changes and steric transitions, which expose myosin weak binding sites on F-actin. At the same time the Tm-Tn complex moves into the closed position. If, in the mutant actin thin filaments, the Tm-Tn complex is not as firmly stabilized in the closed (+Ca2+) position, then a smaller number of myosin heads will be sufficient to induce a shift of the Tm-Tn complex into the open position. This should be especially apparent at low Ca2+ concentrations, where few cross-bridges bind to the thin filaments. Our findings seemed to indicate that this is the case. In addition, the fact that larger fractions of mutant than of wt filaments moved at high pCa values lent support to this premise.The explanation that the mutant actin regulation results are due, at least to some extent, to the destabilization of the actin-Tm complex in the closed state is not indicated by direct binding measurements. Tm binds to wt and 311/312 mutant actins with similar affinities under both closed-state (Tm alone) and open-state (Tm in the presence of S1 at a saturating concentration) conditions. Similar binding of S1·ADP to wt and mutant actin-Tm complexes rules out another possible cause for unequal stability of these actin-Tm complexes in the closed state. The unchanged binding properties of the 311/312 mutant suggest that explanations other than changes in equilibrium binding must be considered to account for our observations. These possibilities include:The three-state equilibrium could be shifted toward the open state if the mutaton actually increases the 311/312 actin open-state affinity for Tm. However, our results suggest that Tm binding to actin under open-state conditions is unchanged by the mutation. This implies that the improved sliding of regulated 311/312 actin filaments at high pCa is not caused by a stabilization of the open-state complex.The increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the regulated 311/312 mutant actin may be because of a destabilization of the actin-Tm-Tn complex in the blocked state (+Tn, −Ca2+), shifting the equilibrium toward the closed state. Such an effect could be the result of a reduced blocked-state affinity for Tm or an increase in the affinity of Tn for Ca2+ in the mutant actin-Tm-Tn complex. Using regulated actin-activated S1 MgATPase assays, we showed that the 311/312 mutation does not change the affinity of Tn for calcium. It may appear surprising that the pCa profiles for regulated wt and mutant actin filaments are the same in ATPase activity measurements but different in the in vitro motility assays. However, the rate-limiting steps in the two types of experiments are different. Unlike the ATPase reaction, filament sliding is an analog of unloaded muscle fiber shortening and is rate-limited by ADP release from actomyosin·ADP (40Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Consequently, ATPase values are not necessarily predictive of filament sliding speeds in the motility assays (41Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Regarding changes in blocked state stability, although we cannot exclude this possibility, circumstantial evidence argues against it. The modulation of actin motility by Tm alone shows that 311/312 mutation-induced changes also occur in the absence of the blocked state. Moreover, because actin residues 311 and 312 are not within the Tm binding site in the blocked state, any change in such binding to 311/312 mutant actin would be allosteric in nature.Interpreting our data in terms of the Lorenz et al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) model of the actin-Tm complex and the three-state model of regulation (4McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) may not be the only way to approach this issue. Squire and Morris (42Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) speculate that Tm alone could occupy a range of positions on the F-actin filament and that the modeled closed state of Tm on actin (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) could very well be an average of these Tm positions. If so, this would affect the identification of amino acid residues involved in the actin-Tm interaction and the estimation of their ΔGcontributions. An example of this would be the recent study of the actin mutation E93K in the Drosophila flight muscle (43Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This residue was not implicated in the Lorenz et al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) study but, nevertheless, strongly affects the function of Actin-Tm filaments in the in vitro motility assay.Finally, the 311/312 mutation may modify the regulation via allosteric shifts in the regulated actin system. One possible scenario is that the binding of S1 to the actin-Tm-Tn complex in the presence of ATP and at low calcium concentrations is enhanced by this mutation. Results of motility experiments with the actin-Tm (no Tn) complexes are also consistent with allosteric explanations. Inhibition of actin sliding by Tm at low densities of HMM on the motility assay surface could be described in purely steric terms, i.e. an insufficient density of myosin heads binding to the closed-state actin-Tm complex to tilt the equilibrium toward the open state (active form) of this complex. (This argument may also explain the prior observations that acto-S1 MgATPase is inhibited by Tm at low S1 concentrations (5Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Williams D.L.J. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Williams Jr., D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).) However, the potentiation of the 311/312 mutant actin-Tm sliding at higher concentrations of HMM together with the reported potentiation of acto-S1 MgATPase by Tm as S1 concentrations are increased (5Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Williams D.L.J. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Williams Jr., D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (albeit not at conditions close to V max) cannot be explained using a steric-block model of regulation or stronger S1·ADP binding to the mutant actin-Tm complex. These findings point to an allosteric change in the mutant actin-Tm complex leading to kinetic and/or mechanical consequences in the actomyosin cross-bridge cycle. Such consequences could, for example, include an increase in the rate of the ADP release step and/or of the ATP binding step and the subsequently more rapid release of the actin-Tm complex.It should be noted that a missense mutation in actin (R312H) has been associated with hereditary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart failure of unknown origin (44Olson T.M. Michels V.V. Thibodeau S.N. Tai Y.S. Keating M.T. Science. 1998; 280: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Nearly one-third of all heart failures are associated with relaxation abnormalities that could stem from an increased affinity of TnC for calcium, impaired sequestration of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or slowed extrusion of calcium by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (45Poole-Wilson P. Colucci W. Massie B. Chatterjee K. Coats A. Heart Failure. Churchill Livingston, New York1996: 4-5Google Scholar, 46Katz A.M. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The elevated pCa50 for the speed-pCa curve (Fig. 2 A) suggests that regulated thin filaments containing the E311A/R312A actin mutant would exhibit slowed or impaired relaxation following contraction. A similar effect occurring in thin filaments containing the R312H mutation could contribute to the etiology of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.In summary, using in vitro motility assays, we found that yeast actin is a convenient substitute for skeletal actin in the study of regulation. Our in vitro motility experiments uncovered notable differences in regulation between wt and 311/312 mutant actin. As indicated by regulated acto-S1 ATPase assays, we saw no differences in the affinity of Tn for Ca2+ in thin filaments reconstituted with either actin. We detected no significant differences between the two actins in their binding of Tm, S1, and S1·ADP and small, if any differences in other nonregulated functions. Our results underscore the importance of allosteric factors in the regulation of actomyosin interactions. The contraction of vertebrate striated muscle is regulated by the thin filament-associated proteins tropomyosin (Tm) 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; S1, myosin subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; HMM, heavy meromyosin; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; S1, myosin subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; HMM, heavy meromyosin; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. and troponin (Tn), which modulate the interaction of actin and myosin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (2Ebashi S. Endo M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1968; 18: 123-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Each Tm molecule associates with one Tn molecule and seven actin monomers. The amino acid sequence of Tm contains a pattern of charged and uncharged amino acids that repeats 14 times along its length (3McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol.

As each pair of repeats corresponds to an actin monomer along the actin filament, it has been inferred that the binding of Tm to actin is dominated by electrostatic interactions (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Tn is composed of three subunits: TnT, TnI, and TnC. The TnC subunit binds Ca2+ and confers calcium sensitivity to the actin-Tm-Tn system. According to the three-state model of thin filament regulation (4McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys.

(1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) regarding the role of actin residue 311 in actin-Tm binding. According to the McKillop and Geeves (4McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) three-state model, the binding of Ca2+ to Tn induces conformational changes and steric transitions, which expose myosin weak binding sites on F-actin. At the same time the Tm-Tn complex moves into the closed position. If, in the mutant actin thin filaments, the Tm-Tn complex is not as firmly stabilized in the closed (+Ca2+) position, then a smaller number of myosin heads will be sufficient to induce a shift of the Tm-Tn complex into the open position. This should be especially apparent at low Ca2+ concentrations, where few cross-bridges bind to the thin filaments. Our findings seemed to indicate that this is the case. In addition, the fact that larger fractions of mutant than of wt filaments moved at high pCa values lent support to this premise.The explanation that the mutant actin regulation results are due, at least to some extent, to the destabilization of the actin-Tm complex in the closed state is not indicated by direct binding measurements. Tm binds to wt and 311/312 mutant actins with similar affinities under both closed-state (Tm alone) and open-state (Tm in the presence of S1 at a saturating concentration) conditions. Similar binding of S1·ADP to wt and mutant actin-Tm complexes rules out another possible cause for unequal stability of these actin-Tm complexes in the closed state. The unchanged binding properties of the 311/312 mutant suggest that explanations other than changes in equilibrium binding must be considered to account for our observations. These possibilities include:The three-state equilibrium could be shifted toward the open state if the mutaton actually increases the 311/312 actin open-state affinity for Tm. However, our results suggest that Tm binding to actin under open-state conditions is unchanged by the mutation. This implies that the improved sliding of regulated 311/312 actin filaments at high pCa is not caused by a stabilization of the open-state complex.The increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the regulated 311/312 mutant actin may be because of a destabilization of the actin-Tm-Tn complex in the blocked state (+Tn, −Ca2+), shifting the equilibrium toward the closed state. Such an effect could be the result of a reduced blocked-state affinity for Tm or an increase in the affinity of Tn for Ca2+ in the mutant actin-Tm-Tn complex. Using regulated actin-activated S1 MgATPase assays, we showed that the 311/312 mutation does not change the affinity of Tn for calcium. It may appear surprising that the pCa profiles for regulated wt and mutant actin filaments are the same in ATPase activity measurements but different in the in vitro motility assays. However, the rate-limiting steps in the two types of experiments are different. Unlike the ATPase reaction, filament sliding is an analog of unloaded muscle fiber shortening and is rate-limited by ADP release from actomyosin·ADP (40Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Consequently, ATPase values are not necessarily predictive of filament sliding speeds in the motility assays (41Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Regarding changes in blocked state stability, although we cannot exclude this possibility, circumstantial evidence argues against it. The modulation of actin motility by Tm alone shows that 311/312 mutation-induced changes also occur in the absence of the blocked state. Moreover, because actin residues 311 and 312 are not within the Tm binding site in the blocked state, any change in such binding to 311/312 mutant actin would be allosteric in nature.Interpreting our data in terms of the Lorenz et al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) model of the actin-Tm complex and the three-state model of regulation (4McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) may not be the only way to approach this issue. Squire and Morris (42Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) speculate that Tm alone could occupy a range of positions on the F-actin filament and that the modeled closed state of Tm on actin (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) could very well be an average of these Tm positions. If so, this would affect the identification of amino acid residues involved in the actin-Tm interaction and the estimation of their ΔGcontributions. An example of this would be the recent study of the actin mutation E93K in the Drosophila flight muscle (43Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This residue was not implicated in the Lorenz et al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) study but, nevertheless, strongly affects the function of Actin-Tm filaments in the in vitro motility assay.Finally, the 311/312 mutation may modify the regulation via allosteric shifts in the regulated actin system. One possible scenario is that the binding of S1 to the actin-Tm-Tn complex in the presence of ATP and at low calcium concentrations is enhanced by this mutation. Results of motility experiments with the actin-Tm (no Tn) complexes are also consistent with allosteric explanations. Inhibition of actin sliding by Tm at low densities of HMM on the motility assay surface could be described in purely steric terms, i.e. an insufficient density of myosin heads binding to the closed-state actin-Tm complex to tilt the equilibrium toward the open state (active form) of this complex. (This argument may also explain the prior observations that acto-S1 MgATPase is inhibited by Tm at low S1 concentrations (5Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Williams D.L.J. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Williams Jr., D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).) However, the potentiation of the 311/312 mutant actin-Tm sliding at higher concentrations of HMM together with the reported potentiation of acto-S1 MgATPase by Tm as S1 concentrations are increased (5Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Williams D.L.J. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Williams Jr., D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (albeit not at conditions close to V max) cannot be explained using a steric-block model of regulation or stronger S1·ADP binding to the mutant actin-Tm complex. These findings point to an allosteric change in the mutant actin-Tm complex leading to kinetic and/or mechanical consequences in the actomyosin cross-bridge cycle. Such consequences could, for example, include an increase in the rate of the ADP release step and/or of the ATP binding step and the subsequently more rapid release of the actin-Tm complex.It should be noted that a missense mutation in actin (R312H) has been associated with hereditary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart failure of unknown origin (44Olson T.M. Michels V.V. Thibodeau S.N. Tai Y.S. Keating M.T. Science. 1998; 280: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Nearly one-third of all heart failures are associated with relaxation abnormalities that could stem from an increased affinity of TnC for calcium, impaired sequestration of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or slowed extrusion of calcium by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (45Poole-Wilson P. Colucci W. Massie B. Chatterjee K. Coats A. Heart Failure. Churchill Livingston, New York1996: 4-5Google Scholar, 46Katz A.M. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The elevated pCa50 for the speed-pCa curve (Fig. 2 A) suggests that regulated thin filaments containing the E311A/R312A actin mutant would exhibit slowed or impaired relaxation following contraction. A similar effect occurring in thin filaments containing the R312H mutation could contribute to the etiology of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.In summary, using in vitro motility assays, we found that yeast actin is a convenient substitute for skeletal actin in the study of regulation. Our in vitro motility experiments uncovered notable differences in regulation between wt and 311/312 mutant actin. As indicated by regulated acto-S1 ATPase assays, we saw no differences in the affinity of Tn for Ca2+ in thin filaments reconstituted with either actin. We detected no significant differences between the two actins in their binding of Tm, S1, and S1·ADP and small, if any differences in other nonregulated functions. Our results underscore the importance of allosteric factors in the regulation of actomyosin interactions. The goal of this study was to test predictions of the Lorenzet al. (1Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) model of the actin-Tm complex in the closed state. According to this model, actin residue 311 contributes significantly to the closed-state interaction of actin and Tm. Our initial hypothesis, based on the above model, was that a mutation at this residue should reduce the affinity of Tm for actin by about 4-fold and thus destabilize the closed-state binding of Tm to the mutant actin. This, in turn, would be reflected in an altered Ca2+sensitivity of the regulated mutant actin filaments in the in vitro motility assays. As a first step, we established that wt yeast actin is fully regulated by Tm-Tn (38Gerson J.H. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 57Google Scholar). Thus, one important result of this work is that regulation can be conveniently studied using yeast actin in thein vitro motility assays. Korman and Tobacman (39Korman V. Tobacman L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 347Google Scholar) have also shown yeast actin to be fully regulated in acto-S1 ATPase studies. These results pave the way for regulation experiments using mutated yeast actins. The main result of this work is that in the in vitromotility assay, the regulated 311/312 mutant actin filaments move faster at high pCa values than do regulated wt actin filaments.

The metalloenzyme nitrogenase, which catalyzes the biological reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3), is composed of two separable component proteins (1Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J.

Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 3Burgess B.K. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1377-1406Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The other component, the iron (Fe) protein, is a homodimer containing a single [4Fe-4S] cluster bridged between the subunits and two nucleotide binding sites (4Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The current model for the catalytic mechanism of nitrogenase holds that the reduced Fe protein, with two bound MgATP molecules, binds to the MoFe protein, and a single electron is transferred from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein in a reaction that is somehow coupled to the hydrolysis of two MgATP molecules (6Burgess B.K. Stiefel E.I. Coucouvanis D. Newton W.E. Molybdenum Enzymes, Cofactors, and Model Systems. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 144-169Google Scholar). The oxidized Fe protein, with two molecules of MgADP bound, then dissociates from the MoFe protein (7Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Several cycles of component protein binding, MgATP hydrolysis, and intercomponent electron transfer are required to reduce substrates by multiple electrons (8Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Acc. Chem.

MgATP appears to play several key roles in the reduction of substrates by nitrogenase (8Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1997; 30: 260-266Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). First, the binding of MgATP to the Fe protein induces conformational changes within the Fe protein (10Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). These conformational changes influence the binding of the Fe protein to the MoFe protein (11Thorneley R.N.F. Gresshoff P.M. Roth L.E. Stacey G. Newton W.E. Nitrogen Fixation: Achievements and Objectives. Chapman and Hall, New York1990: 103-109Crossref Google Scholar). Once the two proteins have associated, MgATP hydrolysis functions somehow to facilitate electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. Finally, the hydrolysis of MgATP to MgADP and Pi is believed to be involved in stimulating the dissociation of the Fe protein from the MoFe protein (12Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem.

Acta. 1978; 527: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that combining the Fe protein isolated from the bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp2) with the MoFe protein isolated from the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii (Av1) resulted in a nondissociating complex (Cp2·Av1) (see Equation 1). Cp2+Av1⇌k−1k1Cp2·Av1Ka=k1k−1(Eq. 1) The association constant (K a) for the Cp2·Av1 complex was determined to be approximately 10-fold higher than that for the homologous A. vinelandii nitrogenase complex and 100-fold higher than that for the homologous C. pasteurianumnitrogenase complex (15Emerich D.W. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4369-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, this protein-protein complex could form with or without nucleotides (17Emerich D.W. Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the Cp2·Av1 complex is inactive in all substrate reduction activities, it was later found (18Larsen C. Christensen S. Watt G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that this complex could still hydrolyze MgATP to MgADP + Pi at low rates (36-fold lower than the homologous protein complexes). In the present work, we present evidence that primary electron transfer, but not subsequent electron transfer reactions, occurs within the Cp2·Av1 tight complex. Primary electron transfer was found to occur without added nucleotides at low rates, but the addition of MgATP accelerated electron transfer by more than 10,000-fold to rates near those observed in the homologous protein complexes. How these results relate to our current understanding of the roles of MgATP in the nitrogenase mechanism is discussed. Nitrogenase Fe and MoFe proteins were expressed inA. vinelandii cells and purified to apparent homogeneity essentially as described previously (19Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). C. pasteurianum strain W5 (a gift from J.-S. Chen, Virginia Tech) was grown under N2-fixing conditions essentially as described (21Carnahan J.E. Castle J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1958; 75: 121-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the nitrogenase Fe protein was purified (22Vandecastle J.P. Burris R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 794-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified biuret method (23Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard, or by the visible absorption using absorption coefficients of 11.1 mm−1·cm−1 at 400 nm for reduced Av2 and Cp2 (24Anderson G.L. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2118-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and 62.3 mm−1·cm−1 at 400 nm for reduced Av1 (24Anderson G.L. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2118-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Watt G.D. Wang Z.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1844-1850Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All of the nitrogenase proteins used in this study had specific activities of at least 1,800 nmol of acetylene reduced·min−1·mg of protein−1. Protein manipulations were performed in the absence of O2 in sealed serum vials under an argon atmosphere or in an argon-filled glovebox (Vacuum Atmospheres, Hawthorne CA). Absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer in 2.0-ml quartz cuvettes fitted with serum stoppers. Anaerobicity was obtained by purging the cuvettes with O2-free argon for 6 min. The buffer used for these experiments was 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, with 2 mmdithionite. A MgATP-regenerating system was included, as indicated, during nitrogenase catalysis to prevent the formation of MgADP, which is a known inhibitor of MgATP binding to the Fe protein (26Bui P.T. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 2462-2465Google Scholar). The Av1 P clusters were oxidized by 2 eq of electrons by the addition of an excess of oxidized indigo disulfonate (27Christiansen J. Tittsworth R.C. Hales B.J. Cramer S.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10017-10024Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This was done by exchanging dithionite-reduced Av1 into anaerobic, dithionite-free 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, with 250 mm NaCl, by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column in an anaerobic glovebox. Av1 was then oxidized to the P2+state by the addition of an excess of oxidized indigo disulfonate (28Pierik A.J. Wassink H. Haaker H. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 15 min. Indigo disulfonate was then separated from Av1 by passage through a Dowex-1 (Sigma) column equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. The oxidized Av1 (P2+) was collected, and the concentration was determined from the absorption spectrum and the known absorption coefficient of 73 mm−1·cm−1 at 400 nm (29Watt G.D. Burns A. Lough S. Tennent D.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4926-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reduced, dithionite-free Cp2 was prepared by passage of the protein through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a dual-mode cavity and an Oxford ESR 900 liquid helium cryostat. In all cases, 4-mm calibrated quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad, Buena, NJ) were used. All spectra were recorded at 12 K with 1,024 points/scan. The conversion time and time constant were 10.24 ms. All other parameters are noted in the figure legends. Electron transfer from Cp2 to Av1 was monitored by the increase in the visible absorbance of Cp2 upon oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster from the reduced (+) to the oxidized (2+) state (30Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This electron transfer reaction was monitored in real time by use of a Hi-Tech SF61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a data acquisition and curve fitting system (Salisbury, Wilts, U. K.). The SHU-61 sample handling unit was kept inside an anaerobic glovebox (Coy Products, Grass Lake, MI) with a gas atmosphere of 95% N2 and 5% H2 and an oxygen concentration less than 1 ppm oxygen. Reactant solutions were thermostatted to within ± 0.1 °C by means of an FC-200 Techne flow cooler attached to a closed circulation Techne C-85D water circulator (Techne Ltd., Duxford, Cambridge, U. K.). Data were collected at 430 nm for the oxidation/reduction of Fe protein. Earlier work demonstrated no significant change in the absorption coefficient of the MoFe protein at 430 nm resulting from electron transfer from the Fe protein (30Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out in 100 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4, with 2 mm dithionite. In all cases, reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing reactants contained in the two drive syringes of the stopped-flow instrument. The instrument mixing time was determined to be approximately 4 ms. Reaction conditions are noted in the appropriate figure legends. Apparent first-order rate constants for electron transfer (k obs) were determined from nonlinear, least squares fits of the absorbance versus time traces to the equation for a single exponential. In all cases, the absorbanceversus time traces represented the average of three consecutive experiments. Potentiometric redox titrations were performed essentially as described previously (31Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Mortenson L.E. Watt G.D. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13112-13117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in 50 mmTricine buffer, pH 8.0, with 150 mm NaCl and a series of redox mediators. For titrations of the Cp2 [4Fe-4S]2+/+couple, the mediators included a 50 μm concentration each of flavin mononucleotide (Em = −172 mV and −238 mV), benzyl viologen (Em = −361 mV), methyl viologen (Em = −440 mV), andN,N′-propane-2,2′-dipyridinium (Em = −590 mV; a gift from Dr. Vernon Parker, Utah State University). For titrations of the Av1 P2+/N couple, the mediators included a 100 μm concentration each of flavin mononucleotide, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. The reduction potential of the mediator and protein solution was adjusted by the addition of a 5 mmdithionite (Na2S2O4) solution or a 25 mm oxidized indigo disulfonate solution. For titrations below −500 mV, reduction was accomplished in a standard H-cell using a Hewlett-Packard 6212C constant power supply with a gold wire working electrode and a platinum mesh counter electrode (2 × 1 cm). In all cases, the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl microelectrode that was calibrated against a standard calomel electrode. All potentials are reported relative to the normal hydrogen electrode. At defined potentials, 250-μl aliquots were removed and were frozen in calibrated quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad, Buena, NJ). The relative concentrations of the reduced and oxidized states for each metal center were determined by the peak-to-peak height of the appropriate EPR signal. Plots of the fraction of maximum signal intensityversus potential were fit to the Nernst equation (Equation2) using the nonlinear, least squares fitting program Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) where E is the measured potential, Em is the midpoint potential,R is the gas constant, T is the temperature,n is the number of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant, [red] is the concentration of the reduced species, and [ox] is the concentration of the oxidized species (32Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). E=Em−RTnFln([red]/[ox])(Eq. 2) For titrations of the Cp2 [4Fe-4S]2+/+couple, EPR spectra were recorded at 12 K, with a 9.64-GHz microwave frequency, a 10-mW microwave power, a 100-kHz modulation frequency, and a modulation amplitude of 5.028 G. For titrations of the Av1 P2+/N couple, EPR spectra were recorded at 12 K, with a 9.38-GHz microwave frequency, a 50-mW microwave power, a 100-kHz modulation frequency, and a modulation amplitude of 12.63 G. Midpoint potentials have an estimated error of ± 10 mV. Electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein can be monitored by the increase in the electronic absorption spectrum in the 430 nm region as a result of the oxidation of the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster from the 1+ to the 2+ oxidation state (30Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When dithionite-reduced Cp2 ([4Fe-4S]+) was combined with dithionite-reduced Av1 in the absence of any nucleotides, an increase in the absorbance in the 430 nm region was observed over 10 min as shown in Fig. 1 A. This is consistent with the oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of Cp2 to the 2+ state resulting from electron transfer to the MoFe protein in the absence of nucleotides. In contrast, when A. vinelandiiFe protein (Av2) was mixed with Av1 under identical conditions, no changes were observed in the 430 nm region of the absorbance spectrum even after a 10-min incubation (Fig. 1 B, traces 1and 2). Only upon the addition of MgATP to the Av2·Av1-containing solution did the absorbance in the 430 nm region increase (Fig. 1 B, trace 5), consistent with the dependence of electron transfer on MgATP for the homologous complex. To confirm that the increase in absorbance observed by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy upon incubation of Cp2 with Av1 was caused by the oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of Cp2, EPR spectroscopy was used to monitor the oxidation state of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The Cp2 [4Fe-4S]+ cluster is an S = 1/2 system with a rhombic EPR spectrum centered at g = 1.93 (Fig.2, trace 2) (33Zumft W.G. Cretney W.C. Huang T.C. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Zumft W.G. Palmer G. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Palmer G. Multani J.S. Cretney W.C. Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon oxidation to [4Fe-4S]2+, the cluster goes to anS = 0 state and is EPR-silent (36Mortenson L.E. Zumft W.G. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dithionite-reduced Av1 demonstrates low field EPR signals (g = 4.3 and 3.6) (not shown) and a signal at g = 2.0 (Fig. 2,trace 1), which arise from FeMoco (37Orme-Johnson W.H. Hamilton W.D. Jones T.L. Tso M.Y.W. Burris R.H. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3142-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Münck E. Rhodes H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Davis L.C. Brill W.J. Shah V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 400: 32-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 39Zimmermann R. Münck E. Brill W.J. Shah V.K. Henzl M.T. Rawlings J. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 537: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The Fe protein spectrum can be added to the MoFe protein spectrum to give a predicted spectrum that would arise from a nonreacting mixture of Cp2 and Av1 (Fig. 2, trace 3) in dithionite. An EPR spectrum was recorded for the mixture of Cp2 and Av1 after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 2, trace 4). As shown, the intensity of the reduced Cp2 signal centered at g = 1.93 decreased, consistent with the one-electron oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of Cp2 to the EPR-silent 2+ oxidation state. This result confirms the transfer of an electron from Cp2 supposed from the changes in the absorbance spectra. No changes were seen in the intensity or line shapes of the EPR signals attributed to FeMoco of Av1 after incubation with Cp2. Likewise, EPR signals ascribed to the P clusters did not appear upon incubation of Av1 with Cp2. To confirm that Cp2 could transfer an electron to the P cluster, which is the putative electron acceptor, changes in the EPR signals of more oxidized states of the P clusters were monitored. One-electron oxidation of the P cluster from the P N state results in an S = 1/2 and 5/2 mixed spin state (designated as P+) that gives rise to perpendicular mode EPR signals in the g = 2 andg = 5 regions (40Tittsworth R.C. Hales B.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9763-9767Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two-electron oxidation of the P cluster from the P N state results in anS ≥ 3 spin system (designated as P2+) that gives rise to a parallel mode EPR signal at g = 11.8 (28Pierik A.J. Wassink H. Haaker H. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to use EPR to monitor electron transfer from the Fe protein to the P cluster of the MoFe protein by monitoring the reduction of the P2+ oxidation state to the P+ oxidation state (41Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16770-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig.3 (trace 1) shows the perpendicular mode EPR spectrum of Av1 oxidized by four electrons (each P cluster oxidized by two electrons to the P2+ state). The existence of the P2+ oxidation state was evident by a parallel mode EPR signal at g = 11.8 (data not shown). The predicted EPR spectrum (obtained from the sum of spectra 1 and 2) for the nonreacting mixture of Av1 in the P2+ oxidation state and reduced Cp2 is shown in Fig. 3 (trace 3). When the two proteins were actually allowed to react, however, the spectrum shown in Fig. 3, trace 4, was obtained. The disappearance of the g = 1.93 signal ascribed to Cp2 and the appearance of signals with g values at 5.28, 2.04, 1.94, and 1.80 are consistent with the oxidation of the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster to the 2+ state and the reduction of each P cluster from the P2+ to the P+ state. In addition, the parallel mode EPR signal for P2+ disappeared after Cp2 and Av1 were mixed (data not shown). In control incubations, when reduced, dithionite-free Av2 was incubated with oxidized Av1 (P2+state) in the absence of MgATP, no changes in the EPR spectrum were observed, indicative of a lack of electron transfer in the absence of nucleotides for the Av2-Av1 mixture. To obtain kinetic constants for the observed electron transfer from Cp2 to Av1, the changes in the electronic spectrum at 430 nm were monitored by stopped-flow spectroscopy upon mixing reduced Cp2 with Av1 in the absence of nucleotides. A first-order increase in the absorbance at 430 nm was recorded with an apparent first-order rate constant of 0.007 s−1 (Fig. 4 A,trace 1). When MgADP was included, again an apparent first-order increase in the absorbance was observed, with an apparent first-order rate constant of 0.018 s−1 (Fig.4 A, trace 2). The addition of MgATP significantly increased the rate of oxidation of Cp2 as evident in Fig.4 B. An apparent first-order rate constant for electron transfer in the presence of MgATP was measured to be 100 s−1. This apparent rate constant for primary electron transfer from Cp2 to Av1 in the presence of MgATP represents more than a 104-fold increase from the nucleotide free condition and approaches that observed for the MgATP-dependent rate constants found for the homologous A. vinelandii nitrogenase complex (42Mensink R.E. Wassink H. Haaker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To gain insights into how nucleotides might accelerate the rate of electron transfer in the Cp2·Av1 complex, the midpoint potentials (Em) of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ couple of Cp2 and the P2+/N couple of Av1 were determined for the individual proteins alone and for the two proteins when complexed together. According to electron transfer theory (43Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7801) Google Scholar), the difference between the Em values (or the free energy change ΔG) for the electron donor and the electron acceptor will affect the rate of electron transfer (44Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Emvalues for the metal centers were also determined in the presence of MgADP. Similar experiments in the presence of MgATP are not possible because of MgATP hydrolysis by this nitrogenase complex. Fig.5 A presents redox titrations for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster couple of Cp2 either in the uncomplexed state or when complexed with Av1. From fits of the data to the Nernst equation (Equation 1), Em values of −300 and −510 mV were determined in the absence of nucleotides for the uncomplexed and complexed states, respectively. When MgADP was included, the Em for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ couple of free Cp2 was shifted to −380 mV, consistent with shifts seen earlier (45Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When MgADP was added to Cp2 complexed with Av1, the calculated Em of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster couple was −510 mV, the same as the value calculated for the complexed Cp2 couple in the absence of nucleotides. Fig. 5 B presents redox titrations for the P2+/N couple of Av1 in the uncomplexed state and when complexed to Cp2, either in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of MgADP. Within the error of the experiment, no changes in the Em for the P2+/Ncouple were observed as a result of complex formation with Cp2 (approximately −310 mV). Likewise, the addition of MgADP to the Cp2·Av1 complex did not result in detectable changes in theEm for the P clusters. The recent x-ray structures for two nitrogenase Fe protein-MoFe protein complexes have provided important insights into the interactions between these two proteins (46Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 47Rees D.C. Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J. Peters J.W. Seefeldt L.C. Howard J.B. Elmerich C. Kondorosi A. Newton W.E. Biological Nitrogen Fixation for the 21st Century. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 11-16Google Scholar). However, some major questions remain, including how the affinity between the two component proteins is changed during the catalytic cycle, how MgATP binding and hydrolysis are involved in this process, and how MgATP is coupled to intercomponent electron transfer. Recent investigations of the three known tight nitrogenase complexes, namely the Cp2·Av1 complex (18Larsen C. Christensen S. Watt G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the MgADP·AlF4−-stabilized Av2·Av1 complex (48Spee J.H. Arendsen A.F. Wassink H. Marritt S.J. Hagen W.R. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the L127Δ Av2·Av1complex (49Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12976-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), have begun to provide some insights into these outstanding questions. For example, the earlier observation that MgATP could be hydrolyzed at considerable rates by the Cp2·Av1 complex (18Larsen C. Christensen S. Watt G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) supported the idea that the Fe protein and MoFe protein do not have to dissociate for exchange of nucleotides to occur. Similar results have been found in the L127Δ Av2·Av1 complex. 2M. J. Ryle, unpublished results. More recently, examinations of the L127Δ Fe protein-MoFe protein tight complex (49Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the Av2·Av1·MgADP·AlF4− tight complex (48Spee J.H. Arendsen A.F. Wassink H. Marritt S.J. Hagen W.R. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have revealed that primary electron transfer can occur within the complex without MgATP hydrolysis. It was concluded, contrary to longstanding models, that MgATP hydrolysis was not absolutely required for electron transfer between the proteins. The present results for the Cp2·Av1 nitrogenase complex further define a role for MgATP in the electron transfer process by revealing that one important function is to accelerate the primary electron transfer rate. It is of interest to consider how nucleotides might function to accelerate primary electron transfer within the complex. Perhaps the simplest explanation would be that nucleotides change the thermodynamic driving force for the electron transfer reaction. This could be accomplished by nucleotide-induced changes in theEm values for either the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster or the MoFe protein P cluster, thereby increasing the difference between the two Em values (ΔEm). This explanation is tempting considering earlier work that demonstrated that MgATP or MgADP binding to the free Fe protein results in about a −120 mV shift in theEm for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ couple (10Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 45Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). More recently, it has also been shown that association of the L127Δ Fe protein with the MoFe protein to form a tight complex results in shifts in the Em values of two of the three nitrogenase metal centers to favor electron transfer (50Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12976-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TheEm for the L127Δ Fe protein [4Fe-4S]2+/+ couple was observed to shift by more than −200 mV upon complex formation to about −600 mV, and theEm for the MoFe protein P2+/N couple shifted by −80 mV to −390 mV. Negative shifts in the Em values of the P cluster and the [4Fe-4S] cluster were also observed in the Av2·Av1·MgADP·AlF4− nitrogenase complex (48Spee J.H. Arendsen A.F. Wassink H. Marritt S.J. Hagen W.R. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present work, the Em values for the metal centers of free Cp2 and free Av1 and for the Cp2·Av1 complex were determined. Em values observed for the free proteins were consistent with previously reported values (28Pierik A.J. Wassink H. Haaker H. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,45Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 51Morgan T.V. Mortenson L.E. McDonald J.W. Watt G.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 33: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the complex, only the Em of the [4Fe-4S] cluster changed (from −300 to −510 mV). Unlike the other two complexes described above, no change in theEm of the P cluster was observed in the Cp2·Av1 complex. Despite the particular differences that complex formation has on the Em values for each metal cluster in the three tight complexes, a theme that emerges is that the energy of complex formation is coupled to changes in theEm values to favor electron transfer. Although MgADP is observed to accelerate the electron transfer rate in the Cp2·Av1 complex by 2.5-fold, MgADP resulted in no additional changes in the Em values for any of the metal centers within the complex. This observation suggests that the rate acceleration induced by MgADP is not the result of changes in the driving force (i.e. Em values). Although it is not possible to measure the effects of MgATP on theEm values in the complex because of the hydrolysis reaction, electron transfer theory can be used to make the argument that, similar to MgADP, the rate acceleration in electron transfer induced by MgATP cannot be accounted for solely by changes in driving force. It should be noted that the electron transfer reactions in the Cp2·Av1 complex may not necessarily follow electron transfer theory, but for the purposes of this argument this assumption will be made. A simplified version of the Marcus equation which has evolved from analysis of many protein electron transfer reactions (44Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) is shown in Equation 3 logket=15−0.6R−3.1(ΔG−λ)2/λ(Eq. 3) where k et is the electron transfer rate constant (s−1), R is the distance between the donor and acceptor (Å), ΔG is the free energy difference (eV), and λ is the reorganization energy (eV). Using this equation, values for the primary electron transfer rate constants with and without MgATP, a value for R of 14 Å (46Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and a range for λ from 1.8 to 2.4 eV (52Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53Lanzilotta W.N. Parker V.D. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it was possible to estimate changes in the free energy (ΔΔG) that would be required for this rate acceleration. From such a calculation, and using the standard relationship between ΔG and ΔEm, a ΔΔEm from −620 to −720 mV is estimated. Thus, for a change in the driving force to account fully for the observed change in the rate constant for electron transfer, MgATP binding or hydrolysis in the complex would have to change the ΔEm more than −600 mV. Such large changes inEm values seem unreasonable given the previously observed effects of MgATP on nitrogenase. In addition, changes inEm in redox sites in proteins of this magnitude would be unprecedented. Whereas it is reasonable to assume that part of the mechanism for the MgATP-dependent rate acceleration of electron transfer might involve changes in Emvalues, this alone is not likely to account for the entire observed rate enhancement. Another possible way to increase the rate of electron transfer could be through changes in the pathway(s) for electron transfer. Changes in electron transfer pathways in other proteins have been observed to have large effects on the electron transfer rate (54Jacobs B.A. Mauk M.R. Funk W.D. MacGillivray R.T.A. Mauk A.G. Gray H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4390-4394Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Possible electron transfer pathways from the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster to the MoFe protein P cluster can be suggested from the structures of the two nitrogenase complexes (46Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 47Rees D.C. Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J. Peters J.W. Seefeldt L.C. Howard J.B. Elmerich C. Kondorosi A. Newton W.E. Biological Nitrogen Fixation for the 21st Century. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 11-16Google Scholar). In the two likely pathways, at least one H-bond (i.e. noncovalent bond) jump is predicted. Such jumps have been suggested to be less efficient in electron transfer (55Onuchic J.N. Beratan D.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 349-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 56Wuttke D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1007-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). One possibility is that MgATP binding or hydrolysis in the Cp2·Av1 complex could result in changes in the electron transfer pathway, possibly including changes in the distance or orientation of the H-bond jump. In this case, some of the energy associated with MgATP binding or hydrolysis would be coupled to changes in protein conformation within the complex that would alter the electron transfer pathway. Finally, two additional observations from the present work deserve comment as they provide additional insights into the roles of MgATP in the nitrogenase reaction. First, it is evident that for the Cp2·Av1 nitrogenase complex, the acceleration of the electron transfer rate is at least partially uncoupled from the rates of MgATP hydrolysis. Although MgATP addition accelerated the primary electron transfer to rates near those observed for the homologous nitrogenase complexes, the rates of MgATP hydrolysis for the Cp2·Av1 complex are 36-fold lower than for the homologous complex (18Larsen C. Christensen S. Watt G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that MgATP hydrolysis can occur in nitrogenase complexes without electron transfer, thus indicating that hydrolysis can be uncoupled from electron transfer. The present results indicate that electron transfer rates can also be uncoupled from MgATP hydrolysis rates. This latter point is supported by the observations of electron transfer without MgATP in other nitrogenase tight complexes (48Spee J.H. Arendsen A.F. Wassink H. Marritt S.J. Hagen W.R. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 49Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, an important observation from the present work is that Cp2 is unable to transfer more than one electron into the resting state of the MoFe protein even when MgATP is present. After electron transfer, the [4Fe-4S] cluster of Cp2 can be reduced in the complex, yet no further electron transfer (i.e. oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster) is observed. This would explain why the Cp2·Av1 complex is inactive because at least two electrons would be required to reduce even the simplest substrates (57Burgess B.K. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology: Molybdenum Enzymes. John Wiley and Sons, New York1985: 161-220Google Scholar). The reason that the second electron cannot be transferred in the Cp2·Av1 complex is not clear. It would appear from the current results that the limitation is not the hydrolysis of MgATP because MgATP hydrolysis continues in the Cp2·Av1 complex before and after the primary electron transfer event. Instead, the lack of transfer of the second electron into the MoFe protein may have to do with the proper coupling of MgATP binding or hydrolysis to changes in the Fe protein or MoFe protein structures, or the oxidation state of the electron acceptors in the MoFe protein. The lower rates of MgATP hydrolysis by the Cp2·Av1 complex may also account for the lack of transfer of a second electron. Additionally, dissociation of the Fe protein from the MoFe protein, which does not occur readily in the Cp2·Av1 complex, may somehow be required for subsequent electron transfer reactions. Studies to begin to understand these open questions are currently under way. We thank Drs. William Lanzilotta, Jason Christiansen and Jennifer Huyett for helpful discussions."

Thus, although the heme domain of nNOS2 is capable of binding heme, the heme coordination geometry is highly abnormal in that it probably has a proximal non-cysteine thiolate ligand both in the ferric and ferrous states. Moreover, negligible spectral perturbation of the nNOS2 ferriheme was detected upon addition of either l-arginine or imidazole.

Recent high resolution x-ray crystal structure determinations of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the heme-binding domain fragment of inducible NOS (iNOS) have proven that the overall protein topology is very different from that of either regular cytochrome P450 or chloroperoxidase, although the proximal ligand to the central ferriheme iron is a conserved cysteine residue (10Crane B.R.

The endogenous thiolate sulfur donor ligand to the central heme iron provides a rational basis for the proposed two-step sequential catalytic mechanism of NOS, where the first step involving the formation of the intermediateN ω-hydroxyarginine may follow a cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase mechanism (1Marletta M.A. J.

Aside from the protein chemistry, the in vivo regulation of NOS, from the viewpoint of control of NO synthesis, has been the subject of extensive investigation because of diverse physiological functions of NO in cells. Thus, NO produced by NOS isoforms induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation, serves as a messenger in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and also acts as a cytotoxic agent in the immune system to kill tumor cells and intracellular parasites (2Bredt D.S.

In the case of nNOS, the genes are either constitutively or stage- and tissue-specifically expressed in different neuronal cell types and in skeletal muscle (5Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol.

Although the coding region of the nNOS gene encodes a 160-kDa protein, the mRNA is considerably larger (∼9.5 kilobase pairs), and significant molecular diversity is found, mostly in the 5′-noncoding region. This diversity is produced by specific alternative splicing at different splice sites and may affect the stability of individual mRNA species (5Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol.

The presence of at least six different variants of alternatively spliced nNOS mRNA species, which are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner, has been reported (28Brenman J.E. Xia H. Chao D.S. Black S.M. Bredt D.S. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 19: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Among them, a natural mutant of mouse nNOS created by specific alternative splicing and designated nNOS2 by Ogura et al. (29Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is one of the most unusual and interesting. First, it has been shown that the primary structure of mouse nNOS2 lacks the C-terminal half of the highly conserved “dihydrofolate reductase module” region in the heme-binding domain (corresponding to residues 504–608 in mouse or rat nNOS1) due to in-frame mutation with skipping of exons 9 and 10 by alternative splicing (29Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Second, the missing 105-amino acid residue region contains Glu-597, which is involved in l-arginine binding (11Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Third, despite the difference of the heme domain sequence of nNOS2 from that of nNOS1, their calmodulin-binding and cytochrome P450 reductase domains remain intact at the primary structure level (29Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Fujisawa H. Ogura T. Kurashima Y. Yokoyama T.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fourth, the alternatively spliced product is specifically expressed in mouse central nervous system cells (29Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Fujisawa H. Ogura T. Kurashima Y. Yokoyama T. Yamashita J. Esumi H.

Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), implying an unknown conserved function in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, none of these natural variants of NOS isoforms has been characterized spectroscopically in detail. It is therefore of particular interest to investigate whether or not the alternatively spliced product nNOS2 has a native heme coordination geometry and retains the ability to function as a true “nitric-oxide synthase.” In this paper, we report the heterologous overexpression of mouse nNOS2 cDNA gene inEscherichia coli for the first time and the molecular and spectroscopic characterization of the recombinant enzyme.

The transfer vectors carrying the cDNA for nNOS1 and nNOS2 were individually constructed for recombination with AcNPV as follows: an NheI site was newly generated upstream of the first Met codon of the cDNA for nNOS1 with a phosphorylated DNA oligomer (NOSNhe I: 5′- GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GTG AGC TAG CAT GGA AGA GCA CAC G-3′). The DNA fragment coding the altered 5′-leader sequence and N-terminal region of nNOS was replaced by the corresponding region of nNOS2 using two unique restriction enzyme sites, ScaI and AflII sites. The obtained plasmids (pTZ19RNOS1/NheI, and pTZ19RNOS2/NheI) were excised by NheI and XbaI digestion, and the DNA fragments encoding nNOS genes were individually ligated into theNheI site of pJVP10Z using the compatibility betweenXbaI and NheI sites. The directions of the cDNA were identified by DNA sequencing. The coinfection with AcNPV DNA and the constructed transfer vectors was conducted by using a linear transfection module (Invitrogen), and the screening of the recombinant virus was carried out according to the manufacturer's manual, Max Bac baculovirus expression system manual (Invitrogen) and the literature (37King L.A.

First, anNdeI site was newly generated to include the first Met codon of the cDNA for the wild-type nNOS in pTZ19RNOS1 by using the mutation primer (NOSNde I: 5′-GAC GGC CAG TGA GAA CAT ATG GAA GAG CAC ACG-3′). Because the obtained plasmid (pTZ19RNOS1/NdeI) has two NdeI sites, the plasmid was partially digested withNdeI, followed by complete digestion with XbaI. The NdeI-XbaI fragment containing the full-length nNOS1 cDNA was then inserted between the NdeI andXbaI sites of the multicloning linker of pCWori+. The pCWori vectors for nNOS2 were prepared by exchanges of theAflII-XbaI fragment encoding the alternatively spliced region. The resultant pCWori vectors and pKY206 were introduced by repeated transformation into the host strain, E. colistrain BL21 (Takara Biomedicals), which lacks the two proteaseslon and ompT. The recombinant enzymes were expressed as described in the literature (39Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Iwasaki T. Kurahashi Y. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The standard assay was performed at 25 °C in assay mixture containing 16.7 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, 4.2 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 667 μm EDTA, 167 μm EGTA, 667 μm dithiothreitol, 16.7 μml-[U-14C]arginine, 667 μm NADPH, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 6.7 μg of calmodulin, 1.25 μm FAD, 1.25 μm FMN, 2.5 μm H4BP and the enzyme, in a total volume of 30 μl. The specific activity ofl-[U-14C]Arg used in the assays was 11.84 GBq/mmol. The NADPH-dependent diaphorase activity was measured using dichlorophenolindophenol as an artificial electron acceptor by monitoring the NADPH-dependent reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol at A 600 nm, essentially as described previously (9Abu-Soud H.M.

The standard assay was performed at 25 °C in an assay mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 85 μm NADPH, 50 μm dichlorophenolindophenol , 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, and the enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. The effect of Ca2+-calmodulin complex on NADPH diaphorase activity was measured in the same assay mixture, except for the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and 10 μg of calmodulin. Recombinant nNOS1 and nNOS2 produced using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system were partially purified on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by a fast desalting column, Ampure SA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purification of recombinant nNOS1 and nNOS2 produced in E. coli strain BL21 was performed on ice or at 4 °C essentially as described in the literature (40Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The catalytic activity and the purity of the purified wild-type enzyme, nNOS1, were comparable with those previously reported for recombinant nNOS1 by others (40Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P.

Absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U3210 spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. EPR measurements were carried out using a JEOL JEX-RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which the temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller as reported previously (47Iwasaki T.

(Tokyo, Japan), using a JEOL JES-TE200 spectrometer equipped with an ES-CT470 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which the temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments digital temperature indicator/controller model 9650 and the magnetic field was monitored with a JEOL NMR field meter ES-FC5. All spectral data were processed using KaleidaGraph software version 3.05 (Abelbeck Software). Purified nNOS was estimated by using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The homology search against data bases was performed with the BEAUTY and BLAST network service (49Worley K.C. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The multiple sequence alignments were performed using the CLUSTAL X graphical interface (50Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35617) Google Scholar) with small manual adjustments. The alternatively spliced product of mouse nNOS variant, nNOS2, is specifically expressed in the central nervous system and has a 105-amino acid deletion in the C-terminal highly conserved region of the heme-binding domain (29Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We first produced the nNOS2 cDNA gene product in a baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell expression system and partially purified nNOS2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In contrast to the case of the recombinant wild-type enzyme nNOS1, partially purified nNOS2 lacked citrulline-forming activity at 25–37 °C (data not shown). Because essentially the same result has been obtained with recombinant mouse nNOS2 expressed in cell culture (29Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Proceedings of the Third International Meeting on Biology of Nitric Oxide. Portland Press, London1994Google Scholar), we constructed the pCWori+ vector harboring the cDNA of the full-length nNOS2 gene, and produced the recombinant mouse nNOS2 in an E. coli expression system co-producingE. coli GroELS for detailed spectroscopic characterization. The recombinant enzyme was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was used for further characterization (see below). Fig.2 shows typical optical absorption spectra of purified mouse nNOS2 produced in E. coli strain BL21. The ferric form of nNOS2 purified either in the presence or absence of l-arginine contained bound protoheme IX, whose content varied considerably from preparation to preparation. Thus, a broad Soret peak centered at 416 nm was clearly visible in most preparations (represented by preparation 1) of purified nNOS2, 2The typical optical spectra of purified nNOS2 (preparation 1) were essentially identical to those of partially purified nNOS2 heme domain produced in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in the absence of H4BP, except for the absence of the spectral contribution of the diflavin reductase domain (T. Iwasaki, H. Hori, and T. Nishino, unpublished results). whereas a small shoulder around 420 nm could be detected in a few instances in which the spectral contribution was primarily from the bound diflavin centers in the reductase domain (represented by preparation 2) (Fig.2 A). In either case, the occupancy of bound heme in purified nNOS2 was consistently much lower than that of r"

The fluorescence anisotropy data of both mutants were adequately described by two rotational correlation times, and these are compared with the theoretically expected values based on the rotational diffusion of an idealized dumbbell. These data imply that the motion of the N- and C-terminal domains of troponin C are independent. They also suggest that in the metal-free, calcium-saturated and calcium-saturated troponin I peptide-bound states, troponin C is elongated, having an axial ratio of 4–5. Calcium or magnesium binding to the high affinity sites alone reduces the axial ratio to approximately 3. However, with calcium bound to sites III and IV and in the presence of a 1:1 molar ratio of the troponin I peptide, troponin C is approximately spherical. The metal ion and troponin I peptide-induced length changes in troponin C may play a role in the mechanism by which the regulatory function of troponin C is effected.

On the basis of the crystal structure of TnC, with calcium bound to the C-terminal domain sites (1Herzberg O. James M.N.G. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 2Satyshur K.A. Rao S.T. Pyzalska D. Drendel W. Greaser M. Sundaralingam M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) propose that the major conformational change that occurs when the regulatory N-terminal domain sites bind calcium involves the exposure of a hydrophobic patch resulting from the movement of the B/C helix away from the N/A/D helices. Subsequent structural data, for example, the high resolution NMR (7Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystal structures of calcium-saturated (8Houdusse A. Love M.L. Dominguez R. Grabarek Z. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1695-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) TnC and the x-ray crystal structure of the calcium-saturated N-terminal domain of TnC (9Strynadka N.C. Cherney M. Sielecki A.R. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), have confirmed the validity of this model. However, TnC is but one component of a three-component complex, and the issue of whether the structural changes that occur in “isolated” TnC directly reflect its behavior in the functioning troponin complex remains unresolved. Additionally, it has been proposed that the hydrophobic patch that is exposed in the calcium-replete N- and C-terminal domains are binding sites for troponin I (10Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), and the structure and dynamics that TnC displays under such conditions is not known. We have recently completed the steady-state optical spectroscopic characterization of two mutants of chicken skeletal TnC bearing a single Trp residue at positions 78 (F78W) and 154 (F154W) in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. 2M. C. Moncrieffe, S. Yu Venyaminov, T. E. Miller, G. Guzman, J. D. Potter, and F. G. Prendergast, submitted for publication. The introduced Trp residue in both mutants is located at position −z + 1 of the EF-hand, which is immediately after the last metal ion coordinating residue in site II (F78W) and site IV (F154W), respectively. Both mutants were iso-functional with wild-type TnC in the restoration of contractile activity to TnC-depleted-skinned muscle fibers. 3J. D. Potter, J. D. Guzman, J. Zhao, and T. Miller, unpublished information. The spectroscopic properties of Trp-154 are sensitive to calcium and magnesium binding at sites III and IV (11Chandra M. McCubbin W.D. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), while Trp-78 responds to calcium binding at both the N- and C-terminal domain sites. On the basis of the spectroscopic properties of the Trp residue, we surmised that the indole moiety is in a rigid molecular environment and that this feature should render these mutants useful in studying the overall dynamic behavior of TnC. The presence of a single Trp residue in either domain may also provide information about the local dynamics of the N- and C-terminal domains of TnC. This paper reports a study of the rotational and translational motion of F78W and F154W. We have first used minimum perturbation mapping (12Shih H.H. Brady J. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,13Haydock C. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 98: 8199-8214Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to explore possible conformation of the Trp residue in both F78W and F154W starting from the x-ray crystal structure of 2-calcium TnC (2Satyshur K.A. Rao S.T. Pyzalska D. Drendel W. Greaser M. Sundaralingam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1628-1647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, time-resolved anisotropy decays of the Trp fluorescence and sedimentation velocity experiments have been used to obtain information regarding the rotational motion and the shape that TnC adopts in the metal-free-, metal-bound (calcium and magnesium)-, and calcium-troponin I peptide (residues 96–116 of troponin I)-ligated states, respectively. Our results suggest that the dynamics of metal-free, 2·Ca2+, and 2·Mg2+-TnC are consistent with that of flexible dumbbell and is similar to what has been found for the metal-free state of CAM (14Tjandra N. Kuboniwa H. Ren H. Bax A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, in the calcium-saturated state (with or without TnIp) and the 2·Ca2+TnIp state, the apparent domain motions are no longer detected, which is suggestive of a more rigid conformation. The sedimentation velocity data suggests that in the apo-, calcium-saturated- and calcium-saturated TnIp states, TnC is elongated with an axial ratio of 4–5. Calcium or magnesium binding to the high affinity C-terminal domain sites results in a contraction of the axial ratio to approximately 3, which is consistent with that found in the 2-calcium crystal structure of TnC (2Satyshur K.A. Rao S.T. Pyzalska D. Drendel W. Greaser M. Sundaralingam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1628-1647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has dimensions of 75 Å × 25 Å. However, in the presence of TnIp and calcium bound to the high affinity sites, TnC becomes approximately spherical. The initial structures used to obtain minimum perturbation maps were generated from the 2-calcium x-ray crystallographic coordinates of TnC (2Satyshur K.A. Rao S.T. Pyzalska D. Drendel W. Greaser M. Sundaralingam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1628-1647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bad contacts removed by 5 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The side chains of Trp-78 and Trp-154 were subsequently built from the topology and parameter internal coordinates. The following residues were allowed to be free during the simulations: 20, 24, 35, 40, 43, 44, 47, 71, 73, and 80 (F78W); 98, 101, 102, 105, 113, 149, 151, 155, 157, and 158 (F154W). All nonpolar hydrogens were treated as extended heavy atoms, and the dielectric constant was equal to the distance in angstroms between interacting atoms. The charge on ionized side chains was reduced by 80%, and nonbonded interactions were switched off over the range 7–11Å. Calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics, Inc. Indigo-2 computer using executable code derived from CHARMM (15Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) version 22 with topology and parameter files taken from CHARMM version 19. Minimum perturbation mappings were computed on a 5° grid of Trp-78 and Trp-154 χ1 × χ2 torsion space (13Haydock C. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 98: 8199-8214Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). During minimization, χ1 and χ2 were constrained with a harmonic constraint energy constant of 400 kcal mol-1 rad2. At each of the 72 × 72 grid points, the free atoms were minimized using 40 steps of the steepest descent method followed by 240 steps with the Powell (16Powell M.J.D. Math. Program. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1435) Google Scholar) method. SHAKE (17van Gunsteren W.F. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1980; 1: 266-274Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, and the system was minimized for an additional 40 steps by the Powell method. Grid points for which the final minimized energy exceeded 50 kcal mol−1 were considered outliers, and the map was interpolated at these points using bivariate interpolation (18Akima H. ACM Trans. Math Software. 1978; 4: 148-159Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of the TnC mutants has been described previously. 2M. C. Moncrieffe, S. Yu Venyaminov, T. E. Miller, G. Guzman, J. D. Potter, and F. G. Prendergast, submitted for publication. Metal-free protein samples were prepared by dialysis (twice) against a medium composed of 120 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA at pH 7.0. After dialysis, the volume was adjusted with dialysate to yield a protein concentration of 7–10 μm for fluorescence or 16 μm for ultracentrifugation. Protein concentrations were calculated using the previously determined molar absorptivity values of 6.6 mm−1 cm−1 for F78W and 5.5 mm−1 cm−1 for F154W.2Calcium-ligated states of the mutants were obtained by adding aliquoits of CaCl2 (Orion) so that the free calcium ion concentrations, determined as described in Robertson and Potter (19Robertson S.P. Potter J.D. Schwartz A. Methods in Pharmacology. 5. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 63-75Google Scholar), were pCa 6.8 and pCa 3.5, corresponding to the 2-calcium and 4-calcium states. Additionally, the magnesium-saturated state was obtained by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2. The high concentration of MOPS used ensured that the pH changes accompanying metal ion binding to TnC were negligible. The time-resolved anisotropy decay of the Trp fluorescence was measured using time-correlated single photon counting (20O'Connor D.V. Phillips D. Time-correlated Single Photon Counting. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar). Protein samples of approximately 7 μm concentration were excited at 300 nm using the frequency-doubled output of a cavity-dumped synchronously pumped Coherent 700 rhodamine 6G dye laser (Coherent), which was itself pumped by the frequency-doubled output of a Coherent Antares YAG laser. The emission was isolated using an interference filter (351 nm; 4 nm bandpass) and detected with a Hamamatsu R2809 microchannel plate photo-multiplier tube (Hamamatsu, Japan). The instrument response function (full width at half maximum) obtained by collecting scattered light from a suspension of nondairy creamer was 50 ps. Data channels (2048) were acquired using a Nucleus PCA-II data acquisition card (Oxford Instruments). Data acquisition was automated, and the parallel (I ∥) and perpendicular (I ⊥) components were obtained by alternately integrating the respective data sets for 30 s, to minimize the effects of laser instability, until the peak count in the parallel channel was approximately 2 × 104. The parallel and perpendicular components of the intensity decay are related to the anisotropy, r(t), and the total fluorescence intensity I(t) is related by I∥(t)=13I(t)[1+2r(t)](Eq. 1) I⊥(t)=13I(t)[1−2r(t)](Eq. 2) with I(t) being modeled by a multiexponential function (20O'Connor D.V. Phillips D. Time-correlated Single Photon Counting. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar). Molecules lacking spherical symmetry are usually modeled as prolate or oblate ellipsoids, and under such circumstances, the anisotropy is expected to decay as a sum of exponentials given by r(t)=r0∑i=15γiexp−t/φi(Eq. 3) where r 0 is the fundamental or zero-time anisotropy, and the pre-exponential factors, γi, and the rotational correlation times, φi, are functions of the rates of rotation about the molecular axes of the molecule and the orientation of the absorption and emission dipoles relative to these axes (21Belford G.G.

Data analysis of the time-resolved anisotropy decay was performed using the program ANISO, 4Z. Bajzer, I. Penzar, M. C. Moncrieffe, and F. G. Prendergast, manuscript in preparation. employing cubic discretization of the instrument response function. The parameters were estimated by the maximum-likelihood method (24Bajzer Z.B. Prendergast F.G. Methods in Enzymology. 210. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992: 200-237Google Scholar), which minimizes the Poisson deviance, D=2∑k=1n[ck∥ln(ck∥/Fk∥)−ck∥+Fk∥]+[ck⊥ln(ck⊥/Fk⊥)−ck⊥+Fk⊥](Eq. 4) Here c k ∥ andc k ⊥ denote the measured counts for the parallel and perpendicular polarized components, andF k ∥ andF k ⊥ are the corresponding theoretical expressions for the number of counts, that is, Fks=∫tk−1tkdt∫0tR(u+δ)Is(t−u)du+ζRk+b(Eq. 5) where s denotes the parallel (∥) or perpendicular (⊥) component, and the integrals are discretized as explained in Bajzer et al.

R is the instrument response function with Rk=∫tk−1tkR(t)dt(Eq. 6) δ is the zero-time shift, ξ is a light scattering correction, and b is the presumed constant background parameter. The criteria for “goodness of fit” included ftests applied to the Poisson deviances (that are distributed as χ2) for models having different numbers of rotational components and the required randomness of the residuals (26Catterall T. Duddell J. Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 173Google Scholar). The steady-state anisotropy, r ss, which is the average of r(t) weighted by the total intensityI(t) (27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), was calculated using the following. rss=∫0∞I(t)r(t)dt∫0∞I(t)dt(Eq. 7) The experimentally obtained rotational correlation times were compared with those expected for an idealized dumbbell using equations developed by Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield (28Garcia de la Torre J. Bloomfield V.D. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 1765-1778Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Garcia de la Torre J. Bloomfield V.D.

This procedure considers a dumbbell to be composed of two large spheres of diameter ς1 connected by smaller spheres of diameter ς2. The equation describing the rotational diffusion coefficient for rotation about an axis perpendicular to the main symmetry axis, Dr⊥, is 8πης13kBTDr⊥=0.2675exp∑i=1i=3∑j=1j=3cijLς1iς2ς1j(Eq. 8) where η is the viscosity at temperature T, andk B is the Boltzmann constant.

Biophys. 1981; 14: 81-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and are valid for L/ς1 < 10 and ς1/ς2 < 1. To calculate the anisotropy decay of the model dumbbell, the rotational diffusion coefficient for rotation about the main symmetry axis,D 1, given by D1=kBT4πη14ς13+Lς22(Eq. 9) is also required (31Small E.W. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The functional form for the decay of the fluorescence anisotropy in terms of the diffusion coefficients for rotation about D 1 and Dr⊥ for a system with three rotational correlation times is similar to Eq. 3 with φ1= (4D 1 + 2 Dr⊥)-1, φ2 = (D 1 + 5 Dr⊥)-1, and φ3 = (6 Dr⊥)-1 (31Small E.W.

Protein concentrations were approximately 7 μm, and the solution composition was 100 mmMOPS, 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. The expected rotational correlation times for the TnC mutants were calculated using hydrated volumes of 27,973 Å3 and 34,045 Å3, corresponding to a commonly used value for the degree of hydration for globular proteins of 0.2 g of H2O/g of protein (27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar) and the value of 0.4 g of H2O/g of protein suggested by Hubbard et al. (32Hubbard S.R. Hodgson K.D. Doniach S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4151-4158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all calculations, the value of ς2 was 3.5 Å. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed at 23.3 °C using short column (0.7 mm) cells (33Yphantis D.A. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1960; 88: 586-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and Rayleigh interference optics on a Beckman Model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a electronic speed control, RTIC temperature controller. and a pulsed laser diode light source (670 nm). Data were acquired at speeds of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000 revolutions/minute using a television camera-based online data acquisition and analysis system (34Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.M. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Identical experiments were also conducted in a Beckman XL-I ultracentrifuge at 20 °C. Sample concentrations were approximately 16, 8, and 5 μm, and data was collected at intervals after the estimated time to equilibrium and tested for equilibrium by subtracting successive scans (35Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Data within the optical window were selected and analyzed to estimate the molecular weight of the various species using the program NONLIN (36Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman XL-I instrument equipped with absorption or Rayleigh interference optics (37Laue T.M. Cohn G. Katzir A. Ultrasensitive Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics. 1895. Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers, Bellingham, WA1993Google Scholar), a 4-hole titanium rotor, 6-channel, 12-mm-thick charcoal-filled epon centerpieces, and appropriate windows. Experiments were conducted at 60,000 revolutions/minute at 20 °C. Data were acquired at 1-s intervals to produce sedimentation coefficient distributions according to the method described by Stafford (38Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Estimates of the shape of the TnC mutants were obtained by calculating Perrin shape factors and the corresponding axial ratio of an ellipsoid. The Perrin shape factor,F, is defined as F=s0/Sobs(Eq. 10) where s obs is the measured sedimentation coefficient, and s 0, that of an equivalent spherical molecule having a radiusR 0·s 0, is calculable from s0=M(1−ν̄ρ)6πηNAR0(Eq. 11) where M is the mass of the particle,ν, the calculated partial specific volume (0.72 g−1 cm3) based on the amino acid sequence, η is the solvent viscosity, N A is Avogadro's number,R 0 = [3M(1 + δ)ν/4πN A]1/3, ρ is the density and δ is the degree of hydration. The minimum perturbation approach is based on the assumption that the overall structure of a stable mutant differs from the wild-type protein only in the positions of the backbone and side chain atoms that are neighbors of the mutant side chain. Consequently, the method provides simple estimates of the possible conformation of the mutant side chain (12Shih H.H. Brady J. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Minimum perturbation maps for Trp-78 and Trp-154 are shown in Fig.1. The map for Trp-78 has two wells, and the trans-perpendicular (tp) well is about 11 kcal/mol more stable than the trans-antiperpendicular well. The Trp-154 map has one distinct well (tp). The maps predict that in both mutants, the trans-perpendicular tryptophan conformation predominates over other side chain conformations. Because the structure of neither mutant has been solved crystallographically, the possibility that other tryptophan conformations are significantly populated or even predominate cannot be absolutely excluded. We investigated the possibility that alternate packing of neighboring side chains might stabilize other tryptophan conformations by calculating minimum perturbation maps for each tryptophan mutant with the side chains neighboring truncated at the β-carbon position (maps not shown). The Trp-78 map with the indole ring-truncated neighbor side chains has the gauche-antiperpendicular well stabilizing to within 4 kcal/mol of the tp well and has both the tp and ga wells splitting into two sub-wells of similar stability. The Trp-154 map with truncated neighbor side chains also has a ga well that is about 4 kcal/mol less stable than the tp well. Although these results confirm that crystal structures of the TnC mutants are required in order to be certain about the predominant tryptophan side chain conformations, they imply that there may be multiple conformations of the Trp residue, and the interconversion between these conformations may perhaps influence the anisotropy decays of the Trp residue. We have used the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of the Trp moiety in the TnC mutants to obtain information about the rotational dynamics of TnC. Fig.2 shows typical time-resolved intensity decay data, which upon analysis, yielded the parameters given in TableI. The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of the Trp fluorescence from F154W was, except for the metal-free state, dominated by the “long” rotational component, φ1, which accounted for approximately 72–81% of the total anisotropy decay under the sample conditions listed in Table I. In the metal-free state of F154W at 20 °C, the recovered rotational correlation times are 3.1 ns and 0.57 ns, with the zero-time (r 0) and steady-state (r ss) anisotropy being 0.23 and 0.07, respectively. Metal ion binding to the high affinity sites in the C-terminal domain increases the recovered φ1 and r ss values relative to that obtained in the metal-free state, whereas the r 0value remains unaltered. However, the φ1 value is sensitive to the type of metal ion occupying the C-terminal domain sites. Thus, the recovered φ1 value for the 2·Ca2+ state of F154W was 4.1 ns, and that for the 2·Mg2+ state was 3.4 ns. This suggests that the structure of the 2·Ca2+ and 2·Mg2+ states of TnC are different and is consistent with the fluorescence emission spectral behavior of F154W under conditions where the high affinity sites are saturated by calcium or magnesium ions.2 TnIp binding to 2·Ca2+-F154W results in a recovered φ1 value of 8.1 ns and an r ss value of 0.12. In the calcium-saturated state of F154W, the recovered φ1 value is 11.7 ns, and the value of the short rotational component is almost an order of magnitude less than those obtained in the apo-, 2·Ca2+, 2·Mg2+, or 2·Ca2+-TnIp states. The recoveredr 0 value for the calcium-saturated state is 0.29, which is close to the value of 0.31 obtained by steady-state emission anisotropy measurements in 67% glycerol at −46 °C. 5M. C. Moncrieffe and F. G. Prendergast, unpublished data. Additionally, the value of the recovered steady-state anisotropy for the 4·Ca2+ state was approximately 44% higher than that for the metal-free state. In the presence of saturating concentrations of calcium and TnIp, the recovered parameters are almost identical to those of the calcium-saturated state. The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decays of F78W were dominated by φ1, which accounted for 72–86% of the total anisotropy decay. In the metal-free state, the recovered φ1 value of 7.04 ns for this mutant was approximately 2× greater than the corresponding value for F154W. This suggests that the motional components of TnC that are sensed by Trp-78 and Trp-154 are different. Magnesium binding to the high affinity sites results in a reduction of the φ1 value relative to that of the metal-free state. This implies that magnesium binding to sites III and IV alters the conformation of the C-terminal domain such that the motional component detected by Trp-78 is different than that of the apo state. When calcium replaces magnesium at the high affinity sites, the recovered φ1 value is the same at that obtained for the metal-free state. The r 0 andr ss values for the metal-free, magnesium-saturated, and 2·Ca2+-bound states are almost identical. TnIp binding to 2·Ca2+-F78W increases the recovered φ1 value by approximately 3 ns. Ther 0 and r ss values are similar to th"
