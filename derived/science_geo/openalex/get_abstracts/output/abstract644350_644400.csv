Cserép et al. identified a specialized morphofunctional communication site between microglial processes and neuronal cell bodies in the mouse and the human brain (see the Perspective by Nimmerjahn). These junctions are formed at specific areas of the neuronal somatic membranes and possess a distinctive nanoarchitecture and specialized molecular composition linked to mitochondrial signaling. The junctions appear to provide a major site for microglia-neuron communication and may help to mediate the neuroprotective effects of microglia after acute brain injury.

Under the application of a magnetic field, vortices with zero-bias peaks that are consistent with Majorana bound states have been observed. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, Zhu et al. studied the conductance of these states as the tip-sample distance was reduced (see the Perspective by Sau). The researchers found that the value of the conductance increased and eventually saturated. For one of the vortices they studied, the conductance reached a quantized value that is characteristic of the Majorana bound states. Science , this issue p. 189 ; see also p. 145"

Liao et al. electrospun polyacrylonitrile- co -methyl acrylate fibers modified with a small amount of poly(ethylene glycol) bisazide (PEG-BA) (see the Perspective by Fox). After collecting the electrospun yarn, it was annealed under tension that both aligned the small fibers and cross-linked them together via the PEG-BA.

The protein p27 has been thought to act as a CDK inhibitor. Guiley et al. performed a structural analysis of active complexes of CDK4 with cyclin D1 (CycD1) and p27 (see the Perspective by Sherr). The results showed that p27 actually remodels the active site of CDK4 to allow full activation when p27 is phosphorylated on tyrosine (phosp27). Furthermore, they found that the breast cancer drug palbociclib, a CDK4 inhibitor, doesn't actually interact with active phosp27-CDK4-CycD1 trimers. Instead, it appears that the drug, which shows promise in the clinic, binds to inactive CDK4 monomers and prevents interaction with p27. Science , this issue p. eaaw2106 ; see also p. 1315"

The development of the diamond anvil cell (DAC) enables tabletop experiments to investigate a diverse landscape of high-pressure phenomena ranging from the properties of planetary interiors to transitions between quantum mechanical phases. In this work, we introduce and utilize a novel nanoscale sensing platform, which integrates nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers directly into the culet (tip) of diamond anvils. We demonstrate the versatility of this platform by performing diffraction-limited imaging (~600 nm) of both stress fields and magnetism, up to pressures ~30 GPa and for temperatures ranging from 25-340 K. For the former, we quantify all six (normal and shear) stress components with accuracy $<0.01$ GPa, offering unique new capabilities for characterizing the strength and effective viscosity of solids and fluids under pressure. For the latter, we demonstrate vector magnetic field imaging with dipole accuracy $<10^{-11}$ emu, enabling us to measure the pressure-driven $\alpha\leftrightarrow\epsilon$ phase transition in iron as well as the complex pressure-temperature phase diagram of gadolinium. In addition to DC vector magnetometry, we highlight a complementary NV-sensing modality using T1 noise spectroscopy; crucially, this demonstrates our ability to characterize phase transitions even in the absence of static magnetic signatures. By integrating an atomic-scale sensor directly into DACs, our platform enables the in situ imaging of elastic, electric and magnetic phenomena at high pressures."

How whales were able to become so large has long been of interest. Goldbogen et al. used field-collected data on feeding and diving events across different types of whales to calculate rates of energy gain (see the Perspective by Williams). They found that increased body size facilitates increased prey capture. Furthermore, body-size increase in the marine environment appears to be limited only by prey availability.

https://openalex.org/W2994701067,"Clostridial metabolite production The clostridia are Firmicute bacterial commensals commonly found in the mammalian gut. Clostridia produce a range of metabolites that diffuse into the host's circulation and have been difficult to manipulate genetically, but Guo et al. successfully developed a CRISPR-Cas9 deletion system in Clostridium sporogenes (see the Perspective by Henke and Clardy). The authors used deletion mutants and mass spectrometry to elucidate clostridial synthesis of several different branched short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including isobutyrate, 2-methylbutyrate, and isovalerate. Germ-free mice colonized with mutants incapable of synthesizing SCFAs showed altered immunoglobulin A production. This finding potentially links bacterial SCFA production and host responses to the presence of the clostridia. Science , this issue p. eaav1282 ; see also p. 1309"

Typically, to achieve high-pressure conditions, researchers place their samples in diamond anvil cells (DACs). However, monitoring the properties of the sample inside a DAC is tricky (see the Perspective by Hamlin and Zhou). Hsieh et al. , Lesik et al. , and Yip et al. developed monitoring techniques based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The NV centers can act as sensors because their energy levels and the associated spectra are sensitive to strain and magnetic fields. This enabled optical readout of a spatially resolved signal.

https://openalex.org/W2993834819,"A balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) maintained within a narrow window is widely regarded to be crucial for cortical processing. In line with this idea, the E/I balance is reportedly comparable across neighboring neurons, behavioral states, and developmental stages and altered in many neurological disorders. Motivated by these ideas, we examined whether synaptic inhibition changes over the 24-h day to compensate for the well-documented sleep-dependent changes in synaptic excitation. We found that, in pyramidal cells of visual and prefrontal cortices and hippocampal CA1, synaptic inhibition also changes over the 24-h light/dark cycle but, surprisingly, in the opposite direction of synaptic excitation. Inhibition is upregulated in the visual cortex during the light phase in a sleep-dependent manner. In the visual cortex, these changes in the E/I balance occurred in feedback, but not feedforward, circuits. These observations open new and interesting questions on the function and regulation of the E/I balance."
https://openalex.org/W2993618241,"The intronic C9orf72 G4C2 expansion, the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD, produces sense- and antisense-expansion RNAs and six dipeptide repeat-associated, non-ATG (RAN) proteins, but their roles in disease are unclear. We generated high-affinity human antibodies targeting GA or GP RAN proteins. These antibodies cross the blood-brain barrier and co-localize with intracellular RAN aggregates in C9-ALS/FTD BAC mice. In cells, α-GA1 interacts with TRIM21, and α-GA1 treatment reduced GA levels, increased GA turnover, and decreased RAN toxicity and co-aggregation of proteasome and autophagy proteins to GA aggregates. In C9-BAC mice, α-GA1 reduced GA as well as GP and GR proteins, improved behavioral deficits, decreased neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and increased survival. Glycosylation of the Fc region of α-GA1 is important for cell entry and efficacy. These data demonstrate that RAN proteins drive C9-ALS/FTD in C9-BAC transgenic mice and establish a novel therapeutic approach for C9orf72 ALS/FTD and other RAN-protein diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2995435815,"An important feature of strong correlated electron systems is the tunability between interesting ground states such as unconventional superconductivity and exotic magnetism. Pressure is a clean, continuous and systematic tuning parameter. However, due to the restricted accessibility introduced by high-pressure devices, compatible magnetic field sensors with sufficient sensitivity are rare. This greatly limits the detections and detailed studies of pressure-induced phenomena. Here, we utilize nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful, spatially-resolved vector field sensor for material research under pressure at cryogenic temperatures. Using a single crystal of BaFe2(As0:59P0:41)2 as an example, we extract the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), the local magnetic field profile in the Meissner state and the critical fields (Hc1 and Hc2). The method developed in this work will become a unique tool for tuning, probing and understanding quantum many body systems."
https://openalex.org/W2994858491,"Background Mental health recovery narratives are stories of recovery from mental health problems. Narratives may impact in helpful and harmful ways on those who receive them. The objective of this paper is to develop a change model identifying the range of possible impacts and how they occur. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults with experience of mental health problems and recovery (n = 77). Participants were asked to share a mental health recovery narrative and to describe the impact of other people’s recovery narratives on their own recovery. A change model was generated through iterative thematic analysis of transcripts. Results Change is initiated when a recipient develops a connection to a narrator or to the events descripted in their narrative. Change is mediated by the recipient recognising experiences shared with the narrator, noticing the achievements or difficulties of the narrator, learning how recovery happens, or experiencing emotional release. Helpful outcomes of receiving recovery narratives are connectedness, validation, hope, empowerment, appreciation, reference shift and stigma reduction. Harmful outcomes are a sense of inadequacy, disconnection, pessimism and burden. Impact is positively moderated by the perceived authenticity of the narrative, and can be reduced if the recipient is experiencing a crisis. Conclusions Interventions that incorporate the use of recovery narratives, such as peer support, anti-stigma campaigns and bibliotherapy, can use the change model to maximise benefit and minimise harms from narratives. Interventions should incorporate a diverse range of narratives available through different mediums to enable a range of recipients to connect with and benefit from this material. Service providers using recovery narratives should preserve authenticity so as to maximise impact, for example by avoiding excessive editing."
https://openalex.org/W3012774426,"Studying the biology of sleep requires the accurate assessment of the state of experimental subjects, and manual analysis of relevant data is a major bottleneck. Recently, deep learning applied to electroencephalogram and electromyogram data has shown great promise as a sleep scoring method, approaching the limits of inter-rater reliability. As with any machine learning algorithm, the inputs to a sleep scoring classifier are typically standardized in order to remove distributional shift caused by variability in the signal collection process. However, in scientific data, experimental manipulations introduce variability that should not be removed. For example, in sleep scoring, the fraction of time spent in each arousal state can vary between control and experimental subjects. We introduce a standardization method, mixture z-scoring, that preserves this crucial form of distributional shift. Using both a simulated experiment and mouse in vivo data, we demonstrate that a common standardization method used by state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithms introduces systematic bias, but that mixture z-scoring does not. We present a free, open-source user interface that uses a compact neural network and mixture z-scoring to allow for rapid sleep scoring with accuracy that compares well to contemporary methods. This work provides a set of computational tools for the robust automation of sleep scoring."

https://openalex.org/W2995874430,"Gastrointestinal microbiota has significant impact on the nutrition and health of monogastric herbivores animals including donkey. However, so far the microbiota in different gastrointestinal compartments of healthy donkey has not been described. Therefore, we investigated the abundance and function of microbiota at different sites of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (foregut: stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum; hindgut: cecum, ventral colon, dorsal colon, and rectum) of healthy adult donkeys mainly based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis. Collectively, our results showed that donkey has a rich, diverse and multi-functional microbiota along the GIT. In general, the richness and diversity of the microbiota are much higher in the hindgut relative to that in the foregut; at phylum level, the Firmicutes is dominant in the foregut while both Firmicutes and Bacteroides are abundant in the hindgut; at the genus level, Lactobacillus was dominant in the foregut while Streptococcus was more dominant in the hindgut. Our further PICRUSt analysis showed that varying microbiota along the GIT is functionally compatible with the corresponding physiological function of different GIT sites. For example, the microbes in the foregut are more active at carbohydrate metabolism, and in the hindgut are more active at amino acid metabolism. This work at the first time characterized the donkey digestive system from the aspects of microbial composition and function, provided an important basic data about donkey healthy gastrointestinal microbiota, which may be utilized to evaluate donkey health and also offer clues to further investigate donkey digestive system, nutrition, even to develop the microbial supplements."
https://openalex.org/W2996299007,"Black pepper is one of the most valued and widely used spices in the world and dominates multi-billion dollar global spices trade. India is amongst the major producers, consumers and exporters of black pepper. In spite of its commercial and cultural importance, black pepper has received meagre attention in terms of generation of genomic resources. Availability of markers distributed throughout the genome would facilitate and accelerate genetic studies, QTL identification, genetic enhancement and crop improvement in black pepper. In this perspective, the sequence information from the recently sequenced black pepper (Piper nigrum) genome has been used for identification and characterisation of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs). Total 69,126 SSRs were identified from assembled genomic sequence of P. nigrum. The SSR frequency was 158 per MB making it, one SSR for every 6.3 kb in the assembled genome. Among the different types of microsatellite repeat motifs, dinucleotides were the most abundant (48.6%), followed by trinucleotide (23.7%) and compound repeats (20.62%). A set of 85 SSRs were used for validation, of which 74 produced amplification products of expected size. Genetic diversity of 30 black pepper accessions using 50 SSRs revealed four distinct clusters. Further, the cross species transferability of the SSRs was checked in nine other Piper species. Out of 50 SSRs used, 19 and 31 SSRs were amplified in nine and seven species, respectively. Thus the identified SSRs may have application in other species of the genus Piper where genome sequence is not available yet. Present study reports the first NGS based genomic SSRs in black pepper and thus constitute a valuable resource for a whole fleet of applications in genetics and plant breeding studies such as genetic map construction, QTL identification, map-based gene cloning, marker-assisted selection and evolutionary studies in Piper nigrum and related species."
https://openalex.org/W2995887830,"Objectives To explore availability, prices and affordability of essential medicines for diabetes and hypertension treatment in private pharmacies in three provinces of Zambia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 99 pharmacies across three Zambian provinces. Methods were based on a standardized methodology by the World Health Organization and Health Action International. Availability was analysed as mean availability per pharmacy and individual medicine. Median prices were compared to international reference prices and differences in price between medicine forms (original brand or generic product) were computed. Affordability was assessed as number of days’ salaries required to purchase a standard treatment course using the absolute poverty line and mean per capita provincial household income as standard. An analysis identifying medicines considered both available and affordable was conducted. Results Two antidiabetics and nine antihypertensives had high-level availability (≥80%) in all provinces; availability levels for the remaining surveyed antidiabetics and antihypertensives were largely found below 50%. Availability further varied markedly across medicines and medicine forms. Prices for most medicines were higher than international reference prices and great price variations were found between pharmacies, medicines and medicine forms. Compared to original brand products, purchase of generics was associated with price savings for patients between 21.54% and 96.47%. No medicine was affordable against the absolute poverty line and only between four and eleven using mean per capita provincial incomes. Seven generics in Copperbelt/Lusaka and two in Central province were highly available and affordable. Conclusions The study showed that the majority of surveyed antidiabetic and antihypertensive medicines was inadequately available (<80%). In addition, most prices were higher than their international reference prices and that treatment with these medicines was largely unaffordable against the set affordability thresholds. Underlying reasons for the findings should be explored as a basis for targeted policy initiatives."

The structure and dynamics of the thermosphere is driven by a global circulation that redistributes the incident energy from the Sun. We report mapping of the global circulation in the thermosphere of Mars with the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. The measured neutral winds reveal circulation patterns simpler than those of Earth that persist over changing seasons. The winds exhibit pronounced correlation with the underlying topography owing to orographic gravity waves.

Although a particular interaction is often defined by two specific domains binding to each other, this interaction often occurs in the context of other domains in multidomain proteins. How such adjacent domains form supertertiary structures and modulate protein–protein interactions has only recently been addressed and is incompletely understood. The postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 contains a three-domain supramodule, denoted PSG, which consists of PDZ, Src homology 3 (SH3), and guanylate kinase-like domains. The PDZ domain binds to the C terminus of its proposed natural ligand, CXXC repeat–containing interactor of PDZ3 domain (CRIPT), and results from previous experiments using only the isolated PDZ domain are consistent with the simplest scenario for a protein–protein interaction; namely, a two-state mechanism. Here we analyzed the binding kinetics of the PSG supramodule with CRIPT. We show that PSG binds CRIPT via a more complex mechanism involving two conformational states interconverting on the second timescale. Both conformational states bound a CRIPT peptide with similar affinities but with different rates, and the distribution of the two conformational states was slightly shifted upon CRIPT binding. Our results are consistent with recent structural findings of conformational changes in PSD-95 and demonstrate how conformational transitions in supertertiary structures can shape the ligand-binding energy landscape and modulate protein–protein interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2995186988,"Mammalian and bird ribosomes are nearly twice the mass of prokaryotic ribosomes in part because of their extraordinarily long rRNA tentacles. Human rRNA tentacles are not fully observable in current three-dimensional structures and their conformations remain to be fully resolved. In previous work we identified sequences that favor G-quadruplexes in silico and in vitro in rRNA tentacles of the human large ribosomal subunit. We demonstrated by experiment that these sequences form G-quadruplexes in vitro. Here, using a more recent motif definition, we report additional G-quadruplex sequences on surfaces of both subunits of the human ribosome. The revised sequence definition reveals expansive arrays of potential G-quadruplex sequences on LSU tentacles. In addition, we demonstrate by a variety of experimental methods that fragments of the small subunit rRNA form G-quadruplexes in vitro. Prior to this report rRNA sequences that form G-quadruplexes were confined to the large ribosomal subunit. Our combined results indicate that the surface of the assembled human ribosome contains numerous sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes on both ribosomal subunits. The data suggest conversion between duplexes and G-quadruplexes in response to association with proteins, ions, or other RNAs. In some systems it seems likely that the integrated population of RNA G-quadruplexes may be dominated by rRNA, which is the most abundant cellular RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2995635168,"Stressful environments accelerate the formation of isoaspartyl (isoAsp) residues in proteins, which detrimentally affect protein structure and function. The enzyme PROTEIN l -ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE (PIMT) repairs other proteins by reverting deleterious isoAsp residues to functional aspartyl residues. PIMT function previously has been elucidated in seeds, but its role in plant survival under stress conditions remains undefined. Herein, we used molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches, including protein overexpression and knockdown experiments, in Arabidopsis to investigate the role of PIMTs in plant growth and survival during heat and oxidative stresses. We demonstrate that these stresses increase isoAsp accumulation in plant proteins, that PIMT activity is essential for restricting isoAsp accumulation, and that both PIMT1 and PIMT2 play an important role in this restriction and Arabidopsis growth and survival. Moreover, we show that PIMT improves stress tolerance by facilitating efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by protecting the functionality of antioxidant enzymes from isoAsp-mediated damage during stress. Specifically, biochemical and MS/MS analyses revealed that antioxidant enzymes acquire deleterious isoAsp residues during stress, which adversely affect their catalytic activities, and that PIMT repairs the isoAsp residues and thereby restores antioxidant enzyme function. Collectively, our results suggest that the PIMT-mediated protein repair system is an integral part of the stress-tolerance mechanism in plants, in which PIMTs protect antioxidant enzymes that maintain proper ROS homeostasis against isoAsp-mediated damage in stressful environments."
https://openalex.org/W2995638771,"Facial expressions are deeply tied to empathy, which plays an important role during social communication. The eye region is effective at conveying facial expressions, especially fear and sadness emotions. Further, it was proved that subliminal stimuli could impact human behavior. This research aimed to explore the effect of subliminal sad, fearful and neutral emotions conveyed by the eye region on a viewer's empathy for pain using event-related potentials (ERP). The experiment used an emotional priming paradigm of 3 (prime: subliminal neutral, sad, fear eye region information) × 2 (target: painful, nonpainful pictures) within-subject design. Participants were told to judge whether the targets were in pain or not. Results showed that the subliminal sad eye stimulus elicited a larger P2 amplitude than the subliminal fearful eye stimulus when assessing pain. For P3 and late positive component (LPC), the amplitude elicited by the painful pictures was larger than the amplitude elicited by the nonpainful pictures. The behavioral results demonstrated that people reacted to targets depicting pain more slowly after the sad emotion priming. Moreover, the subjective ratings of Personal Distress (PD) (one of the dimensions in Chinese version of Interpersonal Reactivity Index scale) predicted the pain effect in empathic neural responses in the N1 and N2 time window. The current study showed that subliminal eye emotion affected the viewer's empathy for pain. Compared with the subliminal fearful eye stimulus, the subliminal sad eye stimulus had a greater impact on empathy for pain. The perceptual level of pain was deeper in the late controlled processing stage."
https://openalex.org/W2996010285,"Introduction Innovations in head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment are often subject to economic evaluation prior to their reimbursement and subsequent access for patients. Mapping functions facilitate economic evaluation of new treatments when the required utility data is absent, but quality of life data is available. The objective of this study is to develop a mapping function translating the EORTC QLQ-C30 to EQ-5D-derived utilities for HNC through regression modeling, and to explore the added value of disease-specific EORTC QLQ-H&N35 scales to the model. Methods Data was obtained on patients with primary HNC treated with curative intent derived from two hospitals. Model development was conducted in two phases: 1. Predictor selection based on theory- and data-driven methods, resulting in three sets of potential predictors from the quality of life questionnaires; 2. Selection of the best out of four methods: ordinary-least squares, mixed-effects linear, Cox and beta regression, using the first set of predictors from EORTC QLQ-C30 scales with most correspondence to EQ-5D dimensions. Using a stepwise approach, we assessed added values of predictors in the other two sets. Model fit was assessed using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and BIC) and model performance was evaluated by MAE, RMSE and limits of agreement (LOA). Results The beta regression model showed best model fit, with global health status, physical-, role- and emotional functioning and pain scales as predictors. Adding HNC-specific scales did not improve the model. Model performance was reasonable; R2 = 0.39, MAE = 0.0949, RMSE = 0.1209, 95% LOA of -0.243 to 0.231 (bias -0.01), with an error correlation of 0.32. The estimated shrinkage factor was 0.90. Conclusions Selected scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30 can be used to estimate utilities for HNC using beta regression. Including EORTC QLQ-H&N35 scales does not improve the mapping function. The mapping model may serve as a tool to enable cost-effectiveness analyses of innovative HNC treatments, for example for reimbursement issues. Further research should assess the robustness and generalizability of the function by validating the model in an external cohort of HNC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3005096566,"Insomnia is one of the most common minor ailments to which patients seek advice in a community pharmacy setting. Due to the availability of a wide variety of over-the-counter (OTC) products, community pharmacists are in the front line to safe-guard patients looking for self-medication or advice for treatment of insomnia. The purpose of this study was to assess the content of community pharmacists' interactions with patients seeking advice for insomnia in Jordan. A cross-sectional study using a simulated patient methodology was conducted across a stratified convenience sample of community pharmacies in three major cities in Jordan. The visits were evaluated using pre-defined criteria adapted from published literature relating to content and counseling skills. Visits were audio-recorded using a hidden microphone and the simulated patient completed a data collection form immediately after each visit. A total of 67 community pharmacies (response rate = 93.0%) agreed to participate and were all visited once by the simulated patient. The median duration of the visit was 2 minutes (range: 0.2-4 minutes). The majority (86.6%) of visits resulted in the sale of a drug, most commonly a combination product (paracetamol and diphenhydramine) for 30 recommendations (44.8%). This was followed by a natural plant extract combination product, namely valerian and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) for 23 (34.3%). Pharmacists often did not question medical history or other symptoms prior to product sale. Frequently, the recommended dose (49.3%) and administration time (38.8%) were the only information provided to the patient. No information was provided in relation to potential drug interactions or contraindications. No advice was offered on lifestyle or good sleeping hygiene. This study provided evidence that community pharmacists in Jordan in general did not offer adequate counseling for patients seeking advice for insomnia. Exploration of the reasons and factors contributing to this practice and highlighting professional opportunity and responsibility is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2995002624,"Phosphoinositides play crucial roles in intracellular membrane dynamics and cell signaling, with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphates being the predominant phosphoinositide lipids at endosomes and lysosomes, whereas PI 4-phosphates, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ), are enriched at the cell surface including sites of endocytosis. How PI 4-phosphates and PI 3-phosphates are dynamically interconverted within the endocytic pathway and how this is controlled in space and time remains poorly understood. Here, combining live imaging, genome engineering, and acute chemical and genetic manipulations, we found that local synthesis of PI(3,4)P 2 by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2α at plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits is spatially segregated from its hydrolysis by the PI(3,4)P 2 -specific inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase 4A (INPP4A). We observed that INPP4A is dispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is undetectable in endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Instead, we found that INPP4A partially localizes to endosomes and that loss of INPP4A in HAP1 cancer cells perturbs signaling via AKT kinase and mTOR complex 1. These results reveal a function for INPP4-mediated PI(3,4)P 2 hydrolysis in local regulation of growth factor and nutrient signals at endosomes in cancer cells. They further suggest a model whereby synthesis and turnover of PI(3,4)P 2 are spatially segregated within the endocytic pathway to couple endocytic membrane traffic to growth factor and nutrient signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2996410797,"Background Access to adequate treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) has been a high priority among American policymakers. Elucidation of the sociodemographic and institutional differences associated with the use, or lack thereof, of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) provides greater clarity on who receives OAT. Timely access to care is a further consideration and bears scrutiny as well. Methods We draw upon data from the Treatment Episode Data Set—Admissions (TEDS-A) to analyse the relationship between sociodemographic and institutional characteristics and the receipt of opioid agonist treatments and time waiting to enter treatment. Results Estimates from logistic regression models highlight certain groups which show lower odds of receipt of OAT, including those in precarious housing arrangements, those unemployed or not otherwise in the labor force, and those referred by drug abuse care providers, educational institutions, employers, and the criminal justice system. Groups which showed higher odds of waiting over a week to enter treatment included those who were separated, divorced, or widowed, those working part-time, and those referred by drug abuse care providers, employers, and the criminal justice system. Conclusion Given the efficacy of OAT and the adverse outcomes associated with long waiting times, coordinated effort is needed to understand why these differences persist and how they may be addressed through appropriate policy responses."
https://openalex.org/W3013374506,"Sub-Saharan Africa lags in adoption of mobile health (m-health) applications and in leveraging m-health for sustainable development goals. There is a need for a comprehensive investigation of determinants of hospitals' adoption of m-health in Sub-Saharan Africa to inform policies, practices and investments.This investigation used a logit regression model to analyze the determinants of m-health adoption in Kenyan hospitals applying the Technological, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory. A representative sample of 211 executives of Level 4-6 hospitals in 24 counties provided primary data on Patient-Centered (PC) and Facility-Centered (FC) m-health applications.Both PC and FC m-health adoption were predicted by competition for patients (PC p = 0.041, FC p = 0.021), IT human resource capacity (PC p = 0.048, FC p = 0.037), and hospital pursuit of market growth through technological leadership (PC p = 0.010, FC p = 0.020). Further determinants of PC m-health adoption included hospital access to slack financial resources (p = 0.006), acquisition strategy (p = 0.011), compatibility with the hospital systems (p = 0.015), trialability (p = 0.019), medical insurance company support (p = 0.025),patient pressure (p = 0.036), and perceived effect of global medical tourism (p = 0.039). FC m-health adoption was predicted by hospital size (p = 0.008), ICT infrastructure capacity (p = 0.041), and government support (p = 0.013).A differentiated approach is required to scale up m-health adoption. PC m-health requires emphasis on establishing national and regional compatibility and interoperability, developing trialability processes and validation mechanisms, incentivizing patient competition and mobility, establishing innovative and cost-effective acquisition strategies, and ensuring integration of digital services within national insurance schemes and policies. These policies require support from patients and communities to drive demand and spur investment in adequate IT human resources to maintain reliability. Pilot PC m-health projects should prioritize hospitals with slack financial resources, while FC m-health should target large facility size. FC m-health applications are more complex and costly than PC, requiring government incentives to trigger hospital investments and national investment in ICT infrastructure. Investors and hospital managers should integrate m-health into market growth strategies for sustainable m-health scale-up in Kenya and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2995737397,"Bi-allelic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers are widely used in population genetic studies. In most studies, sequences either side of the SNPs remain unused, although these sequences contain information beyond that used in population genetic studies. In this study, we show how these sequence tags either side of a single nucleotide polymorphism can be used for comparative genome analysis. We used DArTseq (Diversity Array Technology) derived SNP data for a non-model Australian native freshwater fish, Macquaria ambigua, to identify genes linked to SNP associated sequence tags, and to discover homologies with evolutionarily conserved genes and genomic regions. We concatenated 6,776 SNP sequence tags to create a hypothetical genome (representing 0.1–0.3% of the actual genome), which we used to find sequence homologies with 12 model fish species using the Ensembl genome browser with stringent filtering parameters. We identified sequence homologies for 17 evolutionarily conserved genes (cd9b, plk2b, rhot1b, sh3pxd2aa, si:ch211-148f13.1, si:dkey-166d12.2, zgc:66447, atp8a2, clvs2, lyst, mkln1, mnd1, piga, pik3ca, plagl2, rnf6, sec63) along with an ancestral evolutionarily conserved syntenic block (euteleostomi Block_210). Our analysis also revealed repetitive sequences covering approximately 12% of the hypothetical genome where DNA transposon, LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons were most abundant. A hierarchical pattern of the number of sequence homologies with phylogenetically close species validated the approach for repeatability. This new approach of using SNP associated sequence tags for comparative genome analysis may provide insight into the genome evolution of non-model species where whole genome sequences are unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W2995397468,"Background Arboviruses and protozoans can cause neurologic disorders in horses. In Brazilian Amazon, several horses presenting signs compatible with disorders caused by these infectious agents have been observed. Objective To contribute to the knowledge of this epidemiological picture, we sought to construct a serological diagnostic panel for neurotrophic infectious agents in local horses. Material and methods A total of 213 blood samples from horses were collected from 29 farms in three municipalities. Samples were evaluated and considered positive when they met the following criteria: titers ≥ 1:80 with the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for apicomplexan protozoans; positive recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with subsequent titers ≥ 1:10 by the PRNt for viruses; and detection under direct microscopic examination for Trypanosoma evansi. Results No horses were found to be infected by T. evansi, and only two were infected Toxoplasma gondii and/or Neospora spp. The highest protozoan infection rate was observed for Sarcocystis neurona (40.3%; n = 86/213). Among the positive ELISA samples tested by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90), 92% (n = 76/83) were positive for St Louis Encephalitis virus, 43% (n = 6/14) were positive for West Nile virus and 33% (n = 16/48) were positive for Mayaro virus. Eighteen percent (n = 39/213) of horses were co-infected by S. neurona and at least one arbovirus, particularly SLEV and/or MAYV. Conclusion Samples positive for SLEV associated with S. neurona, including samples from horses that had recovered from neurological signs were frequent, and must be considered when investigating the possible causes of neurological diseases in South Roraima horses."
https://openalex.org/W2996916961,"Patients on hemodialysis must undergo this procedure at a hospital three times weekly and might be unable to visit a dentist. In addition, dentists might hesitate to provide oral care because such patients tend to bleed because they are medicated with anticoagulants, are susceptible to bacterial infections, and might have unusual drug reactions. We postulated that patients on hemodialysis have worse oral status than healthy people, which in turn might predispose such patients to systemic complications.We compared the status of dental caries and periodontal diseases among 80 patients on hemodialysis and 76 healthy individuals (controls) using the decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index, total number of C4 teeth (destruction of the entire tooth crown), and periodontal pocket depth. Clinical data were analyzed after all patients on hemodialysis and controls provided written, informed consent to participate in the study.Total number of C4 teeth (p = 0.021), missing teeth (MT) index (p = 0.0302), and DMFT index score ≥ 24 (p = 0.017) were significantly higher in patients on hemodialysis than controls. Pulse pressure (p = 0.0042) and the prevalence of a history of heart disease such as angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction (p = 0.029) were higher in patients on hemodialysis with higher (≥ 24) than lower (< 24) DMFT index scores. Periodontal pocket depth was not significantly different between these two groups.Worse status of dental caries is possibly associated with arteriosclerosis among patients on hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2996984981,"Introduction Under the hypothesis that early natural killer cell infusion (NKI) following haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) will reduce relapse in the early post-transplant period, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of NKI following haplo-SCT in children with recurrent neuroblastoma who failed previous tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT. Methods We used the high-dose 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine and cyclophosphamide/fludarabine/anti-thymocyte globulin regimen for conditioning and infused 3 × 107/kg of ex-vivo expanded NK cells derived from a haploidentical parent donor on days 2, 9, and 16 post-transplant. Interleukin-2 was administered (1 × 106 IU/m2/day) subcutaneously to activate infused donor NK cells on days 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, and 20 post-transplant. Results Seven children received a total of 19 NKIs, and NKI-related acute toxicities were fever (n = 4) followed by chills (n = 3) and hypertension (n = 3); all toxicities were tolerable. Grade ≥II acute GVHD and chronic GVHD developed in two and five patients, respectively. Higher amount of NK cell population was detected in peripheral blood until 60 days post-transplant than that in the reference cohort. Cytomegalovirus and BK virus reactivation occurred in all patients and Epstein-Barr virus in six patients. Six patients died of relapse/progression (n = 5) or treatment-related mortality (n = 1), and one patient remained alive. Conclusion NKI following haplo-SCT was relatively safe and feasible in patients with recurrent neuroblastoma. Further studies to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effect without increasing GVHD are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2997724402,"Objectives Consistent condom use is essential to reducing heterosexual transmission of HIV. African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV in the United States despite comprising a small percentage of the population. Our objectives were to evaluate factors associated with self-reported condom use in a cohort of predominantly African American women receiving HIV care in Atlanta, Georgia. Methods A cross-sectional study of reproductive knowledge, attitudes, and practices among adult, sexually-active, HIV-positive women attending the Grady Infectious Disease Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia was conducted from July, 2013 to November, 2014 to evaluate factors associated with self-reported condom use. Primary outcomes included: condom use at last vaginal intercourse and consistent condom use with vaginal intercourse over the last six months. Descriptive, bivariable, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Of 187 women enrolled, 170 reported having vaginal intercourse in the last six months. Seventy-four percent used condoms at last vaginal intercourse, whereas 53% reported consistent condom use over the last six months. In adjusted analyses, factors associated with condom use at last intercourse included decreased frequency of sex, no history of drug use, and confidence to discuss condom use with sexual partners (p<0.05). Factors associated with consistent condom use in the past six months were older age, being single/dating, and confidence to discuss condom use with sexual partners. History of drug use, having HIV-positive partners, and unprotected anal intercourse were associated with inconsistent use (p<0.05). Conclusions Improved strategies are needed to educate women on the importance of safe sexual practices and condom negotiation. Healthcare providers should strive to have an open dialogue with patients about condom use, whether they engage in anal sex, and its risks."
https://openalex.org/W2996662788,"The use of remote sensing to rapidly and accurately obtain information on the spatiotemporal distribution of large-scale wheat and maize acreage is of great significance for improving the level of food production management and ensuring food security. We constructed a MODIS-NDVI time series dataset, combined linear interpolation and the Harmonic Analysis of Time Series algorithm to smooth the time series data curve, and classified the data with random forest algorithms. The results show that winter wheat–summer maize planting areas were mainly distributed in the western plains, southern region, and north-eastern part of the middle mountainous regions while the eastern hilly regions were less distributed and scattered. The winter wheat–summer maize planting areas in the study area continued to grow from 2004–2016, with the most significant growth in the northern part of the western plains and Yellow River Delta. The spatial planting probability reflected the planting core area and showed an intensive planting pattern. During the study period, the peak value and time for the NDVI of the winter wheat were significantly different and showed an increasing trend, while these parameters for the summer maize were relatively stable with little change. Therefore, we mapped a spatial distribution of the winter wheat and summer maize, using the time series data pre-processing synthesis and phenology curve random forest classification methods. Through precision analysis, we obtained satisfactory results, which provided a straightforward and efficient method to monitor the winter wheat and summer maize."
https://openalex.org/W2995641082,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and is characterized by steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying NASH development remain obscure. The nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner ( Shp ) plays a complex role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Here, we sought to determine SHP's role in regulating steatosis and inflammation in NASH. Shp deletion in murine hepatocytes ( Shp Hep −/− ) resulted in massive infiltration of macrophages and CD4 + T cells in the liver. Shp Hep −/− mice developed reduced steatosis, but surprisingly increased hepatic inflammation and fibrosis after being fed a high-fat, -cholesterol, and -fructose (HFCF) diet. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that pathways involved in inflammation and fibrosis are significantly activated in the liver of Shp Hep −/− mice fed a chow diet. After having been fed the HFCF diet, WT mice displayed up-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( Pparg ) signaling in the liver; however, this response was completely abolished in the Shp Hep −/− mice. In contrast, livers of Shp Hep −/− mice had consistent NF-κB activation. To further characterize the role of Shp specifically in the transition of steatosis to NASH, mice were fed the HFCF diet for 4 weeks, followed by Shp deletion. Surprisingly, Shp deletion after steatosis development exacerbated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis without affecting liver steatosis. Together, our results indicate that, depending on NASH stage, hepatic Shp plays an opposing role in steatosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, Shp deletion in hepatocytes activated NF-κB and impaired Pparg activation, leading to the dissociation of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH development."
https://openalex.org/W3003271374,"Introduction Association between parent’s Body Mass Index (BMI) and their children, has been widely documented. Individual, familiar and structural factors play a role in this relation. We analyzed the association between maternal BMI change during the first year post-partum and their offspring’s growth-trajectories and energy intake in their first five years of life. Objective Compare growth-trajectories and children’s caloric intake according to post-partum mother´s BMI classification. Methods The anthropometric assessment was taken in 935 mother-child pairs along the study period. Mothers were classified into four groups according to their BMI-trajectories in the post-partum. Children’s weight for height z-scores (WHZ) was compared among groups using random-effects regression models. A longitudinal comparison of children’s caloric intake by the maternal group was carried out. Results At 42 months of age, infants from mothers that remained overweight during the first year post-partum had, on average, 0.61 SD higher WHZ than those from mothers who remained in a recommended BMI group (R-BMI) in the same period. At 60 months of age, children´s prevalence of obesity was almost twice in the maternal overweight group vs R-BMI group (14.2% and 7.3% respectively). Chances for a child of having an over caloric intake were 36.5% (95% IC: 6.6%, 74.8%) and significantly higher among children from overweight mothers than those from R-BMI mothers. The difference in children’s WHZ trajectory remained significant after adjusting for caloric intake, suggesting that contextual factors play a role in shaping children’s obesity. A concurrent ethnographic study with the study subjects provides suggestions as to what these factors might be, including changes in the food landscape. Conclusion Children from overweight mothers tended to have a more caloric diet yielding a higher propensity to obesity. Contextual factors such as food landscape might contribute to childhood obesity beyond having an overweight mother. Pregnancy and post-partum is a window of opportunity for interventions to decrease the incidence of children’s overweight."
https://openalex.org/W2996099414,"Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, requiring ongoing development of targeted therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies. Carbohydrates on embryonic cells are often highly expressed in cancer and are therefore attractive targets for antibodies. Stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4) is one such glycolipid target expressed in many cancers, including breast and ovarian carcinomas. Here, we defined the structural basis for recognition of SSEA-4 by a novel monospecific chimeric antibody (ch28/11). Five X-ray structures of ch28/11 Fab complexes with the SSEA-4 glycan headgroup, determined at 1.5–2.7 Å resolutions, displayed highly similar three-dimensional structures indicating a stable binding mode. The structures also revealed that by adopting a horseshoe-shaped conformation in a deep groove, the glycan headgroup likely sits flat against the membrane to allow the antibody to interact with SSEA-4 on cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the terminal sialic acid of SSEA-4 plays a dominant role in dictating the exquisite specificity of the ch28/11 antibody. This observation was further supported by molecular dynamics simulations of the ch28/11-glycan complex, which show that SSEA-4 is stabilized by its terminal sialic acid, unlike SSEA-3, which lacks this sialic acid modification. These high-resolution views of how a glycolipid interacts with an antibody may help to advance a new class of cancer-targeting immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2996802669,"Previous research shows conflicting findings for the effect of font readability on comprehension and memory for language. It has been found that—perhaps counterintuitively–a hard to read font can be beneficial for language comprehension, especially for difficult language. Here we test how font readability influences the subjective experience of poetry reading. In three experiments we tested the influence of poem difficulty and font readability on the subjective experience of poems. We specifically predicted that font readability would have opposite effects on the subjective experience of easy versus difficult poems. Participants read poems which could be more or less difficult in terms of conceptual or structural aspects, and which were presented in a font that was either easy or more difficult to read. Participants read existing poems and subsequently rated their subjective experience (measured through four dependent variables: overall liking, perceived flow of the poem, perceived topic clarity, and perceived structure). In line with previous literature we observed a Poem Difficulty x Font Readability interaction effect for subjective measures of poetry reading. We found that participants rated easy poems as nicer when presented in an easy to read font, as compared to when presented in a hard to read font. Despite the presence of the interaction effect, we did not observe the predicted opposite effect for more difficult poems. We conclude that font readability can influence reading of easy and more difficult poems differentially, with strongest effects for easy poems."
https://openalex.org/W2995038325,"In urban areas green roofs provide important environmental advantages in regard to biodiversity, storm water runoff, pollution mitigation and the reduction of the urban heat island effect. There is a paucity of literature comparing different types of green roof substrates and their contributions to ecosystem services or their negative effects. This study investigated if there was a difference between sedum and wildflower green roof substrate properties (soil organic matter (SOM), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and pH values) of 12 green roofs in the city of Brighton & Hove. One hundred substrate samples were collected (50 from sedum roof substrates and 50 from wildflower roof substrates) and substrate properties were investigated using standard protocols. Comparisons were made between substrate characteristics on both types of roof substrate with a series of multiple linear regressions. Sedum roofs displayed significantly higher values of SOM, P and pH. There were significant positive relationships between SOM and K concentrations, SOM and P concentrations, pH and K concentrations and pH and P concentrations on sedum roofs. This study concluded that sedum roof substrates are more favourable for plant water use efficiency and also contained a significantly higher percentage of SOM than wildflower roofs. However, higher concentrations of P in sedum roof substrates may have implications in regard to leachates."
https://openalex.org/W2994913060,"Background The effect of statins over time on coronary atherosclerosis in patients with inflammatory joint diseases (IJD) is unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the change in coronary plaque morphology and volume in long-term statin-treated patients with IJD. Methods Sixty-eight patients with IJD and carotid artery plaque(s) underwent coronary computed tomography angiography before and after a mean of 4.7 (range 4.0–6.0) years of statin treatment. The treatment target for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) was ≤1.8 mmol/L. Changes in plaque volume (calcified, mixed/soft and total) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) from baseline to follow-up were assessed using the 17-segment American Heart Association-model. Results Median (IQR) increase in CAC after statin treatment was 38 (5–236) Agatston units (p<0.001). Calcified and total plaque volume increased with 5.6 (0.0–49.1) and 2.9 (0.0–23.5) mm3, respectively (p<0.001 for both). The median (IQR) change in soft/mixed plaque volume was -10 (-7.1–0.0), p = <0.001. Patients who had obtained the LDL-c treatment target at follow-up, experienced reduced progression of both CAC and total plaque volume compared to patients with LDL-c >1.8mmol/L (21 [2–143] vs. 69 [16–423], p = 0.006 and 0.65 [-1.0–13.9] vs. 13.0 [0.0–60.8] mm3, p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions A progression of total atherosclerotic plaque volume in statin-treated patients with IJD was observed. However, soft/mixed plaque volume was reduced, suggesting an alteration in plaque composition. Patients with recommended LDL-c levels at follow-up had reduced atherosclerotic progression compared to patients with LDL-c levels above the treatment target, suggesting a beneficial effect of treatment to guideline-recommended lipid targets in IJD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2996004687,"Pregnancy is associated with a temporarily increased sickness absence (SA) risk. This association may vary by the level of occupational gender segregation; however, knowledge in this area is limited. We studied whether trends in SA and disability pension (DP) in the years before and after first childbirth among women with one or more childbirths and with no childbirth during the study period varied by occupational gender segregation.We conducted a population-based register study involving nulliparous women aged 18-39 years, living in Sweden in 2002-2004 (n = 364,411). We classified participants in three childbirth groups as: (1) no childbirth in 2005 or in the next 3.75 years, (2) first childbirth in 2005 and no births in the subsequent 3.75 years, and (3) first childbirth in 2005 and at least one additional birth in the subsequent 3.75 years, and into five categories based on the rate of women in their occupations. We compared crude and standardized mean annual net SA and DP days during the three years before and the three years after 2005 across the childbirth and occupational gender segregation categories.Women in extremely male-dominated occupations had or tended to have somewhat higher mean combined SA and DP days than women in gender-integrated occupations; women in female-dominated occupations had comparable or tended to have slightly higher mean SA and DP days than women in gender-integrated occupations. Except for the year before the first childbirth, women who gave birth, especially those who gave several births, had generally a lower mean combined standardized SA and DP days than nulliparous women. We found no substantial differences in trends in SA and DP around the time of first childbirth according to occupational gender segregation.Trends in SA and DP around the time of first childbirth did not vary by occupational gender segregation."
https://openalex.org/W3008208069,"Accurate smoking prevalence data is critical for monitoring, surveillance, and evaluation. However, estimates of prevalence vary across surveys due to various factors. This study examines smoking prevalence estimates for 18–21 year olds across six U.S. national telephone, online and in-person surveys for the years 2013 and 2014. Estimates of ever smoking ranged from 35% to 55%. Current smoking ranged from 16% to 30%. Across the three modalities, household surveys were found to yield the highest estimates of smoking prevalence among 18 to 21 year olds while online surveys yielded the lowest estimates, and this was consistent when stratifying by gender and race/ethnicity. Assessments of the joint effect of gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment and survey mode indicated that the relative differences in the likelihood of smoking were consistent across modes for gender and education groups. However, the relative likelihood of smoking among minority groups compared with non-Hispanic Whites varied across modes. Gender and racial/ethnic distributions for most surveys significantly differed from the U.S. Census. Over and underrepresentation of certain demographic subpopulations, variations in survey question wording, and social desirability effects may explain modality differences in smoking estimates observed in this study. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of survey mode on variation in smoking prevalence estimates across national surveys, particularly for young adult populations."
https://openalex.org/W2998809695,"Detection of misfolded prion protein, PrPTSE, in biological samples is important to develop antemortem tests for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay detects PrPTSE but requires dedicated equipment and relatively long incubation times when applied to samples containing extremely low levels of PrPTSE. It was shown that a microplate shaker with heated top (Thermomixer-C) accelerated amplification of PrPTSE in brain suspensions of 263K scrapie and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). We expanded the investigation to include TSE agents previously untested, including chronic wasting disease (CWD), macaque-adapted variant CJD (vCJD) and human vCJD, and we further characterized the assays conducted at 42°C and 55°C. PrPTSE from all brains containing the TSE agents were successfully amplified using a truncated hamster recombinant protein except for human vCJD which required truncated bank vole recombinant protein. We compared assays conducted at 42°C on Thermomixer-C, Thermomixer-R (without heated top) and on a fluorimeter used for RT-QuIC. QuIC on Thermomixer-R achieved in only 18 hours assay sensitivity similar to that of RT-QuIC read at 60 hours (or 48 hours with sCJD). QuIC on Thermomixer-C required 24 hours to complete and the endpoint titers of some TSEs were 10-fold lower than those obtained with RT-QuIC and Thermomixer-R. Conversely, at 55°C, the reactions with sCJD and CWD on Thermomixer-C achieved the same sensitivity as with RT-QuIC but in shorter times. Human vCJD samples tested at higher temperatures gave rise to high reactivity in wells containing normal control samples. Similarly, reactions on Thermomixer-R were unsuitable at 55°C. The main disadvantage of Thermomixers is that they cannot track formation of PrP fibrils in real time, a feature useful in some applications. The main advantages of Thermomixers are that they need shorter reaction times to detect PrPTSE, are easier to use, involve more robust equipment, and are relatively affordable. Improvements to QuIC using thermal mixers may help develop accessible antemortem TSE tests."

The project leader and I were sitting under a tree, protected from the hot sun, while we placed leg bands on birds we had just caught. I hadn't handled a bird in a year, and I was nervous that it would escape. I held the bird tightly as it struggled in my hand. Then, as I readjusted my grip, I saw it was lying limp. “Is he OK?” I asked the project leader in a shaky voice. I handed her the bird and she looked down uncomfortably, setting it on the ground. We both stared at it, wishing the wind blowing its chest feathers was actually its heartbeat returning.

> “As researchers, we must be mindful of the ethical dimensions of our work.” 

I'm not an ornithologist; I'm a Ph.D. student who studies soil biology. But I had worked on birds as an undergraduate student, and I was assisting the project leader, a close friend, with her research. I make the cross-country trip each year to help her and welcome it as a fun change of pace from my usual fieldwork, which involves digging up soil samples from agricultural fields.

This year, though, the experience left me in turmoil. It's not uncommon for animals to die when biologists catch them—and some scientists consider this an unavoidable cost of doing research—but the knowledge that I had taken a life nagged at me. I felt ashamed of my mistake and agonized over the bird for days.

After I traveled back to my university and reoriented myself to my dissertation research, I realized that I had more on my conscience than the accidental killing of one bird. I regularly capture and preserve huge numbers of soil invertebrates (mites, beetles, and other critters) for my research; this summer alone I killed more than 10,000. I had turned a blind eye to this invertebrate massacre. But as I resumed my normal work, sorting and categorizing hundreds of vials of dead invertebrates, the conflict between my methods and my values increasingly weighed on me.

I face similar struggles in my personal life. Before grad school, I was dedicated to walking or biking around town and buying food from local and organic sources. In grad school, where I'm pressed for time and money, I drive more often and have become increasingly relaxed about my consumer choices. Conventionally farmed bananas shipped thousands of kilometers to Vermont are often the easiest and cheapest snack option I can find, even though eating them while I research sustainable agriculture feels enormously hypocritical.

Scientific research can make a real difference in the world. But I've come to realize that the life of a scientist comes with ethical trade-offs, including ones that aren't easy to stomach—or avoid. Some scientists, such as myself, may debate the ethics of methods that could harm or kill animals. Others may struggle with whether it's the right choice to fly around the world to meetings about climate change.

I entered my Ph.D. program because I care deeply about environmental conservation, and I want to stay grounded and true to those motivations. But I am not perfect. I've made compromises between getting research done and following my personal values. Although these compromises can be necessary and practical, I sometimes look back and wonder whether I cut the wrong corners. The unfortunate reality is that in grad school, moments of reflection are sometimes difficult to come by. Juggling classes and research, jumping through various Ph.D. milestones, and learning technical and professional skills—on top of worrying whether my research is novel, relevant, and impactful—leave me little time and emotional space for much else.

Going forward, though, I want to be more deliberate about these ethical considerations. I plan to ask myself whether my methods are truly necessary and to think more carefully about ways to minimize harm or risk.

The death of this bird hit me as a wake-up call, forcing me to reflect and recalibrate. In grad school, it's easy to be consumed by pressures and demands. But it's important to have moments where we can step back and reconnect with our values. As researchers, we must be mindful of the ethical dimensions of our work.
