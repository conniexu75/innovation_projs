https://openalex.org/W2593598577,"With some advances in modern medicine (such as cancer chemotherapy, broad exposure to antibiotics, and immunosuppression), the incidence of opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans has increased. Cases of drug resistance among these pathogens have become more frequent, requiring the development of new drugs and a better understanding of the targeted enzymes. Sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) is a cytochrome P450 enzyme required for biosynthesis of sterols in eukaryotic cells and is the major target of clinical drugs for managing fungal pathogens, but some of the CYP51 key features important for rational drug design have remained obscure. We report the catalytic properties, ligand-binding profiles, and inhibition of enzymatic activity of C. albicans CYP51 by clinical antifungal drugs that are used systemically (fluconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole) and topically (miconazole and clotrimazole) and by a tetrazole-based drug candidate, VT-1161 (oteseconazole: (R)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1,1-difluoro-3-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)-1-(5-(4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenyl)pyridin-2-yl)propan-2-ol). Among the compounds tested, the first-line drug fluconazole was the weakest inhibitor, whereas posaconazole and VT-1161 were the strongest CYP51 inhibitors. We determined the X-ray structures of C. albicans CYP51 complexes with posaconazole and VT-1161, providing a molecular mechanism for the potencies of these drugs, including the activity of VT-1161 against Candida krusei and Candida glabrata, pathogens that are intrinsically resistant to fluconazole. Our comparative structural analysis outlines phylum-specific CYP51 features that could direct future rational development of more efficient broad-spectrum antifungals."

We devised a microfabricated organ culture system that viably preserves the normal multicellular composition of the mouse intestine, with luminal flow to control perturbations (e.g., microbes, drugs). It enables studying short-term responses of diverse gut components (immune, neuronal, etc.). We focused on the early response to bacteria that induce either Th17 or RORg+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells in vivo. Transcriptional responses partially reproduced in vivo signatures, but these microbes elicited diametrically opposite changes in expression of a neuronal-specific gene set, notably nociceptive neuropeptides. We demonstrated activation of sensory neurons by microbes, correlating with RORg+ Treg induction. Colonic RORg+ Treg frequencies increased in mice lacking TAC1 neuropeptide precursor and decreased in capsaicin-diet fed mice. Thus, differential engagement of the enteric nervous system may partake in bifurcating pro- or anti-inflammatory responses to microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2592254127,"Phosphate is essential for all living systems, serving as a building block of genetic and metabolic machinery. However, it is unclear how phosphate could have assumed these central roles on primordial Earth, given its poor geochemical accessibility. We used systems biology approaches to explore the alternative hypothesis that a protometabolism could have emerged prior to the incorporation of phosphate. Surprisingly, we identified a cryptic phosphate-independent core metabolism producible from simple prebiotic compounds. This network is predicted to support the biosynthesis of a broad category of key biomolecules. Its enrichment for enzymes utilizing iron-sulfur clusters, and the fact that thermodynamic bottlenecks are more readily overcome by thioester rather than phosphate couplings, suggest that this network may constitute a ""metabolic fossil"" of an early phosphate-free nonenzymatic biochemistry. Our results corroborate and expand previous proposals that a putative thioester-based metabolism could have predated the incorporation of phosphate and an RNA-based genetic system. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2594573375,"Meiosis is the cellular program that underlies gamete formation. For this program, crossovers between homologous chromosomes play an essential mechanical role to ensure regular segregation. We present a detailed study of crossover formation in human male and female meiosis, enabled by modeling analysis. Results suggest that recombination in the two sexes proceeds analogously and efficiently through most stages. However, specifically in female (but not male), ∼25% of the intermediates that should mature into crossover products actually fail to do so. Further, this ""female-specific crossover maturation inefficiency"" is inferred to make major contributions to the high level of chromosome mis-segregation and resultant aneuploidy that uniquely afflicts human female oocytes (e.g., giving Down syndrome). Additionally, crossover levels on different chromosomes in the same nucleus tend to co-vary, an effect attributable to global per-nucleus modulation of chromatin loop size. Maturation inefficiency could potentially reflect an evolutionary advantage of increased aneuploidy for human females."
https://openalex.org/W2593037083,"We present SplashRNA, a sequential classifier to predict potent microRNA-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Trained on published and novel data sets, SplashRNA outperforms previous algorithms and reliably predicts the most efficient shRNAs for a given gene. Combined with an optimized miR-E backbone, >90% of high-scoring SplashRNA predictions trigger >85% protein knockdown when expressed from a single genomic integration. SplashRNA can significantly improve the accuracy of loss-of-function genetics studies and facilitates the generation of compact shRNA libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2592416896,"Client behaviour change is at the heart of veterinary practice, where promoting animal health and welfare is often synonymous with engaging clients in animal management practices. In the medical realm, extensive research points to the link between practitioner communication and patient behavioural outcomes, suggesting that the veterinary industry could benefit from a deeper understanding of veterinarian communication and its effects on client motivation. Whilst extensive studies have quantified language components typical of the veterinary consultation, the literature is lacking in-depth qualitative analysis in this context. The objective of this study was to address this deficit, and offer new critical insight into veterinary communication strategies in the pursuit of client behaviour change. Role-play interactions (n = 15) between UK cattle veterinarians and an actress experienced in medical and veterinary education were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Analysis revealed that, overall, veterinarians tend to communicate in a directive style (minimal eliciting of client opinion, dominating the consultation agenda, prioritising instrumental support), reflecting a paternalistic role in the consultation interaction. Given this finding, recommendations for progress in the veterinary industry are made; namely, the integration of evidence-based medical communication methodologies into clinical training. Use of these types of methodologies may facilitate the adoption of more mutualistic, relationship-centred communication in veterinary practice, supporting core psychological elements of client motivation and resultant behaviour change."
https://openalex.org/W2594146958,"Alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis are important in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and asbestosis. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) detoxifies mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, in part, by deacetylating manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and mitochondrial 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase. We reasoned that SIRT3 deficiency occurs in fibrotic lungs and thereby augments AEC mtDNA damage and apoptosis. Human lungs were assessed by using immunohistochemistry for SIRT3 activity via acetylated MnSODK68. Murine AEC SIRT3 and cleaved caspase-9 (CC-9) expression were assayed by immunoblotting with or without SIRT3 enforced expression or silencing. mtDNA damage was measured by using quantitative PCR and apoptosis via ELISA. Pulmonary fibrosis after asbestos or bleomycin exposure was evaluated in 129SJ/wild-type and SIRT3-knockout mice (Sirt3−/−) by using fibrosis scoring and lung collagen levels. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung alveolar type II cells have increased MnSODK68 acetylation compared with controls. Asbestos and H2O2 diminished AEC SIRT3 protein expression and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation, including MnSODK68. SIRT3 enforced expression reduced oxidant-induced AEC OGG1K338/341 acetylation, mtDNA damage, and apoptosis, whereas SIRT3 silencing promoted these effects. Asbestos- or bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, AEC mtDNA damage, and apoptosis in wild-type mice were amplified in Sirt3−/− animals. These data suggest a novel role for SIRT3 deficiency in mediating AEC mtDNA damage, apoptosis, and lung fibrosis.—Jablonski, R. P., Kim, S.-J., Cheresh, P., Williams, D.

https://openalex.org/W2594557659,"Neural circuit wiring relies on selective synapse formation whereby a presynaptic release apparatus is matched with its cognate postsynaptic machinery. At metabotropic synapses, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. In the mammalian retina, rod photoreceptors form selective contacts with rod ON-bipolar cells by aligning the presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channel directing glutamate release (CaV1.4) with postsynaptic mGluR6 receptors. We show this coordination requires an extracellular protein, α2δ4, which complexes with CaV1.4 and the rod synaptogenic mediator, ELFN1, for trans-synaptic alignment with mGluR6. Eliminating α2δ4 in mice abolishes rod synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission to rod ON-bipolar cells, and disrupts postsynaptic mGluR6 clustering. We further find that in rods, α2δ4 is crucial for organizing synaptic ribbons and setting CaV1.4 voltage sensitivity. In cones, α2δ4 is essential for CaV1.4 function, but is not required for ribbon organization, synaptogenesis, or synaptic transmission. These findings offer insights into retinal pathologies associated with α2δ4 dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2593596699,"The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the fourth most important crop food in the world and Colombia has one of the most important collections of potato germplasm in the world (the Colombian Central Collection-CCC). Little is known about its potential as a source of genetic diversity for molecular breeding programs. In this study, we analyzed 809 Andigenum group accessions from the CCC using 5968 SNPs to determine: 1) the genetic diversity and population structure of the Andigenum germplasm and 2) the usefulness of this collection to map qualitative traits across the potato genome. The genetic structure analysis based on principal components, cluster analyses, and Bayesian inference revealed that the CCC can be subdivided into two main groups associated with their ploidy level: Phureja (diploid) and Andigena (tetraploid). The Andigena population was more genetically diverse but less genetically substructured than the Phureja population (three vs. five subpopulations, respectively). The association mapping analysis of qualitative morphological data using 4666 SNPs showed 23 markers significantly associated with nine morphological traits. The present study showed that the CCC is a highly diverse germplasm collection genetically and phenotypically, useful to implement association mapping in order to identify genes related to traits of interest and to assist future potato genetic breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2594052716,"The serotonin receptor subtypes 2 comprise 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C, which are Gαq-coupled receptors and display distinct pharmacological properties. Although co-expressed in some brain regions and involved in various neurological disorders, their functional interactions have not yet been studied. We report that 5-HT2 receptors can form homo- and heterodimers when expressed alone or co-expressed in transfected cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies confirmed that 5-HT2C receptors interact with either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors. Although heterodimerization with 5-HT2C receptors does not alter 5-HT2C Gαq-dependent inositol phosphate signaling, 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptor-mediated signaling was totally blunted. This feature can be explained by a dominance of 5-HT2C on 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor binding; in 5-HT2C-containing heterodimers, ligands bind and activate the 5-HT2C protomer exclusively. This dominant effect on the associated protomer was also observed in neurons, supporting the physiological relevance of 5-HT2 receptor heterodimerization in vivo. Accordingly, exogenous expression of an inactive form of the 5-HT2C receptor in the locus ceruleus is associated with decreased 5-HT2A-dependent noradrenergic transmission. These data demonstrate that 5-HT2 receptors can form functionally asymmetric heterodimers in vitro and in vivo that must be considered when analyzing the physiological or pathophysiological roles of serotonin in tissues where 5-HT2 receptors are co-expressed.

Metabotropic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) subtype 2 receptors (5-HT2), which belong to the class A-1 GPCR family, display a widespread expression in the nervous system and are involved in an important array of physiological and pathological processes.

Recently, a study identified other 5-HT receptor heterodimers with functional implication; heterodimers between 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors have been reported to regulate GIRK channel activity in heterologous systems and in hippocampal neurons (29.Renner U. Zeug A. Woehler A. Niebert M. Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Gorinski N. Guseva D. Abdel-Galil D. Fröhlich M. Döring F. Wischmeyer E. Richter D.W. Neher E. Ponimaskin E.G. Heterodimerization of serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 differentially regulates receptor signalling and trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 2486-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization was found to inhibit 5-HT1A-mediated activation of Gαi and GIRK channel activity, without affecting 5-HT7 receptor-mediated signaling, indicating a unidirectional dominant effect of the 5-HT7 protomer. Of note, cross-talks between 5-HT receptors have been reported without obligatory physical interaction. For instance, co-expression of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors influences the internalization pathways and kinetics of both receptors without heterodimerization (i.e. lack of FRET signal) (30.Janoshazi A. Deraet M. Callebert J. Setola V. Guenther S. Saubamea B. Manivet P. Launay J.M. Maroteaux L. Modified receptor internalization upon coexpression of 5-HT1B receptor and 5-HT2B receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, neither the basic pharmacological profiles of putative 5-HT2 heterodimers nor their signaling properties have been characterized. We specifically addressed this issue here by studying the interactions between the three members of the 5-HT2 subfamily and their functional consequences in vitro and in vivo. Using co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) approaches, we found that 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C form heterodimers when co-expressed in heterologous expression systems. Although 5-HT2C-containing heterodimers did not show alterations in coupling properties, the signaling of associated 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B protomers was blunted, whereas the 5-HT2C protomer maintained its signaling properties. Moreover, no blunting occurred in 5-HT2A/2B heterodimers. We next showed that this asymmetry in Gαq protein activation was related to a dominant effect of the 5-HT2C protomer on ligand binding to the other partner. Using AAV-mediated exogenous expression of a 5-HT2C receptor-truncated C-tail mutant (5-HT2CΔCter) in brain regions expressing endogenous 5-HT2A receptor, we also observed a blunting effect of this inactive 5-HT2C receptor leading to a complete binding inhibition of the 5-HT2A-selective ligand. Accordingly, this lack of ligand binding was associated with impaired 5-HT2A-induced excitatory neurotransmission in neurons expressing the 5-HT2C-inactive protomer. The putative formation of heterodimers between 5-HT2 receptor subtypes was investigated using BRET and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1). The coding region of Renilla luciferase (Rluc, BRET donor) or the yellow variant of the green fluorescent protein (YFP, BRET acceptor), were fused in-phase downstream of the coding region of 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. Saturation BRET experiments were conducted in HEK293 cells co-transfected with constant amounts of BRET donor plasmids and increasing amounts of BRET acceptor plasmids. In case of a close proximity between the investigated partners, hyperbolic saturation of the BRET signal is expected (see under “Experimental procedures”). Hyperbolic curves were indeed obtained when 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors were tested for self-association (5-HT2A/2A and 5-HT2C/2C, respectively, Fig. 1a), confirming previous studies showing that these receptors are able to homodimerize in transfected cells (13.Brea J.

Noteworthy, the same experiment with 5-HT2B BRET pairs led to a linear plot, consistent with a bystander (nonspecific) BRET and thus with the absence of self-association. Hyperbolic curves were also obtained with 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C BRET pairs (5-HT2A/2C), 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C BRET pairs (5-HT2B/2C), and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B (5-HT2A/2B) BRET pairs (Fig. 1b), suggesting that 5-HT2 receptors can form heterodimers in intact cells. BRET50 values (values of YFP/Rluc for half-maximal BRET) reflect the propensity of association between the investigated proteins. Interestingly, BRET50 values for heterodimeric association are significantly lower than those measured for homodimeric association of 5-HT2 subtypes, suggesting that in native cells expressing more than one 5-HT2 receptor subtype heterodimerization is favored over homodimerization (Fig. 1b). The physical interaction between these receptor subtypes was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in the same cells, using epitope (FLAG)- or GFP-tagged proteins (Fig. 1c). Consistent with BRET data, FLAG-5-HT2C receptor co-immunoprecipitated with 5-HT2A-GFP and 5-HT2C-GFP receptors. In complementary experiments FLAG-5-HT2B receptor co-immunoprecipitated with 5-HT2A-GFP and 5-HT2C-GFP receptors. We next examined the consequence of 5-HT2-receptor heterodimerization on agonist-induced Gαq activation. The 5-HT2 receptors consistently activate the PLC-β pathway in native tissues and heterologous cells (3.Millan M.J. Marin P. Bockaert J. Mannoury la Cour C.

Dose-response curves of 5-HT2-mediated production of IP in response to 5-HT or the partial agonist DOI in cells expressing 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, or 5-HT2C receptors and in combination were analyzed using the operational model (31.Black J.W.

No significant difference in Gαq coupling efficiency as determined by the transduction coefficient (τ/KA) (32.Kenakin T. Watson C. Muniz-Medina V. Christopoulos A. Novick S. A simple method for quantifying functional selectivity and agonist bias.ACS Chem.

In the absence of highly selective, subtype-specific 5-HT2 agonists, we next determined whether agonist-induced 5-HT2 heterodimer signaling was altered in the presence of selective antagonist of the other protomer (Fig. 5). Affinity and selectivity of antagonists were first tested in transfected cells to define the optimal concentration that nearly fully inhibits each individual receptor and to avoid cross-reactivity (100 nm, Fig. 3). Dose-response curves of 5-HT2-mediated IP accumulation in response to 5-HT stimulation allowed the determination of the minimal agonist concentration inducing maximal IP response (1 μm, Fig. 4a). When expressed individually, 5-HT2 receptors displayed significant 5-HT-stimulated IP production (Fig. 5a); in the presence of selective antagonists (MDL100970 for 5-HT2A, RS127445 for 5-HT2B, and RS102221 for 5-HT2Creceptors), the agonist-stimulated IP response was reduced to basal level in cells expressing the cognate 5-HT2 receptor (Fig. 5a).Figure 3Affinity and selectivity of antagonists used in this study.

By contrast in the 5-HT2B/2C heterodimers, only the 5-HT2C receptors continued mediating signaling, because blocking selectively the 5-HT2B receptors with RS127445 did not inhibit the 5-HT-mediated IP accumulation (Fig. 5a), although it can be blocked only by selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonists RS102221 or SB242084 (Figs. 5a and 4, c and d). The 5-HT2A-mediated IP accumulation was similarly blunted by expression of the 5-HT2C receptor, as MDL100907 had no significant inhibitory effect on IP production but RS102221 did (Fig. 5a). The same effect was reproduced for different agonists 5-HT or nor-(+)-fenfluramine (NDF) (Fig. 4, e and f) and in all tested cell lines, COS-7 (Fig. 2), HEK293 (Figure 4, Figure 5), CHO (Fig. 6c), or LMTK (Fig. 6, a and b), and thus is likely independent of agonists or cell-specific effectors. Because it was shown above that under the same expression conditions these receptor isoforms constitute heterodimers, a plausible explanation for the observed effects is that heterodimerization with 5-HT2C prevents the ability of 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors to signal, whereas in the case of heterodimerization of 5-HT2A with 5-HT2B receptors, both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B protomers contribute to signal. These results are consistent with a model where in the 5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT2B/2C heterodimers, only the 5-HT2C protomer couples to the G protein, while preventing coupling of the associated protomer. To investigate this issue, we co-expressed the 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptor with a 5-HT2C receptor deleted for the C-terminal tail (5-HT2CΔCter) (Fig. 5b), a mutant receptor incapable of activating Gαq and stimulating IP production in response to 5-HT stimulation (Fig. 5b). Confirming the hypothesis, in cells expressing 5-HT2A/2CΔCter and 5-HT2B/2CΔCter heterodimers, IP accumulation was dramatically reduced (Fig. 5b). In addition, co-expressing 5-HT2C receptors wit"
https://openalex.org/W2591914616,"The major endocannabinoid in the mammalian brain is the bioactive lipid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The best-known effects of 2-AG are mediated by G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors. In principle, 2-AG could modify neuronal excitability by acting directly on ion channels, but such mechanisms are poorly understood. Using a preparation of dissociated mouse midbrain dopamine neurons to isolate effects on intrinsic excitability, we found that 100 nM 2-AG accelerated pacemaking and steepened the frequency-current relationship for burst-like firing. In voltage-clamp experiments, 2-AG reduced A-type potassium current (IA) through a cannabinoid receptor-independent mechanism mimicked by arachidonic acid, which has no activity on cannabinoid receptors. Activation of orexin, neurotensin, and metabotropic glutamate Gq/11-linked receptors mimicked the effects of exogenous 2-AG and their actions were prevented by inhibiting the 2-AG-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase α. The results show that 2-AG and related lipid signaling molecules can directly tune neuronal excitability in a cell-autonomous manner by modulating IA."

Leptin and linoleic acid have the ability to potentially affect immune cells, whereas curcumin is a known natural polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Aims This study was designed to evaluate the pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects of leptin and linoleic acid on immune cells from patients with NAFLD and to corroborate the modulatory effects of curcumin and its preventive properties against the progression of NAFLD using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis mouse model. Results The ex vivo experiments showed that linoleic acid increased the production of reactive oxygen species in monocytes and liver macrophages, whereas leptin enhanced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in monocytes and interferon-γ production in circulating CD4+ cells. Conversely, oral administration of curcumin prevented HFD-induced liver injury, metabolic alterations, intrahepatic CD4+ cell accumulation and the linoleic acid- and leptin- induced pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects on mouse liver macrophages. Conclusion Our findings provide new evidence for the therapeutic potential of curcumin to treat human NAFLD. However, the development of a preventive treatment targeting human circulating monocytes and liver macrophages as well as peripheral and hepatic CD4+ cells requires additional research."
https://openalex.org/W2593051497,"Plants adjust their development and architecture to small variations in ambient temperature. In a time in which temperatures are rising world-wide, the mechanism by which plants are able to sense temperature fluctuations and adapt to it, is becoming of special interest. By performing RNA-sequencing on two Arabidopsis accession and one Brassica species exposed to temperature alterations, we showed that alternative splicing is an important mechanism in ambient temperature sensing and adaptation. We found that amongst the differentially alternatively spliced genes, splicing related genes are enriched, suggesting that the splicing machinery itself is targeted for alternative splicing when temperature changes. Moreover, we showed that many different components of the splicing machinery are targeted for ambient temperature regulated alternative splicing. Mutant analysis of a splicing related gene that was differentially spliced in two of the genotypes showed an altered flowering time response to different temperatures. We propose a two-step mechanism where temperature directly influences alternative splicing of the splicing machinery genes, followed by a second step where the altered splicing machinery affects splicing of downstream genes involved in the adaptation to altered temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2593392007,"Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR) is the final enzyme in proline biosynthesis, catalyzing the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to proline. Mutations in the PYCR1 gene alter mitochondrial function and cause the connective tissue disorder cutis laxa. Furthermore, PYCR1 is overexpressed in multiple cancers, and the PYCR1 knock-out suppresses tumorigenic growth, suggesting that PYCR1 is a potential cancer target. However, inhibitor development has been stymied by limited mechanistic details for the enzyme, particularly in light of a previous crystallographic study that placed the cofactor-binding site in the C-terminal domain rather than the anticipated Rossmann fold of the N-terminal domain. To fill this gap, we report crystallographic, sedimentation-velocity, and kinetics data for human PYCR1. Structures of binary complexes of PYCR1 with NADPH or proline determined at 1.9 A resolution provide insight into cofactor and substrate recognition. We see NADPH bound to the Rossmann fold, over 25 A from the previously proposed site. The 1.85 A resolution structure of a ternary complex containing NADPH and a P5C/proline analog provides a model of the Michaelis complex formed during hydride transfer. Sedimentation velocity shows that PYCR1 forms a concentration-dependent decamer in solution, consistent with the pentamer-of-dimers assembly seen crystallographically. Kinetic and mutational analysis confirmed several features seen in the crystal structure, including the importance of a hydrogen bond between Thr-238 and the substrate as well as limited cofactor discrimination."

The genome is a circular chromosome of 8,121,733 bp with a G+C content of 68.1% that encodes 7,697 predicted proteins. In the N. seriolae UTF1 predicted genes, we found orthologs of virulence factors of pathogenic mycobacteria and human clinical Nocardia isolates involved in host cell invasion, modulation of phagocyte function and survival inside the macrophages. The virulence factor candidates provide an essential basis for understanding their pathogenic mechanisms at the molecular level by the fish nocardiosis research community in future studies. We also found many potential antibiotic resistance genes on the N. seriolae UTF1 chromosome. Comparative analysis with the four existing complete genomes, N. farcinica IFM 10152, N. brasiliensis HUJEG-1 and N. cyriacigeorgica GUH-2 and N. nova SH22a, revealed that 2,745 orthologous genes were present in all five Nocardia genomes (core genes) and 1,982 genes were unique to N. seriolae UTF1. In particular, the N. seriolae UTF1 genome contains a greater number of mobile elements and genes of unknown function that comprise the differences in structure and gene content from the other Nocardia genomes. In addition, a lot of the N. seriolae UTF1-specific genes were assigned to the ABC transport system. Because of limited resources in ocean environments, these N. seriolae UTF1 specific ABC transporters might facilitate adaptation strategies essential for marine environment survival. Thus, the availability of the complete N. seriolae UTF1 genome sequence will provide a valuable resource for comparative genomic studies of N. seriolae isolates, as well as provide new insights into the ecological and functional diversity of the genus Nocardia."

Adiponectin knock-out mice were orally administered dextran sulfate sodium for 7 days and were compared with wild-type mice. The severity of disease was analyzed histopathologically and through cytokine profiling. HCT116 colonic epithelial cells were employed to analyze the in vitro effects of adiponectin and AdipoR1 interactions in colonic injury following dextran sulfate sodium treatment. Adiponectin knock-out mice receiving dextran sulfate sodium exhibited severe colitis, had greater inflammatory cell infiltration, and an increased presence of activated B cells compared with controls. This was accompanied by an exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine profile and increased STAT3 signaling. Adiponectin knock-out mouse colons had markedly reduced proliferation and increased epithelial apoptosis and cellular stress. In vitro, adiponectin reduced apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and stress signals and restored STAT3 signaling.

Combination therapies have a range of advantages, including synergism, toxicity reduction, and delaying the onset of resistance acquisition. Unfortunately, antimalarial combination therapy is limited by the depleting repertoire of effective drugs with distinct target pathways. To fast-track antimalarial drug discovery, we have previously employed drug-repositioning to identify the anti-amoebic drug, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate, as a potential candidate for repositioned use against malaria. Despite its 1000-fold increase in in vitro antimalarial potency (ED50 47 nM) compared with its anti-amoebic potency (ED50 26–32 uM), practical use of the compound has been limited by dose-dependent toxicity (emesis and cardiotoxicity). Identification of a synergistic partner drug would present an opportunity for dose-reduction, thus increasing the therapeutic window. The lack of reliable and standardised methodology to enable the in vitro definition of synergistic potential for antimalarials is a major drawback. Here we use isobologram and combination-index data generated by CalcuSyn software analyses (Biosoft v2.1) to define drug interactivity in an objective, automated manner. The method, based on the median effect principle proposed by Chou and Talalay, was initially validated for antimalarial application using the known synergistic combination (atovaquone-proguanil).

https://openalex.org/W2594274697,"Reciprocal regulation of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis contributes to systemic metabolic homeostasis. Recent evidence from lower order organisms has found that reversible post-translational modification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), particularly acetylation, contributes to the reciprocal regulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. However, whether this occurs in mammalian hepatocytes in vitro or in vivo is unknown. Several proteomics studies have identified 4 lysine residues in critical regions of mammalian GAPDH that are altered by multiple post-translational modifications. In FAO hepatoma cells, mutation of all 4 lysine residues (4K-R GAPDH) to mimic their unmodified state reduced GAPDH glycolytic activity and glycolytic flux and increased gluconeogenic GAPDH activity and glucose production. Hepatic expression of 4K-R GAPDH in mice increased GAPDH gluconeogenic activity and the contribution of gluconeogenesis to endogenous glucose production in the unfed state. Consistent with the increased reliance on the energy-consuming gluconeogenic pathway, plasma free fatty acids and ketones were elevated in mice expressing 4K-R GAPDH, suggesting enhanced lipolysis and hepatic fatty acid oxidation. In normal mice, food withholding and refeeding, as well as hormonal regulators of reciprocal glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, such as insulin, glucagon, and norepinephrine, had no effect on global GAPDH acetylation. However, GAPDH acetylation was reduced in obese and type 2 diabetic db/db mice.

Given that TGF-β1 and myocardin (MYOCD) are potent activators for VSMC differentiation, we screened for TGF-β1 and MYOCD/serum response factor (SRF)–regulated TSPANs in VSMC by using RNA-seq analyses and RNA-arrays. TSPAN2 was found to be the only TSPAN family gene induced by TGF-β1 and MYOCD, and reduced by SRF deficiency in VSMCs. We also found that TSPAN2 is highly expressed in smooth muscle–enriched tissues and down-regulated in in vitro models of VSMC phenotypic modulation. TSPAN2 expression is attenuated in mouse carotid arteries after ligation injury and in failed human arteriovenous fistula samples after occlusion by dedifferentiated neointimal VSMC. In vitro functional studies showed that TSPAN2 suppresses VSMC proliferation and migration. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TSPAN2 is regulated by 2 parallel pathways, MYOCD/SRF and TGF-β1/SMAD, via distinct binding elements within the proximal promoter. Thus, we identified the first VSMC-enriched and MYOCD/SRF and TGF-β1/SMAD-dependent TSPAN family member, whose expression is intimately associated with VSMC differentiation and negatively correlated with vascular disease.

https://openalex.org/W2591899506,"We modeled the cost-effectiveness of rearing Anastrepha ludens, a major fruit fly pest currently mass reared for sterilization and release in pest control programs implementing the sterile insect technique (SIT). An optimization model was generated by combining response surface models of artificial diet cost savings with models of A. ludens pupation, pupal weight, larval development time and adult emergence as a function of mixtures of yeast, a costly ingredient, with corn flour and corncob fractions in the diet. Our model revealed several yeast-reduced mixtures that could be used to prepare diets that were considerably cheaper than a standard diet used for mass rearing. Models predicted a similar production of insects (pupation and adult emergence), with statistically similar pupal weights and larval development times between yeast-reduced diets and the standard mass rearing diet formulation. Annual savings from using the modified diets could be up to 5.9% of the annual cost of yeast, corn flour and corncob fractions used in the standard diet, representing a potential saving of US $27.45 per ton of diet (US $47,496 in the case of the mean annual production of 1,730.29 tons of artificial diet in the Moscafrut mass rearing facility at Metapa, Chiapas, Mexico). Implementation of the yeast-reduced diet on an experimental scale at mass rearing facilities is still required to confirm the suitability of new mixtures of artificial diet for rearing A. ludens for use in SIT. This should include the examination of critical quality control parameters of flies such as adult flight ability, starvation resistance and male sexual competitiveness across various generations. The method used here could be useful for improving the cost-effectiveness of invertebrate or vertebrate mass rearing diets worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2593112171,"Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted to study the functional response and prey size spectrum of the young naupliar stages of the calanoid copepod Paracartia grani Sars. Experiments were conducted on a range of microalgal prey of varying sizes and motility patterns. Significant feeding was found in all prey of a size range of 4.5-19.8 μm, with Holling type III functional responses observed for most prey types. The highest clearance rates occurred when nauplii fed on the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa sp. and the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii (respectively, 0.61 and 0.70 mL ind-1 d-1), suggesting an optimal prey:predator ratio of 0.09. Additional experiments were conducted to examine the effects of the presence of alternative prey (either Heterocapsa sp. or Gymnodinium litoralis) on the functional response to the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana. In the bialgal mixtures, clearance and ingestion rates of I. galbana along the range of the functional response were significantly reduced as a result of selectivity towards the larger, alternative prey. Paradoxically, relatively large prey trigger a perception response in the nauplii, but most likely such prey cannot be completely ingested and a certain degree of sloppy feeding may occur. Our results are further evidence of the complex prey-specific feeding interactions that are likely to occur in natural assemblages with several available prey types."

While the knowledge related to improving newborn and child survival has advanced remarkably over the past few decades, many healthcare systems in such settings remain unable to effectively deliver pediatric advance life support management. With the introduction of the Emergency Triage, Assessment and Treatment plus Admission care (ETAT+)-a locally adapted pediatric advanced life support management program-in Rwandan district hospitals, we undertook this study to assess the extent to which these hospitals are prepared to provide this pediatric advanced life support management. The results of the study will shed light on the resources and support that are currently available to implement ETAT+, which aims to improve care for severely ill infants and children.A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in eight district hospitals across Rwanda focusing on the availability of physical and human resources, as well as hospital services organizations to provide emergency triage, assessment and treatment plus admission care for severely ill infants and children.Many of essential resources deemed necessary for the provision of emergency care for severely ill infants and children were readily available (e.g. drugs and laboratory services). However, only 4/8 hospitals had BVM for newborns; while nebulizer and MDI were not available in 2/8 hospitals. Only 3/8 hospitals had F-75 and ReSoMal. Moreover, there was no adequate triage system across any of the hospitals evaluated. Further, guidelines for neonatal resuscitation and management of malaria were available in 5/8 and in 7/8 hospitals, respectively; while those for child resuscitation and management of sepsis, pneumonia, dehydration and severe malnutrition were available in less than half of the hospitals evaluated.Our assessment provides evidence to inform new strategies to enhance the capacity of Rwandan district hospitals to provide pediatric advanced life support management. Identifying key gaps in the health care system is required in order to facilitate the implementation and scale up of ETAT+ in Rwanda. These findings also highlight a need to establish an outreach/mentoring program, embedded within the ongoing ETAT+ program, to promote cross-hospital learning exchanges."

Mups bind a variety of volatile ligands; these ligands, and Mup proteins themselves, influence numerous behavioral traits. Although urinary Mup protein levels vary between inbred mouse strains, this difference is most pronounced in BALB/cJ mice, which have dramatically low urinary Mup levels; this BALB/cJ trait had been mapped to a locus on chromosome 15. We previously identified Zhx2 (zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2) as a regulator of numerous liver-enriched genes. Zhx2 is located on chromosome 15, and a natural hypomorphic mutation in the BALB/cJ Zhx2 allele dramatically reduces Zhx2 expression. Based on these data, we hypothesized that reduced Zhx2 levels are responsible for lower Mup expression in BALB/cJ mice. Using both transgenic and knock-out mice along with in vitro assays, our data show that Zhx2 binds Mup promoters and is required for high levels of Mup expression in the adult liver. In contrast to previously identified Zhx2 targets that appear to be repressed by Zhx2, Mup genes are positively regulated by Zhx2.

However, the molecular basis for the gain of STAT1 function remains largely unclear. Here, we investigated the structural features of STAT1 GOF residues to better understand the impact of these pathogenic mutations. We constructed STAT1 alanine mutants of the α3 helix residues of the coiled-coil domain, which are frequently found in CMC pathogenic mutations, and measured their transcriptional activities. Most of the identified GOF residues were located inside the coiled-coil domain stem structure or at the protein surface of the anti-parallel dimer interface. Unlike those, Arg-274 was adjacent to the DNA-binding domain. In addition, Arg-274 was found to functionally interact with Gln-441 in the DNA-binding domain. Because Gln-441 is located at the anti-parallel dimer contact site, Gln-441 reorientation by Arg-274 mutation probably impedes formation of the dimer. Further, the statistical analysis of RNA-seq data with STAT1-deficient epithelial cells and primary T cells from a CMC patient revealed that the R274Q mutation affected gene expression levels of 66 and 76 non-overlapping RefSeq genes, respectively. Because their transcription levels were only slightly modulated by wild-type STAT1, we concluded that the R274Q mutation increased transcriptional activity but did not change dramatically the repertoire of STAT1 targets.

https://openalex.org/W2594067343,"Purpose Innovative laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) enables noninvasive evaluation of retinal microcirculation and the usefulness has been reported in the field of ophthalmology. LSFG has allowed us to measure the real time changes of retinal blood flow without pupillary dilatations and contrast media. Herein, we investigated the change of retinal blood flow in normal pregnant women during gestation using LSFG. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in 53 pregnant women who visited our institution between January, 2013 and July, 2014. Finally, a total of 41 participants without any obstetric complications were available for evaluation. Retinal blood flow was measured with LSFG in a total of 4 times during pregnancy (T1. 11–13 weeks, T2. 19–21 weeks, T3. 28–30 weeks, T4. 34–36 weeks) and mean blur rate (MBR), blowout score (BOS), flow acceleration index (FAI), and resistive index (RI) are analyzed from these measurements. Relations between LSFG parameters and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) are determined throughout pregnancy. Results MBR showed no significant changes throughout pregnancy. BOS showed a tendency to increase in the 3rd trimester. FAI values showed a slight increase from the 1st to 2nd trimester while a significant decrease was noted in the 3rd trimester. RI exhibited no changes between the 1st and 2nd trimesters, values decreased significantly after the 3rd trimester. MAP was positively correlated with BOS, and negatively correlated with FAI and RI. Conclusion The present study clearly demonstrated that profiles of LSFG parameters demonstrated a decrease of resistance in retinal blood vessels. These changes in indices provide a highly sensitive reflection of physiological changes in vascular resistance due to pregnancy. Thus, LSFG may be useful, as a non-invasive, diagnostic tool to detect pregnancy related disorders such as preeclampsia."

However, oligomerization of peroxisomal ABCD transporters is incompletely understood but is of potential significance because more complex oligomerization might lead to differences in substrate specificity. In this work, we have characterized the quaternary structure of the ABCD1 and ABCD2 proteins in the peroxisomal membrane. Using various biochemical approaches, we clearly demonstrate that both transporters exist as both homo- and heterotetramers, with a predominance of homotetramers. In addition to tetramers, some larger molecular ABCD assemblies were also found but represented only a minor fraction. By using quantitative co-immunoprecipitation assays coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we identified potential binding partners of ABCD2 involved in polyunsaturated fatty-acid metabolism. Interestingly, we identified calcium ATPases as ABCD2-binding partners, suggesting a role of ABCD2 in calcium signaling.

Specialists of neuroradiology and vascular neurosurgery decided over the modality assignment. We established a prospective data acquisition in both groups to detect significant differences within a follow-up time of one year. With this setting we evaluated the treatment methods over time and compared endovascular with microsurgical treatment.When compared to the earlier group, microsurgical treatment was less frequently chosen in the more recent collective because of neck-configuration. Endovascular treatment was chosen more frequently over time (31.9% versus 48.8%). Occurrence of initial symptomatic ischemic stroke was significantly lower in the clipping group compared to the endovascular group and remained stable over time. The number of reinterventions due to refilled treated aneurysms significantly decreased in the endovascular group at one-year follow-up, but the significantly better occlusion- and reintervention-rate of the microsurgical group persisted. The rebleeding rate in the endovascular group at one year follow-up decreased from 6.1% to 2.2% and showed no statistically significant difference to the microsurgical group, anymore (endovascular 2.2% versus microsurgical 0.0%, p = 0.11).Microsurgical clipping still has some advantages, however endovascular treatment is improving rapidly."

We previously showed that the Ig-like cell-adhesion molecule nectin-4 cis-interacts with the prolactin receptor through the extracellular region and stimulates prolactin-induced prolactin receptor activation and signaling, resulting in alveolar development in the mouse mammary gland. However, it remains unknown how this interaction stimulates these effects. We show here that the cis-interaction of the extracellular region of nectin-4 with the prolactin receptor was not sufficient for eliciting these effects and that the cytoplasmic region of nectin-4 was also required for this interaction. The cytoplasmic region of nectin-4 directly interacted with suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), but not SOCS3, JAK2, or STAT5a, and inhibited the interaction of SOCS1 with JAK2, eventually resulting in the increased phosphorylation of STAT5a. The juxtamembrane region of nectin-4 interacted with the Src homology 2 domain of SOCS1. Both the interaction of nectin-4 with the extracellular region of the prolactin receptor and the interaction of SOCS1 with the cytoplasmic region of nectin-4 were required for the stimulatory effect of nectin-4 on the prolactin-induced prolactin receptor activation.

Relish-N is then translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus for the expression of IMD-controlled genes. We previously demonstrated that transglutaminase (TG) suppresses the IMD pathway by polymerizing Relish-N to inhibit its nuclear translocation. Conversely, we also demonstrated that orally ingested synthetic amines, such as monodansylcadaverine (DCA) and biotin-labeled pentylamine, are TG-dependently incorporated into Relish-N, causing the nuclear translocation of modified Relish-N in gut epithelial cells. It remains unclear, however, whether polyamine-containing Relish-N retains transcriptional activity. Here, we used mass spectrometry analysis of a recombinant Relish-N modified with DCA by TG activity after proteolytic digestion and show that the DCA-modified Gln residues are located in the DNA-binding region of Relish-N. TG-catalyzed DCA incorporation inhibited binding of Relish-N to the Rel-responsive element in the NF-κB-binding DNA sequence. Subcellular fractionation of TG-expressing Drosophila S2 cells indicated that TG was localized in both the cytosol and nucleus. Of note, natural polyamines, including spermidine and spermine, competitively inhibited TG-dependent DCA incorporation into Relish-N. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that Relish-N was modified by spermine and that this modification reduced transcription of IMD pathway-controlled cecropin A1 and diptericin genes.

The transcriptional factor Relish, which is regulated by the IMD pathway, is endoproteolytically activated by Dredd, a homolog of mammalian caspase-8 (21.Stoven S. Silverman N. Junell A. Hedengren-Olcott M. Erturk D. Engstrom Y. Maniatis T. Hultmark D. Caspase-mediated processing of the Drosophila NF-κB factor Relish.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5991-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycans, Relish is converted to the N-terminal fragment (Relish-N) containing the Rel homology domain with transcriptional activity and the C-terminal fragment (Relish-C) containing an ankyrin-repeat domain that inhibits the nuclear translocation of Relish-N (Fig. 1A). We previously reported that the translocation of Relish-N from the cytosol into the nucleus is inhibited by TG-catalyzed protein-protein cross-linking in gut epithelial cells to promote immune tolerance against commensal bacteria, that full-length Relish must be proteolytically cleaved by Dredd before being cross-linked, and that the resulting Relish-N must be exposed by proteolytic conversion to become a suitable substrate for TG (13.Shibata T.

Transglutaminase-catalyzed protein-protein cross-linking suppresses the activity of the NF-κB-like transcription factor relish.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Conversely, synthetic amines, such as monodansylcadaverine (DCA) and biotin-labeled pentylamine, ingested by flies are TG-dependently incorporated into Relish-N, which inhibits protein-protein cross-linking of Relish-N and leads to the nuclear translocation of Relish-N modified with the amines as well as native Relish-N (13.Shibata T. Sekihara S. Fujikawa T. Miyaji R. Maki K. Ishihara T. Koshiba T. Kawabata S. Transglutaminase-catalyzed protein-protein cross-linking suppresses the activity of the NF-κB-like transcription factor relish.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether the amine-incorporated Relish-N retains transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Natural polyamines, such as spermidine and spermine, are ubiquitously present in organisms and are involved in critically important intracellular functions, such as gene transcription, cellular growth, and differentiation (22.Pegg A.E. Mammalian polyamine metabolism and function.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23.Gao J.H. Guo L.J. Huang Z.Y. Rao J.N. Tang C.W.

Mini-review: polyamines metabolism, toxicity and potent therapeutical use.Antiinfect. Agents. 2014; 12: 95-103Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of these polyamines on TG-dependent regulation of the transcriptional activity of a recombinant Relish-N (rRelish-N) expressed in Escherichia coli. Moreover, TG-dependent polyamine incorporation into native Relish-N and the effects of the modification on the transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes controlled by the IMD pathway were also examined in vivo. We previously demonstrated that Drosophila TG catalyzes the cross-linking of Relish-N to suppress antimicrobial production (13.Shibata T. Sekihara S. Fujikawa T. Miyaji R. Maki K. Ishihara T. Koshiba T. Kawabata S. Transglutaminase-catalyzed protein-protein cross-linking suppresses the activity of the NF-κB-like transcription factor relish.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To confirm whether rRelish-N, as shown in Fig. 1A, functions as a substrate for TG, rRelish-N was incubated with a recombinant TG (rTG) in the presence of DCA, and the fluorescence of the DCA-incorporated rRelish was detected by UV illumination. DCA was incorporated into rRelish-N in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). In Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB)-stained gels, the amount of rRelish-N protein decreased depending on the incubation time because a part of rRelish-N was transformed into high-molecular-weight polymers through TG-dependent protein-protein cross-linking as shown in the following experiments. In addition, the incorporation of DCA into rRelish-N was equivalent to that into N,N′-dimethylcasein, which is a standard TG substrate, indicating that rRelish-N is a proper substrate for TG and equivalent to N,N′-dimethylcasein (Fig. 1D). In the present study, rRelish-N was tagged with GST derived from Schistosoma japonicum at its N terminus because human GST is a known substrate of TG2 (25.Piredda L. Farrace M.G. Lo Bello M. Malorni W. Melino G. Petruzzelli R. Piacentini M. Identification of ‘tissue’ transglutaminase binding proteins in neural cells committed to apoptosis.FASEB J. 1999; 13: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To confirm that the GST tag in rRelish-N is not a target of Drosophila TG, rRelish-N was cleaved by PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare), and the resulting proteins were incubated with rTG in the presence of DCA. As a result, DCA was only incorporated into rRelish-N, clearly indicating that rRelish-N, but not the GST tag, is a substrate for TG (Fig. 2, A and B). We previously reported that rRelish-N expressed in Drosophila S2 cells is cross-linked by TG to form a high-molecular-weight polymer (13.Shibata T. Sekihara S. Fujikawa T. Miyaji R. Maki K. Ishihara T. Koshiba T. Kawabata S. Transglutaminase-catalyzed protein-protein cross-linking suppresses the activity of the NF-κB-like transcription factor relish.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine whether rRelish-N can form a homopolymer in vitro, rRelish-N and rTG were incubated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The high-molecular-weight bands were clearly detected by anti-His tag antibody depending on the incubation time (Fig. 3A, upper panel) but not by anti-TG antibody (Fig. 3A, lower panel), indicating that rRelish-N forms TG-dependent covalent homopolymers. We also previously reported that the full-length Relish must be proteolytically cleaved by Dredd to release Relish-N, leading to the exposure of Gln or Lys residues on Relish-N for TG-dependent cross-linking (13.Shibata T. Sekihara S. Fujikawa T. Miyaji R. Maki K. Ishihara T. Koshiba T. Kawabata S. Transglutaminase-catalyzed protein-protein cross-linking suppresses the activity of the NF-κB-like transcription factor relish.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal portion of Relish, Relish-C, contains an ankyrin-repeat domain that inhibits the dimerization of Relish-N (16.Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A.

To examine the inhibitory effects of Relish-C on the protein-protein cross-linking of Relish-N, rRelish-N was incubated with rTG in the presence of rRelish-C. In Western blotting, the intensity of the monomer band of rRelish-N in the absence of rRelish-C was increased ∼65% by the addition of an equimolar concentration of rRelish-C (Fig. 3, B and C) and increased dramatically depending on the dose increase of rRelish-C (Fig. 3D), indicating that rRelish-C interacts with rRelish-N through masking TG-dependent cross-linking sites on rRelish-N. To determine whether rRelish-C itself has an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking activity of rTG, TG-dependent DCA incorporation into dimethylcasein was measured in the presence of rRelish-C (Fig. 3E). The band intensity of DCA-incorporated dimethylcasein on SDS-PAGE was not affected by increasing concentrations of rRelish-C, indicating that the blocking mechanism of TG-dependent rRelish-N polymerization is due to the presence of rRelish-C at the rRelish-N cross-linking sites. In mammals, inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB), a mammalian homolog of Relish-C, is a substrate of TG2, and the TG2-catalyzed cross-linking sites have been identified by mass spectrometry (26.Park S.S. Kim J.M. Kim D.S. Kim I.H. Kim S.Y. Transglutaminase 2 mediates polymer formation of I-κBα through C-terminal glutamine cluster.J. Biol.

To identify the amine-incorporation sites of Relish-N, rRelish-N was incubated with rTG in the presence of DCA, and DCA-incorporated Gln residues were determined by mass spectrometry after proteolytic digestion (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). In total, 58 peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic or chymotryptic digestion of DCA-modified rRelish-N, covering 90% of the whole sequence of Relish-N (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). Six Gln residues in rRelish-N were identified as DCA incorporation sites, including Gln157, Gln219, Gln275, Gln285, Gln287, and Gln304 (Table 3). Interestingly, the modified Gln residues were all located in the Rel homology domain of Relish-N, functioning as the binding site for the κB site of target genes (Fig. 4A).Table 1Mass spectrometry of trypsin-digested peptidesMassΔMassAmino acidsExpected peptideMeasuredCalculatedDaDa2641.0982641.102−0.00414–38K↓NVMFMNDASSTSGYSSSTSPNSTNR↓S956.471956.472−0.00139–47R↓SFSPAHSPK↓T748.434748.4340.000148–153K↓HVPQLR↓I1243.6921243.693−0.001154–163R↓IVEQPVEKFR↓F1916.8781916.880−0.002166–183R↓YKSEMHGTHGSLNGANSK↓R1950.9481950.951−0.003188–204K↓TFPEVTLCNYDGPAVIR↓C2237.0972237.101−0.004205–223R↓CSLFQTNLDSPHSHQLVVR↓K1806.7941806.796−0.002225–239K↓DDRDVCDPHDLHVSK↓E1761.9211761.924−0.003242–257R↓GYVAQFINMGIIHTAK↓K1228.6161228.616−0.001258–266K↓KYIFEELCK↓K1305.6591305.661−0.002269–278K↓QDRLVFQMNR↓R1409.6881409.690−0.002285–295K↓QLQELHQETER↓E988.476988.4760.000299–306K↓DMNLNQVR↓L913.437913.4370.000307–313R↓LCFEAFK↓I2537.3022537.303−0.001314–336K↓IEDNGAWVPLAPPVYSNAINNRK↓S1228.6881228.689−0.001337–347K↓SAQTGELRIVR↓L2112.1472112.150−0.003348–367R↓LSKPTGGVMGNDELILLVEK↓V2319.0282319.033−0.005375–393K↓VRFFEEDEDGETVWEAYAK↓F2171.0092171.011−0.002396–413R↓ESDVHHQYAIVCQTPPYK↓D1945.9731945.975−0.002420–435R↓EVNVYIELIRPSDDER↓S933.507933.5070.000436–443R↓SFPALPFR↓Y659.397659.3970.000448–453R↓SVIVSR↓K2225.9862225.988−0.003458–480R↓TGSSANSSSSGTESSNNSLDLPK↓T1733.8351733.837−0.002508–521R↓EKHLNEFIASEDFR↓K1411.7291411.731−0.002522–533R↓KLIEHNSSDLEK↓I Open table in a new tab Table 2Mass spectrometry of chymotrypsin-digested peptidesMassΔMassAmino acidsExpected peptideMeasuredCalculatedDaDa1222.4741222.4630.0111–9-↓MNMNQYYDL↓D + 2 oxidation (Met)1151.5271151.528−0.0018–17Y↓DLDNGKNVMF↓M1031.3871031.3870.00018–27F↓MNDASSTSGY↓S1370.6061370.6060.00028–40Y↓SSSTSPNSTNRSF↓S1687.7881687.7880.00041–55F↓SPAHSPKTMELQTDF↓A2175.0122175.017−0.00556–76F↓ANLNLPGGNSPHQPPMANSPY↓Q1470.7271470.7250.00277–89Y↓QNQLLNNGGICQL↓G1279.6381279.641−0.00290–102L↓GATNLINSTGVSF↓G1258.5641258.565−0.001103–114F↓GVANVTSFGNMY↓M1157.4271157.4270.000111–119F↓GNMYMDHQY↓F1470.7501470.751−0.001120–133Y↓FVPAPATVPPSQNF↓G787.361787.3610.000134–140F↓GYHQNGL↓A1182.5451182.545−0.001167–177Y↓KSEMHGTHGSL↓N1670.7531670.755−0.002195–208L↓CNYDGPAVIRCSLF↓Q1837.8711837.874−0.003221–235L↓VVRKDDRDVCDPHDL↓H974.493974.4930.000236–243L↓HVSKERGY↓V1387.7631387.765−0.001248–259F↓INMGIIHTAKKY↓I981.523981.524−0.001282–289L↓SHKQLQEL↓H628.366628.3660.000303–307L↓NQVRL↓C1767.9181767.920−0.002313–328F↓KIEDNGAWVPLAPPVY↓S1601.8121601.8120.000329–343Y↓SNAINNRKSAQTGEL↓R1658.8541658.855−0.001349–364L↓SKPTGGVMGNDELILL↓V + oxidation (Met)1515.7221515.7220.000392–403Y↓AKFRESDVHHQY↓A1047.5051047.506−0.001404–412Y↓AIVCQTPPY↓K1478.7361478.7370.000413–424Y↓KDKDVDREVNVY↓I685.401685.4010.000477–482L↓DLPKTL↓G1189.6451189.6460.000483–494L↓GLAQPPNGLPNL↓S1077.5811077.582−0.001515–523F↓IASEDFRKL↓I Open table in a new tab Table 3Dansylated peptidesMassΔMassAmino acidsExpected peptideMeasuredCalculatedDaDa1989.0881989.0870.001148–161K↓HVPQLRIVEQPVEK↓F + DCA (Gln)1693.7851693.788−0.003209–220F↓QTNLDSPHSHQL↓V + DCA (Gln)1240.6071240.610−0.003272–278R↓LVFQMNR↓R + DCA (Gln), oxidation (Met)2045.9782045.9700.008285–295K↓QLQELHQETER↓E + 2 DCA (Gln)1306.6151306.616−0.002299–306K↓DMNLNQVR↓L + DCA (Gln) Open table in a new tab To assess the mechanism underlying the specificity of the identified Gln residues for TG-dependent cross-linking of rRelish-N, all six Gln residues were mutated to Asn residues (rRelish-N6QN). The expression of rRelish-N6QN, however, was too low to be used for the experiments. Fortunately, rRelish-N5QN with five Gln-to-Asn replacements at Gln157, Gln275, Gln285, Gln287, and Gln304 was successfully prepared. rRelish-N5QN was incubated with rTG in the presence of DCA and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The DCA incorporation into rRelish-N5QN was strongly inhibited by the mutations, and the fluorescence intensity of the band of DCA-incorporated rRelish-N5QN was ∼30% that of wild-type rRelish-N (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, the amount of homopolymers of rRelish-N5QN cross-linked by rTG was reduced to an undetectable level (Fig. 4D), and the ratio of Relish-N monomers to Relish-N polymers in Western blotting was significantly higher in rRelish-N5QN than in rRelish-N (Fig. 4E), indicating a loss of the reactivity of rRelish-N5QN against the TG-dependent protein-protein cross-linking. These results demonstrated that the Gln residues identified by LC-MS/MS analysis are fairly specific for TG-dependent cross-linking in rRelish-N.

To confirm the subcellular localization of TG in Drosophila, rTG was expressed in S2 cells with no detectable endogenous TG antigen, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared. Analysis of the relative intensity of the rTG band by Western blotting indicated that the amount of rTG in the nucleus was approximately half that in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that Drosophila TG works not only in the cytosol but also in the nucleus. DCA- or biotin-pentylamine-incorporated Relish-N is translocated into the nucleus in gut epithelial cells, but whether the amine-incorporated Relish-N retains transcriptional activity in the nucleus is unknown (13.Shibata T.

To evaluate the DNA-binding ability of rRelish-N cross-linked with DCA, rRelish-N treated with 5 mm DCA was incubated with the biotinylated κB oligonucleotide, and the protein-oligonucleotide complex was collected using streptavidin-immobilized agarose. The amount of κB-bound rRelish-N was significantly decreased only when incubated with rTG and DCA (Fig. 5, C and D). To confirm that the decrease in the binding activity of DCA-treated rRelish-N to the κB oligonucleotide was not caused by TG-dependent protein-protein cross-linking of rRelish-N, rRelish-N was incubated with rTG in different concentrations of DCA and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The polymer band of rRelish-N on SDS-PAGE disappeared at 5 mm DCA (Fig. 5E), indicating that the protein-protein cross-linking of rRelish-N by rTG was almost completely inhibited under these conditions. Polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, are natural substrates for TG (32.Folk J.E. Park M.H. Chung S.I. Schrode J. Lester E.P. Cooper H.L.

https://openalex.org/W2592612121,"Phenol- and naphthalene-degrading indigenous Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain C70 has great potential for the bioremediation of polluted areas. It harbours two chromosomally located catechol meta pathways, one of which is structurally and phylogenetically very similar to the Pseudomonas sp. CF600 dmp operon and the other to the P. stutzeri AN10 nah lower operon. The key enzymes of the catechol meta pathway, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) from strain C70, PheB and NahH, have an amino acid identity of 85%. The metabolic and regulatory phenotypes of the wild-type and the mutant strain C70ΔpheB lacking pheB were evaluated. qRT-PCR data showed that in C70, the expression of pheB- and nahH-encoded C23O was induced by phenol and salicylate, respectively. We demonstrate that strain C70 is more effective in the degradation of phenol and salicylate, especially at higher substrate concentrations, when these compounds are present as a mixture; i.e., when both pathways are expressed. Moreover, NahH is able to substitute for the deleted PheB in phenol degradation when salicylate is also present in the growth medium. The appearance of a yellow intermediate 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde was followed by the accumulation of catechol in salicylate-containing growth medium, and lower expression levels and specific activities of the C23O of the sal operon were detected. However, the excretion of the toxic intermediate catechol to the growth medium was avoided when the growth medium was supplemented with phenol, seemingly due to the contribution of the second meta pathway encoded by the phe genes."
https://openalex.org/W2594169773,"The Jiangxi Province of China has numerous native domestic chicken breeds, including some black skin breeds. The genetic diversity of Jiangxi native chickens is largely unknown, and specifically, the genetic contribution of the grey junglefowl to black skin chickens is not well understood. To address these questions, the complete D-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and beta-carotene dioxygenase 2(BCDO2)gene was sequenced in a total of 209 chickens representing seven Jiangxi native breeds. Thirty-one polymorphic sites were identified across the complete mtDNA D-loop region sequence. Twenty-three haplotypes were observed in the seven breeds, which belonged to four distinct mitochondrial clades (A, B, C and E). Clade A and B were dominant in the chickens with a frequency of approximately 67.9%. There were five SNPs that defined two haplotypes, W and Y in BCDO2. Four breeds had one haplotype and three breeds had two. We conclude that Jiangxi native chicken breeds have relatively low genetic diversity and likely share four common maternal lineages from two different maternal ancestors of junglefowl. Furthermore, some Jiangxi chicken populations may have been mixed with chickens with exotic lineage. Further research should be established to protect these domestic chicken resources."
https://openalex.org/W3122185679,"This study investigates patterns of lay perception of economics, and in particular the place of conspiratorial thinking regarding the economic domain. We devised four types of accounts in the economic domain, over a range of questions regarding different aspects of the economy: the classical neo-liberal economic view (which we labeled Econ101), and the Conspiracy view (the destructive outcomes of economy are due to small and powerful groups who are manipulating the markets), to which we added the Government malfunction view (failures in the economy are due to the authorities), and the Bad Invisible Hand view (the invisible hand may go wrong, and the equilibrium reached by its doings may be undesirable). The last two views are the ones most strongly endorsed by our respondents, in the US, Israel and Switzerland. The pattern of inter-correlations between the four accounts, and that between each and the psycho-social variables we examined, exhibits two clusters, Econ101 vs. the other three views of economy. This corresponds to a general opposition between people who trust the neoliberal economic system, and those opposed to it. What sets economic conspiratorial thinking apart are its links with other conspirational beliefs and with paranormal beliefs."

A standardized questionnaire concerning former and present pregnancies was developed and linear regression analysis was used to correlate pathogen detection with pregnancy outcome. Ureaplasmas were the most prevalent of the tested pathogens (positive in 90.5% positive women and 47.5% newborns), followed by mycoplasmas (32.5% and 7.5%), chlamydia (14.5% and 7.5%), trichomonas (8.5% and 4.0%) and gonococcus (0.5% and 0%). CMV was found in 46.5% of the pregnant women and in 10.5% of their newborns, whereas HSV-2 was detected in only two mothers. Multiple regression analyses indicate that colonization of the mothers with U. urealyticum, M. hominis, T. vaginalis or CMV is associated with transmission to newborns and that transmission of M. hominis or CMV from Mongolian pregnant women to offspring is associated with reduced neonatal length and gestational age. Thus, diagnostic tests for their detection should be implemented in the clinical settings in Mongolia."
https://openalex.org/W2593781894,"Chemical exposure assessments are based on information collected via different methods, such as biomonitoring, personal monitoring, environmental monitoring and questionnaires. The vast amount of chemical-specific exposure information available from web-based databases, such as PubMed, is undoubtedly a great asset to the scientific community. However, manual retrieval of relevant published information is an extremely time consuming task and overviewing the data is nearly impossible. Here, we present the development of an automatic classifier for chemical exposure information. First, nearly 3700 abstracts were manually annotated by an expert in exposure sciences according to a taxonomy exclusively created for exposure information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used to extract semantic and syntactic features relevant to chemical exposure text. Using these features, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm to automatically classify PubMed abstracts according to the exposure taxonomy. The resulting classifier demonstrates good performance in the intrinsic evaluation. We also show that the classifier improves information retrieval of chemical exposure data compared to keyword-based PubMed searches. Case studies demonstrate that the classifier can be used to assist researchers by facilitating information retrieval and classification, enabling data gap recognition and overviewing available scientific literature using chemical-specific publication profiles. Finally, we identify challenges to be addressed in future development of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2591607502,"The planting of 162 ha of transgenic glyphosate-resistant creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) near Madras, OR, USA, allowed a unique opportunity to study gene flow over time from a perennial outcrossing species at the landscape level. While conducting a four year in situ survey, we collected panicles and leaf tissue samples from creeping bentgrass and its sexually compatible species. Seeds from the panicles were planted, and seedlings were tested in the greenhouse for expression of the transgene. Gene flow via pollen was found in all four years, at frequencies of 0.004 to 2.805%. Chloroplast markers, in combination with internal transcribed spacer nuclear sequence analysis, were used to aid in identification of transgenic interspecific and intergeneric hybrid seedlings found during the testing and of established plants that could not be positively identified in the field. Interspecific transgenic hybrids produced on redtop (Agrostis gigantea) plants in situ were identified three of the four years and one intergeneric transgenic creeping bentgrass x rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis) hybrid was identified in 2005. In addition, we confirmed a non-transgenic creeping bentgrass x redtop hybrid in situ, demonstrating that interspecific hybrids have established in the environment outside production fields. Results of this study should be considered for deregulation of transgenic events, studies of population dynamics, and prediction of gene flow in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2592269420,"Objectives There are multifaceted views on the use of ketamine, a potentially addictive substance, to treat mental health problems. The past 15 years have seen growing media coverage of ketamine for medical and other purposes. This study examined the print news media coverage of medical and other uses of ketamine in North America to determine orientations and trends over time. Methods Print newspaper coverage of ketamine from 2000 to 2015 was reviewed, resulting in 43 print news articles from 28 North American newspapers. A 55-item structured coding instrument was applied to assess news reports of ketamine. Items captured negative and positive aspects, therapeutic use of ketamine, and adverse side effects. Chi-squares tested for changes in trends over time. Results In the 15-year reviewed period, the three most frequent themes related to ketamine were: abuse (68.2%), legal status (34.1%), and clinical use in anesthesia (31.8%). There was significant change in trends during two periods (2000–2007 and 2008–2015). In 2008–2015, print news media articles were significantly more likely to encourage clinical use of ketamine to treat depression (p = 0.002), to treat treatment resistant depression (p = 0.043), and to claim that ketamine is more effective than conventional antidepressants (p = 0.043). Conclusions Our review found consistent positive changes in the portrayals of ketamine by the print news media as a therapeutic antidepressant that mirror the recent scientific publications. These changes in news media reporting might influence the popularity of ketamine use to treat clinical depression. Guidance is required for journalists on objective reporting of medical research findings, including limitations of current research evidence and potential risks of ketamine."
https://openalex.org/W2592955563,"As climate change is expected to have a significant impact on species distributions, there is an urgent challenge to provide reliable information to guide conservation biodiversity policies. In addressing this challenge, we propose a remote sensing-based approach to forecast the future habitat quality for European badger, a species not abundant and at risk of local extinction in the arid environments of southeastern Spain, by incorporating environmental variables related with the ecosystem functioning and correlated with climate and land use. Using ensemble prediction methods, we designed global spatial distribution models for the distribution range of badger using presence-only data and climate variables. Then, we constructed regional models for an arid region in the southeast Spain using EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) derived variables and weighting the pseudo-absences with the global model projections applied to this region. Finally, we forecast the badger potential spatial distribution in the time period 2071–2099 based on IPCC scenarios incorporating the uncertainty derived from the predicted values of EVI-derived variables. By including remotely sensed descriptors of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of ecosystem functioning into spatial distribution models, results suggest that future forecast is less favorable for European badgers than not including them. In addition, change in spatial pattern of habitat suitability may become higher than when forecasts are based just on climate variables. Since the validity of future forecast only based on climate variables is currently questioned, conservation policies supported by such information could have a biased vision and overestimate or underestimate the potential changes in species distribution derived from climate change. The incorporation of ecosystem functional attributes derived from remote sensing in the modeling of future forecast may contribute to the improvement of the detection of ecological responses under climate change scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2594369172,"Domestication has altered a variety of traits within the Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), including phenotypic, physiological and behavioral traits of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). Little is known, however, about the genetic changes between domesticated and wild Eurasian perch. In this study, we assembled a high-quality de novo reference transcriptome and identified differentially expressed genes between wild and domesticated Eurasian perch. A total of 113,709 transcripts were assembled, and 58,380 transcripts were annotated. Transcriptomic comparison revealed 630 differentially expressed genes between domesticated and wild Eurasian perch. Within domesticated Eurasian perch there were 412 genes that were up-regulated including MHCI, MHCII, chia, ighm within immune system development. There were 218 genes including try1, ctrl, ctrb, cela3b, cpa1 and cpb1, which were down-regulated that were associated with digestive processes. Our results indicated domestication drives the changes of immune and digestive system of Eurasian perch. Our study not only provide valuable genetic resources for further studies in Eurasian perch, but also provide novel insights into the genetic basis of physiological changes in Eurasian perch during domestication process."
https://openalex.org/W2594224298,"The development of plasmid-mediated gene expression control in bacteria revolutionized the field of bacteriology. Many of these expression control systems rely on the addition of small molecules, generally metabolites or non-metabolized analogs thereof, to the growth medium to induce expression of the genes of interest. The paradigmatic example of an expression control system is the lac system from Escherichia coli, which typically relies on the Ptac promoter and the Lac repressor, LacI. In many cases, however, constitutive gene expression is desired, and other experimental approaches require the coordinated control of multiple genes. While multiple systems have been developed for use in E. coli and its close relatives, the utility and/or functionality of these tools does not always translate to other species. For example, for the Gram-negative pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of Legionnaires’ Disease, the aforementioned Ptac system represents the only well-established expression control system. In order to enhance the tools available to study bacterial gene expression in L. pneumophila, we developed a plasmid, pON.mCherry, which confers constitutive gene expression from a mutagenized LacI binding site. We demonstrate that pON.mCherry neither interferes with other plasmids harboring an intact LacI-Ptac expression system nor alters the growth of Legionella species during intracellular growth. Furthermore, the broad-host range plasmid backbone of pON.mCherry allows constitutive gene expression in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacterial species, making pON.mCherry a useful tool for the greater research community."
https://openalex.org/W2593608808,"We examined the epiphytic microbiome of cereal grain using the universal barcode chaperonin-60 (cpn60). Microbial community profiling of seed washes containing DNA extracts prepared from field-grown cereal grain detected sequences from a fungus identified only to Class Sordariomycetes. To identify the fungal sequence and to improve the reference database, we determined cpn60 sequences from field-collected and reference strains of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. These data allowed us to identify this fungal sequence as deriving from C. purpurea, and suggested that C. purpurea DNA is readily detectable on agricultural commodities, including those for which ergot was not identified as a grading factor. To get a sense of the prevalence and level of C. purpurea DNA in cereal grains, we developed a quantitative PCR assay based on the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and applied it to 137 samples from the 2014 crop year. The amount of Claviceps DNA quantified correlated strongly with the proportion of ergot sclerotia identified in each grain lot, although there was evidence that non-target organisms were responsible for some false positives with the ITS-based assay. We therefore developed a cpn60-targeted loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay and applied it to the same grain wash samples. The time to positive displayed a significant, inverse correlation to ergot levels determined by visual ratings. These results indicate that both laboratory-based and field-adaptable molecular diagnostic assays can be used to detect and quantify pathogen load in bulk commodities using cereal grain washes."
https://openalex.org/W2594758761,"While enteric bacteria have been shown to play a critical role in other forms of intestinal damage, their role in mediating the response to the chemotherapeutic drug Doxorubicin (Doxo) is unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of intestinal bacterial depletion to evaluate the role enteric bacteria play in mediating Doxo-induced small intestinal damage and, more specifically, in mediating chemokine expression and leukocyte infiltration following Doxo treatment. An understanding of this pathway may allow for development of intervention strategies to reduce chemotherapy-induced small intestinal damage.Mice were treated with (Abx) or without (NoAbx) oral antibiotics in drinking water for four weeks and then with Doxo. Jejunal tissues were collected at various time points following Doxo treatment and stained and analyzed for apoptosis, crypt damage and restitution, and macrophage and neutrophil number. In addition, RNA expression of inflammatory markers (TNFα, IL1-β, IL-10) and cytokines (CCL2, CC7, KC) was assessed by qRT-PCR.In NoAbx mice Doxo-induced damage was associated with rapid induction of apoptosis in jejunal crypt epithelium and an increase weight loss and crypt loss. In addition, we observed an increase in immune-modulating chemokines CCL2, CCL7 and KC and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. In contrast, while still positive for induction of apoptosis following Doxo treatment, Abx mice showed neither the overall weight loss nor crypt loss seen in NoAbx mice nor the increased chemokine expression and leukocyte infiltration.Enteric bacteria play a critical role in Doxo-induced small intestinal damage and are associated with an increase in immune-modulating chemokines and cells. Manipulation of enteric bacteria or the damage pathway may allow for prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced small intestinal damage."
https://openalex.org/W2592054882,"Hybridisation can produce evolutionary novelty by increasing fitness and adaptive capacity. Heterosis, or hybrid vigour, has been documented in many plant and animal taxa, and is a notable consequence of hybridisation that has been exploited for decades in agriculture and aquaculture. On the contrary, loss of fitness in naturally occurring hybrid taxa has been observed in many cases. This can have negative consequences for the parental species involved (wasted reproductive effort), and has raised concerns for species conservation. This study evaluates the relative fitness of previously documented butterflyfish hybrids of the genus Chaetodon from the Indo-Pacific suture zone at Christmas Island. Histological examination confirmed the reproductive viability of Chaetodon hybrids. Examination of liver lipid content showed that hybrid body condition was not significantly different from parent species body condition. Lastly, size at age data revealed no difference in growth rates and asymptotic length between hybrids and parent species. Based on the traits measured in this study, naturally occurring hybrids of Chaetodon butterflyfishes have similar fitness to their parental species, and are unlikely to supplant parental species under current environmental conditions at the suture zone. However, given sufficient fitness and ongoing genetic exchange between the respective parental species, hybrids are likely to persist within the suture zone."
https://openalex.org/W2594453696,"Objective To evaluate the changes in the jaws and the upper airways of unilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis patients who underwent condylar reconstruction via autogenous coronoid process grafts using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Study design The 27 included patients underwent CBCT examinations at three stages: T0 (within two weeks before surgery), T1 (two weeks after surgery), and T2 (an average of 13 months after surgery). Forty items related to the maxillofacial hard tissues and the upper airway collected at the three times and the coronoid process graft volumes after surgery were compared. Results Some integral items related to the mandibular hard tissues exhibited statistical difference shortly after surgery. Some integral items related to maxillofacial hard tissues changing obviously long period after surgery may result from graft remodeling. Asymmetry-related item regarding local neo-condyle and some airway items were significantly different between T0 and T1. Due to variations in graft remodeling, some related local asymmetry items and airway items differed significantly between T0 and T2. Conclusions Anteriorly and inferiorly located neo-condyles and a trend toward the pronation of the mandible were observed and the narrowness of the upper airway was improved shortly after surgery. The grafts remodeled differently and some integral and asymmetry items related to neo-condyle changed. The improvements in the upper airway were slightly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2592176911,"Retinal OFF bipolar cells show distinct connectivity patterns with photoreceptors in the wild-type mouse retina. Some types are cone-specific while others penetrate further through the outer plexiform layer (OPL) to contact rods in addition to cones. To explore dendritic stratification of OFF bipolar cells in the absence of rods, we made use of the ‘cone-full’ Nrl-/- mouse retina in which all photoreceptor precursor cells commit to a cone fate including those which would have become rods in wild-type retinas. The dendritic distribution of OFF bipolar cell types was investigated by confocal and electron microscopic imaging of immunolabeled tissue sections. The cells’ dendrites formed basal contacts with cone terminals and expressed the corresponding glutamate receptor subunits at those sites, indicating putative synapses. All of the four analyzed cell populations showed distinctive patterns of vertical dendritic invasion through the OPL. This disparate behavior of dendritic extension in an environment containing only cone terminals demonstrates type-dependent specificity for dendritic outgrowth in OFF bipolar cells: rod terminals are not required for inducing dendritic extension into distal areas of the OPL."
https://openalex.org/W2592738355,"Investigating the role and interplay between individual proteins in biological processes is often performed by assessing the functional consequences of gene inactivation or removal. Depending on the sensitivity of the assay used for determining phenotype, between 66% (growth) and 53% (gene expression) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion strains show no defect when analyzed under a single condition. Although it is well known that this non-responsive behavior is caused by different types of redundancy mechanisms or by growth condition/cell type dependency, it is not known what the relative contribution of these different causes is. Understanding the underlying causes of and their relative contribution to non-responsive behavior upon genetic perturbation is extremely important for designing efficient strategies aimed at elucidating gene function and unraveling complex cellular systems. Here, we provide a systematic classification of the underlying causes of and their relative contribution to non-responsive behavior upon gene deletion. The overall contribution of redundancy to non-responsive behavior is estimated at 29%, of which approximately 17% is due to homology-based redundancy and 12% is due to pathway-based redundancy. The major determinant of non-responsiveness is condition dependency (71%). For approximately 14% of protein complexes, just-in-time assembly can be put forward as a potential mechanistic explanation for how proteins can be regulated in a condition dependent manner. Taken together, the results underscore the large contribution of growth condition requirement to non-responsive behavior, which needs to be taken into account for strategies aimed at determining gene function. The classification provided here, can also be further harnessed in systematic analyses of complex cellular systems."
https://openalex.org/W2592647098,"Antibody therapeutics offer effective treatment options for a broad range of diseases. One of the greatest benefits of antibody therapeutics is their extraordinarily long serum half-life, allowing infrequent dosing with long-lasting effects. A characteristic of antibodies that drives long half-life is the ability to interact with the recycling receptor, FcRn, in a pH-dependent manner. The benefit of long half-life, however, carries with it liabilities. Although the positive effects of antibody therapeutics are long-lasting, any acute adverse events or chronic negative impacts, such as immunosuppression in the face of an infection, are also long-lasting. Therefore, we sought to develop antibodies with a chemical handle that alone would enjoy the long half-life of normal antibodies but, upon addition of a small-molecule antidote, would interact with the chemical handle and inhibit the antibody recycling mechanism, thus leading to rapid degradation and shortened half-life in vivo. Here we present a proof of concept study where we identify sites to incorporate a non-natural amino acid that can be chemically modified to modulate FcRn interaction in vitro and antibody half-life in vivo. This is an important first step in developing safer therapeutics, and the next step will be development of technology that can perform the modifying chemistry in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2593588708,"Although the role of T cells in autoimmunity has been explored for many years, the mechanisms leading to the initial priming of an autoimmune T cell response remain enigmatic. The ‘hit and run’ model suggests that self-antigens released upon cell death can provide the initial signal for a self-sustaining autoimmune response. Using a novel transgenic mouse model where we could induce the release of self-antigens via caspase-dependent apoptosis. We tracked the fate of CD8+ T cells specific for the self-antigen. Our studies demonstrated that antigens released from apoptotic cells were cross-presented by CD11c+ cells in the draining lymph node. This cross-presentation led to proliferation of self-antigen specific T cells, followed by a transient ability to produce IFN-γ, but did not lead to the development of autoimmune diabetes. Using this model we examined the consequences on T cell immunity when apoptosis was combined with dendritic cell maturation signals, an autoimmune susceptible genetic background, and the deletion of Tregs. The results of our study demonstrate that autoimmune diabetes cannot be initiated by the presentation of antigens released from apoptotic cells in vivo even in the presence of factors known to promote autoimmunity."
