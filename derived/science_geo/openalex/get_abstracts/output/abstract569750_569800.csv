https://openalex.org/W2525811471,"Networks of organic chemical reactions are important in life and probably played a central part in its origin. Network dynamics regulate cell division, circadian rhythms, nerve impulses and chemotaxis, and guide the development of organisms. Although out-of-equilibrium networks of chemical reactions have the potential to display emergent network dynamics such as spontaneous pattern formation, bistability and periodic oscillations, the principles that enable networks of organic reactions to develop complex behaviours are incompletely understood. Here we describe a network of biologically relevant organic reactions (amide formation, thiolate-thioester exchange, thiolate-disulfide interchange and conjugate addition) that displays bistability and oscillations in the concentrations of organic thiols and amides. Oscillations arise from the interaction between three subcomponents of the network: an autocatalytic cycle that generates thiols and amides from thioesters and dialkyl disulfides; a trigger that controls autocatalytic growth; and inhibitory processes that remove activating thiol species that are produced during the autocatalytic cycle. In contrast to previous studies that have demonstrated oscillations and bistability using highly evolved biomolecules (enzymes and DNA) or inorganic molecules of questionable biochemical relevance (for example, those used in Belousov-Zhabotinskii-type reactions), the organic molecules we use are relevant to metabolism and similar to those that might have existed on the early Earth. By using small organic molecules to build a network of organic reactions with autocatalytic, bistable and oscillatory behaviour, we identify principles that explain the ways in which dynamic networks relevant to life could have developed. Modifications of this network will clarify the influence of molecular structure on the dynamics of reaction networks, and may enable the design of biomimetic networks and of synthetic self-regulating and evolving chemical systems."

https://openalex.org/W2527599582,"Deubiquitinases are important components of the protein degradation regulatory network. We report the discovery of ML364, a small molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinase USP2 and its use to interrogate the biology of USP2 and its putative substrate cyclin D1. ML364 has an IC50 of 1.1 μm in a biochemical assay using an internally quenched fluorescent di-ubiquitin substrate. Direct binding of ML364 to USP2 was demonstrated using microscale thermophoresis. ML364 induced an increase in cellular cyclin D1 degradation and caused cell cycle arrest as shown in Western blottings and flow cytometry assays utilizing both Mino and HCT116 cancer cell lines. ML364, and not the inactive analog 2, was antiproliferative in cancer cell lines. Consistent with the role of cyclin D1 in DNA damage response, ML364 also caused a decrease in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. These effects by a small molecule inhibitor support a key role for USP2 as a regulator of cell cycle, DNA repair, and tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2526418622,"As part of the German Barcode of Life campaign, over 3500 arachnid specimens have been collected and analyzed: ca. 3300 Araneae and 200 Opiliones, belonging to almost 600 species (median: 4 individuals/species). This covers about 60% of the spider fauna and more than 70% of the harvestmen fauna recorded for Germany. The overwhelming majority of species could be readily identified through DNA barcoding: median distances between closest species lay around 9% in spiders and 13% in harvestmen, while in 95% of the cases, intraspecific distances were below 2.5% and 8% respectively, with intraspecific medians at 0.3% and 0.2%. However, almost 20 spider species, most notably in the family Lycosidae, could not be separated through DNA barcoding (although many of them present discrete morphological differences). Conspicuously high interspecific distances were found in even more cases, hinting at cryptic species in some instances. A new program is presented: DiStats calculates the statistics needed to meet DNA barcode release criteria. Furthermore, new generic COI primers useful for a wide range of taxa (also other than arachnids) are introduced."
https://openalex.org/W2525623129,"Over the last few decades, the institutionalisation of quantitative research evaluations has created incentives for scholars to publish as many papers as possible. This paper assesses the effects of such incentives on individual researchers' scientific impact, by analysing the relationship between their number of articles and their proportion of highly cited papers. In other words, does the share of an author's top 1% most cited papers increase, remain stable, or decrease as his/her total number of papers increase? Using a large dataset of disambiguated researchers (N = 28,078,476) over the 1980-2013 period, this paper shows that, on average, the higher the number of papers a researcher publishes, the higher the proportion of these papers are amongst the most cited. This relationship is stronger for older cohorts of researchers, while decreasing returns to scale are observed for recent cohorts. On the whole, these results suggest that for established researchers, the strategy of publishing as many papers as possible did not yield lower shares of highly cited publications, but such a pattern is not always observed for younger scholars."
https://openalex.org/W2527031680,"The aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial activities of the phenolic essential oil (EO) compounds hinokitiol, carvacrol, thymol, and menthol against oral pathogens. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Escherichia. coli were used in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), bacterial growth curves, temperature and pH stabilities, and synergistic effects of the liquid and vapor EO compounds were tested. The MIC/MBC of the EO compounds, ranging from the strongest to weakest, were hinokitiol (40–60 μg/mL/40-100 μg/mL), thymol (100–200 μg/mL/200-400 μg/mL), carvacrol (200–400 μg/mL/200-600 μg/mL), and menthol (500-more than 2500 μg/mL/1000-more than 2500 μg/mL). The antibacterial activities of the four EO phenolic compound based on the agar diffusion test and bacterial growth curves showed that the four EO phenolic compounds were stable under different temperatures for 24 h, but the thymol activity decreased when the temperature was higher than 80°C. The combination of liquid carvacrol with thymol did not show any synergistic effects. The activities of the vaporous carvacrol and thymol were inhibited by the presence of water. Continual violent shaking during culture enhanced the activity of menthol. Both liquid and vaporous hinokitiol were stable at different temperatures and pH conditions. The combination of vaporous hinokitiol with zinc oxide did not show synergistic effects. These results showed that the liquid and vapor phases of hinokitiol have strong anti-oral bacteria abilities. Hinokitiol has the potential to be applied in oral health care products, dental materials, and infection controls to exert antimicrobial activity."
https://openalex.org/W2525640759,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that controls the production of IL-1β, a cytokine that influences the development of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Helminth parasites secrete molecules that interact with innate immune cells, modulating their activity to ultimately determine the phenotype of differentiated T cells, thus creating an immune environment that is conducive to sustaining chronic infection. We show that one of these molecules, FhHDM-1, a cathelicidin-like peptide secreted by the helminth parasite, Fasciola hepatica, inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in reduced secretion of IL-1β by macrophages. FhHDM-1 had no effect on the synthesis of pro-IL-1β. Rather, the inhibitory effect was associatedwith the capacity of the peptide to prevent acidification of the endolysosome. The activation of cathepsin B protease by lysosomal destabilization was prevented in FhHDM-1-treated macrophages. By contrast, peptide derivatives of FhHDM-1 that did not alter the lysosomal pH did not inhibit secretion of IL-1β. Wepropose a novel immunemodulatory strategy usedby F. hepatica, whereby secretion of the FhHDM-1 peptide impairs the activation of NLRP3 by lysosomal cathepsin B protease, which prevents the downstream production of IL-1β and the development of protective T helper 1 type immune responses that are detrimental to parasite survival.—Alvarado, R., To, J., Lund, M.

https://openalex.org/W2526370177,"Cattle are major reservoirs of the provisionally named influenza D virus, which is potentially involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex. Here, we conducted a serological survey for the influenza D virus in Japan, using archived bovine serum samples collected during 2010–2016 from several herds of apparently healthy cattle in various regions of the country. We found sero-positive cattle across all years and in all the prefectural regions tested, with a total positivity rate of 30.5%, although the positivity rates varied among regions (13.5–50.0%). There was no significant difference in positivity rates for Holstein and Japanese Black cattle. Positivity rates tended to increase with cattle age. The herds were clearly divided into two groups: those with a high positive rate and those with a low (or no) positive rate, indicating that horizontal transmission of the virus occurs readily within a herd. These data demonstrate that bovine influenza D viruses have been in circulation for at least 5 years countrywide, emphasizing its ubiquitous distribution in the cattle population of Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2556032506,"Proteins are often engineered to have higher affinity for their ligands to achieve therapeutic benefit. For example, many studies have used phage or yeast display libraries of mutants within complementarity-determining regions to affinity mature antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs). However, these approaches do not allow rapid assessment or evolution across the entire interface. By combining directed evolution with deep sequencing, it is now possible to generate sequence fitness landscapes that survey the impact of every amino acid substitution across the entire protein-protein interface. Here we used the results of deep mutational scans of a TCR-peptide-MHC interaction to guide mutational strategies. The approach yielded stable TCRs with affinity increases of >200-fold. The substitutions with the greatest enrichments based on the deep sequencing were validated to have higher affinity and could be combined to yield additional improvements. We also conducted in silico binding analyses for every substitution to compare them with the fitness landscape. Computational modeling did not effectively predict the impacts of mutations distal to the interface and did not account for yeast display results that depended on combinations of affinity and protein stability. However, computation accurately predicted affinity changes for mutations within or near the interface, highlighting the complementary strengths of computational modeling and yeast surface display coupled with deep mutational scanning for engineering high affinity TCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2527314971,"Background Dengue is the second most important vector-borne disease of humans globally after malaria. Incidence of dengue infections has dramatically increased recently, potentially due to changing climate. Climate projections models predict increases in average annual temperature, precipitation and extreme events in the future. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of changing climate on distribution of dengue vectors in relation to epidemic risk areas in Tanzania. Methods/Findings We used ecological niche models that incorporated presence-only infected Aedes aegypti data co-occurrence with dengue virus to estimate potential distribution of epidemic risk areas. Model input data on infected Ae. aegypti was collected during the May to June 2014 epidemic in Dar es Salaam. Bioclimatic predictors for current and future projections were also used as model inputs. Model predictions indicated that habitat suitability for infected Ae. aegypti co-occurrence with dengue virus in current scenarios is highly localized in the coastal areas, including Dar es Salaam, Pwani, Morogoro, Tanga and Zanzibar. Models indicate that areas of Kigoma, Ruvuma, Lindi, and those around Lake Victoria are also at risk. Projecting to 2020, we show that risk emerges in Mara, Arusha, Kagera and Manyara regions, but disappears in parts of Morogoro, Ruvuma and near Lake Nyasa. In 2050 climate scenario, the predicted habitat suitability of infected Ae. aegypti co-occurrence with dengue shifted towards the central and north-eastern parts with intensification in areas around all major lakes. Generally, model findings indicated that the coastal regions would remain at high risk for dengue epidemic through 2050. Conclusion/Significance Models incorporating climate change scenarios to predict emerging risk areas for dengue epidemics in Tanzania show that the anticipated risk is immense and results help guiding public health policy decisions on surveillance and control of dengue epidemics. A collaborative approach is recommended to develop and adapt control and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2525285319,"The impairing effects of mental fatigue on visual sustained attention were assessed by event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects performed a dual visual task, which includes a continuous tracking task (primary task) and a random signal detection task (secondary task), for 63 minutes nonstop in order to elicit ERPs. In this period, the data such as subjective levels of mental fatigue, behavioral performance measures, and electroencephalograms were recorded for each subject. Comparing data from the first interval (0–25 min) to that of the second, the following phenomena were observed: the subjective fatigue ratings increased with time, which indicates that performing the tasks leads to increase in mental fatigue levels; reaction times prolonged and accuracy rates decreased in the second interval, which indicates that subjects’ sustained attention decreased.; In the ERP data, the P3 amplitudes elicited by the random signals decreased, while the P3 latencies increased in the second interval. These results suggest that mental fatigue can modulate the higher-level cognitive processes, in terms of less attentional resources allocated to the random stimuli, which leads to decreased speed in information evaluating and decision making against the stimuli. These findings provide new insights into the question that how mental fatigue affects visual sustained attention and, therefore, can help to design countermeasures to prevent accidents caused by low visual sustained attention."
https://openalex.org/W2527443085,"The main purpose of performing radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients is to improve the quality of life (QoL) and alleviate AF-related symptoms. We aimed to determine the qualitative and quantitative effects of RFCA on the QoL in AF patients.We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis using a random effects model. We searched for the studies that reported the physical component summary score (PCS) and mental component summary score (MCS) of the short form-36, a validated system to assess and quantify the QoL, before and after RFCA in AF patients. PCS and MCS are T-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.Of the 470 studies identified through systematic search, we included 13 studies for pre-RFCA vs. the post-RFCA analysis and 5 studies for treatment success vs. AF recurrence analyses. In the pre-RFCA vs. post-RFCA analysis, RFCA was associated with a significant increase in both the PCS (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 6.33 [4.81-7.84]; p < 0.001) and MCS (WMD = 7.80 [6.15-9.44]; p < 0.001). The ΔPCS (post-RFCA PCS-pre-RFCA PCS) and ΔMCS values were used for the treatment success vs. AF recurrence analysis. Patients with successful ablation had a higher ΔPCS (WMD = 7.46 [4.44-10.49]; p < 0.001) and ΔMCS (WMD = 7.59 [4.94-10.24]; p < 0.001).RFCA is associated with a significant increase in the PCS and MCS in AF patients. Patients without AF recurrence after RFCA had a better improvement in the PCS and MCS than patients who had AF recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2556178500,"In the retina, aberrant opsin transport from cell bodies to outer segments leads to retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa. Opsin transport is facilitated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system that mediates the bidirectional movement of proteins within cilia. In contrast to functions of the anterograde transport executed by IFT complex B (IFT-B), the precise functions of the retrograde transport mediated by IFT complex A (IFT-A) have not been well studied in photoreceptor cilia. Here, we analyzed developing zebrafish larvae carrying a null mutation in ift122 encoding a component of IFT-A. ift122 mutant larvae show unexpectedly mild phenotypes, compared with those of mutants defective in IFT-B. ift122 mutants exhibit a slow onset of progressive photoreceptor degeneration mainly after 7 days post-fertilization. ift122 mutant larvae also develop cystic kidney but not curly body, both of which are typically observed in various ciliary mutants. ift122 mutants display a loss of cilia in the inner ear hair cells and nasal pit epithelia. Loss of ift122 causes disorganization of outer segment discs. Ectopic accumulation of an IFT-B component, ift88, is observed in the ift122 mutant photoreceptor cilia. In addition, pulse-chase experiments using GFP-opsin fusion proteins revealed that ift122 is required for the efficient transport of opsin and the distal elongation of outer segments. These results show that IFT-A is essential for the efficient transport of outer segment proteins, including opsin, and for the survival of retinal photoreceptor cells, rendering the ift122 mutant a unique model for human retinal degenerative diseases."

However, if this is evident also in a genetic model of obesity and whether gut microbiota has a role, is not known.The metabolic effects of prenatal metformin exposure were investigated in a genetic model of obesity, mice overexpressing neuropeptide Y in the sympathetic nervous system and in brain noradrenergic neurons (OE-NPYDβH). Metformin was given for 18 days to the mated female mice. Body weight, body composition, glucose tolerance and serum parameters of the offspring were investigated on regular diet from weaning and sequentially on western diet (at the age of 5-7 months). Gut microbiota composition was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing at 10-11 weeks.In the male offspring, metformin exposure inhibited weight gain. Moreover, weight of white fat depots and serum insulin and lipids tended to be lower at 7 months. In contrast, in the female offspring, metformin exposure impaired glucose tolerance at 3 months, and subsequently increased body weight gain, fat mass and serum cholesterol. In the gut microbiota, a decline in Erysipelotrichaceae and Odoribacter was detected in the metformin exposed offspring. Furthermore, the abundance of Sutterella tended to be decreased and Parabacteroides increased. Gut microbiota composition of the metformin exposed male offspring correlated to their metabolic phenotype.Prenatal metformin exposure caused divergent metabolic phenotypes in the female and male offspring. Nevertheless, gut microbiota of metformin exposed offspring was similarly modified in both genders."
https://openalex.org/W2524066096,"Agonist induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidases (NOX) enhances platelet aggregation and hence the risk of thrombosis. RhoA and Rac1 GTPases are involved in ROS generation by NOX in a variety of cells, but their roles in platelet ROS production remain unclear. In this study we used platelets from RhoA and Rac1 conditional knockout mice as well as human platelets treated with Rhosin and NSC23767, rationally designed small molecule inhibitors of RhoA and Rac GTPases, respectively, to better define the contributions of RhoA and Rac1 signaling to ROS generation and platelet activation. Treatment of platelets with Rhosin inhibited: (a) U46619 induced activation of RhoA; (b) phosphorylation of p47phox, a critical component of NOX; (c) U46619 or thrombin induced ROS generation; (d) phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC); (e) platelet shape change; (f) platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen; and (g) release of P-selectin, secretion of ATP and aggregation. Conditional deletion of RhoA or Rac1 gene inhibited thrombin induced ROS generation in platelets. Addition of Y27632, a RhoA inhibitor, NSC23766 or Phox-I, an inhibitor of Rac1-p67phox interaction, to human platelets blocked thrombin induced ROS generation. These data suggest that: (a) RhoA/ROCK/p47phox signaling axis promotes ROS production that, at least in part, contributes to platelet activation in conjunction with or independent of the RhoA/ROCK mediated phosphorylation of MLC; and (b) RhoA and Rac1 differentially regulate ROS generation by inhibiting phosphorylation of p47phox and Rac1-p67phox interaction, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2527032308,"The biosynthesis of carboxylic acids including fatty acids from biomass is central in envisaged biorefinery concepts. The productivities are often, however, low due to product toxicity that hamper whole-cell biocatalyst performance. Here, we have investigated factors that influence the tolerance of Escherichia coli to medium chain carboxylic acid (i.e., n-heptanoic acid)-induced stress. The metabolic and genomic responses of E. coli BL21(DE3) and MG1655 grown in the presence of n-heptanoic acid indicated that the GadA/B-based glutamic acid-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) system might be critical for cellular tolerance. The GDAR system, which is responsible for scavenging intracellular protons by catalyzing decarboxylation of glutamic acid, was inactive in E. coli BL21(DE3). Activation of the GDAR system in this strain by overexpressing the rcsB and dsrA genes, of which the gene products are involved in the activation of GadE and RpoS, respectively, resulted in acid tolerance not only to HCl but also to n-heptanoic acid. Furthermore, activation of the GDAR system allowed the recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase of Micrococcus luteus and the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase of Pseudomonas putida to reach 60% greater product concentration in the biotransformation of ricinoleic acid (i.e., 12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (1)) into n-heptanoic acid (5) and 11-hydroxyundec-9-enoic acid (4). This study may contribute to engineering E. coli-based biocatalysts for the production of carboxylic acids from renewable biomass."

We prospectively studied the prevalence, etiology and the impact of anemia on QoL in 218 Indian cancer patients attending a tertiary referral hospital. The study used the sTfR/log Ferritin index to detect iron deficiency anemia and assessed patient QoL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) tool, standardized for language. Mean patient age was 51±13 years and 60% were female. The prevalence of cancer related anemia in this setting was 64% (n = 139). As expected, plasma ferritin did not differ significantly between anemic (n = 121) and non-anemic cancer patients (n = 73). In contrast, plasma sTfR levels were significantly higher in anemic cancer patients compared to non-anemic cancer patients (31 nmol/L vs. 24 nmol/L, p = 0.002). Among anemic cancer patients, using the sTfR/log Ferritin index, we found that 60% (n = 83) had iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Interestingly, plasma sTfR levels were significantly higher in cancer patients with CRA+IDA (n = 83) compared with patients having CRA (n = 38) alone (39 nmol/L vs. 20 nmol/L, p<0.001). There was a significant linear correlation between Hb and QoL (Spearman ρ = 0.21; p = 0.001) and multivariate regression analysis revealed that every gram rise in Hb was accompanied by a 3.1 unit increase in the QoL score (95% CI = 0.19–5.33; p = 0.003). The high prevalence of anemia in cancer patients, a major portion of which is due to iron deficiency anemia, the availability of sensitive and specific biomarkers of iron status to detect IDA superimposed on anemia of inflammation, suggests an urgent need to diagnose and treat such patients. Despite the potential negative consequences of increasing metabolically available plasma iron in cancer, our clinical data suggest that detecting and treating IDA in anemic cancer patients will have important consequences to their QoL and overall survival. Clinical trials of iron therapy in these patients will be able to demonstrate the potential for benefit or harm."
https://openalex.org/W2524257512,"Hemolysis is a complication in septic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, which utilizes the released Hb as an iron source. S. aureus can acquire heme in vitro from hemoglobin (Hb) by a heme-sequestering mechanism that involves proteins from the S. aureus iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system. However, the host has its own mechanism to recapture the free Hb via haptoglobin (Hp) binding and uptake of Hb-Hp by the CD163 receptor in macrophages. It has so far remained unclear how the Isd system competes with this host iron recycling system in situ to obtain the important nutrient. By binding and uptake studies, we now show that the IsdH protein, which serves as an Hb receptor in the Isd system, directly interferes with the CD163-mediated clearance by binding the Hb-Hp complex and inhibiting CD163 recognition. Analysis of truncated IsdH variants including one or more of three near iron transporter domains, IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdHN3, revealed that Hb binding of IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 accounted for the high affinity for Hb-Hp complexes. The third near iron transporter domain, IsdHN3, exhibited redox-dependent heme extraction, when Hb in the Hb-Hp complex was in the oxidized met form but not in the reduced oxy form. IsdB, the other S. aureus Hb receptor, failed to extract heme from Hb-Hp, and it was a poor competitor for Hb-Hp binding to CD163. This indicates that Hb recognition by IsdH, but not by IsdB, sterically inhibits the receptor recognition of Hb-Hp.

The functions of most of these proteins have been elucidated: extraction of heme is achieved by the two bacterial surface-exposed Hb-receptors, IsdB and IsdH; transport of heme across the bacterial cell wall and plasma membrane is performed by IsdA and IsdC together with the membrane protein IsdEF complex; and the heme oxygenase enzymes IsdG and IsdH, located in the cytoplasm, finally cleave the porphyrin ring (reviewed in Ref. 7.Sheldon J.R. Heinrichs D.E. Recent developments in understanding the iron acquisition strategies of gram positive pathogens.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 39: 592-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the role of Isd proteins in the sequestering of iron from free Hb is well understood, this may not apply to the situation in the blood where extracellular Hb is found in complex with Hp. The heme-binding function of S. aureus Isd proteins—IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH—is conferred by the presence of a near iron transporter (NEAT) domain with a conserved heme-binding pocket (8.Fonner B.A. Tripet B.P. Eilers B.J. Stanisich J. Sullivan-Springhetti R.K. Moore R. Liu M. Lei B. Copié V. Solution structure and molecular determinants of hemoglobin binding of the first NEAT domain of IsdB in Staphylococcus aureus.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 3922-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Importantly, the heme-binding domain alone is unable to extract heme from Hb, and IsdB and IsdH contain additional NEAT domains to achieve this function (9.Spirig T. Malmirchegini G.R. Zhang J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 1065-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, IsdH contains three NEAT domains of which the first and second NEAT domain (IsdHN1 and IsdHN2) bind to Hb but lack heme binding activity, whereas the third, C-terminal, NEAT domain (IsdHN3) carries the single heme-binding site of IsdH. IsdHN2 and IsdHN3 are connected by an α-helical linker domain and the IsdHN2-linker-IsdHN3 region is the minimal fragment of the IsdH receptor that retains native ability to capture heme from Hb (9.Spirig T.

IsdB has a two-NEAT domain (IsdBN1 and IsdBN2) structure connected with an α-helical linker domain, similar to the minimal functional fragment of IsdH (8.Fonner B.A. Tripet B.P. Eilers B.J.

In addition to Hb binding, the IsdHN1 domain is also reported to bind other ligands including Hp (12.Dryla A. Hoffmann B. Gelbmann D. Giefing C. Hanner M. Meinke A. Anderson A.S. Koppensteiner W.

Independent of heme extraction, IsdH also plays a role in S. aureus immune evasion by promoting degradation of bound complement C3, thereby avoiding opsonophagocytosis (14.Visai L. Yanagisawa N.

Hp exists in three main variants designated Hp1-1, Hp2–1, and Hp2-2, where Hp1-1 is a Hp dimer, whereas the two other variants are found as different multimeric forms. All forms bind αβ-Hb dimers in the Hp region distal to the center of the Hp protein. Structural data have shown that IsdH binds to Hb in Hb-Hp complexes close to the site for interaction of Hp and CD163 (22.Stødkilde K. Torvund-Jensen M. Moestrup S.K. Andersen C.B. Structural basis for trypanosomal haem acquisition and susceptibility to the host innate immune system.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that IsdH only binds Hb-Hp via a direct Hb interaction without direct contact to the Hp subunit, in contrast to previous reporting (12.Dryla A. Hoffmann B. Gelbmann D.

Furthermore, this study describes how the interaction with Hb-Hp leads to heme extraction and obstruction of CD163-mediated clearance of Hb-Hp complexes in macrophages. IsdH truncation variants IsdHN1, IsdHN2N3, IsdHN1N2N3, and IsdBN1N2 with a His6 tag were expressed recombinantly and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Binding of the IsdH variants to Hb-Hp complexes was evaluated by SPR analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for binding of IsdHN1 (one Hb binding site), IsdHN2N3 (one Hb binding site), or IsdHN1N2N3 (two Hb binding sites) to Hb-Hp1-1 or Hp2-2 were ∼70,∼120, and ∼30 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). The binding curves of IsdHN1 and IsdHN1N2N3 were different in the sense that IsdHN1 and IsdHN2N3 displayed faster off rates, compared with IsdHN1N2N3. These results suggest that the two Hb-binding domains in IsdHN1 and IsdHN2, together increase the overall functional affinity of IsdHn1N2N3 for Hb-Hp. No significant binding of any of the IsdH constructs was seen to Hp1-1 and Hp2-2 (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2SPR analysis of IsdH binding to Hb-Hp. A and B, binding of 100 nm IsdHN1, IsdHN2N3, and IsdHN1N2N3 to immobilized Hp1-1 saturated with Hb (A) or immobilized Hp2-2 saturated with Hb (B). On basis of these data, the apparent KD values were estimated by fitting the plateau binding response: IsdHN1 binding to Hb-Hp1-1 KD = 74 ± 18 nm and binding to Hb-Hp2-2 KD = 71 ± 19 nm; IsdHN2N3 binding to Hb-Hp1-1 KD = 117 ± 17 nm and binding to Hb-Hp2-2 KD = 127 ± 18 nm; IsdHN1N2N3 binding to Hb-Hp1-1 KD = 28 ± 10 nm and to Hb-Hp2-2 KD = 33 ± 9 nm. The values are represented as means ± S.D., and r2 of the fits were all above 0.98. C and D, binding of 100 nm IsdHN1, IsdHN2N3, and IsdHN1N2N3 to immobilized Hp1-1 (C) or immobilized Hp2-2 (D). The binding was investigated on two independently produced flow cells for both Hp1-1 and Hp2-2, respectively. All experiments were at least repeated in triplicate to each flow cell. The apparent binding constants are determined based on a triplicate binding experiment to a single flow cell with either Hp1-1 or Hp2-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the interaction between IsdHN1 and Hb or Hb-Hp complexes in solution, we employed size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with in-line right angle light scattering (RALS). The molecular mass of IsdHN1 determined by SEC-RALS in solution (18.6 kDa) was close to the monomer molecular mass based on sequence and determined by mass spectrometry (18,907 Da) (Fig. 3). The major component of the Hp1-1 preparation was a ∼93-kDa species, consistent with the presence of the Hp1-1 dimer, including ∼20% mass contribution because of glycosylation; a minor peak at the exclusion volume of the SEC column was assumed to be an aggregate. Hb eluted as a single asymmetric peak, indicative of the well characterized dimer-tetramer equilibrium (24.Valdes Jr., R. Vickers L.P. Halvorson H.R. Ackers G.K. Reciprocal effects in human hemoglobin: direct measurement of the dimer-tetramer association constant at partial oxygen saturation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 5493-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); the measured molecular mass of 57 kDa suggested that the protein was predominantly in the tetrameric state under the experimental conditions. Analysis of a 1:1 (by mass) mixture of IsdHN1 with Hp showed no significant change in the peak elution times or molecular masses as determined by RALS (Fig. 3); thus no interaction between IsdHN1 and Hp could be detected. In contrast, Hp and Hb in an 1:1 (by mass) mixture formed a complex with a molecular mass of 152 kDa, consistent with a stoichiometry of one Hp1-1 dimer bound to two Hb αβ-dimers; the absence of any detectable free Hb is consistent with the known high affinity binding between Hp and Hb. The elution of this complex shifted to an earlier time point, and the molecular mass of the complex increased upon addition of IsdHN1 (Fig. 3), indicating formation of a ternary Hb-Hp-IsdHN1 complex. Taken together, the SPR and SEC-RALS data show that Hb is necessary for interaction between Hb-Hp and IsdH, most likely via a direct interaction between IsdH and Hb. To determine whether IsdHN3 is capable of extracting heme from Hb-Hp, heme transfer from Hb-Hp to IsdHN2N3 was monitored using UV-visible spectroscopy, taking advantage of the different spectra generated when heme is bound to the globin or bound to the IsdH protein. Previous studies have confirmed rapid heme transfer to IsdHN2N3 from metHb (9.Spirig T. Malmirchegini G.R. Zhang J. Robson S.A. Sjodt M. Liu M. Krishna Kumar K. Dickson C.F. Gell D.A. Lei B. Loo J.A. Clubb R.T. Staphylococcus aureus uses a novel multidomain receptor to break apart human hemoglobin and steal its heme.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1065-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13.Pilpa R.M. Robson S.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T. Functionally distinct NEAT (NEAr Transporter) domains within the Staphylococcus aureus IsdH/HarA protein extract heme from methemoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1166-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when metHb was incubated in the presence of added IsdHN2N3 (Fig. 4A). Significant absorbance changes were also evident when metHb-Hp1-1 was incubated with IsdHN2N3 (Fig. 4C), indicating that IsdH is capable of extracting heme from Hb in complex with Hp. When IsdHN2N3 was mixed with ferrous oxyHb or oxyHb-Hp1-1, no spectral changes were detected (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, ferrous oxyHb has to be oxidized to metHb for IsdH to be able to extract heme. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was used to determine whether the high affinity binding of IsdH to Hb-Hp interferes with the binding of the complex to purified CD163. A robust SPR response was obtained when Hb-Hp1-1 was injected over CD163 immobilized on the SPR chip surface (Fig. 5A, Buffer), indicating a complex forming between Hb-Hp1-1 and CD163. In contrast, when Hb-Hp1-1 was injected together with an equimolar concentration of IsdHN1, the SPR response was strongly attenuated (Fig. 5A), suggesting that IsdHN1 interferes with the interaction of Hb-Hp1-1 with CD163. Similarly, the IsdHN2N3 and IsdHN1N2N3 proteins also blocked the Hb-Hp1-1 interactions with CD163 (Fig. 5, A and C). Similar results were obtained for interactions of Hb-Hp2-2 with CD163 (Fig. 5, B and D). All IsdH constructs exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of Hb-Hp binding to CD163 with IsdHN1N2N3 showing the highest potency. The IsdH variants were slightly more potent in their inhibition of Hb-Hp2-2 (Fig. 5, B and D) binding compared with Hb-Hp1-1 (Fig. 5, A and C). To investigate how these interactions may impact on clearance of Hb-Hp complexes by cellular CD163, we analyzed the endocytosis of fluorophore-labeled Hb-Hp2-2 by transfected CD163-expressing CHO cells (CHO CD163) in the presence of IsdHN1N2N3, IsdHN2N3, or IsdHN1. As expected, confocal microscopy showed that fluorophore-labeled Hb-Hp (Fig. 6A, green) only was endocytosed when CHO cells were expressing CD163 (Fig. 6A, red). A substantial inhibition of CD163-mediated vesicular Hb-Hp uptake was observed in the presence of IsdHN1N2N3, IsdHN2N3, or IsdHN1 compared with the positive control (Fig. 6A). The inhibitory effect by IsdH was quantified by analyzing the cellular uptake of fluorescent Hb-Hp2-2 by flow cytometry (Fig. 6B). All IsdH constructs inhibited Hb-Hp uptake in a dose-dependent manner, with IsdHN1N2N3 being most efficient showing a 6-fold reduction in uptake using an equimolar concentration of the Hb-Hp units. Complete inhibition, corresponding to the background level in the mock transfected CHO cells, was seen at 5 molar excess of IsdHN1N2N3 and IsdHN1. The inhibitory effect by IsdH was also evident in flow cytometric analysis of monocytes/macrophages, the cell type responsible for the in vivo clearance of Hb-Hp (Fig. 7). The flow cytometric analysis shows that an equimolar concentration of IsdHN1N2N3 reduced the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) signal of Hb-Hp ∼4-fold. Similar inhibition was a seen with IsdHN1 and IsdHN2N3, although 5-fold higher concentrations of these IsdH truncation mutants were needed to obtain the same level of inhibition.FIGURE 7Flow cytometric analysis of uptake of Hb-Hp2-2 by dexamethasone-treated monocytes. A, adherent 3-day-old monocytes treated with 2.5 × 10−7 m dexamethasone were incubated with 23 μg/ml Atto-488-labeled Hb-Hp2-2 and IsdHN1, IsdHN2N3, or IsdHN1N2N3 in 1-, 5-, and 20-fold molar excess over Hb-Hp. B, a polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD163 IgG (50 μg/ml) and an irrelevant polyclonal rabbit anti-human antibody (50 μg/ml) were used as positive and negative inhibition controls respectively. The data from one representative experiment of three are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, because IsdH and IsdB share a high degree of structural homology and both are reported to function as Hb receptors, interactions of IsdB with the Hb-Hp complex and its removal by CD163 were investigated. IsdBN1N2 was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy for its ability to transfer heme (Fig. 8, A and B). Although IsdBN1N2 rapidly transfers heme from metHb, we could not detect any heme transfer from metHb-Hp. In contrast to IsdH, SPR analysis showed no or very weak inhibition of Hb-Hp binding to CD163 by IsdBN1N2 (Fig. 8C), although IsdBN1N2 was able to bind to Hb-Hp (Fig. 8D). Finally, IsdBN1N2 did not inhibit uptake of fluorophore-labeled Hb-Hp2-2 in CHO CD163 (Fig. 8E). This study shows that S. aureus IsdH blocks the CD163-mediated uptake of Hb-Hp complexes, which instantly form when Hb is released during intravascular hemolysis. The blockage is biologically meaningful because it inhibits the normal mechanism for Hb degradation in the host and therefore secures a pool of Hb-iron for the pathogen. The present heme transfer kinetic studies shows that IsdH is able to extract heme from metHb-Hp but not from oxyHb-Hp. This is in line with previous studies on free Hb showing that the third NEAT domain, IsdHN3, binds ferric heme tighter than ferrous heme (25.Moriwaki Y. Caaveiro J.M. Tanaka Y. Tsutsumi H. Hamachi I. Tsumoto K. Molecular basis of recognition of antibacterial porphyrins by heme-transporter IsdH-NEAT3 of Staphylococcus aureus.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 7311-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and studies with the other S. aureus receptor, IsdB, which does not extract heme from oxyHb (26.Bowden C.F. Verstraete M.M. Eltis L.D. Murphy M.E. Hemoglobin binding and catalytic heme extraction by IsdB near iron transporter domains.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 2286-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the IsdH blocking of the CD163-mediated pathway for Hb-Hp uptake may benefit S. aureus by providing time for the spontaneous oxidation of Hb from its ferrous form to ferric metHb, from which IsdH then can extract the heme. Our data indicate that both the IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains contribute to the binding of the Hb-Hp complexes. This is in line with previous data showing that IsdHN1 only binds the Hb α-subunit, whereas IsdHN2 binds either the Hb α- or the Hb β-subunit (27.Krishna Kumar K. Jacques D.A. Pishchany G. Caradoc-Davies T. Spirig T. Malmirchegini G.R. Langley D.B. Dickson C.F. Mackay J.P. Clubb R.T. Skaar E.P. Guss J.M. Gell D.A. Structural basis for hemoglobin capture by Staphylococcus aureus cell-surface protein, IsdH.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 38439-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given that Hb-Hp complexes contain Hb αβ dimers, the higher affinity of IsdHN1N2N3 suggests that IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 are bound simultaneously to the Hb α- and β-subunits, thereby stabilizing the interaction. By presenting the known Hb-Hp-IsdHN1 crystal structure in a view together with a model of two CD163 scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, previously shown to bind Hp in the Hb-Hp complex, Fig. 9 illustrates how IsdHN1 blocks the CD163 binding site on Hb-Hp (28.Nielsen M.J.

Fig. 9 also illustrates how two positively charged amino acids, Lys317 and Arg307, in Hp interact with acidic calcium-coordinating residues in CD163.

However, x-ray crystal structures are needed to confirm the domain interactions of IsdHN1N2N3 with Hp-bound Hb. IsdHN1 has, in contrast to our findings, been reported to bind Hp with a KD in the micromolar (12.Dryla A. Hoffmann B. Gelbmann D. Giefing C. Hanner M. Meinke A. Anderson A.S. Koppensteiner W.

In our study, we could not detect Hp binding by any of the IsdH constructs using either the sensitive SPR analyses or SEC-RALS in line with size exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, a recently published structure of IsdHN1 binding to Hb-Hp shows that IsdHN1 molecules only bound to Hb α-subunits (22.Stødkilde K. Torvund-Jensen M. Moestrup S.K. Andersen C.B.

Given that Hb-Hp is one of the strongest known non-covalent interactions (30.Hwang P.K. Greer J. Interaction between hemoglobin subunits in the hemoglobin. haptoglobin complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3038-3041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that trace contamination of Hp preparations with Hb gave rise to false positive interactions with IsdH observed in previous studies. IsdH shares a high degree of homology with IsdB (11.Sjodt M. Macd"

We examined 140 autopsied human hearts from Caucasian individuals of both sexes (29.3% females) with a mean age of 49.1±17.2 years. We macroscopically investigated the lower part of the right atrium, the CTI, the inferior vena cava ostium and the terminal crest. The paraseptal isthmus (18.5±4.0 mm) was significantly shorter than the central isthmus (p<0.0001), and the central isthmus (24.0±4.2 mm) was significantly shorter than the inferolateral isthmus (29.3±4.9 mm) (p<0.0001). Heart weight was positively correlated with all isthmus diameters. Three different sectors of CTI were distinguished: anterior, middle and posterior. The middle sector of the CTI presented a different morphology: trabeculae (N = 87; 62.1%), intertrabecular recesses (N = 35; 25.0%) and trabecular bridges (N = 18; 12.9%). A single sub-Eustachian recess was present in 48.6% of hearts (N = 68), and a double recess was present in 2.9% of hearts (N = 4) with mean depth = 5.6±1.8mm and diameter = 7.1±3.4mm. The morphology of the distal terminal crest was varied; 10 patterns of the distal terminal crest ramifications were noted. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the investigated CTI parameters between groups with different types of terminal crest ramifications. The presence of intertrabecular recesses (25.0%), trabecular bridges (12.9%) and sub-Eustachian recesses (48.6%) within the CTI can make ablation more difficult. We have presented the macroscopic patterns of final ramifications of the terminal crest within the quadrilateral CTI area."

Accordingly, we aimed to determine whether adipocyte miRNA expression is responsive to exercise training and to identify exercise-responsive miRNAs that influence adipocyte metabolism. Next-generation sequencing was used to profile miRNA expression of adipocytes that were isolated from abdominal subcutaneous (ABD) and gluteofemoral (GF) adipose tissue of overweight men before and after 6wk of endurance exercise training. Differentially expressed miRNAs were overexpressed or silenced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and lipid metabolism was examined. Next-generation sequencing identified 526 miRNAs in adipocytes, and there were no statistical differences in miRNA expression when comparing pre- and post-training samples for ABD and GF adipocytes. miR-10b expression was increased in ABD compared with GF adipocytes, whereas miR-204, miR-3613, and miR-4532 were more highly expressed in GF compared with ABD adipocytes. Blocking miR-10b in adipocytes suppressed β-adrenergic lipolysis but generally had a minor effect on lipid metabolism. Thus, unlike their critical role in adipogenesis, stable changes in miRNA expression do not play a prominent role in the regulation of adipocyte function in response to endurance exercise training.—Tsiloulis, T., Pike, J., Powell, D., Rossello, F.

https://openalex.org/W2527244153,"The presence of human norovirus in the aquatic environment can cause outbreaks related to recreational activities and the consumption of norovirus-contaminated clams. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of norovirus genogroups I (GI) and II (GII) in the coastal aquatic environment in South Korea (March 2014 to February 2015). A total of 504 water samples were collected periodically from four coastal areas (total sites = 63), of which 44 sites were in estuaries (clam fisheries) and 19 were in inflow streams. RT-PCR analysis targeting ORF2 region C revealed that 20.6% of the water samples were contaminated by GI (13.3%) or GII (16.6%). The prevalence of human norovirus was higher in winter/spring than in summer/fall, and higher in inflow streams (50.0%) than in estuaries (7.9%). A total of 229 human norovirus sequences were identified from the water samples, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences clustered into eight GI genotypes (GI.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and nine GII genotypes (GII.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 17, and 21). This study highlighted three issues: 1) a strong correlation between norovirus contamination via inflow streams and coastal areas used in clam fisheries; 2) increased prevalence of certain non-GII.4 genotypes, exceeding that of the GII.4 pandemic variants; 3) seasonal shifts in the dominant genotypes of both GI and GII."

https://openalex.org/W2525777812,"Genomic and physiological responses in Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) in the northern Gulf of Mexico have confirmed oil exposure of resident marsh fish following the Macondo blowout in 2010. Using these same fish, we evaluated otolith microchemistry as a method for assessing oil exposure history. Laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry was used to analyze the chemical composition of sagittal otoliths to assess whether a trace metal signature could be detected in the otoliths of F. grandis collected from a Macondo-oil impacted site in 2010, post-spill relative to pre-spill, as well as versus fish from areas not impacted by the spill. We found no evidence of increased concentrations of two elements associated with oil contamination (nickel and vanadium) in F. grandis otoliths regardless of Macondo oil exposure history. One potential explanation for this is that Macondo oil is relatively depleted of those metals compared to other crude oils globally. During and after the spill, however, elevated levels of barium, lead, and to a lesser degree, copper were detected in killifish otoliths at the oil-impacted collection site in coastal Louisiana. This may reflect oil contact or other environmental perturbations that occurred concomitant with oiling. For example, increases in barium in otoliths from oil-exposed fish followed (temporally) freshwater diversions in Louisiana in 2010. This implicates (but does not conclusively demonstrate) freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River (with previously recorded higher concentrations of lead and copper), designed to halt the ingress of oil, as a mechanism for elevated elemental uptake in otoliths of Louisiana marsh fishes. These results highlight the potentially complex and indirect effects of the Macondo oil spill and human responses to it on Gulf of Mexico ecosystems, and emphasize the need to consider the multiple stressors acting simultaneously on inshore fish communities."
https://openalex.org/W2525032631,"The molecular defects which lead to multistep incidences of human T-cell leukemia have yet to be identified. The DNA-binding protein Helios (known as IKZF2), a member of the Ikaros family of Krüppel-like zinc-finger proteins, functions pivotally in T-cell differentiation and activation. In this study, we identify three novel short Helios splice variants which are T-cell leukemic specific, and demonstrate their dominant-negative function. We then test the cellular localization of distinct Helios isoforms, as well as their capability to form heterodimer with Ikaros, and the association with complexes comprising histone deacetylase (HDAC). In addition, the ectopic expression of T-cell leukemic Helios isoforms interferes with T-cell proliferation and apoptosis. The gene expression profiling and pathway analysis indicated the enrichment of signaling pathways essential for gene expression, translation, cell cycle checkpoint, and response to DNA damage stimulus. These data indicate the molecular function of Helios to be involved in the leukemogenesis and phenotype of T-cell leukemia, and also reveal Helios deregulation as a novel marker for T-cell leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2523803852,"Objectives To assess long-term survival and mortality in adult cardiac surgery patients. Methods 8,564 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery in Trondheim, Norway from 2000 until censoring 31.12.2014 were prospectively followed. Observed long-term mortality following surgery was compared to the expected mortality in the Norwegian population, matched on gender, age and calendar year. This enabled assessment of relative survival (observed/expected survival rates) and relative mortality (observed/expected deaths). Long-term mortality was compared across gender, age and surgical procedure. Predictors of reduced survival were assessed with multivariate analyses of observed and relative mortality. Results During follow-up (median 6.4 years), 2,044 patients (23.9%) died. The observed 30-day, 1-, 3- and 5-year mortality rates were 2.2%, 4.4%, 8.2% and 13.8%, respectively, and remained constant throughout the study period. Comparing observed mortality to that expected in a matched sample from the general population, patients undergoing cardiac surgery showed excellent survival throughout the first seven years of follow-up (relative survival ≥ 1). Subsequently, survival decreased, which was more pronounced in females and patients undergoing other procedures than isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Relative mortality was higher in younger age groups, females and patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). The female survival advantage in the general population was obliterated (relative mortality ratio (RMR) 1.35 (1.19–1.54), p<0.001). Increasing observed long-term mortality seen with ageing was due to population risk, and younger age was independently associated with increased relative mortality (RMR per 5 years 0.81 (0.79–0.84), p<0.001)). Conclusions Cardiac surgery patients showed comparable survival to that expected in the general Norwegian population, underlining the benefits of cardiac surgery in appropriately selected patients. The beneficial effect lasted shorter in younger patients, females and patients undergoing AVR or other procedures than isolated CABG. Thus, the study identified three groups that need increased attention for further improvement of outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2524046343,"While variation in age structure over time and space has long been considered important for population dynamics and conservation, reliable estimates of such spatio-temporal variation in age structure have been elusive for wild vertebrate populations. This limitation has arisen because of problems of imperfect detection, the potential for temporary emigration impacting assessments of age structure, and limited information on age. However, identifying patterns in age structure is important for making reliable predictions of both short- and long-term dynamics of populations of conservation concern. Using a multistate superpopulation estimator, we estimated region-specific abundance and age structure (the proportion of individuals within each age class) of a highly endangered population of snail kites for two separate regions in Florida over 17 years (1997–2013). We find that in the southern region of the snail kite—a region known to be critical for the long-term persistence of the species—the population has declined significantly since 1997, and during this time, it has increasingly become dominated by older snail kites (> 12 years old). In contrast, in the northern region—a region historically thought to serve primarily as drought refugia—the population has increased significantly since 2007 and age structure is more evenly distributed among age classes. Given that snail kites show senescence at approximately 13 years of age, where individuals suffer higher mortality rates and lower breeding rates, these results reveal an alarming trend for the southern region. Our work illustrates the importance of accounting for spatial structure when assessing changes in abundance and age distribution and the need for monitoring of age structure in imperiled species."
https://openalex.org/W2524838919,"Adverse effect of alcohol on neural function has been well documented. Especially, the teratogenic effect of alcohol on neurodevelopment during embryogenesis has been demonstrated in various models, which could be a pathologic basis for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). While the developmental defects from alcohol abuse during gestation have been described, the specific mechanisms by which alcohol mediates these injuries have yet to be determined. Recent studies have shown that alcohol has significant effect on molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation including genes involved in neural development. To test our hypothesis that alcohol induces molecular alterations during neural differentiation we have derived neural precursor cells from pluripotent human ESCs in the presence or absence of ethanol treatment. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling identified molecular alterations induced by ethanol exposure during neural differentiation of hESCs into neural rosettes and neural precursor cell populations. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional analysis on significantly altered genes showed potential ethanol's effect on JAK-STAT signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and regulation of autophagy. We have further quantitatively verified ethanol-induced alterations of selected candidate genes. Among verified genes we further examined the expression of P2RX3, which is associated with nociception, a peripheral pain response. We found ethanol significantly reduced the level of P2RX3 in undifferentiated hESCs, but induced the level of P2RX3 mRNA and protein in hESC-derived NPCs. Our result suggests ethanol-induced dysregulation of P2RX3 along with alterations in molecules involved in neural activity such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction may be a molecular event associated with alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy of an enhanced nociceptive response."
https://openalex.org/W2526055455,"Background Overweight/obesity has been reported to worsen pulmonary function (PF). This study aimed to examine the association between PF and several body composition (BC) measures in two population-based cohorts. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of individuals aged 18 and 30 years from two Pelotas Birth Cohorts in southern Brazil. PF was assessed by spirometry. Body measures that were collected included body mass index, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, percentages of total and segmented (trunk, arms and legs) fat mass (FM) and total fat-free mass (FFM). FM and FFM were measured by air-displacement plethysmography (BODPOD) and by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Associations were verified through linear regressions stratified by sex, and adjusted for weight, height, skin color, and socioeconomic, behavioral, and perinatal variables. Results A total of 7347 individuals were included in the analyses (3438 and 3909 at 30 and 18 years, respectively). Most BC measures showed a significant positive association between PF and FFM, and a negative association with FM. For each additional percentage point of FM, measured by BOD POD, the forced vital capacity regression coefficient adjusted by height, weight and skin color, at 18 years, was −33 mL (95% CI −38, −29) and −26 mL (95% CI −30, −22), and −30 mL (95% CI −35, −25) and −19 mL (95% CI −23, −14) at 30 years, in men and women, respectively. All the BOD POD regression coefficients for FFM were the same as for the FM coefficients, but in a positive trend (p<0.001 for all associations). Conclusions All measures that distinguish FM from FFM (skinfold thickness–FM estimation–BOD POD, total and segmental DXA measures–FM and FFM proportions) showed negative trends in the association of FM with PF for both ages and sexes. On the other hand, FFM showed a positive association with PF."
https://openalex.org/W2526048654,"Since the advent of large-scale genomic sequencing, and the consequent availability of large numbers of homologous protein sequences, there has been burgeoning development of methods for extracting functional information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). One type of analysis seeks to identify specificity determining positions (SDPs) based on the assumption that such positions are highly conserved within groups of sequences sharing functional specificity, but conserved to different amino acids in different specificity groups. This unsupervised approach to utilizing evolutionary information may elucidate mechanisms of specificity in protein-protein interactions, catalytic activity of enzymes, sensitivity to allosteric regulation, and other types of protein functionality. We present an analysis of SDPs in the LacI family of transcriptional regulators in which we 1) relax the constraint that all specificity groups must contribute to SDP signal, and 2) use a novel approach to robust treatment of sequence alignment uncertainty based on sub-sampling. We find that the vast majority of SDP signal occurs at positions with a conservation pattern that significantly complicates detection by previously described methods. This pattern, which we term “partial SDP”, consists of the commonly accepted SDP conservation pattern among a subset of specificity groups and strong degeneracy among the rest. An upshot of this fact is that the SDP complement of every specificity group appears to be unique. Additionally, sub-sampling gives us the ability to assign a confidence interval to the SDP score, as well as increase fidelity, as compared to analysis of a single, comprehensive alignment—the current standard in multiple sequence alignment methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W2527125010,"Paraná, Yungas and Chaco Serrano ecoregions are among the most species-rich terrestrial habitats at higher latitude. However, the information for tiger moths, one of the most speciose groups of moths, is unknown in these ecoregions. In this study, we assess their species richness and composition in all three of these ecoregions. Also we investigated whether the species composition of tiger moths is influenced by climatic factors and altitude. Tiger moth species were obtained with samples from 71 sites using standardized protocols (21 sites were in Yungas, 19 in Paraná and 31 in Chaco Serrano). Rarefaction-extrapolation curves, non-parametric estimators for incidence and sample coverage indices were performed to assess species richness in the ecoregions studied. Non metric multidimensional scaling and adonis tests were performed to compare the species composition of tiger moths among ecoregions. Permutest analysis and Pearson correlation were used to evaluate the relationship among species composition and annual mean temperature, annual temperature range, annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and altitude. Among ecoregions Paraná was the richest with 125 species, followed by Yungas with 63 species and Chaco Serrano with 24 species. Species composition differed among these ecoregions, although Yungas and Chaco Serrano were more similar than Paraná. Species composition was significantly influenced by climatic factors and altitude. This study showed that species richness and species composition of tiger moths differed among the three ecoregions assessed. Furthermore, not only climatic factors and altitude influence the species composition of tiger moths among ecoregions, but also climatic seasonality at higher latitude in Neotropical South America becomes an important factor."
https://openalex.org/W2524464973,"Abstract Lamprey angiotensinogen (l-ANT) is a hormone carrier in the regulation of blood pressure, but it is also a heparin-dependent thrombin inhibitor in lamprey blood coagulation system. The detailed mechanisms on how angiotensin is carried by l-ANT and how heparin binds l-ANT and mediates thrombin inhibition are unclear. Here we have solved the crystal structure of cleaved l-ANT at 2.7 angstrom resolution and characterized its properties in heparin binding and protease inhibition. The structure reveals that l-ANT has a conserved serpin fold with a labile N-terminal angiotensin peptide and undergoes a typical stressed-to-relaxed conformational change when the reactive center loop is cleaved. Heparin binds l-ANT tightly with a dissociation constant of ~10 nM involving ~8 monosaccharides and ~6 ionic interactions. The heparin binding site is located in an extensive positively charged surface area around helix D involving residues Lys148, Lys 151, Arg155 and Arg380. Although l-ANT by itself is a poor thrombin inhibitor with a second order rate constant of 500 M-1s-1, its interaction with thrombin is accelerated 90-fold by high-molecular-weight heparin following a bell-shaped dose dependent curve. Short heparin chains of 6-20 monosaccharide units are insufficient to promote thrombin inhibition. Furthermore, an l-ANT mutant with the P1 Ile mutated to Arg inhibits thrombin nearly 1500-fold faster than the wild type which is further accelerated by high-molecular-weight heparin. Taken together, these results suggest that heparin binds l-ANT at a conserved heparin binding site around helix D and promotes the interaction between l-ANT and thrombin through a conserved template mechanism of vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2525280927,"The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a declining seabird that is well-known for nesting in coastal old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest. Most studies of habitat selection have focused on modeling terrestrial nesting habitat even though marine habitat is believed to be a major contributor to population declines in some regions. To address this information gap, we conducted a 5-year study of marine resource selection by murrelets in Washington, which contains a population experiencing the steepest documented declines and where marine habitat is believed to be compromised. Across five years we tracked 157 radio-tagged murrelets during the breeding season (May to August), and used discrete choice models to examine habitat selection. Using an information theoretic approach, our global model had the most support, suggesting that murrelet resource selection at-sea is affected by many factors, both terrestrial and marine. Locations with higher amounts of nesting habitat (β = 21.49, P < 0.001) that were closer to shore (β = -0.0007, P < 0.001) and in cool waters (β = -0.2026, P < 0.001) with low footprint (β = -0.0087, P < 0.001) had higher probabilities of use. While past conservation efforts have focused on protecting terrestrial nesting habitat, we echo many past studies calling for future efforts to protect marine habitat for murrelets, as the current emphasis on terrestrial habitat alone may be insufficient for conserving populations. In particular, marine areas in close proximity to old-growth nesting habitat appear important for murrelets during the breeding season and should be priorities for protection."
https://openalex.org/W2526452011,"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of porcine contagious pleuropneumonia, a major cause of economic loss in swine industry worldwide. TolC, the key component of multidrug efflux pumps and type I secretion systems, has been well-studied as an exit duct for numerous substances in many Gram-negative bacteria. By contrast, little is known on the role of TolC in biofilm formation. In this study, a ΔtolC mutant was used to examine the importance of TolC in biofilm formation of A. pleuropneumoniae. Surface attachment assays demonstrated the essential role of TolC in initial attachment of biofilm cells. The loss of TolC function altered surface hydrophobicity, and resulted in greatly reduced autoaggregation in ΔtolC. Using both enzymatic treatments and confocal microscopy, biofilm composition and architecture were characterized. When compared against the wild-type strain, the poly-β-1, 6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA), an important biofilm matrix component of A. pleuropneumoniae, was significantly reduced at the initial attachment stage in ΔtolC. These results were confirmed by mRNA level using quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, defective secretion systems in ΔtolC may also contribute to the deficiency in biofilm formation. Taken together, the current study demonstrated the importance of TolC in the initial biofilm formation stage in A. pleuropneumoniae. These findings could have important clinical implications in developing new treatments against biofilm-related infections by A. pleuropneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2526401103,"Background and Purpose It has been accepted that AMPK (Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase) activation exhibits many beneficial effects on glucolipid metabolism. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is an important lysophospholipid which can improve blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and attenuate inflammation by activating AMPK signal pathway in macrophages. Synthetic alkylphospholipids (ALPs), such as miltefosine, is used as an alternate of LPC for the clinical application. Here, we investigated whether miltefosine could have an impact on hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders. Experimental Approach Mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to generate an obese model. Next, the obese mice were randomly divided into three groups: saline-treated and miltefosine-treated (2.5 or 5 mg/kg/d) groups. Miltefosine was intraperitoneally administrated into mice for additional 4 weeks plus HFD treatment. Key Results It was shown that miltefosine treatment could substantially improve glucose metabolism, prevented hepatic lipid accumulation, and inhibited liver inflammation in HFD-fed mice by activating AMPK signal pathway. In vitro, miltefosine stimulated AMPKα phosphorylation both in time and dose dependent manner and decreased lipid accumulation in liver cells. When a specific AMPK inhibitor compound C was used to treat mice, the antagonistic effects of miltefosine on HFD-induced mouse hyperlipidaemia and liver steatosis were abolished. Treatment with miltefosine also dramatically inhibited the HFD-induced liver inflammation in mice. Conclusions and Implications Here we demonstrated that miltefosine might be a new activator of AMPK signal pathway in vivo and in vitro and be useful for treatment of hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2527015197,"Assessing the parental genetic differences and their subsequent prediction of progeny performance is an important first step to assure the efficiency of any breeding program. In this study, we estimate the genetic divergence in Eucalyptus camaldulensis based on the morphological traits of 132 progenies grown in a savanna biome. Thus, a field experiment was performed using a randomized block design and five replications to compare divergences in total height, commercial height, diameter at breast height, stem form and survival rate at 48 months. Tocher's clustering method was performed using the Mahalanobis and Euclidian distances. The Mahalanobis distance seemed more reliable for the assessed parameters and clustered all of the progenies into fourteen major groups. The most similar progenies (86 accessions) were clustered into Group I, while the most dissimilar (1 progeny) represented Group XIV. The divergence analysis indicated that promising crosses could be made between progenies allocated in different groups for high genetic divergence and for favorable morphological traits."

The combination of gaze direction and emotional expression can therefore convey important information about people's evaluations of the objects in their environment, and can even influence the subsequent evaluations of those objects by a third party, a phenomenon known as the emotional gaze effect. The present study extended research into the effect of emotional gaze cues by investigating whether they affect evaluations of the most important aspect of our social environment-other people-and whether the presence of multiple gaze cues enhances this effect. Over four experiments, a factorial within-subjects design employing both null hypothesis significance testing and a Bayesian statistical analysis replicated previous work showing an emotional gaze effect for objects, but found strong evidence that emotional gaze cues do not affect evaluations of other people, and that multiple, simultaneously presented gaze cues do not enhance the emotional gaze effect for either the evaluations of objects or of people. Overall, our results suggest that emotional gaze cues have a relatively weak influence on affective evaluations, especially of those aspects of our environment that automatically elicit affectively valenced reactions, including other humans."

There was no significant difference in F-ERG between the RDP-MII(E11R)-treated and control eyes. In contrast, P-ERG response amplitude was significantly reduced in the RDP-MII(E11R)-injected eye. Blocking a6* nAChRs at retinal level also decreased the VEP amplitude recorded in the visual cortex contralateral to the injected eye. Because both the cortical and inner retina output were affected by RDP-MII(E11R), whereas photoreceptor output was preserved, we conclude that the reduced visual response was due to an alteration in the function of a6* nAChRs present in the ganglion cell layer.—Barloscio, D., Cerri, E., Domenici, L., Longhi, R., Dallanoce, C., Moretti, M., Vilella, A., Zoli, M., Gotti, C., and Origlia, N.
