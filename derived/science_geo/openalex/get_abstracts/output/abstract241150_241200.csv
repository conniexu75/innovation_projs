https://openalex.org/W1990299300,"Recent theory has predicted a superlens that is capable of producing sub–diffraction-limited images. This superlens would allow the recovery of evanescent waves in an image via the excitation of surface plasmons. Using silver as a natural optical superlens, we demonstrated sub–diffraction-limited imaging with 60-nanometer half-pitch resolution, or one-sixth of the illumination wavelength. By proper design of the working wavelength and the thickness of silver that allows access to a broad spectrum of subwavelength features, we also showed that arbitrary nanostructures can be imaged with good fidelity. The optical superlens promises exciting avenues to nanoscale optical imaging and ultrasmall optoelectronic devices."

We found that homozygous Clock mutant mice have a greatly attenuated diurnal feeding rhythm, are hyperphagic and obese, and develop a metabolic syndrome of hyperleptinemia, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia, and hypoinsulinemia. Expression of transcripts encoding selected hypothalamic peptides associated with energy balance was attenuated in the Clock mutant mice. These results suggest that the circadian clock gene network plays an important role in mammalian energy balance."

Although double emulsions are potentially of commercial value, traditional fabrication by means of two emulsification steps leads to very ill-controlled structuring. Using a microcapillary device, we fabricated double emulsions that contained a single internal droplet in a core-shell geometry. We show that the droplet size can be quantitatively predicted from the flow profiles of the fluids. The double emulsions were used to generate encapsulation structures by manipulating the properties of the fluid that makes up the shell. The high degree of control afforded by this method and the completely separate fluid streams make this a flexible and promising technique."
https://openalex.org/W2073307618,"Machine learning was applied for the automated derivation of causal influences in cellular signaling networks. This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998671658,"Magnaporthe grisea is the most destructive pathogen of rice worldwide and the principal model organism for elucidating the molecular basis of fungal disease of plants. Here, we report the draft sequence of the M. grisea genome. Analysis of the gene set provides an insight into the adaptations required by a fungus to cause disease. The genome encodes a large and diverse set of secreted proteins, including those defined by unusual carbohydrate-binding domains. This fungus also possesses an expanded family of G-protein-coupled receptors, several new virulence-associated genes and large suites of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. Consistent with a role in fungal pathogenesis, the expression of several of these genes is upregulated during the early stages of infection-related development. The M. grisea genome has been subject to invasion and proliferation of active transposable elements, reflecting the clonal nature of this fungus imposed by widespread rice cultivation. The genome sequence of the most destructive pathogen of rice is now available. The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea is the first fungal plant pathogen genome to be characterized, and with the rice genome already sequenced, it provides a unique opportunity to study the relationship between host and pathogen. Early findings include a family of novel G-protein-coupled receptors involved in disrupting host defences, a candidate target for fungicides specific for this pest. The genome has been invaded by other genetic elements in the past, probably contributing to rapid evolution when faced with newly introduced resistant rice varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2032323486,"In eukaryotes, 21- to 24-nucleotide-long RNAs engage in sequence-specific interactions that inhibit gene expression by RNA silencing. This process has regulatory roles involving microRNAs and, in plants and insects, it also forms the basis of a defense mechanism directed by small interfering RNAs that derive from replicative or integrated viral genomes. We show that a cellular microRNA effectively restricts the accumulation of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) in human cells. PFV-1 also encodes a protein, Tas, that suppresses microRNA-directed functions in mammalian cells and displays cross-kingdom antisilencing activities. Therefore, through fortuitous recognition of foreign nucleic acids, cellular microRNAs have direct antiviral effects in addition to their regulatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W2144175766,"Mammals normally maintain their core body temperature (CBT) despite changes in environmental temperature. Exceptions to this norm include suspended animation–like states such as hibernation, torpor, and estivation. These states are all characterized by marked decreases in metabolic rate, followed by a loss of homeothermic control in which the animal's CBT approaches that of the environment. We report that hydrogen sulfide can induce a suspended animation-like state in a nonhibernating species, the house mouse ( Mus musculus ). This state is readily reversible and does not appear to harm the animal. This suggests the possibility of inducing suspended animation-like states for medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2147547928,"The continued retreat of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula has been widely attributed to recent atmospheric warming, but there is little published work describing changes in glacier margin positions. We present trends in 244 marine glacier fronts on the peninsula and associated islands over the past 61 years. Of these glaciers, 87% have retreated and a clear boundary between mean advance and retreat has migrated progressively southward. The pattern is broadly compatible with retreat driven by atmospheric warming, but the rapidity of the migration suggests that this may not be the sole driver of glacier retreat in this region."

Alternatively, it might allow the processing of all objects in parallel but bias activity in favor of those neurons that represent critical features of the target, until the target emerges from the background. To test these possibilities, we recorded neurons in area V4 of monkeys freely scanning a complex array to find a target defined by color, shape, or both. Throughout the period of searching, neurons gave enhanced responses and synchronized their activity in the gamma range whenever a preferred stimulus in their receptive field matched a feature of the target, as predicted by parallel models. Neurons also gave enhanced responses to candidate targets that were selected for saccades, or foveation, reflecting a serial component of visual search. Thus, serial and parallel mechanisms of response enhancement and neural synchrony work together to identify objects in a scene.

Findings reveal a marked alongshore variation in retained primary production that is highly correlated with the alongshore variation in resident fish yield. The highest productivity occurs off the coasts of Washington and southern British Columbia.

https://openalex.org/W2164937876,"How plants recognize pathogens and activate defense is still mysterious. Direct interaction between pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins and plant disease resistance proteins is the exception rather than the rule. During infection, Cladosporium fulvum secretes Avr2 protein into the apoplast of tomato leaves and, in the presence of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat receptor-like Cf-2 protein, triggers a hypersensitive response (HR) that also requires the extracellular tomato cysteine protease Rcr3. We show here that Avr2 binds and inhibits Rcr3 and propose that the Rcr3-Avr2 complex enables the Cf-2 protein to activate an HR."
https://openalex.org/W1984136850,"α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and related disorders. Misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein is thought to be a critical cofactor in the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we investigate the role of the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) in α-synuclein aggregation. We demonstrate that CHIP is a component of Lewy bodies in the human brain, where it colocalizes with α-synuclein and Hsp70. In a cell culture model, endogenous CHIP colocalizes with α-synuclein and Hsp70 in intracellular inclusions, and overexpression of CHIP inhibits α-synuclein inclusion formation and reduces α-synuclein protein levels. We demonstrate that CHIP can mediate α-synuclein degradation by two discrete mechanisms that can be dissected using deletion mutants; the tetratricopeptide repeat domain is critical for proteasomal degradation, whereas the U-box domain is sufficient to direct α-synuclein toward the lysosomal degradation pathway. Furthermore, α-synuclein, synphilin-1, and Hsp70 all coimmunoprecipitate with CHIP, raising the possibility of a direct α-synuclein-CHIP interaction. The fact that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain is required for the effects of CHIP on α-synuclein inclusion morphology, number of inclusions, and proteasomal degradation as well as the direct interaction of CHIP with Hsp70 implicates a cooperation of CHIP and Hsp70 in these processes. Taken together, these data suggest that CHIP acts a molecular switch between proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1996632477,"The origin of the solar wind in solar coronal holes has long been unclear. We establish that the solar wind starts flowing out of the corona at heights above the photosphere between 5 megameters and 20 megameters in magnetic funnels. This result is obtained by a correlation of the Doppler-velocity and radiance maps of spectral lines emitted by various ions with the force-free magnetic field as extrapolated from photospheric magnetograms to different altitudes. Specifically, we find that Ne7+ ions mostly radiate around 20 megameters, where they have outflow speeds of about 10 kilometers per second, whereas C3+ ions with no average flow speed mainly radiate around 5 megameters. Based on these results, a model for understanding the solar wind origin is suggested."

Since 1997, sea surface winds have been strengthening over the western Arabian Sea. This escalation in the intensity of summer monsoon winds, accompanied by enhanced upwelling and an increase of more than 350% in average summertime phytoplankton biomass along the coast and over 300% offshore, raises the possibility that the current warming trend of the Eurasian landmass is making the Arabian Sea more productive."

https://openalex.org/W2010727650,"Obligate Acacia ant plants house mutualistic ants as a defense mechanism and provide them with extrafloral nectar (EFN). Ant/plant mutualisms are widespread, but little is known about the biochemical basis of their species specificity. Despite its importance in these and other plant/animal interactions, little attention has been paid to the control of the chemical composition of nectar. We found high invertase (sucrose-cleaving) activity in Acacia EFN, which thus contained no sucrose. Sucrose, a disaccharide common in other EFNs, usually attracts nonsymbiotic ants. The EFN of the ant acacias was therefore unattractive to such ants. The Pseudomyrmex ants that are specialized to live on Acacia had almost no invertase activity in their digestive tracts and preferred sucrose-free EFN. Our results demonstrate postsecretory regulation of the carbohydrate composition of nectar."
https://openalex.org/W2017757326,"Transient receptor potential channel melastatin subfamily (TRPM) 4 and its close homologue, TRPM5, are the only two members of the large transient receptor potential superfamily of cation channels that are impermeable to Ca2+. In this study, we located the TRPM4 selectivity filter and investigated possible structural elements that render it Ca2+-impermeable. Based on homology with known cation channel pores, we identified an acidic stretch of six amino acids in the loop between transmembrane helices TM5 and TM6 (981EDMDVA986) as a potential selectivity filter. Substitution of this six-amino acid stretch with the selectivity filter of TRPV6 (TIIDGP) resulted in a functional channel that combined the gating hallmarks of TRPM4 (activation by Ca2+, voltage dependence) with TRPV6-like sensitivity to block by extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ as well as Ca2+ permeation. Neutralization of Glu981 resulted in a channel with normal permeability properties but a strongly reduced sensitivity to block by intracellular spermine. Neutralization of Asp982 yielded a functional channel that exhibited extremely fast desensitization (τ"
https://openalex.org/W1977642897,"RecQ helicases are critical for maintaining genomic integrity. In this study, we show that three RecQ members (WRN, deficient in the Werner syndrome; BLM, deficient in the Bloom syndrome; and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> RecQ5b (dmRecQ5b)) possess a novel strand pairing activity. Furthermore, each of these enzymes combines this strand pairing activity with its inherent DNA unwinding capability to perform coordinated strand exchange. In this regard, WRN and BLM are considerably more efficient than dmRecQ5b, apparently because dmRecQ5b lacks conserved sequences C-terminal to the helicase domain that contribute to DNA binding, strand pairing, and strand exchange. Based on our findings, we postulate that certain RecQ helicases are structurally designed to accomplish strand exchange on complex replication and recombination intermediates. This is highly consistent with proposed roles for RecQ members in DNA metabolism and the illegitimate recombination and cancer-prone phenotypes associated with RecQ defects."

In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms of inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by hypoxia and TGF-β in human and murine marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and the role of TGF-β/Smad signaling in the inhibition of adipocytogenesis by hypoxia. Both hypoxia-mimetic deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) and TGF-β1 inhibited adipocyte differentiation (1.0% versus the control at 15 μm DFO and 1.4% versus the control at 1 ng/ml TGF-β1) and adipocyte gene expression (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 and lipoprotein lipase) in human MSCs after 21 days of treatment. Hypoxia (2% O2) and DFO (but not TGF-β1) increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α as shown by Western blotting. Macroarrays and Western and Northern blot analyses showed that hypoxia activated the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and that both hypoxia and TGF-β1 modulated adipocyte differentiation pathways such as the insulin-, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, and MAPK-associated signaling pathways.

Lipid-containing cells were observed in four of the supplement combinations: DM, IDM, DMY, and IDMY. PPARγ2 expression was detected in cultures treated with DM or IDM and was up-regulated in hMSC cultures treated with DY and IDY, with which adipocytes were not observed. The greatest LPL expression was detected in cells treated with IDM compared with DM, DMY, and IDMY. In cultures without visible lipid-containing cells, LPL was up-regulated only in the group treated with IDY. Neither PPARγ2 nor LPL was detected by RT-PCR under basal conditions. These data indicate that up-regulation of PPARγ2 and LPL was achieved with the combination of insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and that addition of indomethacin to the treatment did not increase gene expression or apparent accumulation of adipocytes in hMSCs. For most experiments, IDM supplementation was used as the standard adipocytogenic condition. Regulation of Adipocyte Differentiation in Human and Murine MSCs—hMSCs were cultured in 12-well tissue culture plates; after they reached confluence, the medium was changed to α-minimal essential medium containing 1% FBS-HI and supplemented with IDM, which had been shown to promote PPARγ2 and LPL gene expression and development of lipid-containing cells as described above. hMSCs were treated with 15 μm hypoxia-mimetic deferoxamine mesylate (DFO; 15 mm stock solution in tissue culture-grade sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Sigma), with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or with the vehicle control (0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Three weeks later, lipid accumulation in cells was visualized by staining with 0.3% oil red O (Sigma) (20Zhou S. Eid K. Glowacki J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The lipid-containing cells in three to six random areas of 1 mm2 were enumerated in each culture well (n = 9) per group. The means ± S.D. are presented. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, the p42/44 MAPK inhibitor PD098059, and the TGF-β type I receptor ALK-5 (activin receptor-like kinase-5) inhibitor SB431542 were purchased from Sigma, and the stock solutions in Me2SO were kept at –20 °C. For murine MSCs, after reaching confluence, the medium was changed to McCoy's 5A medium containing 1% FBS-HI and supplemented with IDM for 4 days, and then the adipocytogenic supplements were changed to 10 μg/ml insulin only. Seven days after treatment with the vehicle control, 15 μm DFO, or 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 with or without 10 μm SB431542, lipid accumulation in cells was visualized by staining with 0.3% oil red O. The lipid-containing cells in three to six random areas of 1 mm2 were enumerated in each culture well (n = 3) per group. Cell Viability Assay—Confluent cultures of hMSCs (from a 42-year-old woman) were exposed to increasing concentrations of DFO (1–1,000 μm). Cells were collected after 24 h by trypsinization, and, including cells floating in the medium, cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The percentage of viable cells was calculated as the number of viable cells (unstained) divided by the sum of dead (stained) and viable cells. Western Blotting—hMSCs (from a 42-year-old woman) were cultured in 100-mm dishes. After reaching confluence, the cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 1% FBS-HI and supplemented with IDM under hypoxic (2% O2) or standard (19% O2) conditions with or without DFO (15 μm) or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for 16 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared with urea denaturing buffer containing 6.7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). They were homogenized with a Kontes Pellet Pestle and separated from insoluble cell materials by centrifugation at 16,000 × g in an Eppendorf bench-top centrifuge at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA system (Pierce). Western immunoblotting was performed as described (20Zhou S. Eid K. Glowacki J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Xiao J-H. Ghosn C. Hinchman C. Forbes C. Wang J. Snider N. Cordrey A. Zhao Y. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol.

In brief, proteins were resolved electrophoretically through 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE® BisTris gel, Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 2–3 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C. The anti-HIF-1α primary antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences; the rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2/3 (Ser433/Ser435) IgG antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); and the anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. After removal of the unbound primary antibodies by three 10-min washes with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times for 10 min with PBST. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The antibody-associated protein bands were visualized with the ECL Plus Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from MSCs with TRIzol. For RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the cDNA was used in each 50-μl PCR (30–35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55–60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) with gene-specific primers. The human LPL forward primer is 5′-GAGATTTCTCTGTATGGCACC-3, and the reverse primer is 5′-CTGCAAATGAGACACTTTCTC-3′ (1261–1536 bp; GenBank™ accession number NM_000237.1). Primers for the human PPARγ2 (24Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Brambilla R. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) genes were used for amplification as described previously. Gene Macroarray—GEArray™ human TGF-β/bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway and insulin pathway macroarrays (SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Bethesda, MD) were performed as described previously (20Zhou S. Eid K. Glowacki J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Zhou S. Glowacki J. Yates K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, 3 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the reagents provided by the manufacturer. The labeled cDNAs were hybridized overnight to the macroarrays; washed; and exposed to x-ray film for 5, 16–24, 48, and 72 h. Digital images were obtained by scanning autoradiographs with an Epson transparency adapter. Data were extracted from the images with ScanAlyze software as described in detail elsewhere (26Zhou S. Glowacki J. Yates K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data were organized by functional category of the genes, and a qualitative measure of relative expression under control conditions is indicated. Genes whose expression levels under control conditions were measured during short film exposures (5–24 h) were classified as high expression (+++); 48-h film exposures were classified as low expression (++); and 72-h film exposures were classified as very low expression (+). Undetectable or absent calls (–) were made for pixel intensity equal to the background level. The expression value for each gene on the array was calculated with GEArrayAnalyzer™ software provided by the manufacturer and was verified by visual comparison with the autoradiographs. The usable linear range of pixel intensity was established as 9,000–65,000 as described previously (26Zhou S. Glowacki J. Yates K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The quantitative magnitude of change evoked by treatment is expressed as fold change upon treatment relative to the control. A qualitative increase or decrease or no change evoked by treatment relative to the control is indicated for genes that were expressed at levels too low for quantification or where a neighboring strong spot bled into the feature of interest. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed with modification as described previously (26Zhou S. Glowacki J. Yates K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoretically resolved on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics) by downward capillary transfer in 20× SSC. The nylon membrane was prehybridized in formamide prehybridization/hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) for 3 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was performed overnight in formamide prehybridization/hybridization buffer with random-labeled probes at 42 °C. The probes for human TGFBI, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), PKM2, and INSR (insulin receptor) were labeled with a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics) with 25 ng of RT-PCR products of each gene and purified using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen Inc.). The primers for human TGFBI (26Zhou S. Glowacki J. Yates K.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), PAI-1 (27Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U.

Shin Y.K. Park S.Y. Kim H.K. Park J.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 108: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and INSR (29Persaud S.J. Asare-Anane H. Jones P.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were described previously. The internal control 18 S oligonucleotide probe (Ambion Inc.) was labeled with a DNA 5′-end labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). For removal of nonspecifically bound probes, membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS (5 min each) and twice with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS (5 min each) at room temperature and twice with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS (15 min each) at 42 °C. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography at –80 °C with Eastman Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed two to five times. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. Quantitative data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Hypoxia and Its Mimetic DFO Stabilize HIF-1α and Activate the TGF-β Signal in hMSCs—The effects of hypoxia, hypoxiamimetic DFO, and TGF-β1 on HIF-1α and TGF-β intracellular signaling molecule Smad proteins in hMSCs (from a 42-year-old woman) were assessed by Western immunoblot analysis. Confluent hMSCs were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 1% FBS-HI and supplemented with IDM for 16 h under hypoxic (2% O2) or standard (19% O2) conditions with or without 15 μm hypoxia-mimetic DFO or 1 ng/ml TGF-β1. Hypoxia (2% O2) and its mimetic DFO (15 μm) up-regulated HIF-1α protein (120 kDa) compared with normoxia and the vehicle control (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) did not modulate HIF-1α protein level in hMSCs. Similar results were obtained in the human bone marrow stromal cell line KM101 (data not shown). In addition, hypoxia, its mimetic DFO, and TGF-β1 activated the TGF-β signal as shown by increased phosphorylated Smad2/3 in hMSCs by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Hypoxia-mimetic DFO and TGF-β Inhibit Adipocytogenesis and Adipocyte Gene Expression in hMSCs—hMSCs (from a 42-year-old woman) were used to assess the effects of hypoxia and TGF-β on adipocyte differentiation. After 3 weeks of culture in adipocytogenic supplements with or without hypoxiamimetic DFO (2.5–15 μm) or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml), development of lipid-containing cells was visualized by staining with oil red O (Fig. 2A). DFO significantly blocked adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner (38.8, 20.4, and 1.0% versus the control at 2.5, 5.0, and 15.0 μm DFO, respectively) (Fig. 2B). TGF-β1 significantly decreased adipocyte number (1.4% versus the control; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). Both DFO (50 μm) and TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) blocked expression of the PPARγ2 and LPL adipocyte genes in hMSCs as shown by RT-PCR (Fig. 2C). Hypoxia-mimetic DFO Does Not Alter Cell Viability—The effect of DFO on cell viability was determined with the trypan blue exclusion assay. After 24 h of treatment with 0, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 1000 μm DFO in α-minimal essential medium containing 1% FBS-HI, the viability of hMSCs (from a 42-year-old woman) was 97, 96, 97, 95, 95, and 92%, respectively. Following 3 weeks of treatment with 2.5, 5.0, 15.0, and 50 μm DFO in α-minimal essential medium containing 1% FBS-HI and supplemented IDM, the viability of hMSCs was similar for DFO-treated and control groups. Hypoxia and TGF-β Alter Gene Expression in Adipocyte-associated Pathways—Because both hypoxia and TGF-β inhibited adipocyte differentiation in hMSCs, we assessed whether hypoxia and TGF-β have similar effects on adipocyte-associated signaling pathways. We surveyed effects on gene expression with a cDNA macroarray. Many categories of adipocyte-associated genes were coordinately up- or down-regulated upon 48 h of exposure to hypoxia (2% O2) (Table I). Hypoxia down-regulated PPARγ and its target genes, including adipsin (43% versus the normoxic control), AEBP1 (70%), and SLC27A4 (38%). Among the insulin receptor-associated genes, hypoxia down-regulated CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein; 53%), INSR (84%), NCK2 (32%), CRK (63%), and PPP1CA (protein phosphatase-1, catalytic subunit, alpha isoform). Expression of the primary insulin target gene v-jun was decreased by hypoxia (64%). In the PI3K pathways, hypoxia altered gene expression of PI3K pathway components, including EIF4EBP1 (up-regulation), PIK3R1 (12%), PIK3R2 (25%), and GSK3A and GSK3B (down-regulation), and PI3K pathway target genes, including PAI-1 (426%), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 210%), PKM2 (310%), the low density lipoprotein receptor, and ACACB (acetyl-coenzyme Acarboxylase beta; down-regulation). In the MAPK pathway, hypoxia down-regulated MAPK pathway components, including MAP2K2 (55%), K-ras, and c-raf, and MAPK pathway target genes, including angiogenin (88%) and bcl-x (48%). Under these conditions, there was no effect on insulin-activated transcription factor SREBP1/ADD1 gene expression, but there was up-regulation of the SREBP1 target genes PKM2 (310%) and PCK2 (313%) and down-regulation of ACACB (acetyl-coenzyme Acarboxylase beta) in hMSCs.Table IAdipocyte-associated signaling and target gene expression profiles of hMSCs after exposure to hypoxia (2% O2) or treatment with TGF-β 1 (1 ng/ml) for 48 hCategory and geneGenBank™ accession no.Level of expression (control)aSymbols indicate the relative level of expression in controls: +++, high expression, normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A or β-actin (16-24-h exposure); ++, low expression, normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (48-h exposure); +, very low, normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (3-day exposure); -, undetectable, no normalized data (3-day exposure).Fold change bybArrows indicate qualitative change by hypoxia or TGF-β1 in genes for which quantification was not possible: ↑, increase; ↓, decrease; ↔, no change.HypoxiaTGF-β1PPARγ and its target genesPPARγNM_015869+↓↓AdipsinNM_001928+++0.430.36AEBP1NM_001129+++0.703.46C/EBP-αNM_004364-↔↔C/EBP-βNM_005194++↓↔SLC27A4NM_005094++0.380.76SREBP1 and its target genesSREBP1NM_004176+↔↔PKM2NM_002654++3.101.89PCK2NM_004563++3.131.22ACACBNM_001093+↓↓Insulin receptor-associated genesCAPBC017196+++0.532.04INSRNM_000208+++0.840.49NCK2NM_003581+++0.320.67PTPRF (LAR)NM_002840++1.131.49CRKNM_016823++0.630.41SHC1U73377++1.061.63PTPN11NM_002834+0.961.64PPP1CAAB028949+↓↓Insulin signaling target genev-junNM_002228++0.640.33PI3K pathwayComponentsAKT (PKBβ)cPKBβ, protein kinase Bβ; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor.M77198++↔↔EIF4EBP1NM_004095++↑2.52PIK3R1M61906++0.1227PIK3R2NM_005027+0.25↔GLUT1NM_006516+↔1.71GSK3BNM_002093+↓↔GSK3ANM_019884+↓↓Target genesPAI-1M16006++4.264.51VEGFNM_003376+2.101.22LDLRNM_000527+↓↔MAPK pathwayComponentsRRASNM_006270++1.350.82MAP2K1NM_002755+↔0.28MAP2K2L11285+0.550.31SOS2L13858+1.071.18K-rasM54968+↓↔c-rafX03484+↓↔Target genesAngiogeninM11567+++0.880.64bcl-xZ23115++0.480.47TIEGU21847+↔1.10ERCC1M28650+↔↑a Symbols indicate the relative level of expression in controls: +++, high expression, normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A or β-actin (16-24-h exposure); ++, low expression, normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (48-h exposure); +, very low, normalized to the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (3-day exposure); -, undetectable, no normalized data (3-day exposur"
https://openalex.org/W2056196016,"The importance of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in mediating Parkinson's disease (PD) was suggested in reports, indicating that COX-2 selective inhibitors or genetic knockout reduce 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxicity in a mouse model of PD. However, cell types and mechanisms underlying the activation of COX-2 have not been clearly elucidated in these animal studies. Using primary neuron-glia cultures, we aimed to determine 1) whether microglia participate in 1-methyl-4-phenylpryridinium (MPP)-induced COX-2 activation and 2) whether the activation of COX-2 contributes to subsequent neurotoxicity. MPP, in a concentration-dependent manner, increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in mixed neuron-microglia cultures but not in enriched neuron, microglia, or astroglia cultures nor in mixed neuron-astroglia cultures. MPP-induced PGE2 increase was completely abolished by treatment with DuP697, a COX-2 selective inhibitor. DuP697 also significantly reduced MPP-induced DA neurotoxicity as determined by DA uptake assay. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy studies showed enhanced COX-2 expression in both microglia and neurons after MPP treatment. However, neuronal increase in COX-2 expression was not totally dependent on the production of PGE2 from microglia, since microglia deficient in COX-2 only attenuated, but did not completely block, MPP-increased PGE2 production in mixed neuron-microglia cultures, suggesting that part of PGE2 production was originated from neurons. Together, these results indicate that MPP-induced COX-2 expression and subsequent PGE2 production depend on interactions between neurons and microglia. Microgliosis may also be responsible for the COX-2 activation in neurons, leading to the enhanced DA neurotoxicity, which, in turn, reinforces microgliosis. Thus inhibition of microgliosis and COX-2 activity may stop this vicious circle and be valuable strategies in PD therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1991124500,"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase that is involved in multiple signaling events of eukaryotic cells. It might either act as a catalyst for prolyl bond isomerization, or it can form stoichiometric complexes with target proteins. We have investigated the linear sequence recognition code for CypA by phage display and found the consensus motif FGPXLp to be selected after five rounds of panning. The peptide FGPDLPAGD showed inhibition of the isomerase reaction and NMR chemical shift mapping experiments highlight the CypA interaction epitope. Ligand docking suggests that the peptide was able to bind to CypA in the cis- and trans-conformation.

On the one hand, CypA serves as immunophilin and binding partner for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (1Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), and on the other hand CypA was found to catalyze the cis/trans-isomerization of proline imide bonds in peptides (2Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-activity of CypA was shown to be relevant for protein folding in vitro (3Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), but it has been difficult to prove the relevance of catalysis in vivo. Recent experiments suggest that the tyrosine kinase Itk is regulated by the catalytic activity of CypA (4Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and for the HIV Vpr protein cis/trans-interconversion of a critical proline residue might be catalyzed by CypA (5Bruns K. Fossen T. Wray V. Henklein P. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43188-43201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The role of CypA as stoichiometric binding partner has also gained recent interest in the light of HIV infectivity and T cell signaling. For certain HIV-1 strains, the ability of the capsid protein (CA) to bind CypA correlates well with the infectivity of these strains (6Wiegers K. Krausslich H.G. Virology. 2002; 294: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Structural analysis shows that the GP-dipeptide of the CA86–93 loop is deeply inserted into the CypA binding site, and mutation of glycine to alanine reduces ground state binding, presumably fostering the cis/trans-interconversion rate (7Howard B.R. Vajdos F.F. Li S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of the X-P-dipeptide bond may result in stable complex formation or transient interaction and catalysis, depending on the sequence or conformational context of the critical proline. The sequence context for catalysis by CypA has been investigated in detail (8Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3464-3471Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and revealed no stringent requirements for the nature of the amino acid flanking the central proline. For immunophilins as binding modules it was suggested that peptide conformation is central to the formation of complexes (9Ivery M.T.G. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); however, a global analysis of the sequences binding to CypA is missing. Here we apply phage display from a randomized 9-mer peptide library to map the recognition code for linear peptide sequences that interact with CypA. We identify the consensus sequence as FGPXLp and confirm the importance of the individual amino acids for the peptide FGPDLPAGD. The latter peptide is an active site inhibitor, and NMR spectroscopy shows that the binding epitope overlaps with the interaction site of cyclosporin A and other CypA ligands. The recognition signature is present in a number of human proteins, and peptides derived from these proteins bind to CypA when spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The identification of novel CypA binding sites sets the stage for the detection of yet unknown CypA interaction partners. As a first example, we show that a phage display-derived peptide motif is bound by CypA in the context of the entire cytoplasmic domain of the T cell adhesion molecule CD2. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—To construct GST-CypA fusion protein, the gene encoding human cyclophilin A was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the recombinant plasmid were grown in 2 × YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per 1 liter of medium) at 37 °C till A600 of 0.5, gene expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was harvested after 4 h of growth. GST-CypA was purified from the soluble fraction using affinity chromatography on a prepacked HiTrap glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent gel filtration (Superdex® 75, Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.9) supplemented with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 15N-Labeled CypA was prepared using the expression plasmid pTFT74 (10Freund C. Ross A. Guth B. Pluckthun A. Holak T.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the His6-tag engineered at the N terminus of the protein. E. coli BL21 (DE3) culture was grown at 37 °C in 1 × A minimal medium (60.3 mm K2HPO4, 33.1 m KH2PO4, 1.7 mm sodium citrate, or 15N-labeled NH4Cl, 0.8% w/v glucose, 1 mm MgSO4) until A600 of 0.2 and induced by 50 μm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C. Protein was isolated using a HiTrap nickel-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences) and a gel filtration step as described above. The CD2 cytoplasmic domain was expressed as fusion protein with the Trp-leader sequence in the vector pTMHa (courtesy of P. Kim, Whitehead Institute). The protein was then solubilized from inclusion bodies, cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac 218TP reversed-phase column (Grace GmbH & Co.). Peptidyl-Prolyl cis/trans-Isomerase Assay—PPIase activity was determined in a coupled assay with chymotrypsin using the synthetic tetrapeptide N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Merck) as substrate at a final concentration of 100 μm (11Fischer G. Bang H. Berger E. Schellenberger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 791: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out at 10 °C, and increase in absorbance was followed at 390 nm for 2–10 min. Concentrations of chymotrypsin and PPIase in the reaction mixture in routine assays were 10 μm and 5–50 nm, respectively. Kinetic progression curves were analyzed by a non-linear least squares fit to a single exponential function assuming a first order rate reaction at [S]0≪Km. The rate constant of non-enzymatic spontaneous isomerization was estimated in the absence of the PPIase and subtracted from the values for the enzymatic reaction. To test inhibition of PPIase, rate constants for the first order reaction were estimated in the presence of 10–400 μm of the peptide selected via the phage display procedure. The IC50 was derived using a single exponential decay function. Phage Display Screening—A randomized nonapeptide library (X9) fused to the gpVIII protein of the phagemid vector pC89 (12Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) was used for the phage display procedure. Screening of the library was performed as follows: 100 μg of GST-CypA fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated overnight with 1010 infectious particles in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA, at 4 °C in a total volume of 400 μl. After washing 10 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, the bound phages were eluted with 100 mm glycine/HCl (pH 2.2). E. coli XL-1Blue cells were infected by the eluted phage particles and the phages amplified using the helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene) according to the standard protocol (13Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions: A Molecular Cloning Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 143-166Google Scholar). Binding Studies of Membrane-attached Peptides—Single substitutions of the peptide EGEFGPDLPAGD were generated by semiautomated spot synthesis on Whatman 50 cellulose membranes as described by Kramer and Schneider-Mergener (14Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with GST-CypA (10 μg/ml) overnight. After washing, bound GST-fused protein was labeled with rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Z-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Rockland). An enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) was used for detection on a LumiImager™ (Roche Applied Science). NMR Analysis of CypA-Ligand Interaction—All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K using a Bruker DRX600 instrument equipped with a standard triple resonance probe. Data processing and analysis were carried out with the XWINNMR (Bruker) and SPARKY software packages (15Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). In the NMR titration experiment increasing amounts of the synthetic peptide (0.1–1.5 mm) of the sequence Ac-FGPDLPAGDNH2 or of the entire cytoplasmic domain of CD2 (amino acids 241–351) were added to a 0.2 mm sample of 15N-labeled CypA in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The sum of the chemical shift changes for 15N and 1H atoms in the heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra of free and ligand-bound CypA was determined as [(Δ1H_cs)2 + (Δ15N_cs)2]1/2, where Δ1H_cs is in units of 0.1 ppm, and Δ15N_cs is in units of 0.5 ppm. Modeling of the CypA-Peptide Complex—Since the cyclophilin-bound CAN loop has a similar sequence (XGPX) as the peptide investigated here, we used the x-ray structure of the complex CypA/HIV-1 CAN, Protein Data Bank entry 1M9C (7Howard B.R. Vajdos F.F. Li S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), as a template for modeling. The FlexX package (16Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) was used for docking of the peptides FGPDLPAGD and FGPDLP to CypA. All atoms of CypA and Pro90 (chain D) were fixed during the docking, and the remaining residues of the peptide were subjected to exhaustive conformational analysis. Two complex conformations displaying the highest binding energy score were analyzed in more detail. After docking, the two candidate complexes were solvated in cubic boxes using TIP3P water molecules (17Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28646) Google Scholar) with an initial minimum distance of at least 8 Å between the boundaries of the box and the nearest solute atom. The systems were first optimized by 500 steps energy minimization each using the GROMACS3.14 package (18Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) and the OPLSAA force field (19Jorgensen W.L. Tiradorives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3948) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a 1-ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for each candidate with restrained positions for all the template atoms in CypA and Pro90 (chain D). Finally, two complete 10-ns molecular dynamics simulations with no positional restraint were performed to fully optimize the structure of the two candidates. The LINCS procedure (20Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (10833) Google Scholar) was applied to constrain all bond lengths. The time step of the simulation was set to 2 fs.A9Å cutoff was used for the short range non-bonded interactions and the lists of non-bonded pairs were updated every 10 steps. The Particle Mesh Ewald method (21Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (14862) Google Scholar) with a grid size of 1.2 Å was used to calculate long range electrostatic interactions. In the simulations, temperature and pressure were maintained by weak coupling to an external bath (22Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Vangunsteren W.F. Dinola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (22539) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed at 300 K temperature. Cluster analysis was applied after the simulations. Main-chain atoms and Cβ atoms were selected for calculating the root mean square deviation matrix. The root mean square deviation cutoff was set to 1.0 Å. Phage Display—Phage display was performed with a gene-VIII-derived vector that presents multiple copies of peptides from a randomized X9-library on the surface of phage M13 (12Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The resulting sequences obtained after five rounds of panning are shown in Fig. 1A. The GP-dipeptide motif was found in all sequenced clones in full agreement with the structure-based prediction of previous investigations (7Howard B.R. Vajdos F.F. Li S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The residue directly C-terminal to the proline at position i is assumed to point toward the solvent, while the amino acid at position i+2 shows a preference for the hydrophobic side chains of leucine or tyrosine. Proline is preferred at position i+3, while residues further C-terminal did not show enrichment of any given amino acid. The identified consensus sequence GPXLp highlights the importance of the GP motif and hydrophobic interactions as major components of CypA-peptide interactions. The peptide FGPDLPAGD was further investigated for its potential to inhibit catalysis of cis/trans-prolyl isomerization of the model substrate N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide by CypA. As can be seen from Fig. 1B, the IC50 for inhibition is 27.8 ± 2.4 μm and suggests that the peptide interacts with the active site of CypA. Peptide Substitution Analysis—To refine the phage display results we performed a peptide substitution analysis of the most frequently selected peptide GPDLPAGD (Fig. 1C). The four N-terminal amino acids, EGEF, belonging to the phage capsid protein gVIII were also considered for the analysis, since they are present in all the selected ligands directly N-terminal to the consensus motif and may therefore contain residues that are essential for binding. In addition to the absolute requirement of proline at position i, glycine at position i–1 must be present in this sequence to allow interaction of the peptide with CypA. Surprisingly, the phage protein derived phenylalanine at position i–2 is exclusively needed for high affinity binding. While position i+1 tolerates most amino acid substitutions, position i+2 shows preference for leucine, although substitution by other hydrophobic amino acids, as well as by arginine still results in detectable spot intensities. At position i+3, proline is one of the amino acids resulting in favorable binding, but arginine and cysteine mutant peptides show comparable affinities. For the other positions, no clear preference for certain amino acids can be observed, and we conclude that these residues do not contribute to complex formation with CypA. The combined results from phage display and peptide substitution analysis converge on FGPXLp as the consensus motif for efficient CypA binding. NMR Analysis of CypA Binding to the FGPDLPAGD Peptide—To map the binding interface for the phage display derived peptide, we monitored 15N-1H chemical shift changes of CypA amide groups upon ligand addition. Fig. 2A shows three superimposed heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra of samples containing CypA alone (red) and CypA in the presence of 0.1 mm (green) and 1.5 mm (blue) concentrations of the peptide. Chemical shift changes are significant for resonances that define the epitope accommodating the peptide. Additionally, since the off-rate of the ligand binding is fast in regard to the NMR time scale, the dissociation constant of the interaction could be determined using titration data (the curve in the inset of Fig. 2A). We obtained a KD of 50 ± 13 μm, assuming a simple A + B ↔ AB binding model. This value is similar to the IC50 for the competitive inhibition of the model peptide substrate. The amino acids of CypA that are affected by peptide binding are shown as colored surface in Fig. 2B. They define a contiguous area that superimposes well with the interaction sites of known CypA-ligand structures, as can be seen for the residues His87–Pro93 of the CAN ligand. In Fig. 2B the most prominent chemical shifts are observed for amino acids situated in several ligand recognition areas. First, the N-terminal “i–2 recognition area” comprising residues Gln63, Thr73, Lys82, Ala101, Thr107, Asn108, and Gly109; second, the hydrophobic pocket accommodating the central proline that consists of Met61, Phe113, and Leu122; and third, the “i+2 recognition area” involving Ile57, Trp121, and Asn149, and surrounding loops (Fig. 2). In addition, Arg55, a critical residue for catalysis (24Zydowsky L.D. Etzkorn F.A. Chang H.Y. Ferguson S.B. Stolz L.A. Ho S.I. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), also displays large chemical shift changes (Fig. 2). The hydrophobic pocket is occupied by a proline residue in several CypA-ligand structures (summarized in Refs. 7Howard B.R. Vajdos F.F. Li S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 9Ivery M.T.G. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the importance of the GP motif for binding (Fig. 1C) suggests a similar interaction site for the phage display-derived peptide. Anchoring of the central GP motif at the position observed in the crystal structure of the CypA/HIV-1 CAN complex was used to model the interaction between CypA and the phage display-derived ligand. Model of CypA Bound to the Phage Display-derived Peptide— The docked and optimized model of CypA bound to the FGPDLP motif of the phage display-derived peptide as well as the superposition of the cis- and trans-variants of the peptide are shown in Fig. 3, A and C. To analyze possible interactions of the ligand with CypA a cutoff was set to 3.4 and 5.0 Å for hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, correspondingly. The GP motif adopts a trans-conformation and fits well to the hydrophobic pocket defined by residues Ile57, Phe60, Met61, Ala101, Ala103, and Leu122, involving also Gln63, Asn102, Phe113, and His126 (Fig. 3A). The glycine at position i–1 is essential, since any other residues would result in a clash between the ligand side-chain and CypA. The phenylalanine at position i–2 fits well into the indentation formed by Lys82, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Thr107, Asn108, Gly109, and Gln111. These results are in agreement with the peptide substitution analysis, which shows the FGP segment to be exclusively required for high affinity binding. At position i+1, the side chain of aspartic acid points toward the solvent, which is in accordance with the mutational analysis (Fig. 1C), where most amino acid substitutions are tolerated at this position. The leucine residue at position i+2is involved in van der Waals interactions with Ile57, Asn71, and Arg148 of CypA; however, membrane spot analysis suggests that other hydrophobic amino acids at this position can support similar interactions (Fig. 1C). Superposition of the modeled peptide with the x-ray structure shows a good fit of the first five residues (FGPDL) to the CA fragment despite the difference in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3B). The proline at position i+3 in our model points toward the solvent, while it is oriented toward CypA in the experimental structure (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C shows the superposition of the two docking models with trans- and cis-conformations of the GP motif. It can be seen that the CypA binding site could accommodate both variants, since the major conformational change affects Gi–1, whereas the hydrophobic interactions can be maintained. Finally NMR studies of the peptide in complex with CypA will allow to experimentally validate this model. CypA Binding to Protein Data Bank-derived Sequences—To identify possible interaction partners of CypA a profile search with the phage display-derived FGPXLp signature was performed for the human genome. 104 peptide sequences from intracellular human proteins that match the consensus motif most closely were spotted onto a cellulose membrane and evaluated for binding to GST-CypA (Fig. 4). As a positive control, phage display-derived ligands were used (Fig. 1A) and peptides were grouped into three distinct categories according to their binding efficiency (Table I). Several of the peptides bind with affinities that are comparable with the phage display peptide (approximated KD values: 10–100 μm) and are therefore approaching the affinities of known binding partners of CypA (e.g. CA). Peptides having the highest homology with the consensus “FGPXLp” display the strongest binding. For example, a sequence from signal-induced proliferation-associated protein-1 matches exactly with the consensus motif and is a promising candidate for a physiological interaction with CypA. None of the sequences is known to interact with CypA yet, but it is interesting to note that several zinc finger proteins of the Sna family contain binding motifs for CypA and might indicate a link for CypA to transcription. Surprisingly, a sequence from the ryanodine receptor, a protein that is bound with high affinity by the FKBP12 protein, shows binding to CypA. However, it has to be kept in mind that the linear sequences displayed on the membrane might not be freely accessible in the context of the full-length proteins. Or else, as part of a structured domain, these sequences might be solvent-exposed but adopt a restricted conformation that does not allow the CypA-compatible structure to be formed. To test the potential of CypA to bind to sequences derived from a known structural context, we investigated the binding to such peptides presented on a cellulose membrane. Since CypA is suggested to show a slight preference for cis-proline bonds (25Kern D. Kern G. Scherer G. Fischer G. Drakenberg T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13594-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Zhao Y.D. Ke H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7356-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we used a selected set of 240 sequences of cis-proline-containing peptide motifs of Protein Data Bank-deposited proteins (www.rcsb.org/pdb/) for binding analysis. Seven of these peptides bind with reasonable affinity to CypA showing that peptides adopting a cis-conformation of the X-P bond in naturally folded proteins could be targets of cyclophilin. On the other hand, we did not observe binding of sequences from established CypA binders as for example CA or Itk when displayed as linear peptide motifs (Fig. 4, spots 1–4 and 11). This might imply, in these cases, that the binding conformation of the peptides is only adopted in the context of the folded protein and is unlikely to be populated to a significant degree in the unconstrained peptides as displayed on the membrane. Our results therefore show that the requirements for binding of constrained peptides within folded domains and linear sequences derived by phage display are different and that CypA is able to interact with extended peptide structures that are putative interaction sites within human proteins.Table ISequences of the peptides spotted on the membrane shown inFig. 4 Open table in a new tab CypA Binding to an Expressed Protein Domain Containing the Consensus Sequence GPXLP—One of the data base-derived sequences that resulted in binding to CypA belongs to the reductase domain of the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase isoform μ, which contains the motif KGPPLP. Sequence comparison showed the T cell adhesion molecule CD2 to contain this sequence (designated as proline-rich region 4 or PR4) as part of its cytoplasmic domain. Since CD2 is suggested to be involved in Itk signaling (27King P.D. Sadra A. Teng J.M. Bell G.M. Dupont B. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and since Itk directly binds to CypA (4Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we further investigated a possible direct link between CypA and CD2. The entire cytoplasmic domain of human CD2 was added to 15N-labeled CypA, and 15N-1H NMR correlation spectra were recorded. Fig. 5 shows the superposition of a spectra of 15N-CypA alone (red) and of CypA in the presence of equimolar amounts or a 6-fold excess of CD2 cytoplasmic domain (green and blue, correspondingly). Resonances of amide groups of the CypA active site residues display small, but significant, chemical shift changes upon CD2 ligand addition and indicate a weak but specific interaction between the two proteins. This result shows that a peptide sequence similar to the phage display consensus motif can bind to CypA in the context of an intact protein domain. In respect to CD2 signaling, our findings suggest a CypA-mediated link between Itk and CD2. Identification of the FGPXLp consensus motif suggests a common binding mode for linear peptides that bind to CypA with considerable affinity. Since we show active site binding of the phage display-derived peptide FGPDLPAGD by inhibition experiments and NMR spectroscopy, it is likely that most of the sequences of the phage display ligands (Fig. 1A) and of the motifs derived from human proteins (Fig. 4) are recognized by CypA at the site surrounding the proline binding pocket. The preference of CypA for the GP dipeptide has been observed previously (7Howard B.R. Vajdos F.F. Li S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and is supported by our peptide substitution analysis (Fig. 1C). In addition, in our model of the CypA bound peptide the GP motif is stably anchored in the binding cleft, while additional van der Waals interactions are provided by phenylalanine at position i–2 and leucine at position i+2ofthe ligand. The second proline at position i+3 is introducing a “kink” in the backbone conformation of the ligand, thereby pointing away from the CypA surface. However, in the experimental structure of the CypA-CAN complex this proline is a part of a PPII-helical conformation (Fig. 3B). Our substitution analysis for proline i+3 demonstrates that most residues in this position with high PPII-helix propensities (e.g. Pro, Gln, Asp, Ala, Arg) (28Rucker A.L. Pager C.T. Campbell M.N. Qualls J.E. Creamer T.P. Proteins. 2003; 53: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), show detectable binding, while those with low PPII-helix preferences (His, Thr, Ile, Val) prohibit stable interactions (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the proline at position i+3 of the phage display-derived ligand may also be a part of PPII-helix and residues supporting formation of the helix are preferred at this position. Taken together our data give a rational for the observed binding of a linear peptide ligand to CypA. Since the binding affinity of the phage dipsplay peptide (KD = 50 μm) is similar to the affinity of natively folded proteins, for example immature HIV-1 capsid protein p24 (Ki = 8.2 μm), or its domains (KD = 10–42 μm) (29Bosco D.A. Kern D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6110-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Yoo S.H. Myszka D.G. Yeh C.Y. McMurray M. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 780-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Endrich M.M. Gehrig P. Gehring H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5326-5332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we propose that linear peptide binding can be of physiological relevance. Such binding motifs, when present in unstructured parts of cytoplasmic proteins, may well represent interaction partners of CypA in vivo. In addition, a possible chaperone activity of CypA may depend on its ability to interact with unconstrained regions of human proteins. As an example, we have investigated the binding of CypA to the T cell adhesion molecule CD2, which contains five proline-rich sequence stretches within its cytoplasmic domain. Proline-rich sequence 4 of CD2 comprises the relaxed consensus motif GPXLp, that is present in one of the peptides derived from the data base search (Fig. 4, spot 37). Clearly, there is a weak, but specific, interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 5). The residues that show the most significant chemical shifts upon addition of CD2 are Arg55, Gln63, and Asn102, which are involved in catalysis by CypA, as well as Ile57, Ala101, Phe113, Trp121, and Leu122, which are known to form the ligand binding site (Fig. 5, also compare with Fig. 2). Whether such a weak interaction is of physiological relevance remains to be investigated, but it is noteworthy that both CD2 and CypA are implicated in Itk signaling in T cells and might therefore be part of a larger assembly involved in the regulation of cytokine production (4Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27King P.D. Sadra A. Teng J.M. Bell G.M. Dupont B. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). With regard to the well characterized role of CypA in cyclosporin A-induced immunosuppression its cellular function becomes only slowly unraveled. The function of CypA as an immunophilin suggested a role in immune cell signaling, and recent experiments with CypA–/– mice show reduced interleukin-4 production and enhanced inflammatory responses, thereby highlighting the role of CypA in T cell signaling (32Colgan J. Asmal M. Neagu M. Yu B. Schneidkraut J. Lee Y. Sokolskaja E. Andreotti A. Luban J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found a peptide from the N-terminal SH3 domain of Vav protein (Vav-SH3N) to interact with CypA (Fig. 4, spot 236). While the native Vav-SH3N did not bind to CypA, we observed an acceleration of its in vitro refolding in the presence of the PPIase (data not shown). This indicates that CypA can interact with Vav-SH3N domain in the unfolded or partially structured state, as observed for other proteins (3Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Since Vav and CypA were both shown to interact with Itk in T cells (4Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 33Dombroski D. Houghtling R.A. Labno C.M. Precht P. Takesono A. Caplen N.J. Billadeau D.D. Wange R.L. Burkhardt J.K. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate a possible interplay between the three proteins. Furthermore, CypA is highly up-regulated in neuronal tissues (34Nahreini P. Hovland A.R. Kumar B. Andreatta C. Edwards-Prasad J. Prasad K.N. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in the response of cells to oxidative stress (35Doyle V. Virji S. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several proteins with sequences that bind with significant affinity to CypA are expressed in brain, as for example the neuron navigator (36Maes T. Barcelo A. Buesa C. Genomics. 2002; 80: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another set of proteins identified from our list as potential candidates for CypA binding is involved in cell cycle progression (Table I). Since CypA has been implicated in proliferation of neuronal (34Nahreini P. Hovland A.R. Kumar B. Andreatta C. Edwards-Prasad J. Prasad K.N. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (37Jin Z.G. Lungu A.O. Xie L. Wang M. Wong C. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to validate a direct interaction in more physiological settings. The finding that cytochrome P450 might be directly recognized by CypA is a possible link between oxidative stress and CypA function (35Doyle V. Virji S. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ryanodine receptor 3 from brain comprises a putative CypA binding site. Ryanodine receptors are Ca2+ channels that allow the influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmatic reticulum, and their operation is known to depend on the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase FKBP12 (38Timerman A.P.

An overlapping function of CypA in this context calls for further investigations.

We are also thankful to Kurt Wüthrich for providing NMR spectral assignments of the free CypA."
https://openalex.org/W1968272594,"The scavenger receptor C-type lectin (SRCL) is an endothelial receptor that is similar in organization to type A scavenger receptors for modified low density lipoproteins but contains a C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Fragments of the receptor consisting of the entire extracellular domain and the CRD have been expressed and characterized. The extracellular domain is a trimer held together by collagen-like and coiled-coil domains adjacent to the CRD. The amino acid sequence of the CRD is very similar to the CRD of the asialoglycoprotein receptor and other galactose-specific receptors, but SRCL binds selectively to asialo-orosomucoid rather than generally to asialoglycoproteins. Screening of a glycan array and further quantitative binding studies indicate that this selectivity results from high affinity binding to glycans bearing the Lewis<sup>x</sup> trisaccharide. Thus, SRCL shares with the dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN the ability to bind the Lewis<sup>x</sup> epitope. However, it does so in a fundamentally different way, making a primary binding interaction with the galactose moiety of the glycan rather than the fucose residue. SRCL shares with the asialoglycoprotein receptor the ability to mediate endocytosis and degradation of glycoprotein ligands. These studies suggest that SRCL might be involved in selective clearance of specific desialylated glycoproteins from circulation and/or interaction of cells bearing Lewis<sup>x</sup>-type structures with the vascular endothelium."

We report a novel group of dual-family immunophilins that contain both CyP and FKBP domains for which we propose the name FCBP (FK506- and cyclosporin-binding protein).

Steinbach W.J. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 192-199PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclophilins (CyPs) bind cyclosporin A (CsA), a cyclic undecapeptide (4Jin L.

In both families, the drugs bind to and inhibit the respective PPIase domains that are roughly 100 amino acids long. Thus, the PPIase domain is essentially synonymous with the drug-binding domain. For instance, the FKBP PPIase domain is often called FK506-binding domain (FKBD) (Figs. 1 and 2). Despite the common PPIase activity, there is no significant sequence homology between these two families (1Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no immunophilin has been characterized to date that contains both CyP and FKBP domains (1Galat A. Curr. Top. Med.

Residues important for CN binding are underlined. The W (for Trp), marked with overhead circle, is especially important for CsA binding but is replaced by H (for His) in Toxoplasma, which explains the relative CsA resistance of the latter (Fig. 4). Note how the residue numbers differ between the Toxoplasma and the bacterial FCBPs because of the reversal of the domain arrangement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the generally accepted nomenclature, the immunophilins are named with a prefix of one or two letters indicating the species followed by a number for the calculated molecular mass in kDa. Thus, the archetypal 12-kDa human FKBP is hFKBP12 or Homo sapien FKBP12. As a rule, the small immunophilins (e.g. hFKBP12) contain a single PPIase domain, whereas the larger ones may contain additional domains important for protein-protein interaction (1Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) such as WD40, calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) (Fig. 1). The TPR motif is a degenerate 34 amino acid sequence that folds into a pair of anti-parallel α-helices (7D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In immunophilins containing three TPR motifs as in FKBP52 and CyP40 (Fig. 1), TPR1 and TPR2 are separated by 15–16 amino acid residues, whereas TPR2 and TPR3 are closer and separated by zero to one residue. Interestingly, the sequences of the TPR are more conserved within the family, i.e. a FKBP TPR is more similar in sequence to another FKBP TPR than to a CyP TPR (1Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive activity of CsA and FK506 does not correlate with PPIase inhibition but involves a mechanism in which the CsA-CyP or the FK506-FKBP complex binds to and inhibits cytosolic calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+-CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, also known as protein phosphatase 2B or protein phosphatase 3 (3Blankenship J.R.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). In this communication, we report a novel class of immunophilins, which contain both CyP and FKBP domains. We suggest that they be called FCBPs (FK506- and cyclosporin-binding protein), in keeping with the existing single family names such as FKBP and CyP. We found the first FCBP in T. gondii, a primitive protozoan parasite of the Apicomplexan family, to which the lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, also belongs. A sequence search subsequently led to the characterization of three additional FCBPs, two in Flavobacterium johnsonii, a bacterium with gliding motility, and one in Treponema denticola, an oral spirochete bacterium that causes periodontal disease. Materials—Ethyl-FK506 (ascomycin) was purchased from Calbiochem, cyclosporin A and bovine cyclophilin were from Sigma, and monoclonal His-tag antibody was from Novagen. Geldanamycin was a kind gift from NCI, National Institutes of Health (11Kumar R. Musiyenko A. Barik S. Malar. J. 2003; 2: 30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide N-succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide was from Bachem. Synthetic peptides 18CGSGSDKVDVDPASIVD34 and 500TDKSNDRPKQDVQIVDC516 corresponded to the N- and C-terminal ends of TgFCBP57. Mice antibodies against these peptides were made as described previously (12Kumar R. Musiyenko A. Oldenburg A. Adams B. Barik S. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and named antibodies A and B, respectively. Similar antibody was also made against a peptide corresponding to the catalytic subunit of T. gondii CN (234DESKDDVGQSPEDSFTPND252) (GenBank™ accession number AAM97278). Immunoblot was performed using Super Signal Ultra chemiluminescence (Pierce). Sequence alignments were done through the ClustalW program. T. gondii Calcineurin—T. gondii tachyzoites were grown on human foreskin fibroblast cells and purified as recommended (13Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). T. gondii CN holoenzyme was purified from the parasite pellet essentially as described for the P. falciparum enzyme with the exception that the Complete protein inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added in the lysis buffer to minimize proteolysis (12Kumar R. Musiyenko A. Oldenburg A. Adams B. Barik S. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The final preparation of CN, eluted from the calmodulin-Sepharose column, contained two major polypeptides of 54 and 22 kDa (data not shown), corresponding to the catalytic (CnA) and regulatory (CnB) subunits (GenBank™ accession numbers AAM97278 and AAM97279), respectively. Identification and Recombinant Expression of the FCBP cDNAs—A BLAST search of the T. gondii TigrScan predicted protein sequences in ToxoDB was performed. To our surprise, the same entry (TgTigrScan_2443) was identified using either hFKBP12 or hCyP40 as query. The cDNA sequence was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. The full-length open reading frame was PCR-amplified using primers containing NdeI and BclI sites and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b. Essentially, similar searches of the GenBank™ later led to the F. johnsonii and T. denticola sequences. The F. johnsonii genes were previously called ppiA and ppiB in recognition of their PPIase homology sequences (14McBride M.J. Braun T.F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and their clones were kindly provided by Dr. Mark J. McBride (University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). The open reading frames were cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pET15b. All of the pET15b clones were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The soluble N-terminally His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography using the His-Bind™ kit (Novagen) (15Kumar R. Adams B. Oldenburg A. Musiyenko A. Barik S. Malar. J. 2002; 1: 5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CyP and FKBP domains of TgFCBP57 were similarly expressed and purified. The internal TPR deletion mutants were generated by the PCR-based megaprimer method (16Burke E. Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 226: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar) and similarly expressed and purified. Enzyme Assays—PPIase assays were carried out as described previously (17Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Toran E.J. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Butts R.N. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki Y. Haruki M. Takano K. Morikawa M. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1372-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 1.5-ml reactions contained 20 nm purified wild type or mutant His-tagged enzymes, 250 μg of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin (Sigma), 35 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.014% Triton X-100, and 20 μm substrate peptide N-succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. When used, the inhibitor was preincubated with the enzyme (60 min). The reaction was initiated by the simultaneous addition of chymotrypsin and substrate peptide. Reactions were performed at 10 °C, and the rise in A400 was recorded every 15 s for 4 min. The chaperone assay involved refolding of RNase T1 (18Suzuki Y. Haruki M. Takano K. Morikawa M. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1372-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this procedure, RNase T1 (50 μm) was first unfolded by incubating at 25 °C for 3 h in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Refolding was initiated by diluting 50 μl of this solution with 2.2 ml of buffer A containing recombinant FCBP or its domains (final concentration 20 nm) and was followed at 10 °C by measuring the increase in Trp fluorescence at 320 nm with excitation at 268 nm in a Hitachi UV-visible spectrophotometer. Phosphatase assay for calcineurin was done in a 96-well plate format using the RII phosphopeptide as substrate, and the liberated phosphate was measured by malachite green assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Calbiochem). Phosphatase reactions were routinely initiated with the addition of substrate. Where indicated, the following additions were made at the indicated concentrations 10 min prior to initiating the reaction: Ca2+; Mg2+; Mn2+ (2 mm each); calmodulin (1 μm); purified recombinant FCBP or its deletion mutants (1 μm); and the indicated amounts of CsA or ethyl-FK506 (19Sewell T.J. Lam E. Martin M.M. Leszyk J. Weidner J. Calaycay J. Griffin P. Williams H. Hung S. Cryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21094-21102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were followed with time to ensure linearity, and the results were corrected by subtraction of the corresponding values from an enzyme-free reaction. RNA Interference Analysis of TgFCBP57—RNAi studies were carried out essentially as described previously (20Al-Anouti F. Ananvoranich S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using the appropriate primers, a 500-bp segment of the TgFCBP57-coding sequence (nucleotides 384–883) was amplified by PCR and cloned into HindIII and SacI sites of pGEM-4 (Promega). The resultant clone was transcribed by a mixture of T7 and SP6 polymerases, and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was treated with calf-intestinal phosphatase. dsRNA was electroporated into 5 × 106 T. gondii RH parasites in 400 μl of electroporation buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.6), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm glutathione. Electroporation conditions were as follows: 1.5 kEV pulse; 50 ohms; 50 microfarads; and 1 ms with a 0.2-cm electrode gap in the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. ∼5 × 104 electroporated parasites were added to confluent human foreskin fibroblast cell monolayer in each well of a 24-well plate, and the media were replaced at 4 h to remove unattached parasites. To measure parasite growth, 2.5 μCi of [3H]uracil in 1 ml of medium was added/well at 18 and 24 h post-infection. Incorporation was allowed to occur for 4 h, following which 1 ml of 0.6 n cold trichloroacetic acid was added per well and the plate was left on ice for 1 h and then submerged in a running water bath overnight. The contents of each well were then dissolved in 500 μlof0.1 n NaOH, and 250 μl was used for liquid scintillation counting. Characterization of the Dual-Family Immunophilins—We and others (21Kumar R. Adams B. Musiyenko A. Shulyayeva O. Barik S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 141: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Monaghan P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) recently identified a FKBP sequence in P. falciparum that was 35 kDa in size and contained three TPRs. This FKBP ortholog showed the unique ability to inhibit the plasmodial calcineurin in the absence of drugs. Because the identification of parasitic drug targets is a major interest in our laboratory, these results prompted us to search for FKBP orthologs in another clinically significant member of the Apicomplexan family, namely T. gondii. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” homology query with the prototype human FKBP12 as well as CyP40 identified the 521 amino acid long putative T. gondii sequence in which the FKBP and CyP homology domains were at the N and C termini, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2), and a TPR domain containing three TPR motifs linked the two. We named the dual-family immunophilin FCBP. Because of its theoretical molecular mass of 57 kDa, the T. gondii protein was named TgFCBP57. Subsequent GenBank™ searches led us to two F. johnsonii (Fj) and one T. denticola ortholog mentioned before, and using the same nomenclature, we named them FjFCBP39, FjFCBP40, and TdFCBP35. Interestingly, the similarity of the three putative bacterial proteins with CyP and FKBP domains was also noted recently (14McBride M.J. Braun T.F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), although the proteins were neither expressed nor studied. The identity of TgFCBP57 was ascertained by its reaction with peptide antibodies A and B (“Experimental Procedures”). The His-tagged recombinant additionally reacted with anti-His antibody and was ∼2 kDa larger due to the tag (data not shown). In Fig. 2, we compared the deduced primary structures of these FCBPs with representative FKBPs and CyPs, including the only FKBP in P. falciparum (PfFKBP35). Whereas the high sequence conservation is obvious in each domain, there are a number of differences between the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic FCBPs. The prokaryotic FKBP domains have variable insertions after the invariant FD-dipeptide (Fig. 2). In the CyP domains, the eukaryotic ones are more similar to each other than to their prokaryotic counterparts as evidenced by the gaps. The SIY-tripeptide, for example, is present in the human and T. gondii domains but not in the bacterial ones. Most importantly, the relative order of the two immunophilin domains is reversed. In the prokaryotic FCBPs, the CyP domain is N-terminal, whereas in the eukaryotic FCBP, the FKBP domain is N-terminal (Figs. 1 and 2). The prokaryotic FCBPs have a much shorter linker with no TPR between CyP and FKBP domains. Thus the N-terminal half of TgFCBP57, containing the FKBD followed by the three TPRs, appears very similar to the same domains in PfFKBP35 (Fig. 1), perhaps indicating a close evolutionary relationship. PPIase and Chaperone Activities of the FCBPs—Recombinantly expressed TgFCBP57 (Fig. 3A) and both the flavobacterial enzymes (Fig. 5) exhibited potent PPIase activities. The FKBP and the CyP domains, when expressed individually, had approximately half of the activity of the full-length FCBP on a molar basis (Fig. 3A). Because the bacterial FCBPs lacked the TPRs but still possessed PPIase activity, we reasoned that the exact sequence of the linker may not be important for catalytic function in vitro. In fact, recombinant TgFCBP57 mutants in which one, two, or all three TPR motifs were deleted retained nearly full activity, confirming that the TPRs were not essential for PPIase activity.Fig. 5Sensitivity of FCBPs to immunosuppressant drugs. PPIase activity of the recombinant enzymes from T. gondii and F. johnsonii was determined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of CsA (gray bars) or ethyl-FK506 (black bars) or a mixture of the two (striped bars). The uninhibited activity of the corresponding enzymes (white bars) was taken as 100. Results represent an average of three experiments with mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that the PPIase and chaperone activities do not always correlate. For example, both CyP40 and FKBP52 display chaperone function independent of PPIase activity (23Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Ward B.K. Allan R.K. Mok D. Temple S.E. Taylor P. Dornan J. Mark P.J. Shaw D.J. Kumar P. Walkinshaw M.D. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40799-40809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, direct measurement of refolding of RNase T1, a traditional substrate for folding assay, revealed that the full-length TgFCBP57 as well as its FKBP and CyP domains had protein-folding activity (Fig. 3B). When compared on a molar basis, the individual domains contained approximately half of the activity of the full-length FCBP, matching the PPIase results above. Together, these results establish the modular nature of the FCBP and suggest that the individual FKBP and CyP domains, although quite diverse in sequence, both contribute to the activity of the full-length FCBP. Drug Sensitivity of the FCBPs—As mentioned before, the PPIase activities of the CyPs and FKBPs are inhibited by cyclosporins and FK506, respectively. A number of amino acids known to be important for interactions with these drugs are in fact conserved in the corresponding domains of the FCBPs (Fig. 2). One important exception is His-474 of TgFCBP35, which is Trp in the other homologs (Fig. 2). Available evidence has shown that this change leads to CsA resistance. In three CyPs, namely E. coli Cyp20, human Cyp40, and a CyP from Brugia malayi (a causative agent of human filaria), the equivalent residue is His and changing it to Trp greatly increased the CsA affinity (25Hoffmann K.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11545-11550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For hCyp40, the values for the His → Trp mutant in fact approached the corresponding values for hCyP18 (25Hoffmann K. Kakalis L.T. Anderson K.S. Armitage I.M. Handschumacher R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which naturally contains a Trp in this position (Fig. 2). Therefore, it was important to investigate the drug sensitivity of a FCBP and its two PPIase domains. We first set out to determine the IC50 of CsA and FK506 on the full-length TgFCBP57; however, as high as a concentration of 10 μm of either inhibitor failed to reduce the PPIase activity by half (Fig. 4A). A simple explanation is that each drug only inhibited its cognate PPIase domain. For example, FK506 inhibited the FKBP domain only and not the CyP domain (5Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12037-12042Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To test this directly, we expressed each PPIase domain of TgFCBP57 recombinantly and determined their drug sensitivity. Indeed, the FKBP domain was highly sensitive to FK506 with an IC50 of 70 nm while being fully resistant to CsA (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the CyP domain was sensitive to CsA, although its IC50 was considerably higher at 750 nm (Fig. 4C). Based on the foregoing, we mutated the His-474 of the CyP domain to Trp, which resulted in a dramatic lowering of IC50 of CsA to 40 nm. As expected, the CyP domain (the wild type as well as the H474W mutant) was fully resistant to FK506. Thus each PPIase domain of TgFCBP57 individually exhibited sensitivity to the family-specific drug, further authenticating their membership in the respective families. We next tested the dual drug sensitivity of the FCBPs. The results (Fig. 5) show that CsA and FK506 additively inhibited all of the FCBPs. Thus the relative positioning of the CyP and FKBP domains did not affect drug-PPIase interaction in each domain, further confirming the modular nature of the FCBPs. The higher sensitivity of the bacterial enzymes toward CsA is easily explained by the conserved Trp corresponding to the His-474 in the T. gondii enzyme (Fig. 2). Inhibition of Calcineurin by Individual FCBP Domains— Because the biochemical dissection experiments revealed the modular nature of the FCBPs, it was logical to ask whether each domain also maintained the ability to inhibit calcineurin in the presence of the cognate drug (4Jin L. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13522-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 5Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

We took purified T. gondii calcineurin and measured its phosphatase activity in the presence of the two recombinant domains of TgFCBP57 and either CsA or FK506. The CyP and FKBP domains clearly inhibited calcineurin in the presence of CsA and FK506, respectively, but not in the reciprocal combination (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is obvious that the modular arrangement of the FCBP extends to calcineurin inhibition as well. Inhibition of T. gondii by CsA and FK506—The exact physiological target of CsA or FK506 in T. gondii is not known. However, because the immunophilins are potential pharmaceutical targets, an obvious question was whether these drugs would have anti-parasitic activity. Using an established [3H]-uridine incorporation assay that is specific for the salvage pathway of the parasite and absent in the host, both drugs were found to inhibit T. gondii growth with IC50 values at 0.7–0.8 μm extracellular drug concentration (Fig. 7A). When tested together, the two drugs showed a slightly synergistic inhibition (Fig. 7B). Knockdown of TgFCBP57 by RNAi Inhibits T. gondii Growth—RNAi has emerged as an important tool to knock down specific gene expression (28Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Recently, double-stranded RNA and short interfering RNA have been shown to trigger an RNAi-like effect in the Apicomplexa as well, especially in T. gondii (15Kumar R. Adams B. Oldenburg A.

We adopted a similar approach and targeted the TgFCBP57 mRNA by transfecting a dsRNA corresponding to an internal 500-bp region of the coding sequence, which led to successful silencing of TgFCBP57 (Fig. 8). Concomitantly, parasitic gene expression was significantly reduced, as measured by the incorporation of [3"

Stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with the G protein-coupled receptor agonists bombesin, vasopressin, or bradykinin induced an extremely rapid (within 5 s) increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843. The phosphorylation of this residue preceded FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site, and FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910. Treatment of intact cells with ionomycin stimulated a rapid increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843, indicating that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is a potential pathway leading to FAK-Ser-843 phosphorylation. Indeed, treatment with agents that prevent an agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (e.g. thapsigargin or BAPTA (1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid)), interfere with calmodulin function (e.g. trifluoperazine, W13, and W7), or block Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation (KN93) or expression (small interfering RNA) abrogated the rapid FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 induced by bombesin, bradykinin, or vasopressin. Furthermore, activated CaMKII directly phosphorylated the recombinant COOH-terminal region of FAK at a residue equivalent to Ser-843.

Subsequent Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-576 and Tyr-577, located in the kinase activation loop, is important for the maximal activation of FAK and downstream signaling events (9Owen J.D.

Phosphorylation at Tyr-925 within the focal adhesion targeting domain creates a binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2-SOS (Ras GTP exchange factor) complex and provides a possible mechanism of FAK-mediated activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)/ERK pathway (4Schlaepfer D.D.

Acta. 2004; 1692: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become apparent that FAK is also phosphorylated at serine residues (32Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. Fry D. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specifically, Ser-722, Ser-732, Ser-843, and Ser-910, located in the COOH-terminal region of FAK, have been identified as prominent phosphorylation sites (33Ma A. Richardson A. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) during mitosis. The proximity of several of these phosphorylated serine residues to sites of protein-protein interaction is of potential importance and suggests a role for serine phosphorylation in modulating binding of downstream signaling proteins (6Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-732 plays a critical role in microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration (34Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), implying that serine phosphorylation of FAK is also of fundamental importance in biological regulation. Until recently, however, virtually nothing was known about the regulation of FAK phosphorylation at serine residues in response to external stimuli, including GPCR agonists and growth factors, in any cell type. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 is strikingly stimulated by GPCR agonists, tumor-promoting phorbol esters, and growth factors through an ERK-dependent pathway in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (35Hunger-Glaser I. Salazar E.P. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22631-22643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Hsieh N. Jiang X.

Physiol. 2004; 200: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, FAK-Ser-910 is directly phosphorylated to high stoichiometry by activated ERK in vitro (35Hunger-Glaser I. Salazar E.P. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22631-22643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings support the hypothesis that extracellular stimuli regulate FAK function by phosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues. In the present study we demonstrate that stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin, vasopressin, or bradykinin induces an extremely rapid (within 5 s) increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843. Treatment of intact Swiss 3T3 cells with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also induced rapid FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843. Reciprocally, treatment with agents that prevent agonist-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), interfere with calmodulin function, or block Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) activation or expression abrogated the rapid FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 induced by bombesin, bradykinin, and vasopressin. We also demonstrate that calmodulin-activated α subunit of CaMKII directly phosphorylated the recombinant COOH-terminal region of FAK at a residue equivalent to Ser-843. Thus, our results demonstrate that GPCR activation induces rapid FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 through a Ca2+-, calmodulin-, and CaMKII-dependent pathway and provide further support to the notion that FAK is a point of convergence and integration in the action of multiple signaling pathways. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. For experimental purposes Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days, when the cells were confluent and quiescent. FAK-/-fibroblasts derived from FAK-null mouse embryos were transiently transfected with either vector (enhanced green fluorescent protein), wild type FAK (WT FAK), or a FAK mutant in which Ser-843 was converted to alanine (FAKS843A) (1 μg of DNA/33-mm dish) in Opti-MEM using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h before analysis. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, equilibrated in the same medium at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and then treated with inhibitors and subsequently stimulated with bombesin or other agonists as indicated. Experiments were terminated by aspirating the medium and immediately washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with protein A-agarose linked to polyclonal anti-FAK (C-20) antibody, as previously described (35Hunger-Glaser I.

Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer and extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) by boiling for 10 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes and subsequently blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2, for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with anti-FAK-phospho-Ser-843 (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-phospho-Tyr-397 (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-phospho-Ser-910 (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK (0.1 μg/ml), or anti-phospho-CaMKII (0.1 μg/ml). The membranes were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies to rabbit NA 934V (1:5000) for 1 h at 22 °C. After washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents. Autoradiograms were scanned using the GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the labeled bands were quantified using the Quantity One software program (Bio-Rad). Equally seeded dishes of FAK-/-cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding FAK or the mutant FAKS843A (see above) and cultured for 48 h. Cells were then washed and subsequently lysed on ice in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The extracts (2 μg of total protein) were assayed for FAK phosphorylated at Tyr-397 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples from the extracts were analyzed for total FAK protein by Western blotting with anti-FAK antibodies (as described above) to verify equal level of expression of FAK and FAKS843A. GST-FRNK, the noncatalytic domain of FAK (amino acids 693-1053), in 100 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and 100 μm ATP was incubated with or without calmodulin and/or CaMKII at 30 °C for the various times/conditions as indicated. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fusion Protein-pFLAG-CMV™ -2 expression vector containing FAK wild type was used to create FRNK by PCR amplification using specific oligonucleotide primers (forward primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAATCCAGGCGACAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGTTAGCGGCCGCTTAGTGGGGCCTGGACTG-3′) containing restriction sites for BamHI and NotI, respectively (underlined). The resulting PCR products were subcloned as a BamHI-NotI fragment into the vector pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the bacterial expression construct pGEX-GST-FRNK. The 57-kDa GST-FRNK was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) for 2 h, induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified with the B-PER GST fusion protein purification kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bombesin, bradykinin, vasopressin, thapsigargin, and trifluoroperazine were purchased from Sigma. KN 93, KN 92, W5, W7, W12, W13, ionomycin, BAPTA/AM, the α-subunit of CaMKII, and recombinant calmodulin were obtained from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies to rabbit (NA 934V) and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. FAK polyclonal Ab C-20 and anti-phospho-CaMKII were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, Ca). The phosphospecific polyclonal Abs to Ser-843, Ser-910, and Tyr-397 of FAK were obtained from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA). The murine CaMKIIα-specific siRNA populations and their negative control were obtained from Dharmacon RNA Technologies and used as suggested by the manufacturer. All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. To determine whether the phosphorylation of endogenous FAK at Ser-843 can be regulated by GPCR agonists, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 10 nm bombesin for various times and lysed, and extracts of these agonist-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using a site-specific antibody (referred as FAK-Ser(P)-843) that detects the phosphorylated state of FAK at Ser-843. As illustrated in Fig. 1, upper panel, FAK-Ser(P)-843 immunoreactivity was virtually absent before bombesin stimulation, indicating that Ser-843 of FAK was not phosphorylated in quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells. Upon bombesin stimulation, FAK-Ser(P)-843 immunoreactivity of a single protein band migrating in SDS-PAGE at the expected apparent molecular mass for FAK (120 kDa) increased dramatically in a sharply time-dependent manner. An increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 was detected as early as 5 s after the addition of the agonist, reached a maximum within 1 min, and declined rapidly toward base-line levels within 5-10 min. The maximal increase of FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 induced by bombesin was 9.5 ± 0.8-fold, as compared with the unstimulated level. Bombesin stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells induces FAK phosphorylation at multiple sites, including Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site, and Ser-910, which is phosphorylated through an ERK-dependent pathway (10Salazar E.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28371-28378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The bombesin-induced increase in FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation precedes the phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues, including Tyr-577 in these cells (10Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 38Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28371-28378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To compare the kinetics of FAK phosphorylation at these sites with that of Ser-843 under identical experimental conditions, FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 and Tyr-397 was also determined by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies that detect the phosphorylated state of these residues. In agreement with our previous results (10Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), bombesin stimulated FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 within 30 s after the addition of the agonist, reached a maximum within 1-2 min, and remained relatively constant up to 30 min (Fig. 1). FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in response to bombesin demonstrated a more gradual increase, detectable after 2.5 min of treatment and reaching a maximal stimulation 20 min after the addition of the agonist, also in line with our recent report (35Hunger-Glaser I. Salazar E.P. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22631-22643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinetics shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the increase in the phosphorylation of Ser-843 is the earliest phosphorylation of FAK induced by bombesin receptor stimulation in Swiss 3T3 cells. The striking and sharply time-dependent increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 in response to bombesin prompted us to determine whether this phosphorylation is also elicited by activation of other endogenously expressed GPCRs, including bradykinin and vasopressin. To determine the effect of these agonists on FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with either 100 nm bradykinin or 50 nm vasopressin for various times and lysed. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FAK antibody, and the level of FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 was determined by Western blot analysis using the FAK-Ser(P)-843 phospho-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, bradykinin induced a rapid and transient increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 that was detectable within 5 s, maximal by 1 min, and at near base-line levels by 10-20 min. Vasopressin also evoked a rapid and transient increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 is rapidly and transiently induced by a variety of GPCR agonists, including bombesin, bradykinin, and vasopressin in Swiss 3T3 cells. Next, we attempted to identify the signaling pathway(s) leading to rapid FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 in response to bombesin, bradykinin, and vasopressin. The binding of these biologically active peptides to their cognate GPCRs promotes Gαq-mediated activation of β isoforms of phospholipase C to produce 2-s messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores, and diacylglycerol, which activates conventional and novel protein kinase Cs. Bombesin, bradykinin, and vasopressin also induce Rho-dependent actin remodeling, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, association of FAK and Src, transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor, and activation of the ERKs (39Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 40Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 21: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 41Rozengurt E. J. Cell.

Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22631-22643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consequently, we initially examined whether the increase in FAK-Ser-843 phosphorylation in response to bombesin could be mediated by any of these pathways. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were pretreated with GF 1 or Ro31-8220, potent inhibitors of phorbol ester-sensitive isoforms of protein kinase C, followed by stimulation with bombesin. As shown in Fig. 3A, cell pretreatment with these protein kinase C inhibitors had no significant effect on FAK-Ser-843 phosphorylation in response to bombesin. Furthermore, inhibition of MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)-mediated ERK activation with U0126, Rho-associated kinase activity with HA-1077 or Y27632, Src activity with pyrazolopyrimidine 2, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity with AG1478, or disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D did not interfere with FAK-Ser-843 phosphorylation induced by bombesin. These results are in line with the kinetic experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2, demonstrating that the increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 induced by bombesin in 3T3 cells occurs more rapidly than the increase in the activity of most other phosphorylation cascades studied in this system (10Salazar E.P.

Thus, the kinetic and pharmacological evidence indicates that bombesin-induced FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843 is mediated through protein kinase C-, ERK-, and Rho-associated kinase-independent pathways. We previously demonstrated that bombesin, vasopressin, or bradykinin induce a rapid (within 1-2 s) increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) that peaks 15-20s after the addition of agonist (46Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Rozengurt E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2211-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 47Lopez-Rivas A. Mendoza S.A. Nånberg E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Consequently, we examined whether an increase in [Ca2+]i could trigger FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843. As a first step to examine this possibility, Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin for various times at a concentration (500 nm) that rapidly increases [Ca2+]i in these cells (results not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, ionomycin induced a rapid increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843, which was already striking within 6 s and peaked by 30-60s followed by a gradual decline toward baseline levels. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i is a potential pathway leading to the rapid FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843. To determine whether an increase in [Ca2+]i is necessary for bombesin-induced FAK phosphorylation at Ser-843, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were treated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of BAPTA/AM, a membrane-permeable form of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (49Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). After preincubation with BAPTA/AM, th"

In contrast to vertebrates, flies and worms express only one of the Raf isoforms corresponding to B-Raf.

This cascade is conserved throughout evolution and consists of Raf, the dual specificity kinase MEK, and the MAP kinase ERK. Downstream of this cascade, activated ERK phosphorylates a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear targets (2Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H.

Upon mitogenic stimulation, Raf is recruited to the plasma membrane by Ras (8Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3913-3916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of Raf is a critical step for Raf activation (10Dhillon A.S. Kolch W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the case of Raf-1, negative regulation of the kinase activity involves phosphorylation of Ser-259 by Akt/protein kinase B (11Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) and of Ser-43 and Ser-233 by protein kinase A (12Schramm K. Niehof M. Radziwill G. Rommel C. Moelling K. Biochem. Biophys.

Full activation of Raf-1 requires the dephosphorylation of Ser-259 and the phosphorylation of several critical residues at the N-terminal side of the catalytic domain, including the phosphorylation of Ser-338 by p21-activated kinase (PAK) or by uncharacterized Ras-activated kinases and the phosphorylation of Tyr-341 by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src (2Abraham D.

In addition, the phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Thr-491 and Ser-494 located in the kinase activation loop is necessary for Raf-1 activation (17Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the case of B-Raf there are two aspartic residues at the position equivalent to Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 in Raf-1, which were proposed to mimic Src-dependent phosphorylation (4Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 15Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, the residue corresponding to the PAK-1 phosphorylation site of Raf-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in the case of B-Raf. These modifications lead to an elevated basal kinase activity of B-Raf compared with Raf-1. The simplified regulation of B-Raf activity may be the reason why a single point mutation can transfer B-Raf in a potent oncoprotein, as was shown recently in human melanomas (18Davies H.

This complex includes highly abundant proteins such as 14-3-3 as well as heat shock proteins (20Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Apart from these proteins, genetic studies in yeast and invertebrates revealed the important role of scaffold proteins as organizing centers for signal transduction (22Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mammalian scaffold proteins include the positive regulators of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway MP1 (MEK partner 1) and Ksr (kinase suppressor of Ras) (23Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In flies, genetic screens for mutations that modify a ksr-dependent phenotype identified a novel gene, the connector enhancer of ksr (cnk). CNK is a multidomain protein and acts as regulator of Ras signaling (25Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal portion of CNK strongly cooperates with RasV12G37, a Ras effector loop mutant known to activate the Ral pathway in mammalian cells. The C-terminal portion of CNK binds to D-Raf and blocks Ras- and Raf-dependent signaling, probably by titrating out specific signal molecules (26Douziech M. Roy F. Laberge G. Lefrancois M. Armengod A.V. Therrien M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Therrien M. Wong A.M. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13259-13263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, Drosophila CNK can act on several signaling pathways downstream of Ras and upstream or in parallel to Raf. The importance of CNK in the Ras cascade has been shown in insect cells by a down-regulation of CNK that correlates with the reduction of ERK-dependent insulin stimulation (28Anselmo A.N. Bumeister R. Thomas J.M. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5940-5943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to Drosophila CNK, there exist three CNK proteins in mammals, namely CNK1, CNK2A, also designated as MAGUIN-1, and the spliced form CNK2B/MAGUIN-2 (29Yao I. Hata Y. Ide N. Hirao K.

Matsushima S. Taki W. Inada H. Takai Y. Inagaki M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CNK2A, the homologue of Drosophila CNK, interacts with the Ras effector proteins Raf and Rlf and supports neuronal differentiation (31Bumeister R. Rosse C. Anselmo A. Camonis J. White M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Yao I. Ohtsuka T. Kawabe H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Hata Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Whereas the expression of CNK2A and CNK2B is restricted to brain tissue, CNK1 is expressed ubiquitously. CNK1 interacts with the GTPase Rho, several other proteins of the Rho-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and the Ras effector Ral-GDS (guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator), thereby integrating different signal transduction pathways (34Jaffe A.B. Aspenstrom P. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1736-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Schmidt A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we report on the direct interaction between human CNK1 and Raf-1. We demonstrate that CNK1 interacts with preactivated forms of Raf-1. In addition, CNK1 interacts with Src and is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) via the Src kinase. CNK1 regulates the Src-mediated Raf-1 activation in the concentration-dependent manner typical for scaffold proteins. Knock-down of CNK1 by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) resulted in reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent ERK stimulation, a pathway known to involve Src as an activator of Raf-1 (36Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, CNK1 allows a cross-talk between Src and Raf-1, which is essential for full activation of Raf-1. The cDNA of human CNK1 was subcloned from pBS-CNK1 (provided by M. Therrien and G. M. Rubin) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The coding sequences for the HA and FLAG tags were inserted 5′ to the start codon. CNKnt contains the sequence 5′ to the Aat II restriction site (nucleotide position 939), and CNKct contains the sequence 3′ to the Aat II site. Wild-type Src cDNA was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The Raf1, MEK, and Ras constructs were described previously (37Zimmermann S. Rommel C. Ziogas A. Lovric J. Moelling K. Radziwill G.

To express siRNA against CNK1 or firefly luciferase (GL2) as control, the following annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into pSUPER (39Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

The cassette coding for the H1 promoter and the siRNA sequence were subcloned into the self-inactivating retroviral vector pMSCVpuroΔ3′LTR that was obtained by deletion of the 3′LTR of pMSCVpuro (Clontech). All of the Raf-1 constructs used were described elsewhere (37Zimmermann S. Rommel C. Ziogas A. Lovric J. Moelling K. Radziwill G.

The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG-M2 and anti-FLAG-M2 peroxidase conjugate (Sigma); anti-HA (12CA5), anti-HA (3F10) peroxidase conjugate (Roche Applied Science); anti-ERK2 (C14), anti-Raf-1 (E10), and anti c-Src (SRC2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-c-Raf (pYpY340/341) (BioSource); phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology). Anti-CNK1 was generated in rabbits using the amino acids 1-331 of CNK1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) as the antigen (F. Bootz, Institut für Labortierkunde, University of Zürich). Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells and human epithelial HEp2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of HEK293T and HEp2 cells were performed by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (40Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen). For starvation of cells, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum 24 h after transfection, and cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. For inhibition of Src kinase activity, cells were preincubated with the Src inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem Inc.) 1 h before cell lysis. Stimulation of cells with VEGF (Sigma) were performed as indicated. Recombinant retrovirus was generated by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with the retroviral vector pMSCVΔ3′LTR encoding the siRNA and the two packaging plasmids pVPack-GP and pVPack VSV-G (Stratagene). The virus-containing supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and used for transduction of HEp2 cells. Stably transduced cells were selected with medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted, and the lysate was precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with an appropriate antibody pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed five times in lysis buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of the trimeric complex, lysates containing FLAG-Raf, HA-CNK, and Src were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively, and FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted three times for 15 min each time with anti-FLAG peptide (Sigma) in NETN buffer. One-twentieth of the eluate was used for direct analysis of bound proteins, and the residual eluate was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody. Samples were separated by electrophoresis with 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (38Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and precleared with protein G-Sepharose. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein detection reagent, and equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. FLAG-Raf was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Raf activity was measured in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.5 μg of kinase-defective GST-MEK (Upstate Biotechnology) for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila identified the protein CNK as a novel molecule required for signaling via Ras effector proteins (25Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the role of human CNK1 in the Raf-1 signaling pathway. First, we tested whether Raf-1 can directly interact with CNK1. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged CNK and different FLAG-tagged Raf constructs (see Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitates of Raf proteins were probed with the anti-HA antibody to demonstrate binding of CNK to Raf (Fig. 1B, top). The interaction between the wild-type proteins of Raf and CNK was detectable but weak. Coexpression of activated RasV12 enhanced the association between the two proteins, indicating that Raf-1 preactivated by RasV12 undergoes a conformational change that improves its binding to CNK1. The N terminus of Raf (Rafnt) and the C terminus of Raf (Rafct) bound equally well to CNK, indicating that there are two binding sites for CNK on Raf-1. Coexpression of RasV12 did not affect either one of these interactions. To mimic the activation of Raf-1, we analyzed the constitutively active Raf mutants Raf-S259A and Raf-Y340D (41Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, bottom section). These mutants interacted with CNK without the help of RasV12. A kinase-defective Raf mutant, Raf-K375E, and a mutant defective in binding to activated Ras, Raf-R89L, showed only residual binding to CNK1 in unstimulated cells. In RasV12-activated cells, both Raf mutants were able to bind to CNK1 (Fig. 1B, bottom section). Because B-Raf, the human homologue of Drosophila D-Raf, has an elevated basal kinase activity, we include this Raf protein in our study. In contrast to Raf-1, B-Raf bound to CNK1 without the coexpression of activated Ras (Fig. 1C). The interaction between CNK1 and B-Raf was preferentially exerted via the C terminus of CNK1 (Fig. 1C). To support the biological relevance of the interaction between CNK1 and Raf-1, we analyzed endogenously expressed proteins. Expression of CNK1 was well detectable in different epithelial cell lines such as HEp2, MCF10A, and HeLa, and lower levels were present in HEK293 cells. Coprecipitation of endogenously expressed CNK1 and Raf-1 was well detectable in epithelial cells, but only after the coexpression of activated Ras (Fig. 1D). Replacing RasV12-dependent stimulation of cells by mitogens did not result in a detectable association between Raf-1 and CNK1 (data not shown), perhaps due to the activation of only a small subpopulation of the cytosolic pool of Raf-1 by mitogens (9Hallberg B. Rayter S.I. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3913-3916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that the interaction between CNK1 and Raf-1 depends on the activation state of the cells. Genetic and biochemical data showed that scaffold proteins like Ste5 in yeast or the Jun-interacting protein JIP in mammals can form dimers or even oligomers, which are important for exerting their biological function (42Yablonski D. Marbach I. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13864-13869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 43Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the multidomain protein CNK1 can form dimers or oligomers, two differentially tagged CNK proteins, HA-CNKwt and FLAG-CNKwt, were coexpressed in HEK293T cells. This assay might lead to an underestimation of complex formation, because FLAG-CNK/HA-CNK heterodimers, but not homodimers, can be identified under these conditions. In the first set of the experiment the dimerization of CNK proteins was only weakly detectable. However, coexpression of activators of the MAP kinase pathway such as RasV12 or the constitutively active MEK mutant MEK-Glu-217/Glu-221 (MEK-EE in Fig. 2) strongly induced dimerization of the CNK proteins (Fig. 2). CNK1 is phosphorylated through the MEK pathway, which may trigger CNK1 dimerization. 2A. Ziogas, K. Moelling, and G. Radziwill, unpublished observation. MEK-dependent phosphorylation has been shown also for CNK2 (33Lanigan T.M. Liu A. Huang Y.Z. Mei L. Margolis B. Guan K.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transient activation of the MAP kinase pathway by treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not induce dimerization of CNK proteins (data not shown). This result indicates that strong or prolonged activation of the MAP kinase pathway is necessary to trigger formation of CNK dimers or oligomers. The primary structure of CNK1 predicts a multidomain protein without a catalytic function, suggesting a function as a scaffold protein, e.g. for the MAP kinase pathway. To test this possibility, we searched for interacting partners of CNK1. Whereas the downstream effectors of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK did not bind, the upstream activator of Raf-1, Src, associated with HA-CNKwt (Fig. 3, top section). This interaction depended on the N-terminal part of CNK, because CNKwt and CNKnt, but not CNKct, retained interaction with Src. Src also induced phosphorylation of CNK1 on tyrosine residues, but, in contrast to binding, phosphorylation of CNK1 took place at its C terminus (Fig. 3, second section from top). A kinase-defective Src mutant, used as control, did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of CNK1 (data not shown). These results identified Src as a novel binding partner for CNK1, which could act thereby as an additional scaffold in Raf signaling. The maximal activation of Raf-1 requires cooperation of the Ras-dependent recruitment to the plasma membrane and the Src-dependent phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Our interaction studies indicate that CNK might function as a scaffold protein for Raf-1 and Src. Therefore, we tested to determine whether CNK1 could bind Raf-1 and Src simultaneously in a trimeric complex. FLAG-Rafwt was coexpressed with Src-wt in the presence or absence of HA-tagged CNKwt. Raf was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted from the antibody with the FLAG peptide (Fig. 4, top section). Eluates, which contained equal amounts of Raf, were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with the anti-Src antibody. This sequential precipitation showed that Rafwt indeed formed a trimeric complex with CNK and Src (Fig. 4, second section from top). A kinase-defective mutant of Raf-1, Raf K375E, which only has a residual affinity to CNK (Fig. 1B), did not form a complex with CNK and Src. These results show that CNK1, Src, and Raf-1 form a trimeric complex and strongly support the notion that CNK1 may act as a scaffold to regulate Raf-1 activation. One function of scaffold proteins is to organize and thereby regulate signaling pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of CNK1 on Raf-1 activation and Raf-1-dependent stimulation of MEK and ERK. Ectopic expression of CNK1 had no effect on the basal kinase activity of Raf-1, MEK, or ERK (data not shown). However, CNK1 interfered with the Src-dependent activation of Raf-1. Constant amounts of Src and FLAG-Rafwt were coexpressed with an increasing amount of HA-CNKwt in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5A). Without coexpression of HA-CNKwt, Src induced a weak tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf. Coexpression of a low amount of HA-CNKwt increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1. Higher levels of HA-CNKwt led to the opposite effect, the loss of Src-dependent Raf-1 phosphorylation. ERK phosphorylation behaved similarly to Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Low levels of CNKwt increased ERK phosphorylation, whereas higher levels of CNKwt decreased it. Next, we tested to determine which domain of CNK1 is required for Src-dependent Raf activation. In this case, the activation of Raf-1 was monitored by in vitro kinase assays using immunopurified Raf as the kinase and MEK fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-MEK) as a Raf-specific substrate. Consistent with tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Fig. 5A), low levels of the wild-type CNK1 protein increased Src-dependent Raf activation, whereas higher levels decreased it (Fig. 5B). In addition, large amounts of CNKnt, but not CNKct, significantly decreased Src-dependent Raf activation (compare 0.5 μg and 2.5 μg of DNA), probably because CNKnt, but not CNKct, titrate out Src, which binds just to the N-terminal part of CNK1 (Fig. 3). These results indicate that CNK1 regulates the Src-dependent activation of Raf-1 only under optimized conditions. Too low or too high amounts of CNK1 prevented the formation of the trimeric complex and promoted dimerization between CNK1 and Src or Raf-1, thereby preventing activation of Raf-1 by Src. We showed that CNK1 transmits the signal from active Src to the Raf pathway. The growth factor VEGF specifically induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 via Src (36Alavi A. Hood J.D. Frausto R. Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This pathway results in ERK stimulation and protects cells from apoptosis. Because CNK1 is well expressed in epithelial cells and because the expression of VEGF receptors is not restricted to endothelial cells (44Tian X. Song S. Wu J. Meng L. Dong Z. Shou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Stewart M. Turley H. Cook N. Pezzella F. Pillai G. Ogilvie D. Cartlidge S. Paterson D. Copley C. Kendrew J. Barnes C. Harris A.L. Gatter K.C. Histopathology. 2003; 43: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we have chosen epithelial cells to analyze a putative function of CNK1 in VEGF-dependent signaling. To knock-down CNK1 in HEp2 cells, we stably expressed siRNA specifically targeting CNK1 (Fig. 6, top section). For the control, siRNA against firefly luciferase (GL2) was used. VEGF stimulated ERK phosphorylation in control cells, but this stimulation was impaired in CNK1-depleted cells (Fig. 6, second section from the top, compare third and fourth lanes from the left). As expected, Src mediated VEGF-dependent stimulation of ERK, because pretreatment of cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 reduced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6, second section from the top, compare third and fifth lanes from the left). As shown in Fig. 5A, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of"

In the present study, we demonstrate that agents that depolymerize (latrunculin B and cytochalasin D) or stabilize (jasplakinolide) the actin cytoskeleton blocked agonist-induced endocytosis of the β isoform of the thromboxane A2 receptor (TPβ) in HEK293 cells. This suggests that endocytosis of TPβ requires active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, disruption of microtubules with colchicine did not affect endocytosis of the receptor. Expression of wild-type and mutant forms of the small GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 potently inhibited endocytosis of TPβ, further indicating a role for the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in this pathway. Agonist treatment of TPβ in HEK293 cells resulted in the formation of actin stress fibers through Gαq/11 signaling. Because we previously showed that endocytosis of TPβ is dependent on arrestins, we decided to explore the relation between arrestin-2 and -3 and actin in endocytosis of this receptor. Interestingly, we show that the inhibition of TPβ endocytosis by the actin toxins in HEK293 cells was overcome by the overexpression of arrestin-3, but not of arrestin-2. These results indicate that the actin cytoskeleton is not essential in arrestin-3-mediated endocytosis of TPβ. However, arrestin-3 could not promote endocytosis of the TPβY339A and TPβI343A carboxyl-terminal mutants when the actin cytoskeleton was disrupted.

Two TP isoforms have been characterized in human: TPα (343 amino acids) and TPβ (407 amino acids), which share the first 328 amino acids but differ in their carboxyl-terminal tail (C-tail) regions (2Hirata M.

The major signaling pathway of thromboxane A2 and its receptor is via the activation of the Gq/11 family (12Foley J.F. Kelley L.P. Kinsella B.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Increasing data indicate that receptor signaling participates in GPCR endocytosis. In this regard, we have recently shown that the first step in the regulation of agonist-mediated endocytosis of TPβ involves the activation of Gαq signaling (14Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Gαq regulates TPβ agonist-induced endocytosis is still unclear and is one of the major research interests of our laboratory. It is known that GPCR-mediated activation of Gα12/13 leads to formation of actin stress fibers, through regulation of the small Rho GTPase protein (15Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent studies reported that the activation of the Rho signaling pathway could be achieved by a Gαq/11-dependent mechanism and that distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho were involved in Gαq-versus Gα12/13-mediated activation of Rho signaling (16Vogt S.

An important cellular response to an extracellular signal is the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton has many functions in eukaryotic cells like locomotion by extension of pseudopods, intracellular protein transport, and endocytic processes (19Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Mullins R.D. Curr.

Several studies characterized the role of actin filaments and actin-based motor proteins in endocytosis in yeast (21Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

However, the role of the actin cytoskeleton in GPCR endocytosis in mammalian cells is still controversial. Functional relation between clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton in these cells has been proposed based on recent findings demonstrating that several components of the mammalian endocytic machinery directly or indirectly interact with the actin cytoskeleton (19Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 modulate GPCR desensitization, signaling, and act as adapter proteins in GPCR endocytosis (23Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We observed previously that arrestin-2 and -3 promoted agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ (4Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L.

Very little is known regarding the relation between arrestins and actin in the regulation of GPCR endocytosis. In the present study, we show that TPβ endocytosis requires actin dynamics and we characterize the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the arrestin-mediated endocytosis of TPβ. We also demonstrate that TPβ-mediated activation of Gαq signaling is involved in actin stress fiber formation, which is necessary for agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ.

Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). The Arr3R396A, Arr3ΔLIEF, and Arr3AAEA/R396A cDNA constructs were previously described (28Laporte S.A. Miller W.E. Kim K.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9247-9254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TPβ-GFP was constructed by isolating the TPβ coding sequence by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity System (Roche Applied Science) with the forward 5′-GAGGAATTCATGTGGCCCAACGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAGGGATCCCCATCCTTTCTGGACAGAGC-3′ primers using pcDNA3-HA-TPβ as template. The PCR fragment was cloned in the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) with restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI. Integrity of the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells grown to 75–90% confluence were performed using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty pcDNA3 vector was added to keep the total DNA amount added per plate constant. Cells grown on 60-mm plates were transfected using 6 μg of total DNA. Endocytosis Assays—Endocytosis of receptors was measured by ELISA using transiently transfected HEK293 cells as described previously (4Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 × 106 cells were grown overnight in 60-mm plates. The cells were then transfected with pcDNA3 alone (control) or co-transfected with pcDNA3-HA-TPβ or either indicated receptor constructs combined with pcDNA3-Arr3WT, pcDNA3-Arr2WT, pcDNA3-Arr3R396A, pcDNA3-Arr3ΔLIEF, pHook2-RhoA, pHook2-Rho(N17), pHook2-Rho(V12), pHook2-Cdc42, pHook2-Cdc42(L61), pHook2-Cdc42(N17), or RGS(GRK2). Overexpression levels of the arrestins, Rho, and Cdc42 constructs were adjusted to be equal between samples and were roughly 5-fold that of endogenous proteins as determined by Western blot analysis with respective specific antibodies. Transfected cells were maintained as described above for 24 h. Thereafter, 2 × 105 cells were transferred to 24-well plates pre-coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and maintained for an additional 24 h. To assess the agonist-induced endocytosis, the transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were pretreated with different cell-permeant actin toxins: latrunculin B (5 mg/ml for 1 h), cytochalasin D (2 mm for 20 min), jasplakinolide (10 mm for 30 min), or Me2SO (vehicle), followed by incubation with 100 nm U46619 at 37 °C for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde plus TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 5 min at room temperature followed by washing three times with TBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (Babco) at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS/bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Three washes with TBS buffer followed, and cells were briefly reblocked for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with a 1:1000 in TBS/bovine serum albumin of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with TBS, and a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad) was added following the instructions from the manufacturer. The resulting colorimetric reactions were measured using a Titertek MultisKan MCC/340 spectrophotometer. Cells transfected with pcDNA3 were studied concurrently to determine background. Values shown represent the mean ± S.E. of four to six independent experiments performed in triplicate. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—1.0 × 106 HEK293 cells stably transfected or not with the empty pcDNA3 vector (pcDNA3 cells) or pcDNA3-HA-TPβ (TPβ cells) were grown overnight in 60-mm plates as described above. The cells were then transiently transfected with the indicated constructs and maintained overnight as described above. Then, 2 × 105 cells were transferred on coverslips and further grown overnight. The cells were then stimulated at 37 °C with 100 nm U46619 before being fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde plus PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with an HA-specific monoclonal (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. Then, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS, followed by incubation with a goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with permeabilization buffer and incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (1:200 dilution) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were mounted using the Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope using a ×60 objective. Images were collected using SimplePCI Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Live Cell Fluorescence Microscopy of Pseudopods Extension—1.0 × 106 HEK293 cells stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector (pcDNA3 cells) or pcDNA3-HA-TPβ (TPβ cells) were grown overnight in 60-mm plates as described above. The cells were then transiently transfected with pcDNA3-EGFP-TPβ(pcDNA3 cells), pcDNA3-EGFP-Arr2, pcDNA3-EGFP-Arr3, or pcDNA3 (TPβ cells) and maintained overnight as described above. Then, 2 × 105 cells were transferred on coverslips and further grown overnight. The coverslips were mounted on a heating block at 37 °C on the microscope. Images were collected each 30 s during 60 min using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope with a ×60 objective. Agonist stimulation with 1 μm U46619 occurred after the capture of two images. Images were collected using SimplePCI Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Statistical Analysis—Statistically significant differences were assessed by t test with p values < 0.0005 (***), < 0.01 (**), or < 0.05 (*). Agonist-induced Endocytosis of TPβ Requires Actin Dynamics—We investigated the role of the actin cytoskeleton in TPβ agonist-induced endocytosis by ELISA in HEK293 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged TPβ using two different actin filament-disrupting agents, latrunculin B (Lat B) and cytochalasin D (Cyt D), as well as an actin filament-stabilizing agent, jasplakinolide (Jas). Lat B binds and sequesters actin monomers, whereas Cyt D cups the growing barbed end of actin filaments, both of them preventing actin polymerization by two distinct mechanisms. Cyt D depolymerizes predominantly the actin stress fibers, whereas Lat B disrupts both the cortical actin and actin stress fibers (29Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 30Cassimeris L. McNeill H. Zigmond S.H. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Jas stabilizes actin filaments by binding to their pointed end thereby promoting actin polymerization (32Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microtubules are also important constituents of the cell ultrastructure. Colchicine, a microtubule-disrupting agent, was also tested. As seen in Fig. 1A, disruption as well as stabilization of actin filaments significantly inhibited the agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ after 2 h of U46619 stimulation. Endocytosis of TPβ was inhibited by roughly 70% in the presence of Lat B and Cyt D, whereas Jas decreased it by ∼60% when compared with vehicle-treated cells. In contrast, colchicine did not affect the ligand-induced endocytosis of TPβ. A detailed time course analysis of agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ in the presence of these agents is presented in Fig. 1B. It can be seen that Lat B and Cyt D almost completely abrogated endocytosis of the receptor over the time intervals tested. Jas had a significant inhibitory effect on TPβ endocytosis as well after 60 min of agonist treatment. Colchicine did not modulate agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ. These results suggest that actin filaments, but not microtubules, are involved in TPβ endocytosis. Moreover, our data indicate that TPβ endocytosis requires actin dynamics because both actin-disrupting and actin-stabilizing agents prevented endocytosis of this GPCR. The role of actin assembly/disassembly in GPCR endocytosis is still controversial. We thus decided to determine the effects of Lat B, Cyt D, and Jas on endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), the prototypical GPCR for arrestin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Fig. 2 illustrates that the agonist-induced endocytosis of the β2AR was not affected by the actin-interfering agents used in this study. Thus, contrary to TPβ, agonist-induced endocytosis of the β2AR does not appear to require a dynamic actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the role of actin in GPCR endocytosis is specific to some GPCRs. This also showed that the effects of the agents observed on TPβ endocytosis were not the result of nonspecific cell toxicity. Small G proteins of the Rho family (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) are important players in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. To confirm the implication of actin dynamics in TPβ trafficking, we analyzed the effect of co-expressing wild-type and mutant RhoA and Cdc42 proteins on the agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ. The dominant-negative mutants of RhoA (RhoA(V12)) and Cdc42 (Cdc42(L61)), and their respective constitutively active mutants, RhoA(N17) and Cdc42(N17), were used. All of the RhoA and Cdc42 constructs significantly affected endocytosis of TPβ, with an inhibition ranging from 43 to 80% (Fig. 3). These results support our idea that TPβ endocytosis needs a fine regulation of active actin cytoskeleton rear-rangement, as will be discussed below. Stimulation of TPβ Rapidly Promotes the Formation of Actin Stress Fibers and Pseudopods—We were then wondering whether we could visualize actin cytoskeleton rearrangement after agonist stimulation of TPβ. For this purpose, HEK293 cells transiently expressing HA-TP treated or not with agonist were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to observe actin filaments by fluorescence microscopy. Phalloidin is a toxin that specifically binds to F-actin. Formation of actin stress fibers induced by activation of TPβ (Fig. 4A) or TPα (data not shown) was detected for different time points analyzed between 2 and 120 min. Interestingly, TPβ-containing endocytic vesicles were aligning themselves on underlying actin filaments (Fig. 4A, middle panel) after 30 min of receptor stimulation. We previously reported that the intracellular compartment where TPβ accumulated after sustained agonist treatment corresponded to the Rab11-positive recycling endosome (33Theriault C. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Prominent co-localization of actin and receptors was observed on endosomal endocytic compartments (Fig. 4A, bottom panel) after 60 min of incubation with agonist. The fact that both TPα and TPβ induce the formation of actin stress fibers but that only TPβ undergoes agonist-promoted endocytosis indicates that formation of actin stress fibers is not sufficient for receptor endocytosis. Other elements, such as receptor-specific sequences, must also be involved. To further confirm that the actin cytoskeleton was involved in endocytosis of TPβ, we also performed immunofluorescence microscopy in the presence of Lat B. Cells transfected with pcDNA3-HATPβ were labeled at 4 °C with an anti-HA antibody prior to internalization experiments to allow for detection of only the receptors that are trafficking from the cell surface, as we described previously (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Driss Rochdi M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7079-7085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Theriault C. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with Lat B as described above and were then stimulated or not with 100 nm U46619 for 60 min. As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment with Lat B inhibited both the actin rearrangement and endocytosis of surface receptors following U46619 stimulation when compared with Fig. 4A. The same results were obtained for time points ranging from 0 to 45 min of receptor stimulation (data not shown). These data clearly show that disruption of actin dynamics prevents TPβ entry from the cell surface into intracellular compartments, supporting our ELISA results from Fig. 1. It is known that extension of pseudopods requires sophisticated control of the actin cytoskeleton. Ge et al. (35Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) demonstrated that activation of the GPCR protease-activated receptor 2 promoted ERK1/2- and arrestin-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, polarized pseudopodia extension, and chemotaxis. Moreover, arrestins were shown to translocate to pseudopodia following protease-activated receptor 2 activation. Protease-activated receptor 2·arrestin·ERK1/2 complexes were enriched in pseudopodia after receptor stimulation. So we were curious to see whether U46619 treatment led to pseudopodia extensions in TPβ-expressing cells and to characterize the localization of TPβ and arrestins with respect to these extensions. HEK293 cells expressing TPβ-GFP, GFP-Arr2, or HA-TPβ and GFP-Arr2 were stimulated with U46619 and visualization of GFP-tagged proteins carried out by live cell fluorescence microscopy. Images were collected every 30 s for 60 min. Fig. 5 shows that U46619 treatment of TPβ-expressing cells results in the formation of pseudopods (arrows in upper and middle panels). Stimulation of TPβ triggered an enrichment of arrestin-2 in the pseudopod extensions (Fig. 5, right middle panel) when compared with a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern in the absence of receptor stimulation (Fig. 5, left middle panel) like reported for the protease-activated receptor 2 (35Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Distribution of GFP-Arr2 was not altered by agonist treatment in the absence of TPβ (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Activation of TPβ also appeared to promote its redistribution into the newly formed pseudopods (Fig. 5, upper panel). Live cell imaging showed that there was extension and retention of pseudopods following the first 60 min of agonist stimulation of TPβ after which all activity appeared to cease. GFP-tagged arrestin-3 behaved exactly as GFP-Arr2 (data not shown). TPβ-mediated Activation of Gαq Signaling Is Involved in the Formation of Actin Stress Fibers—One of the major pathways leading to the formation of actin stress fibers is through activation of RhoA via stimulation of Gα12/13. Recently, Vogt et al. (16Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) proposed that RhoA activation induced by receptor agonists via Gαq/11 also occurs although with lower potency than through Gα12/13 (16Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because we previously reported that agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ requires Gαq signaling and that we showed in the present study that it also necessitates actin rearrangement, we were then interested in evaluating the role of Gαq signaling in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in our system. To do so, we used the RGS domain of GRK2, which was shown to specifically inhibit Gαq/11 signaling (27Carman C.V. Lisanti M.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8858-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3-HATPβ and pcDNA3, or pcDNA3-HATPβ and pcDNA3-RGS(GRK2), were stimulated with 100 nm U46619 for 120 min. Fig. 6A demonstrates that the RGS(GRK2) construct drastically inhibited agonist-induced endocytosis of TPβ, further confirming our previous results concerning the role of Gαq"
https://openalex.org/W1966241689,"A/J mice with genetic alterations in K-ras, p53, or Ink4a/Arf were employed to investigate whether mice carrying these germline mutations would be susceptible to tobacco smoke-induced lung tumorigenesis. Transgenic mice of both genders and their wild-type littermates were exposed to environmental cigarette smoke for 6 months, followed by recovery in air for 5 months. A significant increase of lung tumor multiplicity was observed in K-ras, p53, or Ink4a/Arf mutant mice when compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, an additive effect was observed between the mice with a mutant p53 transgene and an Ink4A/Arf deletion during tobacco smoke-induced lung tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of the K-ras gene indicated that the mutations had occurred at either codon 12/13 or 61 in both spontaneously occurring (air control) and tobacco smoke-induced lung tumors. K-ras mutations were found in 62% of the tumors from air-control animals and 83% in those exposed to tobacco smoke. The mutation spectrum found in tumors from mice exposed to tobacco smoke is somewhat similar to that in tumors from air-control mice. In addition, we identified three novel mutations at codon 12: GGT (Gly) → TTT (Phe), ATT (Ile), and CTT (Leu). These findings provide evidence that K-ras, p53, and Ink4a/Arf mutations play a role in tobacco smoke-related lung carcinogenesis. The similarity of the mutation spectra in the K-ras oncogene observed in tobacco smoke-induced tumors, as compared to spontaneous tumors, suggests that tobacco smoke enhances lung tumorigenesis primarily through promoting spontaneously occurring K-ras mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2006239056,"Type I transglutaminase is a plasma membrane-anchored intracellular protein-protein crosslinking enzyme that is responsible for assembly of the keratinocyte cornified envelope during terminal keratinocyte differentiation. We recently described a novel protein, TIG3, that when expressed in keratinocytes causes increased transglutaminase activity and keratinocyte cell death. However, the mechanism of activation of transglutaminase by TIG3 is not known. We now extend our previous study and show that full-length TIG3 forms a complex with type I transglutaminase that is demonstrated by TIG3-transglutaminase co-precipitation. We also demonstrate that treating TIG3-expressing cells with monodansyl cadaverine, a competitive transglutaminase substrate, attenuates the TIG3-dependent response, suggesting that transglutaminase is an important mediator of TIG3 action. These findings suggest that TIG3 forms a complex with transglutaminase resulting in transglutaminase activation and that transglutaminase activity is required for the TIG3-dependent biological response."

Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11781) Google Scholar), is a phenomenon wherebysmall double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) induce the degradation of correspondingtarget mRNAs. When dsRNAs are introduced into cells, they are processed toyield RNAs of 21–23 nucleotides with overhangs of 2 or 3 nucleotides attheir 3′ ends. These small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)(2Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar,3Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar) are integrated into theRNA-induced silencing complex, and the RNA-induced silencing complex binds tothe complementary target mRNA with subsequent degradation of this mRNA(3Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). However, in mammaliancells, dsRNAs also have nonspecific inhibitory effects, which are knowncollectively as the interferon response. The use of synthetic siRNAs allowscells to escape the interferon response(2Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar), and such siRNAs are usedfor the induction of RNAi in mammalian cells. However, synthetic siRNAs arenot stable over the long term in cells, and their synthesis is also veryexpensive. Several groups, including our own, have circumvented these problems bydeveloping systems for vector-based RNAi(4Miyagishi M. Taira K.

There are two types of siRNA expression vector, the tandem type and thehairpin type. The hairpin type(11Kawasaki H. Taira K. NucleicAcids Res. 2003; 31: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) has sense and antisensenucleotides in a single chain, connected via an loop sequence, whereas thetandem type (12Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) has separatesense and antisense sequences. Hairpin-type vectors allow rapid formation ofstable hairpin structures with strong suppressive activity. By using ahairpin-type siRNA expression vector, we succeeded in constructing a vectorsystem that was genetically stable and had strong suppressive activity(12Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis by dsRNA is remarkable, not only with respect tothe interferon response that is associated with RNAi but also as a mechanismby which mammalian cells protect themselves against viral infection. However,the relevant mechanisms are poorly understood. It has been demonstrated thatinterferon (IFN) and dsRNA induce programmed cell death or apoptosis inmammalian cells (13Lengyel P. J.

IFN is a type of cytokine thatinduces the expression of a number of intracellular genes for the preventionof viral invasion and facilitates the apoptosis of infected cells. IFN inducesexpression of a dsRNA-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase (PKR)(14Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G.

PKR also functions as a signal transducer to mediate theactivities of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor κB(NF-κB) (16Gil J. Alcami J. Esteban M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR mightalso regulate the activities of apoptosis-related proteins, such as p53(17Yeung M.C. Lau A.S. J.Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25198-25202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Fas(18Takizawa T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. J.

Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, full details ofthe dsRNA-induced apoptotic network remain to be defined. In the present study, we attempted to identify components of thedsRNA-induced apoptotic pathway by using our library of siRNA expressionvectors. We screened ∼700 vectors that were targeted against 241 genes,which included genes for apoptosis-related proteins, kinases, transcriptionfactors, and other proteins, and we identified several interesting genes, forexample, genes for proteins in the Bcl-2 family and the mitogen-activatedprotein kinase (MAPK) superfamily (JNK/SAPK, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK). We show here that the dsRNA-induced apoptotic pathway iscomposed of at least three independent pathways as follows: the“classical” PKR-dependent pathway; a JNK/SAPK-mediatedmitochondrial pathway; and an ERK2-related pathway. Contrary to a previouslyaccepted hypothesis, ERK2 promoted dsRNA-induced apoptosis. Construction of siRNA Expression Plasmids—The constructionof siRNA expression plasmids was based on the pcPUR hU6 vector (iGENETherapeutics, Inc.;www.iGENE-therapeutics.co.jp).The vector includes a human U6 promoter, a puromycin resistance gene, andBspMI cloning sites. Because hairpin-type siRNA expression plasmids havehigher suppressive activity than tandem-type plasmids, we purchased syntheticoligonucleotides (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) in which sense and antisensenucleotides were connected by an 11-base hairpin loop and formed as a singlechain. After annealing, DNA fragments were ligated into the BspMI sites ofpcPUR hU6. Prediction of Target Sites—We constructed our own algorithmfor the prediction of target sites of RNAi. This algorithm is based on thepartial least squares method(12Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We used the algorithm toselect at least two target sites in each gene of interest. Culture and Transfection of Cells and Determination of CellViability—We cultured HeLa S3 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle'smedium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics.Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen),as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty six hours aftertransfection, cells were selected by exposure to 1 μg/ml puromycin for 24h. The pcPUR hU6 vector targeted against the Renilla gene forluciferase and hepatitis C virus (HCV) served as a negative control. Afterselection, individual populations of cells were resuspended in fresh mediumand divided among three wells in a 48-well plate, with 1 ×105 cells per well. After 18 h, 0.5 μg of poly(I-C) (AmershamBiosciences) was introduced into cells in the presence of FuGENE™ 6(Roche Diagnostics). Twenty four hours after transfection with poly(I-C),cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15min at room temperature prior to staining with 0.2% crystal violet. Reporter Genes and Assays of Activity—HeLa S3 cells weretransfected with 25 ng of firefly luciferase expression vector (pGL3; Promega,Madison, WI) plus 2.5 ng of Renilla luciferase expression vector and0.1, 1, 10, or 100 ng of 50-bp synthesized dsRNA or 0.1, 1, or 10 ng of U6promoter-driven hairpin vector that encoded a 50-bp hairpin RNA and thecontrol vector (pU6 and pUC 19), in individual wells of 48-well plates.Luciferase activity was analyzed 24 h after transfection using the DualLuciferase System (Promega). We added empty vectors to ensure that equalamounts of DNA were used in each transfection. Preparation of Duplexes of RNA Oligonucleotides—By using T7RNA polymerase (AmpliScribe; Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI), we preparedsense and antisense RNAs of 50 bp that were targeted against fireflyluciferase. The oligonucleotides were purified on a 6% polyacrylamide gel thatcontained 7 m urea, with subsequent purification by columnchromatography and ethanol precipitation. The purified sense and antisenseRNAs were annealed to generate duplexes. TUNEL Assay—Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nickend-labeling (TUNEL) analysis was performed with an in situ CellDeath Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cells on a slide were washed twicewith ice-cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at roomtemperature. After removal by washing with paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100and 0.1% sodium acetate were dropped on the slide, which was then incubatedfor 2 min on ice. After the slide had been washed again with PBS, 50 μl ofTUNEL reaction mix from the kit were placed on the cells, and they wereincubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells on the slide were then examinedunder a fluorescence microscope. Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were collected and washedwith ice-cold PBS, lysed in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA,10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, andComplete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). After sonication, thewhole-cell extract was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The concentrationof protein in the supernatant was quantified with a protein assay kit(Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fifteen to 20 μg ofprotein per lysate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Bands of proteins weretransferred to an Immobilon™-PSQ membrane (Millipore Corp.,Bedford, MA), and the membrane was subjected to immunoblotting withappropriate antibodies. The PKR-specific antibody was obtained from Santa CruzBiotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The actin-specific antibody was from Sigma.The antibodies against caspase 3, caspase 7, caspase 10, and Apaf-1 antibodieswere obtained from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against caspase 9, BAX, Bid,MST2, PKCα, ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, phospho-JNK/SAPK, p38MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, and caspase 8 were obtained from Cell SignalingTechnology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against VDAC were purchased from Oncogene(Cambridge, MA). Quantitation of the Release of Cytochrome c fromMitochondria— HeLa S3 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS,resuspended in 100 μl of cytoplasmic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40 and Complete Protease Inhibitormixture), and incubated on ice for 30 min. After homogenization by passagethrough a needle (25 gauge 5/8-inch), samples were centrifuged at 750 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The resultant supernatantwas centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to generate thecytoplasmic fraction. After quantification of protein as described above, 15μg of the fractionated proteins were assayed by Western blotting withcytochrome c-specific antibody (BD Biosciences). Rescue Experiment of the siRNA Expression Vector Targeted againstERK2—The construction of ERK2 expression plasmid was generated bysubcloning based on RT-PCR into pcEF9, which had an EF1α promoter and ahygromycin resistance gene. The ERK2 mutation was made by PCR-basedsite-directed mutagenesis. Three nucleotide mutations were introduced at thetarget sequence of siRNA expression vector without conversion of the aminoacids (G468C, C471G, and C477G), and the resultant plasmid was namedpcEF9-ERK2-Rescue. To generate stable cell lines, cells were transfected with8 μg of the linearized pcEF9 or linearized pcEF9-ERK2-Rescue vectors usingLipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), as described in the manufacturer'sprotocol. Thirty six hours after transfection, the cells were selected by 100μg/ml hygromycin for 2 days, followed by changes with fresh medium with 50μg/ml hygromycin several times for 3 weeks. For the rescue experiment, thetwo types of stable cells were transfected with siRNA expression vectorstargeted against Renilla luciferase (negative control) or ERK2,respectively. Thirty six hours after transfection, cells were selected by 1μg/ml puromycin for 24 h. After selection, individual populations of cellswere resuspended in fresh medium and divided among three wells in a 48-wellplate, with 1 × 105 cells per well. After 18 h, 0.5 μg ofpoly(I-C) (Amersham Biosciences) was introduced into cells as describedabove. Use of the siRNA Expression Vector Library Reduces the InterferonResponse—One of the most significant advantages of the siRNAexpression library, as compared with synthetic siRNA libraries, is thereduction in the interferon response in transfectedcells. 2H. Akashi, M. Miyagishi, T. Yokota, T. Watanabe, T. Hino, K. Nishina, M.Kohara, and K. Taira, unpublished data. Although ithad been postulated that the interferon response occurs only in response tolong dsRNAs and not to siRNAs, it was demonstrated recently that some shortsiRNAs could also induce the interferon response(21Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examinedthe interferon response induced by various types of short dsRNA in detail.Fig. 1, A andB, shows a comparison, in terms of the interferonresponse, between synthetic and vector-derived siRNAs. In the experiments shown in Fig.1, we used 50-bp dsRNA against firefly luciferase to sensitizecells. As shown in Fig.1A, the synthesized (i.e. in vitro transcribed)short dsRNA, targeted to the firefly gene for luciferase, apparently repressedthe expression of the firefly gene in a dose-dependent manner, but theexpression of Renilla luciferase was also suppressed, suggesting thata nonspecific effect might have occurred because of the interferon response.By contrast, the same short dsRNA transcribed from a U6 promoter (see belowfor details) inside cells did not induce the nonspecific reduction in thelevel of Renilla luciferase via the interferon response(Fig. 1B).Furthermore, we found that introduction of mutations (either C to U or A to G)in the stem region significantly reduced the interferon response that wasinduced by long and short dsRNAs.2 The extent of induction of theresponse depended on the sequence of the short siRNA, but it appeared to beadvantageous to avoid any possibility of a strong interferon response by useof siRNA expression vectors, rather than synthetic siRNAs, for theconstruction of libraries. Moreover, this feature was especially important,for example, in attempts to analyze the genes involved in dsRNA-inducedapoptosis, which includes the PKR pathway. Optimization of Conditions for Use of the Library of siRNA ExpressionVectors—A useful siRNA expression library should have strongsuppressive activity and high genetic stability. Although the hairpin-typesiRNA expression vectors had highly suppressive activity, 20–40% of ourconstructs acquired mutations within the hairpin region when such vectors wereintroduced into Escherichia coli. We resolved these problems bydesigning vectors with several C to T (or A to G) point mutations in the senseregion. Such vectors could be sequenced without any problems; they did notexhibit reduced suppressive activity, and they were genetically stable inbacterial cells. We also attempted to maximize suppressive activity byconstructing a loop based on the sequence of micro-RNA and several otherparameters (22Miyagishi M. Matsumoto S. Taira K. Virus Res. 2004; 102: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore,we constructed our own algorithm for the prediction of target sites of siRNAexpression vectors (12Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ouralgorithm ensures a high probability of suppressive activity. Our finaloptimized siRNA expression vector, which included a hairpin-type sequence, hada U6 promoter, mutations in the sense strand, and an optimized loop sequence.Our vector system allowed the generation of genetically stable and very activesiRNA expression libraries(12Miyagishi M. Taira K. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,22Miyagishi M. Matsumoto S. Taira K.

Screening of Genes with the Library of siRNA ExpressionVectors—To analyze dsRNA-induced apoptosis comprehensively by usingour library of siRNA expression vectors, we induced apoptosis by using dsRNA(poly(I-C)). To optimize conditions for screening, we examined two parametersfor the induction of apoptosis, the mode of exposure of cells to poly(I-C),and the method used for transfection. After optimization of transfectionconditions, we were able to induce cell death effectively by using smallamounts of poly(I-C). To confirm that cell death induced by poly(I-C) wasapoptosis, we performed TUNEL assays (Fig.1C). Fluorescence microscopy revealed aggregating nuclei(Fig. 1C,arrowheads) only in cells treated with poly(I-C), andpoly(I-C)-treated cells were TUNEL-positive. The microscopic images of cellsrevealed features typical of apoptosis. In addition, the cleavage of PARP, asdetected by Western blotting, indicated that poly(I-C) did actually induceapoptosis in HeLa S3 cells (Fig.1D). The activation of PKR is an important feature of dsRNA-induced apoptosis.Therefore, we selected PKR as a positive control.Fig. 2 shows stained cells,microscopic images, and the results of Western blotting analysis for siRNAexpression vectors directed against two target sites in the gene for PKR.These observations confirmed that our siRNA expression vectors were able tosuppress the expression of an endogenous gene and that our screening methodshould work in practice. For our screening analysis, we selected 241 specificgenes, including genes for pro-apoptotic proteins, kinases, transcriptionfactors, and various other proteins that appear to be related to apoptosis butwhose functions are poorly understood. We defined at least two target sites ineach gene to check the validity of our choice of targets. Identification of Genes That Inhibit dsRNA-inducedApoptosis—We transfected HeLa S3 cells with our siRNA expressionvectors (Fig. 3) by using onevector per well, and 36 h after transfection, we selected cells for resistanceto puromycin by exposure to the drug for 24 h. After puromycin selection,cells were counted and divided equally into three wells of a 48-well plate.Apoptosis was induced by transfection with dsRNA (poly(I-C)). Twenty fourhours after induction of apoptosis, we examined the effects of siRNAexpression vectors, and we identified several siRNA expression vectors(Table I), which inhibited thedsRNA-induced apoptosis, such as S3 inFig. 3. We categorized thegenes that inhibited the dsRNA-induced apoptosis to four groups, namelymembers of the caspase family, members of the Bcl-2 family, kinases, andothers. Members of the Bcl-2 family and kinases other than PKR have not beenimplicated previously as a part of the network that resulted in dsRNA-inducedapoptosis.Table IGenes identified using siRNA expression vectors that inhibiteddsRNA-induced apoptosisGroupGene productAccession no.Caspase familyCaspase 8NM_001228Caspase 3NM_004346Caspase 9NM_032996Caspase 10NM_001230Bcl-2 familyBAXNM_138761BidNM_001196Kinase familyPKRNM_002759MAP3K1XM_042066MAP3K2NM_006609MAP3K6NM_004672MAP2K1NM_002755MAP2K2NM_030662MAP2K4NM_003010MAPK1NM_002745MAPK9NM_002752MAPK13NM_002754MAPK14NM_139013STK3NM_006281MST2 (STK3)NM_002737MLK4NM_032435DAPK2NM_014326RIPK2NM_003821RIPK3NM_006871OthersCDC6NM_001254DEDDNM_004216VDACNM_003374Apaf-1NM_001160Cytochrome cNM_018947 Open table in a new tab Gil et al. (16Gil J. Alcami J. Esteban M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)described how dsRNA activates PKR via the binding of the dsRNA to twodsRNA-binding motifs. They also showed that PKR-mediated apoptosis involvesthe FADD-caspase 8 pathway(16Gil J. Alcami J. Esteban M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the genesfor the classical mediators of dsRNA-induced apoptosis, namely PKR, caspase 8,and caspase 3, we identified many interesting genes that have not beenconfirmed previously to play roles in dsRNA-induced apoptosis. The involvementof Bid, BAX, VDAC, cytochrome c, caspase 9, andApaf-1 suggests that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might playan important role in dsRNA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, identification ofgenes for ERK2, JNK/SAPK, p38 MAPK, MAP2Ks, andMAP3Ks suggests that MAPKs might be significant participants indsRNA-induced apoptosis. Several factors, which we identified using our vectorlibrary, might work in concert with each other and represent variousnetworks. Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway and dsRNA-inducedApoptosis—The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is one of the majorpathways to apoptosis and is initiated by various apoptosis-inducing signals.When an appropriate apoptotic signal reached the mitochondria, Bcl-2 proteinsmediated an increase in membrane permeability(27Wang G.Q. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Gambotto A. Kim T.H. Fang B. Rabinovitz A. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34307-34317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and cytochromec was released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. The releasedcytochrome c formed a complex with Apaf-1, and this complex activatedcaspase 9 and prolonged the apoptotic stimulus. The mediator between theapoptotic signal and the mitochondria was generally a Bcl homology 3domain-containing pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Bid is also amember of the Bcl-2 family, and its expression is induced by caspase 8(28Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Only a few reports(29Gil J. Garcia M.A. Esteban M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,30Panaretakis T. Pokrovskaja K. Shoshan M.C. Grander D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4543-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have noted a relationshipbetween the Bcl-2 family and the IFN response on the one hand or betweencaspase 9 and PKR on the other hand. Moreover, there has been no detailedanalysis of the association between the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway anddsRNA-induced apoptosis. In our screening study, many siRNA expression vectors targeted to genesrelated to the mitochondrial pathway were able to inhibit the dsRNA-inducedapoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4,siRNA expression vectors against genes for Bid, BAX, VDAC, caspase 9,Apaf-1, and cytochrome c appeared to inhibit dsRNA-inducedapoptosis. The suppressive activity for each vector was confirmed by Westernblotting, as demonstrated also in Fig.4. All our results together suggest a role for the mitochondrialpathway in dsRNA-induced apoptosis. To verify that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is relevant todsRNA-induced apoptosis, we performed Western blotting of cytoplasmicfractions isolated from HeLa S3 cells from 0 to 18 h after the induction ofapoptosis (Fig. 5A).Western blotting indicated that cytochrome c was released from themitochondria about 18 h after transfection with poly(I-C). This resultdemonstrated that the mitochondrial pathway was operative in dsRNA-inducedapoptosis. Next, we examined whether the siRNA expression vectors directedagainst mitochondrion-related genes could block the release of cytochromec in response to poly(I-C). As shown inFig. 5B, when we“knocked down” genes for Bid, BAX, or VDAC, the releaseof cytochrome c from mitochondria was suppressed. These resultsdemonstrated the participation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indsRNA-induced signaling. Moreover, we were surprised that “knockdown” of the genes for PKR and caspase 8 did not affect the release ofcytochrome c from mitochondria. Taken together, these resultsindicated that dsRNA-induced apoptosis required the mitochondrial pathway,which is independent of the pathway that includes PKR and caspase 8. MAPK Superfamily and dsRNA-induced Apoptosis—MAPK cascadesare ubiquitous signal-transduction modules that are involved in numerousintracellular phenomena (31Davis R.J. J. Biol.Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).There are at least three different MAPK cascades, which include ERK1/2, JNK(also known as SAPK), and p38 MAPK. It is generally accepted that ERK1/2signaling is involved in cell proliferation(32Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar), whereas the JNK/SAPK andp38 MAPK pathways are activated preferentially by extracellular stresses(33Dai Y. Yu C. Singh V. Tang L. Wang Z. McInistry R. Dent P. Grant S. CancerRes. 2001; 61: 5106-5115Google Scholar), such as oxidativestresses, radiation, UV light, and tumor necrosis factor-α. These latterpathways play roles in the triggering of apoptotic signals(34Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A.

A self-epitope, mDBM, derived from mouse dopamine β-mono-oxygenase (KALYDYAPI) sharing 44% sequence identity with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-derived immunodominant epitope gp33 (KAVYNFATC/M), has previously been identified as a cross-reactive self-ligand, presentation of which results in autoimmunity. A rat peptide homologue, rDBM (KALYNYAPI, 56% identity to gp33), which displayed similar properties to mDBM, has also been identified. We herein report the crystal structure of H-2Db·rDBM and a comparison with the crystal structures of the cross-reactive H-2Db·gp33 and non-cross-reactive H-2Db·gp33 (V3L) escape variant (KALYNFATM, 88% identity to gp33). Despite the large sequence disparity, rDBM and gp33 peptides are presented in nearly identical manners by H-2Db, with a striking juxtaposition of the central sections of both peptides from residues p3 to p7. The structural similarity provides H-2Db in complex with either a virus-derived or a dopamine β-mono-oxygenase-derived peptide with a shared antigenic identity that conserves the positioning of the heavy chain and peptide residues that interact with the T cell receptor (TCR). This stands in contrast to the structure of H-2Db·gp33 (V3L), in which a single conserved mutation, also present in rDBM, induces large movements of both the peptide backbone and the side chains that interact with the TCR. The TCR-interacting surfaces of the H-2Db·rDBM and H-2Db·gp33 major histocompatibility complexes are very similar with regard to shape, topology, and charge distribution, providing a structural basis for CD8 T cell activation by molecular mimicry and potential subsequent development of autoreactivity.

The molecular mimicry hypothesis postulates that T cells specific for microbial mimicking epitopes can cross-react with MHC-restricted self-peptides.

The development of autoimmunity has been commonly associated with CD4+ T cells (13Wucherpfennig K.W. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, there are now both clinical and experimental observations that suggest that autoreactive CD8+ T cells may also be involved (23Abdul-Majid K.B. Wefer J. Stadelmann C. Stefferl A. Lassmann H.

Although autoreactivity may result from a cross-reactive immune response to foreign molecules that mimic self proteins (19Oldstone M.B. Cell. 1987; 50: 819-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), the importance of molecular mimicry in the development of autoimmune disease remains somewhat controversial (27Benoist C. Mathis D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar).Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of H-2b mice (e.g. C57BL/6 mice) generates a CD8+ CTL response mainly directed toward three immunodominant epitopes (28Moskophidis D. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 50% of the total LCMV-specific CTL activity is directed toward one such peptide, gp33, which is immunodominant in the context of both H-2Kb and H-2Db (29Hudrisier D. Oldstone M.B. Gairin J.E. Virology. 1997; 234: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using transgenic mice with a TCR specific for the H-2Db·gp33 complex (p14 TCR), the potential for cross-reactive recognition of tissue-restricted self-peptides was examined. One of the self-epitopes identified was derived from dopamine β-mono-oxygenase (DBM) (18Ohteki T. Hessel A. Bachmann M.F. Zakarian A. Sebzda E. Tsao M.S. McKall-Faienza K. Odermatt B. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme expressed in the adrenal medulla that is responsible for the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline (30Nakano T. Kobayashi K. Saito S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Activated p14 TCR-transgenic T cells recognized target cells pulsed in vitro with either the mouse mDBM peptide (KALYDYAPI) or the rat homologue rDBM (KALYNYAPI) (18Ohteki T. Hessel A. Bachmann M.F. Zakarian A. Sebzda E. Tsao M.S. McKall-Faienza K. Odermatt B. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, after in vivo activation of the transgenic T cell population with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing gp33 (vacc-GP) through LCMV infection or administration of the gp33 peptide, CD8+ T cell infiltration and inflammation of the adrenal medulla were detected in conjunction with significantly increased levels of dopamine in the adrenal glands (18Ohteki T. Hessel A. Bachmann M.F. Zakarian A. Sebzda E. Tsao M.S. McKall-Faienza K. Odermatt B. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, infection with the LCMV variant 8.7 (which contains a single pV3L mutation in the gp33 epitope) as well as with control vaccinia VSV virus did not result in any infiltration of the adrenal medulla or in alterations of dopamine levels. Furthermore, the DBM peptide, sharing limited amino acid identity with gp33, could positively select the virus-specific p14 TCR in fetal thymic culture but was unable to induce clonal deletion (20Saibil S.D. Ohteki T. White F.M. Luscher M. Zakarian A. Elford A. Shabanowitz J. Nishina H. Hugo P. Penninger J. Barber B. Hunt D.F. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The self-epitope was expressed in complex with H-2Db on thymic epithelial cell lines and thymocytes that were selected by H-2Db·DBM proliferated vigorously in response to H-2Db·gp33 complexes. In summary, the data of Ohteki et al. (18Ohteki T. Hessel A. Bachmann M.F. Zakarian A. Sebzda E. Tsao M.S. McKall-Faienza K. Odermatt B. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Saibil et al. (20Saibil S.D. Ohteki T. White F.M. Luscher M. Zakarian A. Elford A. Shabanowitz J. Nishina H. Hugo P. Penninger J. Barber B. Hunt D.F. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the DBM peptide (mDBM, KALYDYAPI) is processed and presented by H-2Db, mimicking the LCMV-derived gp33 epitope in complex with the same MHC molecule in vivo, initiating autoreactive T cell infiltration within the adrenal medulla of the treated mice. A rat DBM peptide homologue (rDBM, KALYNYAPI), which only differs in position 5, was also identified in the study by Ohteki et al. (18Ohteki T. Hessel A. Bachmann M.F. Zakarian A. Sebzda E. Tsao M.S. McKall-Faienza K. Odermatt B. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rDBM peptide displayed similar properties to mDBM, stimulating proliferation and cytotoxicity of p14 T cells specific for the H-2Db·gp33 complex and acting as a partial agonist/antagonist. However, the rDBM peptide binds with a higher affinity to H-2Db, likely due to the presence of an asparagine residue at anchor position 5 instead of an aspartate in murine DBM (18Ohteki T. Hessel A. Bachmann M.F. Zakarian A. Sebzda E. Tsao M.S. McKall-Faienza K. Odermatt B. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The main purpose of this study was to provide a structural basis for activation of cross-reactive CD8+ T cells by epitope mimicry in a well-established mouse model. We present the crystal structure of H-2Db in complex with the rat homologue of the self-derived DBM peptide and its comparison with the previously determined crystal structures of H-2Db in complex with the cross-reactive immunodominant LCMV-derived gp33 peptide (31Achour A.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although sharing only 56% sequence identity, the rat DBM and the virus-derived gp33 peptides are presented in nearly identical manners by H-2Db, with a striking conservation of peptide conformation, especially in the central segment corresponding to residues p3-p7. The positioning of the side chains that may interact with the TCR is conserved. The conformations of some residues of the H-2Db heavy chain are changed to accommodate the differences between the viral and self-peptides. However, these changes do not infer significant differences on the surface areas of both MHC complexes that interact with the TCR. This study provides a structural basis for peptide molecular mimicry inducing CD8-dependent T cell cross-reactivity. The structures allow us to explain how a dopamine β-mono-oxygenase-derived peptide, sharing only a partial sequence similarity with the immunodominant LCMV-derived peptide gp33, permits the cross-reactivity of the gp33-specific TCR p14.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation and Crystallization of the H-2Db·DBM·mβ2m MHC Complex—The rDBM peptide (KALYNYAPI) was purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The refolding of the H-2Db·rDBM MHC complex was conducted as previously described (31Achour A. Michaelsson J. Harris R.A. Odeberg J. Grufman P. Sandberg J.K. Levitsky V. Karre K. Sandalova T. Schneider G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained in hanging drops by vapor diffusion. Crystal screens (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) were used to establish initial crystallization conditions, which were then refined in a finer grid. The best crystals for the H-2Db·rDBM·mβ2m complex were obtained in 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, at room temperature. Typically, 4 μl of a 3 mg/ml protein solution in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, were mixed at a 2:2:1 ratio with the crystallization reservoir solution and ethanol. The drops were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature.Data Collection and Processing—X-ray data were collected under cryogenic conditions (T = 100 K) to 2.7 Å resolution at beam line I711 in MaxLab, Lund, Sweden (λ = 1.0292 Å) using a MAR345 image plate. Crystals were soaked for a short time in a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% glycerol before data collection. The diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL program package (33Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods in Enzymology.in: Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are presented in Table I.

Refinement of the model was performed using the CNS suite of programs (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), and 4% of the reflections (2232 reflections) were set aside for monitoring the refinement by Rfree (36Brünger A. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar). The refinement started with rigid body refinement, treating the α1α2 (residues 1-182), α3 (residues 183-274), and β2-microglobulin domains as three separate units. After simulated annealing, the model was rebuilt where relevant using the program O (37Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar). An easily interpretable electron density was observed in the peptide binding cleft, and the peptide KALYNYAPI could be placed unambiguously in all four MHC complexes. The model was further refined by restrained and isotropic individual B-factor positional refinement. Tight restrained non-crystallographic symmetry was used throughout the refinement. 109 water molecules were added to the complex using the water-pick option in CNS (3σ in the Fo - Fc map), and the positioning of all water molecules was inspected manually in O. The final rounds of refinement were performed with the program Refmac (38Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). TLS refinement yielded final R and Rfree values of 21.7% and 26.1%, respectively. The stereochemistry of the models was analyzed using PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are provided in Table I. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the H-2Db·rDBM·mβ2m complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1ZHB.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have determined the structure of H-2Db in complex with rat DBM peptide (KALYNYAPI), which binds with a higher affinity to H-2Db than the mouse DBM peptide (KALYDYAPI). However, both the mouse and the rat DBM peptides are recognized by T cells expressing the H-2Db/LCMV gp33-specific p14 TCR, and both act as partial agonists/antagonists. Likewise, we have previously demonstrated that in the context of H-2Db, the structural conformations of the two most common sequence variants of the gp33 peptide, gp33(C) (KAVYNFATC) and gp33(M) (KAVYNFATM), are nearly identical (31Achour A. Michaelsson J. Harris R.A. Odeberg J. Grufman P. Sandberg J.K. Levitsky V. Karre K. Sandalova T. Schneider G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We will therefore refer to the virus-derived peptide gp33(M) as gp33 in the analyses presented hereafter.Overall Structure—As expected, the overall structure of H-2Db in complex with the β-mono-oxygenase-derived peptide rDBM is very similar to previously reported MHC crystal structures. The Rcryst and Rfree values for the refined model of the H-2Db·rDBM MHC are 21.7% and 26.1%, respectively (Table I). The stereochemistry is as expected for a model at this resolution (2.7 Å). The final electron density map is of good quality, with a well-defined polypeptide chain. In particular, the electron density for all residues in contact with the rDBM peptide and for the peptide is clearly defined (Fig. 1). The average peptide B-factor is less than the average B-factor of the heavy and light chains (Table I). The overall structures of the MHC molecules H-2Db in complex with rDBM (KALYNYAPI) or gp33 (KAVYNFATM) (31Achour A. Michaelsson J. Harris R.A. Odeberg J. Grufman P. Sandberg J.K. Levitsky V. Karre K. Sandalova T. Schneider G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are very similar, with a root mean square deviation of 0.70 Å2 for the whole complexes and 0.36 Å2 for the residues corresponding to the α1 and α2 domains (residues 1-182).Despite Large Sequence Disparity, the Conformations of the Peptides rDBM and gp33 Are Similar When Bound to H-2Db— The peptide rDBM shares only 56% sequence identity with the virus-derived epitope gp33. In particular, only one H-2Db anchor position is conserved in both epitopes (asparagine at position 5). Four other positions are conserved: lysine at p1, alanine at p2, tyrosine at p4, and alanine at p7. Conversely, rDBM and gp33 differ at four positions: 1) a valine in gp33 is replaced by a leucine in rDBM at p3, the secondary anchor position differs; 2) a tyrosine in gp33 is substituted with a phenylalanine in rDBM at p6, one of the main TCR-interacting positions; and 3) there are changes from a threonine and a methionine in gp33 to a proline and an isoleucine in rDBM at p8 and p9, respectively, at the C-terminal ends of both peptides. Some of these differences (e.g. the pV3L and pF6Y substitutions) may seem minor. However, when taken in the context of known functional and structural results, the cross-reactivity of the H-2Db·LCMV gp33-specific p14 TCR with H-2Db·rDBM is surprising.Upon CTL selection pressure, LCMV virus escape variants emerge that are based on single amino acid mutations in gp33. Clones displaying three of the most common single mutations (pV3L, pY4F, or pF6L) in the LCMV gp33 sequence escape gp33-specific CTLs in the context of H-2Db (40Pircher H. Moskophidis D. Rohrer U.

Biol. 2000; 302: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The escape peptides (all with 88% identity to gp33) abolish either all recognition by the p14 TCR or act as partial agonists/antagonists (43Tissot A.C. Ciatto C. Mittl P.R. Grutter M.G. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Bachmann M.F. Speiser D.E. Zakarian A. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3110-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutation of a valine to a leucine at position 3 of gp33 also allows LCMV strains to escape immune recognition without markedly altering the binding affinity of the modified peptide to H-2Db (32Velloso L.M. Michaelsson J. Ljunggren H.G. Schneider G. Achour A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The V3L mutation results in a decreased affinity of the p14 TCR by ∼40-fold compared with the wild type H-2Db·gp33 complex (43Tissot A.C. Ciatto C. Mittl P.R. Grutter M.G. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, conservative substitutions impair the binding of the p14 TCR to H-2Db in complex with mutated escape variants and result in abolished TCR recognition.We have recently performed comparative structural studies of H-2Db in complex with either wild-type gp33 or each of the three single-mutated escape epitopes pV3L, pY4F, and pF6L described above (32Velloso L.M. Michaelsson J. Ljunggren H.G. Schneider G. Achour A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the conservative mutations either induce localized conformational changes of peptide residues that interact with the TCR, such as p4 in H-2Db·gp33 (pV3L) and p6 in H-2Db·gp33 (pF6L), or result in two very similar structures with barely any differences except the removal of a hydroxyl group at the TCR/pMHC interface, such as in H-2Db·gp33 (pY4F) (32Velloso L.M.

Thus, the conservative escape variants introduced subtle structural modifications that mostly affected peptide residues that interact with the p14 TCR in the context of H-2Db. One of these escape substitutions (pV3L) is present in rDBM, and despite the limited sequence identity between rDBM and gp33, the p14 TCR is still able to interact with H-2Db in complex with either of these two peptides.Both the gp33 and rDBM peptides have the characteristic conformation for peptides bound to H-2Db in that they bulge from residues 6-8 (45Young A.C.

The peptide backbones align well with each other from residue p1K to residue p6F, whereas the backbone of rDBM shifts from residue 7 to residue 9 by 0.8 Å toward the peptide binding cleft of H-2Db (Fig. 3). The change from a valine in gp33 to a leucine in rDBM thus does not introduce any changes in the N-terminal half of the peptides. In conclusion, comparison of the bound peptid"

We report the crystal structure of TbPGFS·NADP+·citrate at 2.1 Å resolution. TbPGFS adopts a parallel (α/β)8-barrel fold lacking the protrudent loops and possesses a hydrophobic core active site that contains a catalytic tetrad of tyrosine, lysine, histidine, and aspartate, which is highly conserved among AKRs. Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic tetrad residues revealed that a dyad of Lys77 and His110, and a triad of Tyr52, Lys77, and His110 are essential for the reduction of PGH2 and 9,10-PQ, respectively. Structural and kinetic analysis revealed that His110, acts as the general acid catalyst for PGH2 reduction and that Lys77 facilitates His110 protonation through a water molecule, while exerting an electrostatic repulsion against His110 that maintains the spatial arrangement which allows the formation of a hydrogen bond between His110 and C11 that carbonyl of PGH2. We also show Tyr52 acts as the general acid catalyst for 9,10-PQ reduction, and thus we not only elucidate the catalytic mechanism of a PGH2 reductase but also provide an insight into the catalytic specificity of AKRs.

These studies revealed that bacterial and mammalian AKRs catalyze the oxidation/reduction through a catalytic mechanism that involves a catalytic tetrad of aspartate, tyrosine, lysine, and histidine. Although the roles of these residues on catalysis of the oxidation/reduction reaction for a number of substrates have been elucidated, little is known about the way they affect the oxidation/reduction of prostaglandins. Nonetheless, the positional and evolutionary conservation of the residues of this catalytic tetrad in AKRs from different biological kingdoms would suggest that this catalytic mechanism is probably common to all AKRs.PGF2α is one of the earliest discovered prostanoids for which the synthetic pathways and biological functions have been investigated extensively. PGF2α is synthesized by NADPH-dependent reduction catalyzed by AKRs of either the 9,11-endoperoxide moiety of PGH2 or the 9-keto group of PGE2 (12Wintergalen N. Thole H.H. Galla H.J. Schlegel W. Eur.

Rawer M. Szallies A. Fujimori K. Inui T. Nozaki T. Yamashita K. Horii T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1327-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the etiological agent of African trypanosomiasis in humans and animals. T. brucei PGF2α synthase belongs to 5A subfamily of the AKRs (16Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. Kabututu Z. Rawer M. Szallies A. Fujimori K. Inui T. Nozaki T. Yamashita K. Horii T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1327-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The uniqueness of this synthase stems from the discovery that it exhibits a high specificity toward PGH2 and shows no enzymatic activity toward substrates such as PGD2, PGE2, or PGF2α. TbPGFS catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of PGH2 to PGF2α in addition to the reduction of 9,10-PQ (a non-physiological substrate) and has the lowest Km value for PGH2 among the various AKRs. Although it has been shown that PGF2α elicits vacuole formation and thus may play the signal coupling role during phagocytosis in the protozoan parasite Amoeba proteus (32Prusch R.D. Goette S.M. Haberman P. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), little is known as to why T. brucei produces PGF2α. However, because African trypanosomiasis is characterized by miscarriage due to PGF2α overproduction correlated with parasitemia peaks (29Mutayoba B.M. Meyer H.H.D. Osaso J. Gombe S. Theriogenology. 1989; 32: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), findings that T. brucei possesses a TbPGFS suggest that this enzyme may well play a role in the pathogenesis of trypanosomiasis. Hence, the elucidation of TbPGFS structure and mechanism of catalysis is of importance because it may lead to the design of specific inhibitors needed for investigating the physiological role(s) of the enzyme in this organism.Here, we describe the x-ray crystallographic structure of the TbPGFS·NADP+·citrate ternary complex at 2.1 Å resolution. TbPGFS structure showed the positional and evolutionary conservation of Asp47, Tyr52, Lys77, and His110 in the catalytic pocket. Although the tyrosine residue has been essential for catalysis in most AKRs, our mutagenesis experiments on the catalytic tetrad revealed that TbPGFS required Lys77 and His110 but not Tyr52 for the biological reduction of PGH2 to PGF2α, whereas it needed Tyr52, Lys77, and His110 for the reduction of 9,10-PQ. Thus, we propose a catalytic mechanism by which a catalytic dyad of Lys77 and His110 in TbPGFS is involved in proton transfer to the 9,11-endoperoxide moiety of PGH2.MATERIALS AND METHODSStructure Determination and Refinement—Initially, we obtained some crystals with ammonium sulfate as a precipitant (33Okano Y. Inoue T. Kubata B.K. Kabututu Z. Urade Y. Matsumura H. Kai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 859-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After observing that citrate inhibited TbPGFS activity, we then crystallized TbPGFS in the presence of 1.4 m sodium citrate (used as a precipitant) at pH 7.0. These cryocooled crystals were obtained in the presence of trehalose, and the x-ray diffraction data were obtained up to 2.1 Å resolution at SPring-8 beam-line 12B2.The structure of TbPGFS was determined by a combination of molecular replacement methods using the AMoRe program (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The structure of Sus scrofa aldose reductase (Protein Data Bank code 1AH3) was used as a search probe (41% identity). After a rotational search at 3.0 Å resolution, we obtained two solutions corresponding to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit that had a correlation coefficient of 52.1% and R-value of 46.4%. Subsequent cycles of the structure refinement were done with the TURBO-FRODO program (35Roussel A. Cambillau C. The TURBO-FRDO Graphics Package. Silicon Graphics Corp., Mountain View, CA1996: 81Google Scholar) by alternating the model building after the rigid body minimization that allowed a complete polypeptide chain tracing. The quality of the final model was assessed from Ramachandran plots and by the analysis of the model geometry. The plot indicated that 87.7% of the residues were in the favorable regions, and 11.1% of the residues were in the allowed regions. Crystallographic refinement was carried out with the CNS program (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The refinement procedure included simulated annealing, positional refinement, restrained temperature factor refinement, and maximum likelihood algorithms as provided by the CNS program. Water molecules were inserted manually and then checked by inspecting the Fo - Fc map. NADP+ and the citrate anion could be inserted into the clearly defined electron density model only after the first cycles of refinement. All residues in the asymmetric unit were similar and exhibited a root mean square deviation of 0.26 Å upon structural alignment.Site-directed Mutagenesis—For point mutations of TbPGFS, highly conserved amino acid residues to be mutated were selected based on the detailed structural information of the TbPGFS·NADP+·citrate ternary complex. Polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was carried out to generate the appropriate mutated cDNAs. A series of sense (F) and antisense (R) primers containing mismatched codons for each mutant were designed for PCR mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce single (D47N, Y52F, K77L, K77R, H110A, and H110F), double (D47N/H110A, Y52F/K77L, Y52F/H110A, and K77L/H110A), and triple (Y52F/K77L/H110A) mutants. The single mutant enzymes were obtained by using the following respective oligonucleotide primer pairs: (F) 5′-GCTATCGTCACATCAATACT GCAGCCATCTATAAAAATG-3′ and (R) 5′-GTATTGATGTGACGATAGCCGC-3′; (F) 5′-GCAGCCATCTTTAAAAATGAAGAAAGCGCTGG-3′ and (R) 5′-CATTTTTAAAGATGGCTGCAGTATCGATG-3′; (F) 5′-GACGCTGCTTTGGAACTCCGACCAGGG-3′ and (R) 5′-CGGAGTTCCAAAGCAGCGTCGTGACGAATAGCTC-3′; (F) 5′-TCACGACGAGGCTTTGGAACTCCGAC-3′ and (R) 5′-GTTCCAAAGCCTCGTCGTGACGAATAG-3′; (F) 5′-ATCGCCTGGCCGGGGAAG GACAAG-3′ and (R) 5′-TCCTTCCCCGGCCAGGCGATGAGGTATAGGTCAAC-3′; and (F) 5′-ATCTTCTGGCCGGGGAAGGACAAG-3′ and (R) 5′-TCCTTCCCCGGCCAGAAGATGAGGTATAGGTCAAC-3′ (the bold and underlined codons indicate the site of mutations). Wild-type TbPGFS open reading frame from pGEX4T-1 was subcloned into pUC18, and the resulting Wt-pUC18 plasmid was used as template for PCR amplification. The first PCR, amplified with Pyro-Best polymerase (Takara Shuzo), was carried out with gene-specific sense F-primer for each mutant and antisense M13 R-primer, as well as with sense M13 F-primer and gene-specific antisense R-primer for each mutant. The resultant products from the first PCR of each mutant were mixed and used as a template for the second PCR, which used gene-specific sense F-primer of each mutant and antisense M13 R-primer, as well as gene-specific antisense R-primer for each mutant and sense M13 F-primer. Products from the second PCR of each mutant were cloned into pUC18 and sequenced. Subsequently, the open reading frames that contained mismatched codons were cloned in pGEX4T-1, and their sequences were checked.Expression and Purification of Mutant Enzymes—The coding region of wild-type and mutant TbPGFS cDNAs that carried EcoRI and SalI restriction sites at their respective 5′-end were cloned into the corresponding sites of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) to prepare TbPGFS-glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The resultant recombinant vectors were used for transformation of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were cultured for 8-10 h in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants were harvested by centrifugation; washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of reversible and irreversible inhibitors (1 tablet in 25 ml) of pancreas extract, Pronase, thermolysin, chemotrypsin, trypsin, and papain (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics); suspended in the same buffer; and disrupted by sonication. After removal of debris by centrifugation, the recombinant proteins in the supernatant were purified by affinity chromatography on reduced glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Wild-type and mutant TbPGFS fusion proteins bound to the resin via their glutathione S-transferase were cleaved with thrombin, and then TbPGFS was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/Cl (pH 8.0) buffer and applied to a DEAE anion-exchange column that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with an increase in linear gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in the same buffer.Protein concentrations were determined by use of bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE on 14% (w/v) gels, and the gels were stained with Sypro Orange (Bio-Rad) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Daiichi Pure Chemicals).Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Measurements—PGH2 reductase activity was measured by incubating at 37 °C for 2 min a reaction mixture containing an appropriate enzyme aliquot, 5 μm [1-14C]PGH2 (final concentration), 100 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 500 μm NADPH (31Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. Kabututu Z. Rawer M. Szallies A. Fujimori K. Inui T. Nozaki T. Yamashita K. Horii T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1327-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After the reaction had been terminated by the addition of 250 μl of stop solution (30:4:1 (v/v/v) diethyl ether/methanol/2 m citric acid), aliquots were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography as described previously (31Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. Kabututu Z. Rawer M. Szallies A. Fujimori K. Inui T. Nozaki T. Yamashita K. Horii T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1327-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the reduction of 9,10-PQ, the reaction mixture consisted of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), the enzyme, 100 μm NADPH, and 40 μm 9,10-PQ, in a total volume of 500 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate, and then the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (ϵ = 6270 m-1 cm-1) was monitored at 37 °C. Blanks without enzyme or without substrate were also included. kcat and Km values were calculated from initial velocity studies over a wide range of pH values using the triple buffer system containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm 3-[(1,1-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a small aliquot of enzyme in phosphate-buffered saline, and no significant change in the pH of the reaction mixture was observed before or after the addition of enzyme.UV and CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were recorded in Tris/Cl buffer (pH 8.0) on a J-600 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co.) equipped with a 1-mm path length cuvette. The temperature in the cell holder was maintained at 10 °C by a circulating water thermostat. The reported spectra were the mean of 10 scans at 50 nm·min-1.Fluorescence Quenching Assay—To determine the binding of NADPH to wild-type and mutant TbPGFS, we mixed various concentrations of NADPH with TbPGFS in a 200 μl reaction mixture that contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured by an FP-750 spectrofluorometer (Jasco International Co.) at an excitation wavelength of 282 nm and an emission wavelength of 338 nm (37Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30190-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence caused by nonspecific interactions with each ligand was corrected with 1.5 μm N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide. The Kd value for NADPH binding to TbPGFS was calculated as described by Levine (38Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe determined the structure of the TbPGFS·NADP+·citrate ternary complex by molecular replacement at 2.1 Å resolution with Rcryst and Rfree values of 23.1 and 26.8%, respectively.

Open table in a new tab TbPGFS is composed of a cylindrical core of eight parallel β-strands surrounded by 8 α-helices running antiparallel to the β-sheets (Fig. 1, A and B). This (α/β)8 structure is interrupted by two extra α-helices (H1 and H2) situated toward the COOH-terminal side of the molecule. The helix H1 lies in between β7 and α7, whereas H2 follows α8. The bottom of the barrel is sealed by a β hairpin-like structure made up of two additional anti-parallel β-strands, B1 and B2, corresponding to residues 7-9 and 14-16, joined by a tight turn. These extra structures, i.e. H1, H2, B1, and B2, have also been described in other members of the AKR superfamily (2Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Borhani D.W. Harter T.M. Petrash J.M. J. Biol.

The COOH-terminal 19 amino acid residues sketch out the upper part of the substrate-binding pocket by constructing a lip-like structure around the edge of the COOH-terminal face of the central β-barrel. The overall structure of TbPGFS is homologous to that of Corynebacterium 2,5-diketo-d-gluconic acid reductase A (2,5DKG) (8Khurana S. Powers D.B. Anderson S. Blaber M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6768-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), both of which belong to the fifth subfamily of the AKR superfamily (Fig. 1B). It is also essentially similar to the structures of members of the first subfamily of AKRs, including human aldose reductase (ADR) holoenzyme (2Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), porcine ADR (10Borhani D.W. Harter T.M. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24841-24847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat liver 3α-hydroxysteroid/dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) (4Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, one of the major structural differences between TbPGFS and members of the first subfamily of AKRs is the presence of shorter loops in the structure of TbPGFS. A superimposition, with a root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å from the corresponding Cα atoms, of the TbPGFS model on the rat 3α-HSD (Fig. 1C) showed deletions in loops β1-α1, β4-α4, and β7-H1 in TbPGFS in contrast to the presence of significantly longer loops in enzymes of the first subfamily of AKRs. As a result, TbPGFS possesses shallow cofactor- and substrate-binding sites, whereas rat 3α-HSD shows a deep corresponding site created by the longer loops. The presence of short loops in TbPGFS and Corynebacterium 2,5DKG may thus be a common characteristic of the members of the fifth subfamily of AKRs.TbPGFS does not possess the Rossmann fold for binding NADPH. The NADP+ pyridine nucleotide is bound in an extended conformation within a crevice that extends from the outer edge of the barrel to the inner core. The nicotinamide ring is positioned deep in the central region of the β-barrel. The NADP+ adenine and pyrophosphate groups are wedged on the surface of the depression between the α7 and α8 helices (Fig. 1B). The electron density map of the NADP+ molecule bound to TbPGFS (Fig. 2A) showed that the enzyme·NADP+ complex was stabilized by 16 hydrogen and 3 ionic bonds and 1 aromatic stacking interaction (Fig. 2B). The number of interactions is lower than that for AKRs of the first subfamily, such as human ADR holoenzyme and rat 3α-HSD, both of which have 19 hydrogen bonds, 3 salt bridges, and 1 aromatic stacking (2Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 4Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching assay (data not shown) revealed that the Kd value of TbPGFS for NADPH (5.3 μm) was 1 order of magnitude higher than that of rat 3α-HSD, i.e. 143 nm (40Pawlowski J.E. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13502-13510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a relatively loose binding of NADPH in TbPGFS as compared with the tight binding in AKRs of the first subfamily. The weaker affinity for NADPH may be responsible, in part, for the 3-fold higher NADPH Km value of 5.7 μm (31Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. Kabututu Z. Rawer M. Szallies A. Fujimori K. Inui T. Nozaki T. Yamashita K. Horii T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1327-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for TbPGFS compared with 2 μm for human ADR holoenzyme (10Borhani D.W. Harter T.M. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24841-24847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In TbPGFS, the pyrophosphate group of NADP+ is bound in a crevice on the surface of the barrel. On one side, the crevice lines Ser188, Leu190, and Gln192, all provided by loop β7-H1. On the other side, it has only Lys230, held by loop β8-α8. The pyrophosphate group is held in place by hydrogen bonding interactions with Ser188, Leu190, Gln192, and one molecule of water in one side and Lys230 in the other side (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, in the AKRs of the first subfamily, the extended polypeptide region of loop β7-H1 folds over the pyrophosphate group of NADPH and builds a short tunnel, known as the “safety belt,” through which the pyrophosphate moiety passes. In human ADR holoenzyme, salt bridges between Asp216, Lys21, and Lys262 stabilize this safety belt (2Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, the safety belt is absent in TbPGFS, and Asp216 has been deleted from loop β7-H1. Lys24 (similar to Lys21 in human ADR holoenzyme) is located too far, i.e. ∼6.3 Å, from t"

https://openalex.org/W2052104016,"Portal hypertension (PHT) is associated with increased susceptibility of the gastric mucosa to injury by a variety of factors, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that nonselectively inhibit both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2). PHT gastric mucosa also has excessive nitric oxide (NO) production that contributes to the general increased susceptibility to injury. Using a rat model of PHT, we studied whether selective COX inhibition, which does not damage normal (normotensive) gastric mucosa, is sufficient to cause PHT gastric damage and, if so, whether and how excessive NO is involved. Indomethacin, a nonselective NSAID, caused 2.4-fold more gastric injury to PHT vs. normotensive sham-operated (SO) control rats. Neither NS-398 nor celecoxib, selective COX-2 inhibitors, caused gastric damage in either SO or PHT rats. SC-560, a selective COX-1 inhibitor, did not cause gastric damage in SO rats but dose-dependently caused gastric damage in PHT rats. There was a compensatory increase in COX-2 expression and activity in SC-560-treated SO rats but not SC-560-treated PHT rats. Partial inhibition of NO production restored gastric COX-2 expression and activity levels in SC-560-treated PHT rats to those of SC-560-treated SO rats, by a mechanism consistent with induction of NF-kappaB, and significantly reduced gastric damage. These studies indicate that, in contrast to normotensive gastric mucosa, inhibition of COX-1 alone is sufficient to cause PHT gastric damage as a result of excessive NO that prevents the induction of NF-kappaB and the compensatory increase in COX-2."

Initial site-directed mutagenesis studies identified Ser-204(5.43) and Ser-207(5.46) as the most likely putative docking sites for catecholic hydroxyl groups of adrenergic agonists (1Strader C.D.

However, the question of how these residues may contribute to ligand-receptor interactions remains open. Using a double alanine mutant in 5.43 and 5.46 positions (S204A, S207A) we noted that the simultaneous removal of the two residues appears to reduce the rather small constitutive activity of the β2AR, suggesting that the presence of the serine motif in H5 might control the intrinsic equilibrium between active and inactive receptor forms (5Ambrosio C. Molinari P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 198-210PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that for each of the three residues the loss of binding affinity due to OH removal is inversely related to the number of additional interacting groups in the non-catecholic part of the catecholamine molecule (6Del Carmine R. Ambrosio C. Sbraccia M. Cotecchia S. Ijzerman A.P. Costa T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Del Carmine R. Molinari P. Sbraccia M. Ambrosio C. Costa T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This behavior suggests an “induced-fit” mechanism in catecholamine binding, such that initial contacts between ligand and receptor sub sites facilitate the establishment of the subsequent interactions. A similar scenario emerges from the analysis of catecholamine interaction with fluorophor-labeled β2AR, where multistep kinetics was found to depend on the number of functional groups present in the catecholamine molecule (8Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J. Parnot C. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 686-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A stepwise mechanism for the conversion of the β2AR into active form was also proposed to explain why the various functional groups in the catecholamine molecule contribute synergistically to ligand binding and receptor activation (9Liapakis G. Chan W.C. Papadokostaki M. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All such evidences, along with an increasing understanding on the role of SSXXS motifs in transmembrane helices orientation (10Ballesteros J.A. Deupi X. Olivella M. Haaksma E.E. Pardo L. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2754-2760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Deupi X. Olivella M. Govaerts C. Ballesteros J.A. Campillo M. Pardo L. Biophys.

Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), indicate that the serine triad in H5 may play a vital role in the conformational motion of the β2AR. In this study, we have further investigated the contribution of H5 serines on ligand affinity and efficacy of the β2AR. To scan a significant range of conformational perturbations and minimize the extent of receptor modification, we replaced a single residue by all other possible amino acids. Ser-207(5.46), the most intramembranous of the three serines, was targeted in this study. To quantify ligand efficacy as the true intrinsic ability to drive receptor activation, without the confounding effects of changes in signaling stoichiometry, receptor trafficking, or interactions with additional effectors, all mutants were expressed as a functional receptor-Gαs fusion protein cassette. In such chimeric constructs the measurable GTP-exchange response only comes from the receptor-tethered α-subunit (13Molinari P. Ambrosio C. Riitano D. Sbraccia M. Gro M.C. Costa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15778-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the forced 1:1 stoichiometry of receptor:Gα expression makes maximal agonist stimulation a linear function of the fusion protein concentration. That corrects for the differences in expression levels. Although providing a somewhat reductive picture of the functional properties of the mutants, this approach can quantify efficacy with a precision comparable to binding affinity. Our results suggest that the serine in position 5.46 might not be available for interaction with the catechol moiety of agonist by default, but become accessible as a consequence of conformational changes that follow initial interactions between ligand and receptor. Also, the analysis of the various functional phenotypes obtained by mutagenesis indicates that the constitutively active receptor form induced by mutagenesis might be similar to a receptor activated by partial agonist, but substantially different from the active form induced by the full agonist. Materials—All biochemicals, including nucleotide analogs, were from Sigma. Culture media and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Methanethiosulfonate ethylamine (MTSEA, CH3SO2−SCH2CH2NH3+) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Radiolabeled ligands and nucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Molecular biology kits and reagents were from Qiagen, Invitrogen, Stratagene, and New England Biolabs. Mutagenesis—The preparation of full-length cDNAs encoding the β2AR-GαsL fusion protein was described previously (13Molinari P. Ambrosio C. Riitano D. Sbraccia M. Gro M.C. Costa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15778-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed by a PCR-based strategy, using mismatched primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR products were digested with KpnI and EcoRV and subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA encoding the human wild-type β2AR-Gαs fusion protein. Recombinant clones were isolated, and the inserted mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Membrane Preparation—COS7 and HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections were performed by DEAE-dextran/chloroquine and calcium phosphate precipitation for COS7 and HEK-293 cells, respectively. Enriched plasma membranes from transfected cells were prepared as described previously (13Molinari P. Ambrosio C. Riitano D. Sbraccia M. Gro M.C. Costa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15778-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and stored frozen (as ≥2 mg/ml) at –80 °C. Receptor Binding Assays—Were made in 1-ml reactions containing 50 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm leupeptin, 10 mm bestatin, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and suitable amounts of membrane proteins (0.5–2 μg). [125I]Pindolol (50–100,000 cpm) was used as radiotracer. Receptor number (Bmax) was computed from competition binding curves constructed using 12 log-spaced concentrations of unlabeled pindolol. Reaction with MTSEA—MTSEA treatment was performed according to the procedure of Javitch et al. (15Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. COS7 cells, plated in T25 flasks or 6-wells plates, were washed 48 h after transfection with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 2 min at room temperature with freshly prepared MTSEA at the desired final concentrations. The reactions were stopped by aspiration, followed by two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (the first containing 10 mm cysteine). Cell monolayers were then resuspended and homogenized by Polytron in binding buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), and incubated as quadruplicate aliquots in the presence of [3H]CGP-12177 (100,000 cpm), plus and minus 1 μm pindolol, to evaluate nonspecific binding. Binding reactions lasted 60 min and were terminated by rapid filtration on GF/B glass fiber filters. The fractional binding due to the exposure to MTSEA was calculated as the ratio: specific binding after the MTSEA treatment/specific binding without the treatment. GTPase and Adenylyl Cyclase Stimulation—The measurement of GTPase and adenylyl cyclase activities was done as described previously (13Molinari P. Ambrosio C. Riitano D. Sbraccia M. Gro M.C. Costa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15778-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GTPγS binding—[35S]GTPγS binding was determined in a 100-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 nm [35S]GTPγS(~1200 Ci/mmol), 3 μm GDP, and 1–5 μg of membrane proteins, with or without the appropriate agonist. Samples were incubated 90 min at 20 °C, filtered onto GF/B (Packard Filterplate), and washed with ice-cold buffer (6–10 volumes) prior to scintillation counting on a microplate radioactivity reader (Packard Top Count). Specific binding (picomoles/mg of membrane protein) was computed by subtracting the binding measured in the presence of 10 μm GTPγS. To measure maximal exchange indices (see “Data Analysis”), agonist concentrations were 100 μm (ISO, EPI, and DCI) and 1 mm (MAPE). To compare G protein activation across various mutants, membranes were prepared from sets of cells transfected with control pcDNA3 and vectors encoding wild-type and mutant constructs (from 5 up to 18 in each experiment). After protein determinations and the collection of aliquots for the analysis of receptor density (see Bmax above), GTPγS binding (measured in quadruplicate) was determined for all membranes in the same experiment. Lower expressed mutants (Lys, Tyr, Asp, and Ile) were tested using 5 μg of protein, whereas 1 μg of proteins was used for all the others. Data analysis—Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by non-linear fitting of the competition curves according to a four-parameter logistic equation, using the program ALLFIT (16De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was calculated by fitting the binding curves with the program LIGAND (17Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constants were converted to free energy changes, i.e. ΔG =–ln(1/Kd), given as RT units (R, gas constant; T, absolute temperature). The variation in free energy due to mutation, ΔΔG, was calculated as the difference in binding energy between mutant and wild-type receptor, ΔΔG = ΔG(mut) – ΔG(wt). Energy values were computed experiment by experiment before taking averages, so that their variances reflect the true experimental error and are not amplified by the errors due the subtractions of averaged starting values. The intrinsic activity of receptor mutants was evaluated by converting GTPγS binding results (picomoles/mg) into two expression level-independent dimensionless indices. The enhancement of nucleotide binding (see “Results” and Fig. 1, C and D) is a linear function of the membrane concentration of fusion protein both in the absence and presence of ligand. Because receptor number = picomoles of the tethered Gs, data were divided by the Bmax (picomoles/mg) measured in the corresponding membranes as in the following equations: basal exchange index (BEI) = (GTPγS binding in receptor transfected cells – GTPγS binding in pcDNA3 transfected cells)/Bmax. Maximal exchange index (MEI) = (GTPγS binding plus agonist – GTPγS binding minus agonist)/Bmax. The first index represents the basal binding of the transfected construct and is significantly enhanced if a mutation increases receptor constitutive activity. The second measures the net ligand-induced stimulation and represents the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of the ligand, when recorded at a saturating concentration of agonist. Data were averaged from many transfection experiments, and the standard deviations of their differences were calculated from the sum of the variances of the two variables. Comparative Modeling of the β2AR and MD Simulations—A molecular model of the human β2AR, truncated at Ser-345, was built by comparative modeling, by means of the MODELLER program (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), using a modified version of the 2.2-Å x-ray crystal structure of rhodopsin as a template (19Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The general strategy used to select the final structure involved a multistep optimization and refinement process, which is described in detail elsewhere (20Seeber M. De Benedetti P.G. Fanelli F. J.

Briefly, the following steps were carried out: (i) Each of five different templates was used to generate 50 models by randomizing the model coordinates through a random number uniformly distributed in the interval –4/+4 Å. Among the 250 models thus obtained, the three showing the lowest violations of spatial restraints and the highest 3D-Profile scores (Protein Health module in the QUANTA 2000 package (www.accelrys.com)) were selected. In the template used to achieve these models, amino acids 228–245 (third intracellular loop) were replaced with the corresponding loop extracted from the computational model of the α1bAR (21Greasley P.J. Fanelli F. Scheer A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. De-Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46485-46494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and Q184, C185 (second intracellular loop) were deleted. In addition to the disulfide bridge Cys-106(3.25)–Cys-191, homologous to that present in rhodopsin, a second bridge was also imposed (“special patches” subroutine) between Cys-184 and Cys-190, in accordance with experimental data (22Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The selected models, completed by the addition of polar hydrogens, were subjected to automatic and manual rotation of the side-chain torsion angles, when in non-allowed conformations. (iii) Next, the models were submitted to extensive energy minimization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation procedures, essentially as described previously (20Seeber M. De Benedetti P.G. Fanelli F. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2003; 43: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that an implicit membrane-water model (23Lazaridis T. Proteins. 2003; 52: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (IMM1), recently implemented in CHARMM (24Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar), was employed (with the adjustable parameter “a” and the non-polar core thickness set as 0.85 and 32 Å, respectively). (iv) The final input structure, selected on the basis of structural quality checks and degree of similarity to rhodopsin structure, was finally subjected to 1 ns of equilibrated MD simulation. The structures averaged over 1 ns as well as over the first and last 500 ps were considered for the structural analysis. Numbering of β2AR Residues—Residues are numbered with two figures. The first is the position in the human β2AR sequence. The second, (in parenthesis), is the position relative to the most conserved residue of the helix in the macro alignment of class A GPCRs (25Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). Validity of the Receptor-Gs Fusion System for the Study of the Effect of Receptor Mutations—As shown in Fig. 1A, we used membranes from COS cells, transiently transfected with increasing amounts of either Gs-fused or wild-type receptor vectors to evaluate the fusion protein “specificity” of the guanine nucleotide exchange signal. Net agonist-stimulated GTPase activity and GTPγS binding (not shown) increased with the enhanced expression of fused receptor, but remained close to zero even at very high levels of non-fused receptor expression. This confirms that no significant contribution from the interaction of the receptor with endogenous Gs can be detected in such read-out (13Molinari P. Ambrosio C. Riitano D. Sbraccia M. Gro M.C. Costa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15778-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity in the same membranes displayed a different pattern. The increased expression of fusion protein resulted in a large enhancement of basal activity, which reflects the increase of Gαs concentration, rather than ligand-independent receptor activity, because identical effects were observed when expressing a fusion protein made between opioid-δ receptor and Gαs (not shown). Moreover, ligand-induced enhancement of adenylyl cyclase was not linear and reached saturation at relatively low levels of fusion protein expression (Fig. 1B). Thus, the tethered receptor-Gα system provide quantitative information on ligand-induced receptor activation only if the measured end-point is direct G protein activation, not effector-mediated signaling. The binding of GTPγS increased linearly with the number of adrenergic binding sites both in the presence and absence and of a maximal agonist concentration (Fig. 1, C and D). The net difference was a linear function of fusion protein expression (Fig. 1, C and D, insets) with zero intercept and a dimensionless slope, which represents a quantitative estimate of the agonist power to activate the system (intrinsic activity). This value, called maximal exchange index (MEI), is independent of expression level. Thus, by taking the ratio, net picomoles/mg of stimulated GTPγS binding versus net picomoles/mg of expressed receptor, we can compare the ability of ligands to maximally activate receptors across membranes expressing different levels of mutants. The enhancement of [35S]GTPγS binding was insensitive to pertussis toxin, but markedly reduced by cholera toxin treatment (data not shown), indicating lack of interferences from endogenous Gi/o proteins. In addition, the typical pattern of ligand intrinsic activities for the β2AR was maintained in the fusion protein construct. In fact, isoproterenol (ISO) and epinephrine (EPI) displayed greater intrinsic activity than dobutamine and halostachin (MAPE), whereas dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) behaved as a weak partial agonist (Fig. 2A). Ligand Binding Affinity for the Receptor Mutants—To evaluate the binding affinity of β2AR-Gαs mutants correctly, the recombinant protein must be expressed to a level at least 10-fold greater than that of the endogenous β2AR in the host cells (which, in COS cell lines, can range between 0.05 and 0.2 pmol/mg of membrane proteins). All residue substitutions, but Arg-207, resulted in receptors that met such criterion. The S207R mutant was thus excluded from the rest of the study. Fig. 2B reports a summary of the expression levels recorded through this investigation (data are normalized to the level of expression of the wild-type construct, which was always determined in each experiment). The differences of expression among mutations ranged from 0.3-(S207K) to 2.1-fold (S207G) the wild-type. Whether such diversity may reflect differences in receptor stability or folding efficiency was not investigated in this study. The binding affinities of the ligands, ISO, EPI, MAPE, and pindolol (PIN) for all mutants are listed as logarithms of the apparent dissociation constants in Table I. To visualize the relative potency of each mutated residue to shift binding affinity with respect to wild-type receptor, we also plotted the data as ΔΔG changes (i.e. ΔG mutant minus ΔG wild-type) for each ligand, ranked according to the magnitude of the residue effect (Fig. 3). The most prominent finding of this analysis is that the changes in binding affinity produced by the mutations are ligand-specific.Table IApparent ligand binding affinities of receptor mutantsResidue in 207Log10(Kd) mIsoproterenolEpinephrineMAPEPindololMean (±S.E.)nMean (±S.E.)nMean (±S.E.)nMean (±S.E.)nAla−5.58 (0.11)5−4.65 (0.32)3−4.36 (0.25)3−9.70 (0.05)8Cys−5.52 (0.11)4−4.38 (0.23)3−4.19 (0.17)3−9.67 (0.04)7Asp−5.95 (0.03)6−5.01 (0.17)3−4.19 (0.02)3−9.04 (0.07)10Glu−4.98 (0.02)6−3.97 (0.01)3−3.91 (0.01)3−8.73 (0.08)10Phe−6.00 (0.03)6−5.02 (0.24)3−4.27 (0.12)3−9.34 (0.06)10Gly−6.15 (0.09)3−5.16 (0.25)3−3.85 (0.15)3−9.06 (0.04)6His−6.20 (0.05)6−5.32 (0.28)3−3.86 (0.14)3−9.50 (0.03)10Ile−5.22 (0.08)3−4.31 (0.02)4−4.91 (0.09)4−9.40 (0.02)5Lys−4.89 (0.07)3−4.12 (0.09)3−3.64 (0.06)3−8.30 (0.04)3Leu−5.86 (0.08)3−4.90 (0.24)3−3.96 (0.13)3−9.47 (0.03)6Met−5.54 (0.10)3−4.37 (0.15)3−3.81 (0.14)3−9.41 (0.04)6N−5.59 (0.05)6−4.33 (0.28)3−3.44 (0.18)3−9.30 (0.02)10Pro−4.95 (0.10)3−4.00 (0.21)3−3.94 (0.08)3−8.03 (0.11)3Gln−5.42 (0.10)6−3.88 (0.39)3−3.47 (0.31)3−9.69 (0.05)10Ser−6.81 (0.10)7−6.42 (0.16)4−4.14 (0.06)4−9.41 (0.03)10Thr−6.39 (0.07)5−6.03 (0.21)3−4.43 (0.04)3−8.79 (0.03)8Val−5.45 (0.09)3−4.35 (0.22)3−4.98 (0.11)3−9.51 (0.03)6Trp−5.67 (0.07)3−4.91 (0.12)3−4.13 (0.07)3−8.73 (0.02)6Tyr−5.56 (0.05)6−4.88 (0.11)3−4.66 (0.03)3−9.17 (0.03)10 Open table in a new tab EPI and ISO, both full agonists with catechol rings, displayed the closest patterns. All mutations produced a loss of binding affinity for such ligands, but the extent of reduction varied greatly. Residues such as Glu, Pro, and Gln produced the largest diminutions (with some differences between EPI and ISO in the relative effects of Pro and Gln). Thr, His, and Gly produced the smallest decrease. Other than noting that Thr (the most conservative replacement for the wild-type Ser) produced the smallest decrease of binding affinity, there was no obvious relationship between the residue ability to be H-bond donor/acceptor and its effect on binding affinity. The changes of binding affinity for the non-catecholic partial agonist MAPE was quite different from that observed for the two catecholamines. Both enhancements and reductions in binding affinity were observed, and the largest changes were not produced by the same residues that mostly affected catecholamines. The aliphatic residues Val and Ile maximally enhanced binding affinity, whereas Asn, Gln, and Lys produced marked reductions. Unlike that of catecholamines, the affinity of MAPE was only slightly changed by Glu and Pro replacements. A still different pattern was observed for the antagonist PIN. Many residues produced little change or slight increases of binding affinity, but significant diminutions were caused by Lys and Pro mutations (Fig. 3). Shifts of Ligand-induced Receptor Activation—To measure how mutations altered the intrinsic ability of ligands to activate the receptor, we determined maximal exchange indexes (see “Experimental Procedures”) for EPI, ISO, MAPE, and the weak partial agonist dichloroisoproterenol (DCI), in numerous transfection experiments performed both in COS7 and HEK-293. The data, normalized with respect to the activation observed in the wild-type construct, are shown in Fig."
