In the present investigation a method for the determination of the relative evaporation-rates of the skin was examined and employed to determine the evaporation-rate for different regions of the body, its variability among cows, and the factors affecting this variability."

Further survey values for both man and animals have been presented in U.S. Atomic Energy Commission reports and in the open literature (2-4). The magnitude and pattern with time of radioactivity levels in the thyroids are of interest because (i) there is provided an alert to any build-up of potentially hazardous levels; (ii) as relationships are developed, radioiodinc measurements could serve as a sensitive monitoring system for other fallout nuelides less easili detected in the hiosphere; (iii) information may be obtained on the movement of radioiodine particularly in the biological system; and (iv) there could be an interference with medical diagnostic tests that employ low levels of radioiodine. This paper (5) summarizes the information that has been obtained on the levels of iodine-13 1 in human and cattle thyroids and presents an estimate of milk levels in the United States during the period from January 1955 to December 1956. Correlation with known bomb tests is noted, and some inferences are drawn about routes of exponire."

On the other hand, small doses of reserpine potentiate the mydriatic action of morphine in mice and large doses produce a meiosis characteristic of reserpine alone4. Since morphine produces a peculiar excitant or manic state in cats5, we were interested in the possible influences of these tranquillizing drugs on the morphine reaction in this species."

We have named it ‘flavensomycin’."

https://openalex.org/W2093844524,"IN a recent communication1, P. C. Dodwell raises some doubts about the adequacy of a theory of visual shape discrimination in octopus which I outlined in Nature
2. Dodwell makes four points: (1) He thinks it would be difficult to devise an analysing mechanism which would analyse relative differences in rates of firing at different points over a row of neurons: such a mechanism is necessary on my theory to explain the discrimination of certain figures (for example, a square and a circle). (2) He maintains that the theory fails to account for discrimination of shape irrespective of the locus of excitation on the retina. (3) He writes: “the reason for postulating the array of cells [in the optic lobes] becomes obscure, because … the analyser … should enable it to deal directly with information from the retina”. (4) He maintains that a theory of shape discrimination which he is putting forward overcomes the difficulties inherent in my own theory by transforming a spatial pattern into a temporal pattern."

The resulting values were higher in the female than in the male (for the areas by 3.15 per cent and for the deoxyribonucleic acid content by 3.54 per cent respectively). Similar results have also been confirmed in Triturus vulgaris, which Vialli and Riccadonna2 studied during an investigation of the direct and reciprocal hybrids Triturus vulgaris × Triturus cristatus. They have maintained that these differences can be explained, though with some reservations, as being due to chromosome differences."

https://openalex.org/W2015959742,"DURING field-observations of mosquitoes (Aedes caspius Pall.) in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, it was found that the insects were not disturbed when being photographed by means of an electronic flash; in this they resemble birds, small mammals and diurnal insects. The firing of ordinary flash bulbs will always cause resting mosquitoes to fly away; and swarming males will disperse for a period of several minutes after a flash-bulb exposure. The firing of an electronic flash, even from as close as 30 cm., did not appear in any way to disturb resting or feeding mosquitoes, and not the slightest change in pitch of male swarms was discernible when they were photographed by the same device. It is not known if the insects react differently to the two light sources because of differences in the duration of light, or whether the disturbance produced by the ordinary flash bulb results from the considerable emission of radiant heat. But whatever the reason, it seemed that this indifference to the electronic flash could be used for recording photographically the activity of small and light insects."

https://openalex.org/W2038203054,"DURING secretion, cells undergo well-known cytological and biochemical modifications. The cytological changes manifest themselves first in the formation of ergastoplasm in the cytoplasm, and secondly within the secretion granula, the secretion granula disappearing during the secreting cycle1. Biochemically, the most important modification is the great diminution and the synthesis of the exocellular enzymes during the secretion period2. Recently, the importance of the different cellular fractions in protein synthesis has been much discussed, and I have studied the modifications of the protein content in the cellular fractions separated from the normal and the secreting pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W2040798463,"IN a communication under this title in Nature of April 13, Mr. K. Gundersen concludes that preservation under paraffin oil seems to be more promising than any other method used. He was evidently not aware that I mentioned in an article in Nature of February 12, 1955, the use of mineral oil for the maintenance of crude and pure cultures of nitrifying bacteria and briefly discussed the results of my experiments in a paper in the annual report of the Experimental and Research Station, Cheshunt, for 1954. Mr. Gundersen did not obtain the results he expected from this method because he did not give his cultures a chance to develop, but put them under paraffin oil immediately after inoculation. My cultures, which were only partly purified, were fully developed and showed peak reactions for nitrite and nitrate, respectively, before they were covered with paraffin oil. They were then kept at room temperature in a cupboard for from three to seven months. Subcultures made after these times developed into fully active cultures; however, the speed of their development differed, probably depending on the strains and the impurities present."
