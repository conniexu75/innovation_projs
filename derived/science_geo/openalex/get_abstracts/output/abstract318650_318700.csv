https://openalex.org/W2044275644,"The unicellular alga Acetabularia was found to show a diurnal rhythm in photosynthesis. This rhythm continued for at least three cycles in constant light and temperature, and hence can be considered endogenous. Plants from which the nucleus had been removed by severing the basal rhizoids showed no modification in the photosynthetic rhythm over a number of cycles. The nucleus is, therefore, not immediately essential for the maintenance of rhythmicity in Acetabularia. Conversely, a mechanism for sustaining time-keeping must exist in the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W2022667545,"Autoradiographs showed that when streptomycin is applied to leaves of coleus plants (1000 to 3600 micrograms per plant) the antibiotic or some by-product is translocated laterally and downward. The translocated material does not alter rhizosphere microorganisms quantitatively. Gram-negative rhizosphere bacteria, however , are suppressed through the 8th day after treatment."

The role of proper time is interpreted in terms of atomic periods, and the relationship between the conformal transformations and the general theory of relativity is clarified."

https://openalex.org/W1999683112,Spores and pollen present in sediments of the lower Eocene Wilcox group in south-central Arkansas are mixed temperate and tropical genera. The source area is postulated to have been temperate highlands adjacent to a tropical coastal plain. A similar interpretation based on plant megafossils has been made. Hystrichosphaerids and dinoflagellates found in the sediments suggest a depositional environment of brackish water.
https://openalex.org/W2042420117,"THE historian of the future will probably characterize the period upon which we are now entering in psychology as the period of the rise of the applied psychological sciences. It may, therefore, be meet and proper to take some fundamental concept of applied psychology as topic for this annual address. select for this purpose the role of mental measurement-the possibility, the scope and the meaning of mental measurements as the foundation of applied mental sciences. In order to illustrate the scope and significance of mental measurement in a concrete and specific instance, shall make bold to present a psychological outline of the measurement of an individual as a singer. Let us make the assumption that this individual is a girl, fifteen years of age, who has had musical training and now desires the best obtainable advice from a consulting psychologist in music in regard to her future prospects as a singer. Musical power is generally admitted to embrace certain well-recognized and fairly concrete capacities. In our commonplace judgment about ourselves and others we say: I have no ear for music. I can not tell a chord from a discord. I can not keep time. I have no sense of rhythm. I can not tell a two-step from a waltz. I can not remember music. I can not image sounds. I am not moved by music. I do not enjoy music. Or, if speaking of some one who has musical ability, we say: He has a"

https://openalex.org/W1987367684,Devils Tower consists of columnar phonolite porphyry which contains large phenocrysts of orthoclase. Potassiumargon determinations on the orthoclase indicate an age of 40.5 million years +/- 4 percent. This is consistent with the geologically accepted Tertiary age.

Although the rate and the grade of relaxation are intimately related to both the stimulus condition and the muscle tension, the latent period of relaxation remains constant, except when the temperature of the bathing fluid is changed."

This is a particularly happy occasion* for me, for the setting is the auditorium in Wheeler Hall, where as an undergraduate I heard many a lecture, and this is the 30th anniversary of the awarding of my A.B. degree in physics by the Unviersity of California, our host institution for this meeting of the AAAS."
