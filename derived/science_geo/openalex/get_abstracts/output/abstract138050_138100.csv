https://openalex.org/W2104796556,"A three-dimensional structure for the monomeric iron-containing hydrogenase (CpI) from Clostridium pasteurianum was determined to 1.8 angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallography using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing. CpI, an enzyme that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of two protons to yield dihydrogen, was found to contain 20 gram atoms of iron per mole of protein, arranged into five distinct [Fe-S] clusters. The probable active-site cluster, previously termed the H-cluster, was found to be an unexpected arrangement of six iron atoms existing as a [4Fe-4S] cubane subcluster covalently bridged by a cysteinate thiol to a [2Fe] subcluster. The iron atoms of the [2Fe] subcluster both exist with an octahedral coordination geometry and are bridged to each other by three non-protein atoms, assigned as two sulfide atoms and one carbonyl or cyanide molecule. This structure provides insights into the mechanism of biological hydrogen activation and has broader implications for [Fe-S] cluster structure and function in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2120960764,"HOX genes specify cell fate in the anterior-posterior axis of animal embryos. Invertebrate chordates have one HOX cluster, but mammals have four, suggesting that cluster duplication facilitated the evolution of vertebrate body plans. This report shows that zebrafish have seven hox clusters. Phylogenetic analysis and genetic mapping suggest a chromosome doubling event, probably by whole genome duplication, after the divergence of ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes but before the teleost radiation. Thus, teleosts, the most species-rich group of vertebrates, appear to have more copies of these developmental regulatory genes than do mammals, despite less complexity in the anterior-posterior axis."

Statistical analyses of single-molecule trajectories revealed a significant and slow fluctuation in the rate of cholesterol oxidation by FAD. The static disorder and dynamic disorder of reaction rates, which are essentially indistinguishable in ensemble-averaged experiments, were determined separately by the real-time single-molecule approach. A molecular memory phenomenon, in which an enzymatic turnover was not independent of its previous turnovers because of a slow fluctuation of protein conformation, was evidenced by spontaneous spectral fluctuation of FAD."
https://openalex.org/W1988876917,"In response to DNA damage and replication blocks, cells prevent cell cycle progression through the control of critical cell cycle regulators. We identified Chk2, the mammalian homolog of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cds1 protein kinases required for the DNA damage and replication checkpoints. Chk2 was rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to replication blocks and DNA damage; the response to DNA damage occurred in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–dependent manner. In vitro, Chk2 phosphorylated Cdc25C on serine-216, a site known to be involved in negative regulation of Cdc25C. This is the same site phosphorylated by the protein kinase Chk1, which suggests that, in response to DNA damage and DNA replicational stress, Chk1 and Chk2 may phosphorylate Cdc25C to prevent entry into mitosis."

To date, however, the genes that encode subunits of this important channel have not been identified. The biophysical properties, sensitivity to pharmacological blockade, and expression pattern of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 potassium channels were determined. It is concluded that both these subunits contribute to the native M-current."

https://openalex.org/W2038030438,"For migratory birds, early arrival and physical condition on the breeding grounds are important determinants of reproductive success and fitness. Differences in arrival times often exceed a month, and later arriving individuals are often in poorer condition. Habitat-specific isotopic signatures indicate that the quality of winter habitats occupied by American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) determines their physical condition and spring departure dates, which in turn result in variable arrival schedules and condition on temperate breeding grounds. These findings link events in tropical winter grounds with those in temperate breeding areas for a migratory songbird and provide evidence that winter habitats may be limiting."
https://openalex.org/W2088618181,"The complement and immunoglobulin receptors are the major phagocytic receptors involved during infection. However, only immunoglobulin-dependent uptake results in a respiratory burst and an inflammatory response in macrophages. Rho guanosine triphosphatases (molecular switches that control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton) were found to be essential for both types of phagocytosis. Two distinct mechanisms of phagocytosis were identified: Type I, used by the immunoglobulin receptor, is mediated by Cdc42 and Rac, and type II, used by the complement receptor, is mediated by Rho. These results suggest a molecular basis for the different biological consequences that are associated with phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2159643400,"Tau proteins aggregate as cytoplasmic inclusions in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Over 10 exonic and intronic mutations in the tau gene have been identified in about 20 FTDP-17 families. Analyses of soluble and insoluble tau proteins from brains of FTDP-17 patients indicated that different pathogenic mutations differentially altered distinct biochemical properties and stoichiometry of brain tau isoforms. Functional assays of recombinant tau proteins with different FTDP-17 missense mutations implicated all but one of these mutations in disease pathogenesis by reducing the ability of tau to bind microtubules and promote microtubule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2143098227,"Ice cores that were recovered from the summit of Sajama mountain in Bolivia provide carbon-14-dated tropical records and extend to the Late Glacial Stage (LGS). Oxygen isotopic ratios of the ice decreased 5.4 per mil between the early Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum, which is consistent with values from other ice cores. The abrupt onset and termination of a Younger Dryas-type event suggest atmospheric processes as the probable drivers. Regional accumulation increased during the LGS, during deglaciation, and over the past 3000 years, which is concurrent with higher water levels in regional paleolakes. Unlike polar cores, Sajama glacial ice contains eight times less dust than the Holocene ice, which reflects wetter conditions and extensive snow cover."
https://openalex.org/W2150905832,"Effects of small population size and reduced genetic variation on the viability of wild animal populations remain controversial. During a 35-year study of a remnant population of greater prairie chickens, population size decreased from 2000 individuals in 1962 to fewer than 50 by 1994. Concurrently, both fitness, as measured by fertility and hatching rates of eggs, and genetic diversity declined significantly. Conservation measures initiated in 1992 with translocations of birds from large, genetically diverse populations restored egg viability. Thus, sufficient genetic resources appear to be critical for maintaining populations of greater prairie chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2014167027,"The NPH1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a 120-kilodalton serine-threonine protein kinase hypothesized to function as a photoreceptor for phototropism. When expressed in insect cells, the NPH1 protein is phosphorylated in response to blue light irradiation. The biochemical and photochemical properties of the photosensitive protein reflect those of the native protein in microsomal membranes. Recombinant NPH1 noncovalently binds flavin mononucleotide, a likely chromophore for light-dependent autophosphorylation. The fluorescence excitation spectrum of the recombinant protein is similar to the action spectrum for phototropism, consistent with the conclusion that NPH1 is an autophosphorylating flavoprotein photoreceptor mediating phototropic responses in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2061064014,"Proteolysis of mitotic cyclins depends on a multisubunit ubiquitin-protein ligase, the anaphase promoting complex (APC). Proteolysis commences during anaphase, persisting throughout G1 until it is terminated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) as cells enter S phase. Proteolysis of mitotic cyclins in yeast was shown to require association of the APC with the substrate-specific activator Hct1 (also called Cdh1). Phosphorylation of Hct1 by CDKs blocked the Hct1-APC interaction. The mutual inhibition between APC and CDKs explains how cells suppress mitotic CDK activity during G1 and then establish a period with elevated kinase activity from S phase until anaphase."

Genetic association analysis of five cohorts of people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) revealed that infected individuals homozygous for a multisite haplotype of the CCR5regulatory region containing the promoter allele, CCR5P1, progress to AIDS more rapidly than those with other CCR5promoter genotypes, particularly in the early years after infection. Composite genetic epidemiologic analyses of genotypes bearingCCR5P1, CCR5-Δ32,CCR2-64I, and SDF1-3′A affirmed distinct regulatory influences for each gene on AIDS progression. An estimated 10 to 17 percent of patients who develop AIDS within 3.5 years of HIV-1 infection do so because they are homozygous forCCR5P1/P1, and 7 to 13 percent of all people carry this susceptible genotype. The cumulative and interactive influence of these AIDS restriction genes illustrates the multigenic nature of host factors limiting AIDS disease progression."

The magnetite crystals were all single magnetic domains, and the magnetization directions of small superparamagnetic crystals were constrained by magnetic interactions with larger crystals in the chains. Shape anisotropy was found to dominate magnetocrystalline anisotropy in elongated crystals. A coercive field between 300 and 450 oersted was determined for one chain."

Angiosperms are defined by carpels enclosing ovules, a character demonstrated in this fossil. This feature is lacking in other fossils reported to be earliest angiosperms. The fruits are small follicles formed from conduplicate carpels helically arranged. Adaxial elongate stigmatic crests are conspicuous on each carpel. The basal one-third of the axes bore deciduous organs of uncertain affinities. No scars of subtending floral organs are present to define the individual fertile parts as floral units, but the leaf-like structures subtending each axis define them as flowers. These fruiting axes have primitive characters and characters not considered primitive."
https://openalex.org/W1993199753,"Fas ligand (CD95L) inhibits T cell function in immune-privileged organs such as the eye and testis, yet in most tissues CD95L expression induces potent inflammatory responses. With a stably transfected colon carcinoma cell line, CT26-CD95L, the molecular basis for these divergent responses was defined. When injected subcutaneously, rejection of CT26-CD95L was caused by neutrophils activated by CD95L. CT26-CD95L survived in the intraocular space because of the presence of transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β), which inhibited neutrophil activation. Providing TGF-β to subcutaneous sites protected against tumor rejection. Thus, these cytokines together generate a microenvironment that promotes immunologic tolerance, which may aid in the amelioration of allograft rejection."
https://openalex.org/W1976519371,"Early in Drosophila embryogenesis, gap gene products directly repress transcription of homeotic (HOX) genes and thereby delimit HOX expression domains. Subsequently, Polycomb-group proteins maintain this repression. Currently, there is no known molecular link between gap and Polycomb-group proteins. Here, dMi-2 is identified as a protein that binds to a domain in the gap protein Hunchback that is specifically required for the repression of HOX genes. Genetic analyses show that dMi-2 participates in both Hunchback and Polycomb repression in vivo. Hence, recruitment of dMi-2 may serve as a link between repression of HOX genes by Hunchback and Polycomb proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1979097982,"Targeted disruption of the gene encoding MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase, defined its function in the regulation of MAPK pathways and cell survival. MEKK1(-/-) embryonic stem cells from mice had lost or altered responses of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) to microtubule disruption and cold stress but activated JNK normally in response to heat shock, anisomycin, and ultraviolet irradiation. Activation of JNK was lost and that of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) was diminished in response to hyperosmolarity and serum factors in MEKK1(-/-) cells. Loss of MEKK1 expression resulted in a greater apoptotic response of cells to hyperosmolarity and microtubule disruption. When activated by specific stresses that alter cell shape and the cytoskeleton, MEKK1 signals to protect cells from apoptosis."

However, this minimal set of factors is not sufficient for transcription when the DNA template is packaged into chromatin. Here, a factor that facilitates activator-dependent transcription initiation on chromatin templates was purified. This factor, remodeling and spacing factor (RSF), has adenosine triphosphate-dependent nucleosome-remodeling and spacing activities. Polymerases that initiate transcription with RSF can only extend their transcripts in the presence of FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription). Thus, the minimal factor requirements for activator-dependent transcription on chromatin templates in vitro have been defined."
https://openalex.org/W1971765286,"Cortical neurons communicate with various cortical and subcortical targets by way of stereotyped axon projections through the white matter. Slice overlay experiments indicate that the initial growth of cortical axons toward the white matter is regulated by a diffusible chemorepulsive signal localized near the marginal zone. Semaphorin III is a major component of this diffusible signal, and cortical neurons transduce this signal by way of the neuropilin-1 receptor. These observations indicate that semaphorin-neuropilin interactions play a critical role in the initial patterning of projections in the developing cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2107405746,"Responses to tones of a basilar membrane site and of auditory nerve fibers innervating neighboring inner hair cells were recorded in the same cochleae in chinchillas. At near-threshold stimulus levels, the frequency tuning of auditory nerve fibers closely paralleled that of basilar membrane displacement modified by high-pass filtering, indicating that only relatively minor signal transformations intervene between mechanical vibration and auditory nerve excitation. This finding establishes that cochlear frequency selectivity in chinchillas (and probably in mammals in general) is fully expressed in the vibrations of the basilar membrane and renders unnecessary additional (""second"") filters, such as those present in the hair cells of the cochleae of reptiles."

Three-dimensional modeling shows that afterslip can only explain one horizontal component of the postseismic deformation, whereas viscoelastic flow can explain the horizontal and near-vertical displacements. The viscosity of a weak, about 10-km-thick layer, in the lower crust beneath the rupture zone that controls the rebound is about 10 18 pascal seconds. The viscoelastic behavior of the lower crust may help to explain the extensional structures observed in the Basin and Range province and it may be used for the analysis of earthquake hazard."

Type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) is enriched in growth cones of neurons in chick dorsal root ganglia. Depletion of internal Ca2+ stores and inhibition of IP3 signaling with drugs inhibited neurite extension. Microinjection of heparin, a competitive IP3R blocker, induced neurite retraction. Acute localized loss of function of IP3R1 in the growth cone induced by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation resulted in growth arrest and neurite retraction. IP3-induced Ca2+ release in growth cones appears to have a crucial role in control of nerve growth."
https://openalex.org/W2171251720,"The dependence of mitosis on the completion of the period of DNA replication in the cell cycle [synthesis (S) phase] ensures that chromosome segregation occurs only after the genome has been fully duplicated. A key negative regulator of mitosis, the protein kinase Wee1, was degraded in a Cdc34-dependent fashion in Xenopus egg extracts. This proteolysis event was required for a timely entrance into mitosis and was inhibited when DNA replication was blocked. Therefore, the DNA replication checkpoint can prevent mitosis by suppressing the proteolysis of Wee1 during S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1725920997,"We have used a model of dietary deficiency that leads to a chronic oxidative stress to evaluate responses that are adaptations invoked to boost cellular defense systems. Long-Evans hooded rats were fed with a diet lacking vitamin E (E) and selenium (Se) for 7 wk from weaning leading to animals deficient in both nutrients (−E −Se). In the absence of an electron donor, liver plasma membranes from these rats were more sensitive to lipid peroxidation, although they contained 40% greater amounts of ubiquinone than the plasma membranes from rats consuming diets with sufficient vitamin E and Se (+E +Se). The incubation of plasma membranes with NAD(P)H resulted in protection against peroxidation, and this effect was more pronounced in −E −Se membranes. Deficiency was accompanied by a twofold increase in redox activities associated with trans plasma membrane electron transport such as ubiquinone reductase and ascorbate free radical reductase. Staining with a polyclonal antibody against pig liver cytochrome b5 reductase, which acts as one ubiquinone reductase in the plasma membrane, showed an increased expression of the enzyme in membranes from −E −Se rats. Little DT-diaphorase activity was measured in +E +Se plasma membranes, but this activity was dramatically increased in −E −Se plasma membranes. No such increase was found in liver cytosols, which contained elevated activity of calcium-independent phospholipase A2. Thus, ubiquinone-dependent antioxidant protection in + E + Se plasma membranes is based primarily on NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, whereas additional protection needed in −E −Se plasma membranes is supported by the increase of ubiquinone levels, increased expression of the cytochrome b5 reductase, and translocation of soluble DT-diaphorase to the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that, in the absence of vitamin E and Se, enhancement of ubiquinone-dependent reductase systems can fulfill the membrane antioxidant protection.—Navarro, F., Navas, P., Burgess, J.

https://openalex.org/W2152667872,"Serine proteases play a key role in the fundamental biology of the central nervous system (CNS), and recent data suggest their involvement in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Little is known about the physiological regulation of these proteases in the CNS. Among the multiple growth factors present in the brain, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) has been described as an injury-related growth factor. However, its beneficial or deleterious role remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the influence of TGF-β1 in apoptosis and necrosis, two mechanisms involved in ischemic neuronal death. We show that TGF-β1 exerts a neuroprotective role restricted to necrosis induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate. This effect is observable only in the obligatory presence of TGF-β1-responsive astrocytes. We demonstrate that this neuroprotective activity is mediated through an up-regulation of a serine protease inhibitor (PAI-1) in astrocytes. These results underline the involvement of serine proteases and extracellular matrix components such as the PAI-1/t-PA axis in the excitotoxic cascade. Moreover, regardless of the underlying mechanisms of t-PA involvement in excitotoxic injury, our observations might warn against the use of tissular plasminogen activator as an alternative therapy for the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic injury in the brain.—Buisson, A., Nicole, O., Docagne, F., Sartelet, H., MacKenzie, E.

https://openalex.org/W1491078366,"Complete spinal cord lesion leads to profound metabolic abnormalities and striking changes in muscle morphology. Here we assess the effects of electrically stimulated leg cycling (ESLC) on whole body insulin sensitivity, skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and muscle fiber morphology in five tetraplegic subjects with complete C5-C7 lesions. Physical training (seven ESLC sessions/wk for 8 wk) increased whole body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 33±13%, concomitant with a 2.1-fold increase in insulin-stimulated (100 µU/ml) 3-O-methylglucose transport in isolated vastus lateralis muscle. Physical training led to a marked increase in protein expression of GLUT4 (378±85%), glycogen synthase (526±146%), and hexokinase II (204±47%) in vastus lateralis muscle, whereas phosphofructokinase expression (282±97%) was not significantly changed. Hexokinase II activity was significantly increased, whereas activity of phosphofructokinase, glycogen synthase, and citrate synthase was not changed after training. Muscle fiber type distribution and fiber area were markedly altered compared to able-bodied subjects before ESLC training, with no change noted in either parameter after ECSL training. In conclusion, muscle contraction improves insulin action on whole body and cellular glucose uptake in cervical cord-injured persons through a major increase in protein expression of key genes involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, improvements in insulin action on glucose metabolism are independent of changes in muscle fiber type distribution.—Hjeltnes, N., Galuska, D., Björnholm, M., Aksnes, A.-K., Lannem, A., Zierath, J.

https://openalex.org/W2092266147,"The Xenopus polo-like kinase 1 (Plx1) is essential during mitosis for the activation of Cdc25C, for spindle assembly, and for cyclin B degradation. Polo-like kinases from various organisms are activated by phosphorylation by an unidentified protein kinase. A protein kinase, polo-like kinase kinase 1 or xPlkk1, that phosphorylates and activates Plx1 in vitro was purified to near homogeneity and cloned. Phosphopeptide mapping of Plx1 phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant xPlkk1 or in progesterone-treated oocytes indicates that xPlkk1 may activate Plx1 in vivo. The xPlkk1 protein itself was also activated by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, and the kinetics of activation of xPlkk1 in vivo closely paralleled the activation of Plx1. Moreover, microinjection of xPlkk1 into Xenopus oocytes accelerated the timing of activation of Plx1 and the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. These results define a protein kinase cascade that regulates several events of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1845409971,"One of the primary antioxidant enzymes, manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), has shown the ability to reverse malignant phenotypes in a variety of human tumor cells that are low or absent in MnSOD expression. We have observed that overexpression of human MnSOD in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. The signaling pathway underlying the MnSOD induced tumor suppression is unknown. We demonstrate here that transcriptional and DNA binding ability of AP-1 and NF-κB, but not SP-1, were inhibited (by 50%) in the MCF-7 cell line overexpressing MnSOD. When transiently expressing, MnSOD inhibited AP-1 but increased NF-κB transactivation, which can be abolished by sodium pyruvate, a hydrogen peroxide scavenger. To analyze the target genes responsible for MnSOD-induced tumor suppression, genes related to tumor growth and responsive to AP-1 or NF-κB were analyzed. AP-1 responsive collagenase I, stromelysin I, and NF-κB responsive IL-1 and IL-6 were down-regulated in the MnSOD stable transfectants compared to the control cell lines. Since TPA induces differentiation in human breast cancer cells and up-regulates MnSOD gene in HeLa cells, MnSOD expression and AP-1 and NF-κB activity were measured under TPA treatment. The results showed that TPA induced endogenous MnSOD expression and inhibited both AP-1 and NF-κB. Together, these results suggest that tumor suppression by overexpressing MnSOD is related to a modulation of AP-1 and NF-κB, which causes a down-regulation of genes responsible for tumor malignant phenotype.—Li, J.-J., Oberley, L.

https://openalex.org/W1517965101,"Lp(a) is a major inherited risk factor for premature atherosclerosis. The mechanism of Lp(a) atherogenicity has not been elucidated, but likely involves both its ability to interfere with plasminogen activation and its atherogenic potential as a lipoprotein particle after receptor-mediated uptake. We demonstrate that Lp(a) stimulates production of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). This effect resulted from a rise in intracellular free calcium induced by Lp(a) and could be inhibited by the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA/AM. The involvement of the LDL and VLDL receptors in Lp(a) activation of HCAEC were ruled out since Lp(a) induction of adhesion molecules was not prevented by an antibody (IgGC7) to the LDL receptor or by receptor-activating protein, an antagonist of ligand binding to the VLDL receptor. Addition of α2-macroglobulin as well as treatment with heparinase, chondroitinase ABC, and sodium chlorate did not decrease levels of VCAM-1 and E-selectin stimulated by Lp(a), suggesting that neither the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein nor cell-surface proteoglycans are involved in Lp(a)-induced adhesion molecule production. Neither does the binding site on HCAEC responsible for adhesion molecule production by Lp(a) appear to involve plasminogen receptors, as levels of VCAM-1 and E-selectin were not significantly decreased by the addition of glu-plasminogen, the lysine analog ε-aminocaproic acid, or by trans-4-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxymethylic acid (tranexamic acid), which acts by binding to the lysine binding sites carried on the kringle structures in plasminogen. In contrast, recombinant apolipoprotein (a) [r-apo(a)] competed with Lp(a) and attenuated the expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin. In summary, we have identified a calcium-dependent interaction of Lp(a) with HCAEC capable of inducing potent surface expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin that does not appear to involve any of the known potential Lp(a) binding sites. Because leukocyte recruitment to the vessel wall appears to represent one of the important early events in atherogenesis, this newly described endothelial cell-activating effect of Lp(a) places it at a crucial juncture in the initiation of atherogenic disease and may lead to a better understanding of the role of Lp(a) in the vascular biology of atherosclerosis.—Allen, S., Khan, S., Tam, S.-P., Koschinsky, M., Taylor, P., Yacoub, M.

https://openalex.org/W2124751592,"Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a stress response protein, is highly induced in response to various agents causing oxidative stress including ultraviolet irradiation, sodium arsenite, hyperoxia, and glutathione depletors. We recently characterized the induction of HO-1 gene expression by nitric oxide (NO) and postulated that the addition of an antioxidant, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), would attenuate HO-1 induction in response to NO. Surprisingly, PDTC was a very potent inducer of HO-1 gene expression, causing increases in the steady-state level of HO-1 mRNA in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle (aVSM) cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. PDTC-induced HO-1 gene expression correlated with a rise in protein levels and was dependent on both increased gene transcription and mRNA stability. Deletional analyses of the proximal promoter and the entire 5' distal upstream region of the HO-1 gene (11 kbp) were performed including the two 5' distal enhancers, SX2 and AB1, located 4 kbp and 10 kbp upstream of the transcription site, respectively. Plasmid vectors containing various fragments of this region were linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, stably transfected into RAW 264.7 cells, and transfectants were assayed for CAT activity after treatment with PDTC. We show that the AB1 distal enhancer plays an important role in mediating PDTC-induced HO-1 gene transcription. Mutational analyses of this enhancer showed that the activator protein 1 (AP-1) regulatory element is crucial for PDTC-induced HO-1 gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays supported this data, demonstrating increased AP-1 DNA binding activity after PDTC treatment. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the antioxidant PDTC enhances HO-1 gene transcription and that the induction appears to be mediated by AP-1 activation of regulatory elements specific to the distal enhancer AB1."
https://openalex.org/W1524632935,"RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted) and other chemoattractant proteins are members of the intercrine or chemokine family of proinflammatory basic polypeptides. RANTES is a prototype of the C-C chemokine subfamily that acts as a selective chemoattractant for human monocytes and CD4-positive lymphocytes and increases the adherence of monocytes to endothelial cells. However, the role of RANTES in white cells is still unclear. We report here that hrRANTES at 20 ng/50 µl in mice causes mast cell recruitment 4 h after intramuscular injection, an effect inhibited by anti-RANTES, as evidenced by 0.1% Toluidine blue, a specific dye for coloring mast cells. Injections of PBS (50 µl) vehicle (negative control) did not produce any appreciable inflammatory response, whereas injection of lipopolysaccharide 20 ng/50 µl (positive control) generated a marked inflammatory state. When RANTES was injected intramuscularly in genetically mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice, the inflammatory effect was not present. The RANTES injection sites were then excised and studied under an optical and electron microscope. A Northern blot analysis was performed using a probe that was prepared to detect mRNA encoding the histidine decarboxylase (HDC) gene on excised muscle tissue. We found that hrRANTES provoked generation of HDC mRNA from muscle tissue after 4 h. These effects were inhibited by an anti-RANTES antibody and were absent in genetically mast cell-deficient mice. The increasing number of mast cells in the RANTES injection sites led to an augmentation of histamine content compared to controls (PBS). The injection of hrRANTES 20 ng/20 µl into the sole of a rat paw confirmed the inflammatory and the mast cell recruitment potential of this chemokine. In these studies, hrRANTES injections in muscle tissue provided direct in vivo evidence that RANTES has a significant effect on mast cell recruitment and HDC mRNA generation.—Conti, P., Reale, M., Barbacane, R. C., Letourneau, R., Theoharides, T. C. Intramuscular injection of hrRANTES causes mast cell recruitment and increased transcription of histidine decarboxylase in mice: lack of effects in genetically mast cell-deficient W/WV mice.

https://openalex.org/W2035331879,"Fayalite grains in chondrules in the oxidized, aqueously altered CV3 chondrite Mokoia have large excesses of radiogenic chromium-53. These excesses indicate the in situ decay of short-lived manganese-53 (half-life = 3.7 million years) and define an initial53Mn/55Mn ratio of 2.32 (±0.18) × 10–6. This ratio is comparable to values for carbonates in CI and CM chondrites and for several classes of differentiated meteorites. Mokoia fayalites formed 7 to 16 million years after Allende calcium-aluminum–rich inclusions, during hydrothermal activity on a geologically active asteroid after chondritic components had ceased forming in the solar nebula."
https://openalex.org/W2169304715,"The major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 is one of the most extensively characterized allergens both on the molecular and the immunological level. To define conformational B cell epitopes on Bet v 1, we screened filamentous phage libraries expressing circular or linear nonapeptides to select ligands specific for anti-Bet v 1 murine monoclonal antibodies BIP1 and BIP4. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BIP1 ligand was CFPYCYPSESA, and of the BIP4-ligand, CRQTRTMPGC. Both sequences derived from the circular phage library. Alignments to the sequence of Bet v 1 showed no similarities, indicating that the antibodies most likely recognize discontinuous epitopes. Phages displaying these mimotopes were capable of inhibiting interactions of the anti-Bet v 1 monoclonals with Bet v 1 in a dose-dependent manner in ELISA. In contrast, sequence-identical synthetic peptides were ineffective in blocking the antibody-allergen interactions. This is in agreement with the conformational inhomogeneity of the peptides in solution as observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Intragastric administration of phages expressing the BIP1 mimotope induced a Bet v 1-specific IgG response in Balb/c mice. We conclude that peptide mimotopes, when displayed on phages, may induce a protective IgG response preventing IgE-mediated allergic reactions, suggesting a possible clinical application.—Jensen-Jarolim, E., Leitner, A., Kalchhauser, H., Zürcher, A., Ganglberger, E., Bohle, B., Scheiner, O., Boltz-Nitulescu, G., Breiteneder, H.

https://openalex.org/W2112466242,"Uncoupling proteins (UCP) may influence thermogenesis. Since skeletal muscle plays an important role in energy homeostasis and substrate oxidation, this study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that skeletal muscle UCP2 content is altered in obesity and could be linked to basal energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, or substrate oxidation within skeletal muscle under postabsorptive (fasting) conditions. To examine these possibilities, limb basal energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (bRQ) were measured in 18 obese nondiabetic (Ob) and lean individuals (L). Total body fat (%) ranged from 11% to 46%. In addition, insulin-stimulated rates of glucose disposal (Rd) were measured under euglycemic hyperinsulinemic conditions. Biopsy of vastus lateralis muscle was used to measure cytochrome c oxidase (COX) enzyme activity and UCP2 content. Whereas low muscle COX activity was found in the Ob compared to L (6.9+/-1.6 vs. 9.6+/-1.2 U/g; P<0.001), skeletal muscle UCP2 content in Ob was significantly higher than in L (48+/-9 vs. 33+/-12 arbitrary units/g; P<0.05). Moreover, UCP2 content was positively correlated with percent of total body fat (r=0.57; P<0. 05) and bRQ (r=0.59; P<0.01), but not with visceral fat (r=0.17; P=0. 49), basal energy expenditure (r=0.07; P=0.79) or Rd (r=-0.23; P=0. 34). In summary, these results indicate that if development of obesity in humans is mediated by defective expression of UCP2 within skeletal muscle, then this effect is not observed in people with established obesity. The present study also suggests that skeletal muscle UCP2 content is not related to basal energy expenditure or insulin sensitivity in humans. However, the increased content of UCP2 within skeletal muscle in obesity appears to coincide with a reduced postabsorptive lipid utilization by muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1751203088,"Thyroid hormone (tri-iodo-thyronine, T3) exerts transcriptional effects on target genes in responsive cells. These effects are determined by DNA/protein interactions governed by the type of T3 receptors (TRs) in the cell. As TRs show tissue and developmental variations, regulation is best addressed in an integrated in vivo model. We examined TR subtype effects on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) transcription and on the pituitary/thyroid axis end point: thyroid hormone secretion. Polyethylenimine served to transfect a TRH-luciferase construct containing 554 bp of the rat TRH promoter into the hypothalami of newborn mice. Transcription from the TRH promoter was regulated in a physiologically faithful manner, being significantly increased in hypothyroidism and decreased in T3-treated animals. Moreover, when various ligand binding forms of mouse or chicken TRβ and TRα were expressed with TRH-luciferase, all forms of TRβ gave T3-dependent regulation of TRH transcription, whereas transcription was T3 insensitive with each TRα tested. Moreover, chicken TRα increased TRH transcription sixfold, whereas mouse TRα decreased transcription. These transcriptional effects had correlated physiological consequences: expression of the chicken TRα in the hypothalamus of newborn mice raised circulating T4 levels by fourfold, whereas mouse TRα had opposite effects. Thus, TR subtypes have distinct, physiologically relevant effects on TRH transcription.—Guissouma, H., Ghorbel, M. T., Seugnet, I., Ouatas, T., Demeneix, B. A. Physiological regulation of hypothalamic TRH transcription in vivo is T3 receptor isoform specific. FASEB J. 12, 1755–1764 (1998)"
https://openalex.org/W1539264929,"The mechanisms responsible for persistence of T lymphocytes at the sites of allergic inflammation are not completely understood. Activated T cells, usually expressing Fas on their surface, undergo activation-induced apoptotic death, thus limiting the dangerous consequences of a persistent immune reaction. We have previously shown that pulmonary T lymphocytes from untreated asthmatic subjects do not express surface Fas receptors nor do they contain Fas mRNA, yet they display normal levels of Fas ligand. This is not an inherited defect and is confined to mucosal T cells. To gain insights into the mechanism responsible for these findings, we performed a set of experiments with both purified Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen and recombinant human cytokines: interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, transforming growth factor beta1, interferon gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In vitro exposure of purified CD4(+) lymphocytes to allergen yielded only transient up-regulation of surface Fas but did not influence susceptibility to Fas-mediated cell death. T-helper type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF) had a dose-dependent and specific inhibitory effect on Fas mRNA, suggesting a new fundamental biological role in the survival of inflammatory cells during allergen exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1600493946,"The successful introduction of 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA) in the chemoprevention and treatment of cancer along with the discovery of different retinoic acid receptors transactivated by different retinoic acid isomers resulted in a number of in vitro studies of the antitumor effects of single retinoic acid isomers. Since the formation of retinoic acid isomers with different receptor affinities might modulate retinoic acid response in vitro, we determined retinoic acid disposition in HL-60 cells and cell culture medium during incubation with 13-cis-, 9-cis-, and all-trans-RA. In medium, retinoic acids underwent a thiol-radical mediated isomerization resulting in a mixture of 13-cis-, 9-cis-, 9,13-di-cis-, and all-trans-RA. Except for the 9, 13-di-cis-RA, all isomers generated in medium were also detected in HL-60 cells. Whereas 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA showed similar cellular pharmacokinetics, all-trans-RA reached about fourfold higher concentrations in HL-60 cells compared to 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA. Due to its better uptake, all-trans-RA became the main isomer within cells as it was formed in the medium when incubated with 13-cis-RA and 9-cis-RA. Thus, due to the simple chemically induced isomerization and its profound influence on cellular retinoic acid concentrations, studies of the efficacy of single retinoic acid isomers in vitro should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W1857916800,"Infectious diarrhea is often caused by the exotoxins of gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. However, these organisms also contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin. LPS induces nitric oxide synthase II (NOS II, inducible NOS) in various types of cells. We now demonstrate by RNase protection analysis, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry that the expression of NOS II mRNA and protein is markedly induced in colonic enterocytes of mice that ingest LPS with their drinking water. Using the same techniques, significant levels of soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC-S), the effector enzyme of NO, were found constitutively expressed in the mucosa. This creates a pathophysiologic autocrine pathway producing increased levels of cyclic GMP and leading to hypersecretion and diarrhea. In fact, the LPS-induced diarrhea developed in parallel with the NOS II induction. Diarrhea could be controlled with orally administered dexamethasone, which prevented the LPS-stimulated induction of NOS II (RNase protection analysis and Western blot). Diarrhea was also blocked by oral aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of NOS II activity. These data suggest that in addition to the known heat-labile and heat-stable exotoxins, gram-negative bacteria may induce diarrhea through the release of endotoxins that induce a NOS II-GC-S autocrine pathway in mucosal epithelium.—Closs, E. I., Enseleit, F., Koesling, D., Pfeilschifter, J. M., Schwarz, P. M., Förstermann, U.

https://openalex.org/W1565040557,"Changes in gene expression have been suggested to play a role in radiotherapy-induced central nervous system (CNS) injury. To begin to identify radiation-inducible genes in the CNS, we have applied the differential display of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products to RNA extracted from the brain of adult rats. RNA was isolated from a rat brain 6 h after whole-body exposure to 10 Gy and compared with RNA from unirradiated brain. A cDNA band was consistently observed at about 600 bp in samples from the irradiated rat but not from unirradiated (control) rat. Amplification and sequencing of the cDNA revealed that it corresponded to the prohormone convertase-2 (PC2) gene, which is involved in the processing of inert prohormones and neuropeptides to their bioactive forms. Enhanced PC2 expression was detected after irradiation of neuronal cultures but not in cultures of astrocytes, suggesting that the cell type in the CNS responsible for the PC2 induction after in vivo irradiation is the neuron. These results indicate that radiation induces the expression of a neuronal enzyme that is critical to the activation of a number of prohormones and neuropeptides, which may influence the radioresponse of the CNS."
