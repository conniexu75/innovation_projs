https://openalex.org/W2322544525,"Physical activity is associated with health. The aim of this study was (a) to access if Portuguese university students meet the public health recommendations for physical activity and (b) the effect of gender and day of the week on daily PA levels of university students. This observational cross-sectional study involved 126 (73 women) healthy Portuguese university students aged 18–23 years old. Participants wore the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Number of steps, time spent sedentary and in light, moderate and vigorous physical activity were recorded. The two-way MANOVA revealed that gender (p-value = 0.001; η2 = 0.038; minimum effect) and day of the week (p-value = 0.001; η2 = 0.174; minimum effect) had significant main effects on the physical activity variables. It was shown that during weekdays, male students walked more steps (65.14%), spent less time sedentary (6.77%) and in light activities (3.11%) and spent more time in moderate (136.67%) and vigorous activity (171.29%) in comparison with weekend days (p < 0.05). The descriptive analysis revealed that female students walked more steps (51.18%) and spent more time in moderate (125.70%) and vigorous (124.16%) activities during weekdays than in weekend days (p < 0.05). Women students did not achieve the recommended 10,000 steps/day on average during weekdays and weekend days. Only male students achieved this recommendation during weekdays. In summary, this study showed a high incidence of sedentary time in university students, mainly on weekend days. New strategies must be adopted to promote physical activity in this population, focusing on the change of sedentary behaviour."

Results show that these nations are reducing their science gap, with R&D investments and scientific impact growing at more than double the rate of the developed world. But this ""catching up"" hides a very uneven picture among these nations, especially on what they are able to generate in terms of impact and output relative to their levels of investment and available resources. Moreover, unlike what one might expect, it is clear that the size of the nations and the relative scale of their R&D investments are not the key drivers of efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2314274831,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that expresses type IVa pili. The pilus assembly system, which promotes surface-associated twitching motility and virulence, is composed of inner and outer membrane subcomplexes, connected by an alignment subcomplex composed of PilMNOP. PilM binds to the N terminus of PilN, and we hypothesize that this interaction causes functionally significant structural changes in PilM. To characterize this interaction, we determined the crystal structures of PilM and a PilM chimera where PilM was fused to the first 12 residues of PilN (PilM·PilN(1–12)). Structural analysis, multiangle light scattering coupled with size exclusion chromatography, and bacterial two-hybrid data revealed that PilM forms dimers mediated by the binding of a novel conserved motif in the N terminus of PilM, and binding PilN abrogates this binding interface, resulting in PilM monomerization. Structural comparison of PilM with PilM·PilN(1–12) revealed that upon PilN binding, there is a large domain closure in PilM that alters its ATP binding site. Using biolayer interferometry, we found that the association rate of PilN with PilM is higher in the presence of ATP compared with ADP. Bacterial two-hybrid data suggested the connectivity of the cytoplasmic and inner membrane components of the type IVa pilus machinery in P. aeruginosa, with PilM binding to PilB, PilT, and PilC in addition to PilN. Pull-down experiments demonstrated direct interactions of PilM with PilB and PilT. We propose a working model in which dynamic binding of PilN facilitates functionally relevant structural changes in PilM.

GspL and BfpC are components of the type II secretion (T2S) and type IVb pilus (T4bP) systems, respectively. These systems share evolutionary origins with the T4aP because they are structurally and functionally related (8Berry J.L. Pelicic V.

An inner membrane platform in the type II secretion machinery of Gram-negative bacteria.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PilM may bind PilB and/or PilC. However, GspL and BfpC deviate substantially from PilM. These proteins are more than 100 residues shorter and consequently lack the ability to bind ATP (28Lu C. Korotkov K.V. Hol W.G.

Biol. 2014; 187: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), thereby limiting the extent to which we can generate testable hypotheses for PilM based on the structures of GspL and BfpC. Despite the similarities among the T4aP, T4bP, and T2S systems, PilM is structurally more similar to FtsA, a key component of the bacterial divisome (15Karuppiah V. Derrick J.P.

Chem. 2011; 286: 24434-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). FtsA forms polymers that can be visualized by negative stain electron microscopy and as a consequence of the packing interactions in FtsA crystal structures (29van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J.

FtsA forms actin-like protofilaments.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2249-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). FtsA binds to FtsN, and this interaction is thought to lead to dissociation of the FtsA polymers, exposing protein-binding sites that allow for recruitment and activation of downstream cell division proteins (31Tsang M.J.

Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 1989-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PilN and FtsN share 14% sequence identity (28% similarity) and have similar topology, including conserved cytoplasmic N-terminal residues (32Pichoff S. Du S. Lutkenhaus J.

Furthermore, identification of key residues involved in the FtsN-FtsA interaction suggests that FtsA binds FtsN using a binding pocket analogous to that used by PilM to bind PilN (33Busiek K.K. Eraso J.M. Wang Y. Margolin W. The early divisome protein FtsA interacts directly through its 1c subdomain with the cytoplasmic domain of the late divisome protein FtsN.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 1989-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar comparisons have been made elsewhere (32Pichoff S. Du S. Lutkenhaus J.

Microbiol. 2013; 16: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), leading us to hypothesize that binding of PilN to PilM causes structural changes in PilM that dictate the nature of its binding partners. Herein we describe the structures of PilM and of PilM C-terminally linked to the first 12 residues of PilN (PilM·PilN(1–12)). Crystallographic and functional characterization revealed that PilM binds its own N terminus to form a dimer and that binding of ATP facilitates PilN binding. The binding of PilN was found to cause long range conformational changes and to lead to PilM monomerization. Furthermore, we show that PilM binds to PilB, PilT, and possibly PilC and that binding of PilN may modulate the interaction of PilM with PilB, PilT, and/or PilC. The primers, strains, and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers, strains, and plasmids used in this study Open table in a new tab Cloning of PilM, PilB, and PilT into pET28a with a thrombin-cleavable hexahistadine tag was described previously (10Chiang P.

The fidelity of the sequences was verified by TCAG sequencing facilities (Hospital for Sick Children). Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus® cells (Stratagene) transformed with pET28a:PilM, pET28a:PilM·PilN(1–12), pET28a:PilMΔ2–8, and pET28a:PilT and E. coli C41(DE3) transformed with pET28a:PilB were grown in 4 liters of lysogeny broth (LB) with 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 1% (w/v) glucose at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–0.6, and then protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown for 16 h at 18 °C. For production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-incorporated PilM, pET28a:PilM was transformed into E. coli B834 Met− (Novagen) and expressed as described elsewhere (35Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K.

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 20 min. For PilM and PilM·PilN(1–12), cell pellets were subsequently resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A1 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm citrate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 50 mm imidazole). ATP was omitted when PilM was used in the ATPase assays. Resuspended cells were lysed by passage through an Emulsiflex-c3 high pressure homogenizer, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was passed over a column containing 5 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resin was first washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of buffer A1 and then 10 CV of buffer A2 (buffer A1 adjusted to pH 6.0) before elution with 5 ml of buffer A2 plus 300 mm imidazole. The protein was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM 200pg column pre-equilibrated with buffer A2 without ATP or imidazole. Purified PilM constructs, with the exception of PilMΔ2–8, which precipitated at room temperature, were treated with thrombin (EMD Millipore) for 16 h at room temperature and separated from the tagged protein using a second round of nickel affinity purification. For the interaction studies between PilM, PilB, and PilT, cell pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer B1 (100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm citrate, 150 mm (NH4)2SO4, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm imidazole). Resuspended cells were lysed by passage through an Emulsiflex-c3 high pressure homogenizer, and the insoluble components were pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 40,000 × g. With the exception of PilB, the resulting supernatant was passed over a column containing 5 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Life Technologies). The Ni-NTA-agarose resin was then washed with 10 CV of buffer B1 and then 10 CV of buffer B2 (200 mm Tris, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 60 mm citrate, 300 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm imidazole) before adjusting the pH with 10 CV of buffer B3 (buffer B1 adjusted to pH 7.0). The protein was eluted in 5 ml of buffer B3 plus 300 mm imidazole and then further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM 200pg column pre-equilibrated with buffer B3 without imidazole. For PilB, after the cell pellets were homogenized and centrifuged, insoluble inclusion bodies were solubilized by gentle stirring in 40 ml of buffer B3 plus 8 m urea for 45 min at room temperature. Components that remained insoluble were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was passed over a HisTrap HP 5-ml (GE Healthcare) nickel affinity column. The resin was washed with 4 CV of buffer B3 plus 8 m urea before elution with a gradient of buffer B3 plus 8 m urea and 300 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions containing PilB were then concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml in an ultrafiltration device, and 300 μl were added (in 50-μl increments every minute for 6 min) to 50 ml of gently stirring renaturation buffer (buffer B3 without imidazole plus 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m arginine, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 1 mm ATP) and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Then the 50-ml solution was exchanged for buffer B3 without imidazole and concentrated to 500 μl over an ultrafiltration device. The protein was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM 200pg column pre-equilibrated with buffer B3 without imidazole. Purified proteins were stored at 4 °C for less than 2 days before use. For crystallization, purified PilM and PilM·PilN(1–12) were concentrated to 15 mg/ml at 3000 × g in an ultrafiltration device, and ATP or AMP-PNP (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm as detailed below. Crystallization conditions were screened using the complete MCSG suite (MCSG 1–4) (Microlytic), using a Gryphon LCP robot (Art Robbins Instruments). Crystal conditions were screened and optimized using vapor diffusion at 20 °C using Art Robbins Instruments Intelli-Plates (96-3 Shallow Well Hampton Research) with equal amounts of protein and reservoir solution. For PilM, the reservoir solution was 27% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.2 m MgCl2, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 7.0. For PilM·PilN(1–12), the reservoir solution was 2 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The crystals were cryoprotected for 5 s in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol before vitrification in liquid nitrogen. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction or native data, as appropriate, were collected on Beamline X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (see Table 2). The data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

https://openalex.org/W2314730689,"Black rot caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pam.) Dowson is the most destructive disease of cauliflower causing huge loss to the farmers throughout the world. Since there are limited sources of resistance to black rot in B. oleracea (C genome Brassica), exploration of A and B genomes of Brassica was planned as these were thought to be potential reservoirs of black rot resistance gene(s). In our search for new gene(s) for black rot resistance, F2 mapping population was developed in Brassica carinata (BBCC) by crossing NPC-17, a susceptible genotype with NPC-9, a resistant genotype. Out of 364 Intron length polymorphic markers and microsatellite primers used in this study, 41 distinguished the parental lines. However, resistant and susceptible bulks could be distinguished by three markers At1g70610, SSR Na14-G02 and At1g71865 which were used for genotyping of F2 mapping population. These markers were placed along the resistance gene, according to order, covering a distance of 36.30 cM. Intron length polymorphic markers At1g70610 and At1g71865 were found to be linked to black rot resistance locus (Xca1bc) at 6.2 and 12.8 cM distance, respectively. This is the first report of identification of markers linked to Xca1bc locus in Brassica carinata on B-7 linkage group. Intron length polymorphic markers provided a novel and attractive option for marker assisted selection due to high cross transferability and cost effectiveness for marker assisted alien gene introgression into cauliflower."

PmaLAAD does not use dioxygen to re-oxidize reduced FADH2 and thus does not produce hydrogen peroxide; instead, it uses a cytochrome b-like protein as an electron acceptor. Although the overall fold of this enzyme resembles that of known amine or amino acid oxidases, it shows the following specific structural features: an additional novel α+β subdomain placed close to the putative transmembrane α-helix and to the active-site entrance; an FAD isoalloxazine ring exposed to solvent; and a large and accessible active site suitable to bind large hydrophobic substrates. In addition, PmaLAAD requires substrate-induced conformational changes of part of the active site, particularly in Arg-316 and Phe-318, to achieve the correct geometry for catalysis. These studies are expected to pave the way for rationally improving the versatility of this flavoenzyme, which is critical for biocatalysis of enantiomerically pure amino acids. l-Amino acid deaminase from Proteus myxofaciens (PmaLAAD) is a membrane flavoenzyme that catalyzes the deamination of neutral and aromatic l-amino acids into α-keto acids and ammonia.

These studies are expected to pave the way for rationally improving the versatility of this flavoenzyme, which is critical for biocatalysis of enantiomerically pure amino acids. A variety of enzymes has been used to prepare chiral pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds containing enantiomeric amine or amino acid groups. Among these are aminotransferases (EC 2.6.4.X), lipases (EC 3.1.1.X), amine oxidases (EC 1.4.3.22), amino acid dehydrogenases (EC 1.4.1.X), and amino acid oxidases (EC 1.4.3.X) (1.Turner N.J.

The deracemization of a racemic amino acid to obtain the l-configuration was achieved by using a stereoselective d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO, 5The abbreviations used are: DAAOd-amino acid oxidaseFbdFAD binding domainLAADl-amino acid deaminaseLAAOl-amino acid oxidasePmaLAADl-amino acid deaminase from P. myxofaciensPmaLAAD-00CC-terminal His-tagged PmaLAADPmaLAAD-00NN-terminal His-tagged PmaLAADPmaLAAD-01Ntruncated PmaLAAD-00N starting from Met-28PmaLAAD-02Ntruncated PmaLAAD-00N starting from Ala-50Sbdsubstrate binding domainPDBProtein Data Bank.

The second step iteratively converts the imino acid produced (from the d-amino acid) back into a dl-mixture to obtain the full resolution of the racemic mixture into the l-enantiomer (1.Turner N.J. Enzyme catalysed deracemisation and dynamic kinetic resolution reactions.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This approach requires stable recombinant DAAOs possessing wide substrate specificity as well as variants engineered to act on synthetic amino acids (3.Pollegioni L. Sacchi S. Caldinelli L.

Amino acid oxidases with reverse stereoselectivity are also well known flavooxidases, mainly produced by snakes or by microorganisms. In particular, l-amino acid oxidases (LAAO, EC 1.4.3.2) catalyze the stereoselective oxidative deamination of l-amino acids into the corresponding α-keto acids and ammonia; the re-oxidation of FADH2 by dioxygen then generates H2O2 (4.Pollegioni L. Motta P. Molla G. l-Amino acid oxidase as biocatalyst: a dream too far?.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2013; 97: 9323-9341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These flavoenzymes catalyze an irreversible reaction (differently from aminotransferases) and do not require a specific step of cofactor regeneration, as otherwise required by the NAD-dependent dehydrogenases. However, because of the problems associated with overexpression of snake venom LAAOs in recombinant hosts and the limited substrate acceptance of the microbial counterparts, no appropriate LAAOs for biocatalysis are available (4.Pollegioni L. Motta P. Molla G. l-Amino acid oxidase as biocatalyst: a dream too far?.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2013; 97: 9323-9341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). l-Amino acid deaminases (LAADs) represent a suitable alternative to LAAOs. LAAD (first identified in the genera Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella) catalyzes the deamination of the l-isomer of amino acids, yielding the corresponding α-keto acids and ammonia without any evidence of H2O2 production. LAAD from Proteus myxofaciens (PmaLAAD), expressed in the Escherichia coli K12 strain, shows a preference for l-amino acids with aliphatic, aromatic, and sulfur-containing side chains (5.Pantaleone D.P.

To gain more insight into the properties of LAAD, we expressed the P. myxofaciens enzyme in E. coli and demonstrated that it is a membrane flavoenzyme employing a cytochrome b-like protein as electron acceptor. By using protein engineering studies, we were able to produce a truncated, soluble form (PmaLAAD-01N), which was crystallized. Its structural and biochemical characterization clearly shows that LAAD does not belong to the LAAO subfamily of flavo-oxidases and is characterized by a large and open active site. These studies provide the strong background needed to rationally alter the versatility of this flavoenzyme; engineered LAAD variants will represent the key to novel applications within the field of amino acid biocatalysis. The gene encoding for LAAD from P. myxofaciens (newly classified as Cosenzaea myxofaciens) (8.Giammanco G.M. Grimont P.A. Grimont F. Lefevre M. Giammanco G. Pignato S.

Microbiol. 2011; 61: 1638-1644PubMed Google Scholar) cloned into the NdeI and SalI restriction sites of the pET21a expression plasmid (Merck) was a generous gift from Wolfgang Kroutil (University of Graz, Austria). PmaLAAD-00N, -01N, -02N, and -00C variants (Fig. 1) were produced by PCR. PmaLAAD wild-type gene was amplified using the upstream primers Var00-UP (5′-TAGGCTAGCAACATTTCAAGGAGAAAGCTAC-3′), Var01-UP (5′-TAGGCTAGCATGGTTCGCCGTGATGGTAAA-3′), VAR02-UP (5′-ATTGCTAGCGCCCTGCCATCAGAATCTGATG-3′), or VAR00C-UP (5′-TAGCATATGAACATTTCAAGGAGAAAGCTAC-3′), and as downstream primers Var00-DN (5′-GCACGGATCCTTATTACTTCTTAAAACGATCCAAACTAAACGG-3′) was used for the -00N, -01N, and -02N mutants and VAR00C-DN (5′-CGCACCTCGAGCTTCTTAAAACGATCCAAAC-3′) for the -00C mutant. The primers were designed to insert an NheI restriction site at the 5′-end and a BamHI restriction site at the 3′-end of the amplification products for PmaLAAD-00N, -01N, and -02N and an NdeI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the amplification product for PmaLAAD-00C. The amplification products (pma-var00, -var01, and -var02 genes) were subcloned into the NheI and BamHI restriction sites of the pET11a-His vector (a modified pET11a vector encoding a His6 tag sequence that is added at the N terminus of the recombinant protein) (9.Caldinelli L.

Similarly, the pET24b plasmid was used to generate the pET24b-PMA00C-His expression plasmid by using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The expressed proteins possess a His tag sequence (Fig. 1). The sequences of the cloned genes were confirmed by gene sequencing. Expression conditions for PmaLAAD and its variants were screened by a simplified 96-well microplate factorial design approach (10.Volontè F. Marinelli F. Gastaldo L. Sacchi S. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Optimization of glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid acylase expression in E. coli.Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 61: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Four different E. coli strains (E. coli BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLysS, Origami2(DE3), and Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS strains, Novagen) and two media (LB or modified TB, to which 10 g/liter glycerol was added) were used. After overnight incubation at 28 °C, protein expression was induced by adding 0.005 or 0.1 mm final concentration of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected after 4 h (at 28 °C) or 20 h (at 15 °C). PmaLAAD expression was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-His tag antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), as well as by activity assay on cell lysates by employing the spectrophotometric assay (see below). Recombinant wild-type and variants of PmaLAAD were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain under the following conditions: cells (from a single colony) were grown in modified TB medium containing 10 g/liter glycerol, to which 100 μg/ml ampicillin was added (or 30 μg/ml kanamycin for PmaLAAD-00C). Protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD600 nm = 0.5; after 4 h of growth at 28 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation. E. coli recombinant cells expressing PmaLAAD variants were disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2). The cell lysate was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 38,500 × g for 1 h yielding the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate and the crude extract containing the soluble proteins and membrane fragments. For wild-type PmaLAAD, ultracentrifugation of the latter fraction at 150,000 × g for 2 h produced a membrane fraction (pellet) and a cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant). The membrane fraction was resuspended in 2.5 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, stored at −80 °C, then thawed and diluted 5-fold in 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5; centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min yielded two phases at different density; see Fig. 2 for details. Recombinant PmaLAAD-00N, -00C, and -01N variants from the soluble fraction of the lysates (crude extract) were purified by using metal-affinity chromatography on a HiTrap chelating column (5 ml, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) using 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. In the case of PmaLAAD-01N, contaminant proteins bound to the column were eluted with two steps at 25 and 80 mm imidazole, and the variant was eluted at 200 mm imidazole. For crystallographic studies, the purity of PmaLAAD-01N was increased by loading the purified protein (13.7 mg/ml) onto a second HiTrap chelating column (1 ml); elution was performed using increasing concentrations of imidazole (25, 50, 12, and 500 mm). PmaLAAD-00N and -01N were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). The activity on l-Phe was assayed spectrophotometrically by following the formation of the product phenylpyruvate at 321 nm, a wavelength at which the extinction coefficient of the substrate is negligible (5.Pantaleone D.P. Geller A.M. Taylor P.P. Purification and characterization of an l-amino acid deaminase used to prepare unnatural amino acids.J. Mol. Catal. B: Enzym. 2001; 11: 795-803Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein sample was added to 2 ml (final volume) of 25 mm l-Phe in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated for 2 min at 25 °C. Every 30 s an aliquot of 400 μl was transferred into a plastic cuvette containing 400 μl of 3 n NaOH to stop the reaction and allow color to develop. One enzymatic unit corresponds to the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of l-Phe per min. The apparent Km, kcat, and Vmax values for l-Phe were determined by the phenylpyruvate production assay using increasing substrate concentrations, at 25 °C, and oxygen air saturation (0.253 mm). The same assay was used to investigate the ability of commercial quinones (anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, menadione, duroquinone, and juglone), using phenazine methosulfate as mediator or artificial electron acceptors (indigotetrasulfonate, gallocyanine, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol/phenazine methosulfate, cytochrome c, and nitro blue tetrazolium) to stimulate the activity of PmaLAAD-00N in the absence of membranes. All compounds were used at 50 μm final concentration, with the only exception being phenazine methosulfate that was used at 800 μm final concentration. The activity of PmaLAAD on l-Phe in the presence of exogenous membranes prepared from E. coli, Streptomyces venezuelae, and human glioblastoma T98G cells was investigated using the spectrophotometric assay. The deamination reaction of PmaLAAD on l-amino acids in the presence of commercially available E. coli lipid extracts (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was investigated by means of a polarographic method based on an oxygen electrode (O2 consumption) assay (11.Molla G. Piubelli L. Volontè F. Pilone M.S. Enzymatic detection of d-amino acids.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 794: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This assay couples the re-oxidation of the reduced flavin in PmaLAAD with an electron acceptor system that, in turn, consumes dioxygen (see under “Results” for details). This assay was also employed to investigate the substrate specificity of PmaLAAD on a number of l-amino acids. To investigate the pH dependence of the initial rate of phenylpyruvate production, wild-type PmaLAAD enzymatic activity was assayed at different pH values on 25 mm l-Phe in a multicomponent buffer (160 mm Tris-HCl, 160 mm Na2CO3, 160 mm H3PO4, 650 mm KCl, and 1% glycerol) (12.Harris C.M. Pollegioni L. Ghisla S. pH and kinetic isotope effects in d-amino acid oxidase catalysis.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5504-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data points were fitted based on the equation for two dissociations: Y = a + b(10pH−pKa1)/(1 + 10pH−pKa1) + [b − c(10pH−pKa2)/(1 + 10pH−pKa2)] (12.Harris C.M. Pollegioni L.

Temperature dependence of PmaLAAD activity was assayed by measuring the production of phenylpyruvate as described above at different temperatures, in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, using 25 mm l-Phe as substrate. Absorbance spectra in the UV-visible region of PmaLAAD variants, as well as ligand-binding experiments, were recorded using a Jasco V-560 spectrophotometer (Jasco Europe, Cremello, Italy) as reported previously (13.Molla G.

Anaerobic samples were prepared in anaerobic cuvettes by applying 10 cycles of evacuation and then flushing with oxygen-free argon. Flavin reduction was carried out by adding 25 mm (final concentrations) of the substrate l-Phe to samples containing ≈15 μm enzyme; reduction of the cofactor for PmaLAAD-00N variant was performed both in the absence and in the presence of E. coli membranes. Photoreduction experiments were carried out at 4 °C using an anaerobic cuvette containing 18.5 μm PmaLAAD-00N or 13.1 μm PmaLAAD-01N, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 μm 5-deaza FAD.

https://openalex.org/W2325787544,"The activation of Nrf2 has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in cancer cell resistance to different anticancer therapies. The inhibition of proteasome activity has been proposed as a chemosensitizing therapy but the activation of Nrf2 could reduce its efficacy. Using the highly chemoresistant neuroblastoma cells HTLA-230, here we show that the strong reduction in proteasome activity, obtained by using low concentration of bortezomib (BTZ, 2.5 nM), fails in reducing cell viability. BTZ treatment favours the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE sequences in the promoter regions of target genes such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), the modulatory subunit of γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCLM) and the transporter for cysteine (x-CT), enabling their transcription. GSH level is also increased after BTZ treatment. The up-regulation of Nrf2 target genes is responsible for cell resistance since HO-1 silencing and GSH depletion synergistically decrease BTZ-treated cell viability. Moreover, cell exposure to all-trans-Retinoic acid (ATRA, 3 μM) reduces the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE sequences, decreases HO-1 induction and lowers GSH level increasing the efficacy of bortezomib. These data suggest the role of Nrf2, HO-1 and GSH as molecular targets to improve the efficacy of low doses of bortezomib in the treatment of malignant neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2333805691,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with various factors, including immunological abnormalities and exposure to allergens. Astaxanthin (AST) is a xanthophyll carotenoid that has recently been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects and to regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, we investigated whether AST could improve the dermatitis and pruritus in a murine model of AD using NC/Nga mice. In addition to a behavioral evaluation, the effects of AST on the AD were determined by the clinical skin severity score, serum IgE level, histological analyses of skin, and by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting analyses for the expression of inflammation-related factors. AST (100 mg/kg) or vehicle (olive oil) was orally administered once day and three times a week for 26 days. When compared with vehicle-treated group, the administration of AST significantly reduced the clinical skin severity score. In addition, the spontaneous scratching in AD model mice was reduced by AST administration. Moreover, the serum IgE level was markedly decreased by the oral administration of AST compared to that in vehicle-treated mice. The number of eosinophils, total and degranulated mast cells all significantly decreased in the skin of AST-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. The mRNA and protein levels of eotaxin, MIF, IL-4, IL-5 and L-histidine decarboxylase were significantly decreased in the skin of AST-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. These results suggest that AST improves the dermatitis and pruritus in AD via the regulation of the inflammatory effects and the expression of inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2313823206,"Soil water repellency (SWR, i.e. reduced affinity for water owing to the presence of organic hydrophobic coatings on soil particles) has relevant hydrological implications because low rates of infiltration enhance water runoff, and untargeted diffusion of fertilizers and pesticides. Previous studies investigated the occurrence of SWR in ecosystems with different vegetation cover but did not clarify its relationships with litter biochemical quality. Here, we investigated the capability of different plant litter types to induce SWR by using fresh and decomposed leaf materials from 12 species, to amend a model sandy soil over a year-long microcosm experiment. Water repellency, measured by the Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) test, was tested for the effects of litter species and age, and compared with litter quality assessed by 13C-CPMAS NMR in solid state and elemental chemical parameters. All litter types were highly water repellent, with MED values of 18% or higher. In contrast, when litter was incorporated into the soil, only undecomposed materials induced SWR, but with a large variability of onset and peak dynamics among litter types. Surprisingly, SWR induced by litter addition was unrelated to the aliphatic fraction of litter. In contrast, lignin-poor but labile C-rich litter, as defined by O-alkyl C and N-alkyl and methoxyl C of 13C-CPMAS NMR spectral regions, respectively, induced a stronger SWR. This study suggests that biochemical quality of plant litter is a major controlling factor of SWR and, by defining litter quality with 13C-CPMAS NMR, our results provide a significant novel contribution towards a full understanding of the relationships between plant litter biochemistry and SWR."
https://openalex.org/W2330702002,"Single B cell screening strategies, which avoid both hybridoma fusion and combinatorial display, have emerged as important technologies for efficiently sampling the natural antibody repertoire of immunized animals and humans. Having access to a range of methods to interrogate different B cell subsets provides an attractive option to ensure large and diverse panels of high quality antibody are produced. The generation of multiple antibodies and having the ability to find rare B cell clones producing IgG with unique and desirable characteristics facilitates the identification of fit-for-purpose molecules that can be developed into therapeutic agents or research reagents. Here, we describe a multi-parameter flow cytometry single-cell sorting technique for the generation of antigen-specific recombinant monoclonal antibodies from single IgG+ memory B cells. Both mouse splenocytes and rabbit PBMC from immunised animals were used as a source of B cells. Reagents staining both B cells and other unwanted cell types enabled efficient identification of class-switched IgG+ memory B cells. Concurrent staining with antigen labelled separately with two spectrally-distinct fluorophores enabled antigen-specific B cells to be identified, i.e. those which bind to both antigen conjugates (double-positive). These cells were then typically sorted at one cell per well using FACS directly into a 96-well plate containing reverse transcriptase reaction mix. Following production of cDNA, PCR was performed to amplify cognate heavy and light chain variable region genes and generate transcriptionally-active PCR (TAP) fragments. These linear expression cassettes were then used directly in a mammalian cell transfection to generate recombinant antibody for further testing. We were able to successfully generate antigen-specific recombinant antibodies from both the rabbit and mouse IgG+ memory B cell subset within one week. This included the generation of an anti-TNFR2 blocking antibody from mice with an affinity of 90 pM."

Predicted crucial properties include the structure and flexibility of the antibody construct, the target antigen(s) and binding epitope(s), and the density of antigens on the cell surface. For bispecific antibodies, the ratio of the expression levels of the two target antigens is predicted to be critical to target binding, particularly for the lower expressed of the antigens. Using bispecific antibodies of different valencies to cell surface antigens including MET and EGF receptor, we have experimentally validated our modeling approach and its predictions and observed several nonintuitive effects of avidity related to antigen density, target ratio, and antibody affinity. In some biological circumstances, the effect we have predicted and measured varied from the monovalent binding interaction by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, our mathematical framework affords us a mechanistic interpretation of our observations and suggests strategies to achieve the desired antibody-antigen binding goals.

https://openalex.org/W2330371131,"The intestinal upper villus epithelial cells represent the differentiated epithelial cells and play key role in digesting and absorbing lumenal nutrients. Weaning stress commonly results in a decrease in villus height and intestinal dysfunction in piglets. However, no study have been conducted to test the effects of weaning on the physiology and functions of upper villus epithelial cells. A total of 40 piglets from 8 litters were weaned at 14 days of age and one piglet from each litter was killed at 0 d (w0d), 1 d (w1d), 3 d (w3d), 5 d (w5d), and 7 d (w7d) after weaning, respectively. The upper villus epithelial cells in mid-jejunum were isolated using the distended intestinal sac method. The expression of proteins in upper villus epithelial cells was analyzed using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification or Western blotting. The expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism, Golgi vesicle transport, protein amino acid glycosylation, secretion by cell, transmembrane transport, ion transport, nucleotide catabolic process, translational initiation, and epithelial cell differentiation and apoptosis, was mainly reduced during the post-weaning period, and these processes may be regulated by mTOR signaling pathway. These results indicated that weaning inhibited various cellular processes in jejunal upper villus epithelial cells, and provided potential new directions for exploring the effects of weaning on the functions of intestine and improving intestinal functions in weaning piglets."
https://openalex.org/W2312245465,"Humans like some colours and dislike others, but which particular colours and why remains to be understood. Empirical studies on colour preferences generally targeted most preferred colours, but rarely least preferred (disliked) colours. In addition, findings are often based on general colour preferences leaving open the question whether results generalise to specific objects. Here, 88 participants selected the colours they preferred most and least for three context conditions (general, interior walls, t-shirt) using a high-precision colour picker. Participants also indicated whether they associated their colour choice to a valenced object or concept. The chosen colours varied widely between individuals and contexts and so did the reasons for their choices. Consistent patterns also emerged, as most preferred colours in general were more chromatic, while for walls they were lighter and for t-shirts they were darker and less chromatic compared to least preferred colours. This meant that general colour preferences could not explain object specific colour preferences. Measures of the selection process further revealed that, compared to most preferred colours, least preferred colours were chosen more quickly and were less often linked to valenced objects or concepts. The high intra- and inter-individual variability in this and previous reports furthers our understanding that colour preferences are determined by subjective experiences and that most and least preferred colours are not processed equally."
https://openalex.org/W2318412327,"Every tenth pregnancy is affected by hypertension, one of the most common complications and leading causes of maternal death worldwide. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy include pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia. The pathophysiology of the development of hypertension in pregnancy is unknown, but studies suggest an association with vitamin D status, measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between gestational 25(OH)D concentration and preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension and blood pressure trajectory. This cohort study included 2000 women. Blood was collected at the first (T1) and third (T3) trimester (mean gestational weeks 10.8 and 33.4). Blood pressure at gestational weeks 10, 25, 32 and 37 as well as symptoms of preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension were retrieved from medical records. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations (LC-MS/MS) in T1 was not significantly associated with preeclampsia. However, both 25(OH)D in T3 and change in 25(OH)D from T1 to T3 were significantly and negatively associated with preeclampsia. Women with a change in 25(OH)D concentration of ≥30 nmol/L had an odds ratio of 0.22 (p = 0.002) for preeclampsia. T1 25(OH)D was positively related to T1 systolic (β = 0.03, p = 0.022) and T1 diastolic blood pressure (β = 0.02, p = 0.016), and to systolic (β = 0.02, p = 0.02) blood pressure trajectory during pregnancy, in adjusted analyses. There was no association between 25(OH)D and pregnancy-induced hypertension in adjusted analysis. In conclusion, an increase in 25(OH)D concentration during pregnancy of at least 30 nmol/L, regardless of vitamin D status in T1, was associated with a lower odds ratio for preeclampsia. Vitamin D status was significantly and positively associated with T1 blood pressure and gestational systolic blood pressure trajectory but not with pregnancy-induced hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2326397891,"Background Impaired remyelination of demyelinated axons is a major cause of neurological disability. In inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), although remyelination does happen, it is often incomplete, resulting in poor clinical recovery. Poly-IC a known TLR3 agonist and IL-33, a cytokine which is induced by poly-IC are known to influence recovery and promote repair in experimental models of CNS demyelination. Methodology and Principal Findings We examined the effect of addition of poly-IC and IL-33 on the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) cultured in vitro. Both Poly-IC and IL-33 induced transcription of myelin genes and the differentiation of OPC to mature myelin forming cells. Poly-IC induced IL-33 in OPC and addition of IL-33 to in vitro cultures, amplified further, IL-33 expression suggesting an autocrine regulation of IL-33. Poly-IC and IL-33 also induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK, a signaling molecule involved in myelination. Following the induction of gliotoxic injury with lysolecithin to the corpus callosum (CC), treatment of animals with poly-IC resulted in greater recruitment of OPC and increased staining for myelin in areas of demyelination. Also, poly-IC treated animals showed greater expression of IL-33 and higher expression of M2 phenotype macrophages in the CC. Conclusion/Significance Our studies suggest that poly-IC and IL-33 play a role in myelin repair by enhancing expression of myelin genes and are therefore attractive therapeutic agents for use as remyelinating agents in human demyelinating disease."

https://openalex.org/W2316482246,"Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn is one of the main traditional Chinese medicines producing coumarins and plenty of literatures are focused on the biosynthesis of coumarins. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used method in studying the biosynthesis pathway and the selection of reference genes plays a crucial role in accurate normalization. To facilitate biosynthesis study of coumarins, twelve candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome database of P. praeruptorum according to previous studies. Then, BestKeeper, geNoFrm and NormFinder were used for selecting stably expressed reference genes in different tissues and under various stress treatments. The results indicated that, among the twelve candidate reference genes, the SAND family protein (SAND), actin 2 (ACT2), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), protein phosphatase 2A gene (PP2A) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) were the most stable reference genes under different experimental treatments, while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin beta-6 (TUB6) were the least stable genes. In addition, the suitability of SAND, TIP41-like protein (TIP41), UBC9, ACT2, TUB6 and their combination as reference genes were confirmed by normalizing the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) in different treatments. This work is the first survey of the stability of reference genes in P. praeruptorum and provides guidelines to obtain more accurate qRT-PCR results in P. praeruptorum and other plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2319725784,"Little is known about iron efflux transporters within bacterial systems. Recently, the participation of Bacillus subtilis PfeT, a P1B4-ATPase, in cytoplasmic Fe(2+) efflux has been proposed. We report here the distinct roles of mycobacterial P1B4-ATPases in the homeostasis of Co(2+) and Fe(2+) Mutation of Mycobacterium smegmatis ctpJ affects the homeostasis of both ions. Alternatively, an M. tuberculosis ctpJ mutant is more sensitive to Co(2+) than Fe(2+), whereas mutation of the homologous M. tuberculosis ctpD leads to Fe(2+) sensitivity but no alterations in Co(2+) homeostasis. In vitro, the three enzymes are activated by both Fe(2+) and Co(2+) and bind 1 eq of either ion at their transport site. However, equilibrium binding affinities and activity kinetics show that M. tuberculosis CtpD has higher affinity for Fe(2+) and twice the Fe(2+)-stimulated activity than the CtpJs. These parameters are paralleled by a lower activation and affinity for Co(2+) Analysis of Fe(2+) and Co(2+) binding to CtpD by x-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that both ions are five- to six-coordinate, constrained within oxygen/nitrogen environments with similar geometries. Mutagenesis studies suggest the involvement of invariant Ser, His, and Glu residues in metal coordination. Interestingly, replacement of the conserved Cys at the metal binding pocket leads to a large reduction in Fe(2+) but not Co(2+) binding affinity. We propose that CtpJ ATPases participate in the control of steady state Fe(2+) levels. CtpD, required for M. tuberculosis virulence, is a high affinity Fe(2+) transporter involved in the rapid response to iron dyshomeostasis generated upon redox stress."
https://openalex.org/W2335309900,"Ezetimibe inhibits Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an apical membrane cholesterol transporter of enterocytes, thereby reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption. This treatment also increases extrahepatic reverse cholesterol transport via an undefined mechanism. To explore this, we employed a trans-intestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) assay, which directly detects circulation-to-intestinal lumen 3H-cholesterol transit in a cannulated jejunal segment, and found an increase of TICE by 45%. To examine whether such increase in efflux occurs at the intestinal brush border membrane(BBM)-level, we performed luminal perfusion assays, similar to TICE but the jejunal wall was labelled with orally-given 3H-cholesterol, and determined elevated BBM-to-lumen cholesterol efflux by 3.5-fold with ezetimibe. Such increased efflux probably promotes circulation-to-lumen cholesterol transit eventually; thus increases TICE. Next, we wondered how inhibition of NPC1L1, an influx transporter, resulted in increased efflux. When we traced orally-given 3H-cholesterol in mice, we found that lumen-to-BBM 3H-cholesterol transit was rapid and less sensitive to ezetimibe treatment. Comparison of the efflux and fractional cholesterol absorption revealed an inverse correlation, indicating the efflux as an opposite-regulatory factor for cholesterol absorption efficiency and counteracting to the naturally-occurring rapid cholesterol influx to the BBM. These suggest that the ezetimibe-stimulated increased efflux is crucial in reducing cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe-induced increase in cholesterol efflux was approximately 2.5-fold greater in mice having endogenous ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 heterodimer, the major sterol efflux transporter of enterocytes, than the knockout counterparts, suggesting that the heterodimer confers additional rapid BBM-to-lumen cholesterol efflux in response to NPC1L1 inhibition. The observed framework for intestinal cholesterol fluxes may provide ways to modulate the flux to dispose of endogenous cholesterol efficiently for therapeutic purposes."

During the process of shifting thermal niches, various types of genes expressed in diverse tissues, including those of the peripheral to central nervous systems, are potentially involved in the evolutionary changes in thermosensation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution of thermosensation, thermal responses were compared between two species of clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis) adapted to different thermal environments. X. laevis was much more sensitive to heat stimulation than X. tropicalis at the behavioral and neural levels. The activity and sensitivity of the heat-sensing TRPA1 channel were higher in X. laevis compared with those of X. tropicalis. The thermal responses of another heat-sensing channel, TRPV1, also differed between the two Xenopus species. The species differences in Xenopus TRPV1 heat responses were largely determined by three amino acid substitutions located in the first three ankyrin repeat domains, known to be involved in the regulation of rat TRPV1 activity. In addition, Xenopus TRPV1 exhibited drastic species differences in sensitivity to capsaicin, contained in chili peppers, between the two Xenopus species.

Thus, they represent fascinating target molecules for the investigation of whether functional changes in sensory receptors have contributed to the evolution of sensory perception and overall species divergence in behavioral responses to specific stimuli. Comparative analyses among closely related species with similar ecological and physiological traits, but that inhabit different thermal environments, are required for investigating the evolutionary processes of thermal adaptation. Two species belonging to the genus Xenopus (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis) are fully aquatic anurans and morphologically similar to each other (17Tinsley R.C. Kobel H.R. The Biology of Xenopus. Zoological Society of London/Clarendon Press, London1996Google Scholar); however, the optimal temperature range for each of these two species is quite different. The optimal temperature range of X. laevis is 16–22 °C, whereas that of X. tropicalis is 22–28 °C (18Kashiwagi K. Kashiwagi A. Kurabayashi A. Hanada H. Nakajima K. Okada M. Takase M. Yaoita Y.

Xenopus, the next generation: X. tropicalis genetics and genomics.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, X. laevis inhabits cooler regions compared with X. tropicalis, found in Africa, and thus these two Xenopus species have adapted to different thermal niches (17Tinsley R.C. Kobel H.R. The Biology of Xenopus. Zoological Society of London/Clarendon Press, London1996Google Scholar). In addition, the availability of genomic sequence data for both species makes them suitable for cloning and characterizing genes of interest (20Hellsten U. Harland R.M. Gilchrist M.J. Hendrix D. Jurka J. Kapitonov V. Ovcharenko I. Putnam N.H. Shu S. Taher L. Blitz I.L. Blumberg B. Dichmann D.S. Dubchak I. Amaya E. et al.The genome of the Western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis.Science. 2010; 328: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Previously, thermal responses of cold-activated TRPM8 were compared between X. laevis and X. tropicalis. However, there were no detectable differences in the thermal responses of TRPM8 between the two Xenopus species (8Myers B.R. Sigal Y.M. Julius D. Evolution of thermal response properties in a cold-activated TRP channel.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempted to compare the thermal responses between X. laevis and X. tropicalis at the behavioral, sensory neuron, and temperature receptor levels. Nocifensive behaviors to heat stimulation and thermal sensitivity of sensory neurons were different between both species. Furthermore, thermal responses of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 also differed between the two Xenopus species. We found that three amino acid substitutions are largely responsible for the species differences in TRPV1 heat responses. We also were able to show that the sensitivity of TRPV1 to capsaicin differs between the two Xenopus species, and this is dictated by another single amino acid substitution. Subtle amino acid changes in thermoTRP channels altered their functional properties, and this may have contributed to the evolutionary shift in thermal and chemical sensation. All procedures involving the care and use of animals were approved by the committees for animal experimentation of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences and Tottori University (Japan). The X. tropicalis strain used for all experiments was the Yasuda strain, which was kindly provided by the National Bio-Resource Project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan (MEXT). X. laevis was purchased from Hamamatsu Seibutsu Kyozai (Hamamatsu, Japan). X. laevis and X. tropicalis (∼5 cm) were housed in large plastic tanks placed in the same room, maintained at 20–25 °C, and used for behavioral experiments and the preparation of DRG neurons. Frogs were fed once every 2 days and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mature X. laevis females were kept at ∼18 °C for oocyte collection. Behavioral experiments were performed according to a previously described procedure (4Ohkita M. Saito S. Imagawa T. Takahashi K. Tominaga M. Ohta T. Molecular cloning and functional characterization of Xenopus tropicalis frog transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 reveal its functional evolution for heat, acid, and capsaicin sensitivities in terrestrial vertebrates.J.

Briefly, a single frog (∼5 cm) was placed into a glass bowl with a small amount of water (50 ml) and left for 20 min to habituate. Then capsaicin was added directly to the water, and jumping behaviors were counted before and after this addition. Capsaicin, purchased from Sigma, was dissolved into ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide as a stock solution. The effect of heat stimulation on the frogs was observed similarly to that of capsaicin. In brief, after habituation, the water in the glass bowl was replaced with water heated to a specific temperature. The glass bowl containing the frog was then immediately immersed in a water bath at the same temperature, and jumping behaviors were counted. Total RNA was extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral neurons excised from X. laevis and used as a template for reverse transcription with GeneRacer oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). To amplify the DNA fragment containing the full-length coding region of X. laevis TRPV1a (Xla-TRPV1a), the aforementioned reverse transcription product was used as a template for RT-PCR with the following primers: frog X. laevis TRPV1-F (5′-gattcaacaaaatgaagaaaat-3′) and X. laevis TRPV1-R (5′-gacagattcactcagccttg-3′); these were used to clone Xla-TRPV1a in a previous study (21Bohlen C.J.

Using this PCR product as a template, nested PCR was performed with the following primers: X. laevis TRPV1-F-KpnI (5′-tcataaggtaccatgaagaaaatgggcagttc-3′) and X. laevis TRPV1-R-NotI (5′-tcataagcggccgctcactcagccttggatgtc-3′). The amplified DNA fragment derived from peripheral neurons was cloned into the pOX+ vector (for expression in X. laevis oocytes) with KpnI and NotI.

To amplify the DNA fragment containing the full-length coding region of X. laevis TRPV1b (Xla-TRPV1b), RT-PCR was performed using the reverse transcription product mentioned above with the following primers: X. laevis TRPV1-F and X. laevis TRPV1-R2 (5′-tcactgctgggatgtctc-3′). Using this PCR product as a template, a second round of PCR was performed with the following primers: X. laevis TRPV1-F3 (5′-atgaagaaaatgggcagttccacc-3′) and X. laevis TRPV1b-R3 (5′-tcactgctgggatgtctcttcctg-3′). To attach the restriction enzyme recognition sites at both ends of the amplified DNA fragment, a third round of PCR was performed using the second PCR product as a template with the following primers: X. laevis TRPV1-F-KpnI and X. laevis TRPV1-R2-NotI (5′-taagcggccgctcactgctgggatgtctcttc-3′). Note that the same forward primers (X. laevis TRPV1-F and X. laevis TRPV1-F-KpnI) were used for cloning Xla-TRPV1a and Xla-TRPV1b, as both genes possess the same nucleotide sequences near the start codon in the genome sequence database. The amplified DNA fragment derived from peripheral neurons was cloned into the pOX+ vector with KpnI and NotI. Xtr-TRPV1 was cloned into pOX+ and pVenus-NLS vectors in a previous study (4Ohkita M. Saito S. Imagawa T. Takahashi K. Tominaga M. Ohta T. Molecular cloning and functional characterization of Xenopus tropicalis frog transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 reveal its functional evolution for heat, acid, and capsaicin sensitivities in terrestrial vertebrates.J.

To amplify the DNA fragment containing the full-length coding region of X. laevis TRPA1a (Xla-TRPA1a), RT-PCR was performed using the reverse transcription product derived from the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral neurons with the following primers: X. laevis TRPA1a-F (5′-cggcccatggcttattccatc-3′) and X. laevis TRPA1-R (5′-gtaacatgcccacgtttggatg-3′). Using this PCR product as a template, a second round of PCR was performed with the following primers: X. laevis TRPA1a-F2-BamHI (5′-taaggatcccgacatgacgtgctcgatc-3′) and X. laevis TRPA1a-R2-NotI (5′-taagcggccgccacgtttggatgattacactgtgatg-3′). The amplified DNA fragment derived from peripheral neurons was cloned into the pOX+ vector with BamHI and NotI. Similarly, for amplifying the full-length DNA fragment of Xla-TRPA1b, X. laevis TRPA1b-F (5′-aaagcgacatgacgtgctcg-3′) and X. laevis TRPA1b-R2-NotI (5′-taagcggccgcaatttacttcattttctgcaacatgc-3′) primers were used for the first PCR, and then X. laevis TRPA1b-F2-BamHI (5′-taaggatcccgacatgacgtgctcgatc-3′) and X. laevis TRPA1b-R3-NotI (5′-taagcggccgcctagccatttctggcttttacagc-3′) primers were used for the second round of PCR. The amplified DNA fragment derived from the brain was cloned into the pOX+ vector with BamHI and NotI. The nucleotide sequences of newly cloned genes were determined for multiple clones to confirm that no PCR errors were included. The LTL chimera, in which the central region of Xtr-TRPV1 was introduced into the background of Xla-TRPV1a, was constructed (“L” and “T” refer to the portions of Xla-TRPV1a and Xtr-TRPV1, respectively). First, the pOX+ vector harboring Xtr-TRPV1 (Xtr-TRPV1/pOX) was digested with AccI to excise the central portion of Xtr-TRPV1. Next, the pOX+ vector harboring Xla-TRPV1a (Xla-TRPV1a/pOX) was also digested with AccI to obtain the pOX vector possessing the N- and C-terminal regions of Xla-TRPV1a at both ends, and then the central portion of Xtr-TRPV1 was ligated into this pOX vector to construct the LTL chimera. Similarly, to construct the LLT chimera, Xla-TRPV1a/pOX and Xtr-TRPV1/pOX were digested with KpnI and BglII, and the resulting DNA fragments were swapped by conventional cloning procedures. To construct the LTT chimera, BsrGI was used. To construct the LTLL chimera, PmeI and KpnI were used. To construct the LTLLL chimera, the TLTT chimera was first constructed with PmeI and KpnI, and then the TLTT chimera was partially digested with EcoRI. The resulting DNA fragment containing the N-terminal portion of TRPV1 was ligated into Xtr-TRPV1/pOX, which was digested with EcoRI. Xenopus TRPV1 point mutants were constructed according to the procedures described in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with minor modifications. The point mutation was introduced by PCR using the Xla-TRPV1a/pOX or Xtr-TRPV1/pOX as templates with oligonucleotide primers containing the intended mutations. The amplified PCR products were transformed into Escherichia coli, and then pOX+ vectors containing TRPV1 were purified using standard procedures. The entire coding sequences of TRPV1 were determined to confirm that only the intended mutations were introduced. Xenopus TRPV1 or TRPA1 (Xtr-TRPV1, Xla-TRPV1a, Xla-TRPV1b, Xtr-TRPA1, Xla-TRPA1a, Xla-TRPA1b, TRPV1 chimeras, and TRPV1 mutants) were heterologously expressed in X. laevis oocytes, and ionic currents were recorded using a previously described two-electrode voltage clamp method (15Saito S.

TRPV1 complementary RNA (cRNA) was synthesized using pOX(+) vectors containing TRPV1 with the mMESSAGE MACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fifty nl of TRPV1 cRNA (100 ng/μl) was injected into defolliculated oocytes, and ionic currents were recorded 1–4 days post-injection using an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments) with a 1-kHz low-pass filter and digitized at 5 kHz using Digidata 1440 (Axon Instruments). Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV. Cinnamaldehyde (Wako) was dissolved into dimethyl sulfoxide as a stock solution and further dissolved into a ND96 bath solution and applied to oocytes by perfusion. For heat stimulation, heated ND96 was applied by perfusion. The temperature was monitored with a thermistor located just beside the oocytes using a TC-344B temperature controller (Warner Instruments). To compare the current amplitudes elicited by heat stimulation between the Xla-TRPV1a and Xla-TRPV1b (Fig. 3C), cRNA was injected into X. laevis oocytes prepared from the same preparation from a single frog, and currents were recorded side by side at 3 days post-injection in three independent preparations. Current amplitudes among wild-type and mutant Xenopus TRPV1 were compared by recording the currents from X. laevis oocytes at 3 days post-injection with two independent preparations (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8B). To compare the thermal activation thresholds of TRPV1 or TRPA1, currents were recorded side by side from cRNA-injected oocytes from at least three independent preparations (Figs. 3F and 11G).FIGURE 7Heat-induced activity differs among Xenopus TRPV1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2321153986,"Methionine is an essential sulfur amino acid that is engaged in key cellular functions such as protein synthesis and is a precursor for critical metabolites involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In mammals, in response to nutrient conditions, the liver plays a significant role in regulating methionine concentrations by altering its flux through the transmethylation, transsulfuration, and transamination metabolic pathways. A comprehensive understanding of how hepatic methionine metabolism intersects with other regulatory nutrient signaling and transcriptional events is, however, lacking. Here, we show that methionine and derived-sulfur metabolites in the transamination pathway activate the GCN5 acetyltransferase promoting acetylation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α to control hepatic gluconeogenesis. Methionine was the only essential amino acid that rapidly induced PGC-1α acetylation through activating the GCN5 acetyltransferase. Experiments employing metabolic pathway intermediates revealed that methionine transamination, and not the transmethylation or transsulfuration pathways, contributed to methionine-induced PGC-1α acetylation. Moreover, aminooxyacetic acid, a transaminase inhibitor, was able to potently suppress PGC-1α acetylation stimulated by methionine, which was accompanied by predicted alterations in PGC-1α-mediated gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production in primary murine hepatocytes. Methionine administration in mice likewise induced hepatic PGC-1α acetylation, suppressed the gluconeogenic gene program, and lowered glycemia, indicating that a similar phenomenon occurs in vivo. These results highlight a communication between methionine metabolism and PGC-1α-mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis, suggesting that influencing methionine metabolic flux has the potential to be therapeutically exploited for diabetes treatment.

Amino acid sensing is a critical mechanism that cells employ to maintain homeostasis and enable survival upon fluctuations in the nutritional environment (1.Gietzen D.W. Rogers Q.R.

Despite variability in side chain chemical structure, cells are able to distinguish the distinct amino acids through the use of specific tRNAs. The amino acid protein sensor GCN2 detects deficiencies in amino acids in a tRNA-dependent manner and reprograms cellular metabolism to modulate energy consumption and maintain homeostasis (3.Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Juxtaposition of domains homologous to protein kinases and histidyl-tRNA synthetases in GCN2 protein suggests a mechanism for coupling GCN4 expression to amino acid availability.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Although mTORC1 is not considered to be a direct sensor of amino acid levels, it functions similarly to GCN2 to alter metabolic pathways in response to amino acid deprivation (5.Sancak Y. Peterson T.R. Shaul Y.D. Lindquist R.A. Thoreen C.C. Bar-Peled L. Sabatini D.M. The Rag GTPases bind raptor and mediate amino acid signaling to mTORC1.Science. 2008; 320: 1496-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Methionine, a dietary essential amino acid, is among the more toxic of the l-amino acids, and hence its abundance needs to be precisely regulated (6.Harper A.E. Benevenga N.J. Wohlhueter R.M. Effects of ingestion of disproportionate amounts of amino acids.Physiol. Rev. 1970; 50: 428-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7.Benevenga N.J. Toxicities of methionine and other amino acids.J. Agric. Food Chem. 1974; 22: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The liver is the primary organ concerned with the detoxification of methionine, and hence its ability to sense alterations in concentrations of this amino acid is vital (8.Marchesini G. Bugianesi E. Bianchi G. Fabbri A. Marchi E. Zoli M. Pisi E. Defective methionine metabolism in cirrhosis: relation to severity of liver disease.Hepatology. 1992; 16: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The existence of any cross-talk between hepatic methionine metabolism and other nutrient-regulated metabolic processes in the liver, such as glucose production, requires further investigation. Intracellularly, apart from being utilized for the synthesis of proteins, methionine acts as a precursor for various metabolites that are associated with the anabolism of biological macromolecules, including nucleic acids (9.Griffith O.W. Mammalian sulfur amino acid metabolism: an overview.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10.Stipanuk M.H. Sulfur amino acid metabolism: pathways for production and removal of homocysteine and cysteine.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 539-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The two main routes for methionine catabolism include the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways. The initial step in transmethylation involves conversion of methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). 6The abbreviations used are: SAMS-adenosylmethionineKMTBα-keto-γ-methylthiobutyrateMTP3-methylthiopropionateEAAessential amino acidTSAtrichostatin AAOAAaminooxyacetic acid. SAM plays a significant role as a donor of methyl groups and is also involved in formation of polyamines such as spermidine (11.Fontecave M. Atta M. Mulliez E. S-Adenosylmethionine: nothing goes to waste.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). As a consequence of methyl transfer, SAM is metabolized to homocysteine via the S-adenosyl homocysteine intermediate (9.Griffith O.W. Mammalian sulfur amino acid metabolism: an overview.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10.Stipanuk M.H. Sulfur amino acid metabolism: pathways for production and removal of homocysteine and cysteine.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 539-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Homocysteine can then either be recycled back to methionine in a folate/choline-dependent manner or it can be shunted down the transsulfuration pathway. This transsulfuration process is composed of the condensation of homocysteine with serine succeeded by a hydrolysis reaction and results in the formation of cysteine via cystathionine. The cysteine produced can then be consumed in protein translation or synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione and the osmolyte taurine (9.Griffith O.W. Mammalian sulfur amino acid metabolism: an overview.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10.Stipanuk M.H. Sulfur amino acid metabolism: pathways for production and removal of homocysteine and cysteine.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 539-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). S-adenosylmethionine α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyrate 3-methylthiopropionate essential amino acid trichostatin A aminooxyacetic acid. In addition to the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways, methionine is also shunted down the transamination pathway (12.Livesey G. Lund P. Methionine metabolism via the transamination pathway in rat liver.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 540-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13.Blom H.J. Boers G.H. van den Elzen J.P. Gahl W.A. Tangerman A. Transamination of methionine in humans.Clin. Sci. 1989; 76: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Flux of methionine down this pathway involves an initial transaminase-mediated conversion to α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB) (14.Scislowski P.W. Pickard K. Methionine transamination: metabolic function and subcellular compartmentation.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 129: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). KMTB is then oxidatively decarboxylated to 3-methylthiopropionate (MTP) through an irreversible reaction catalyzed by the branched chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) (15.Steele R.D. Benevenga N.J. Identification of 3-methylthiopropionic acid as an intermediate in mammalian methionine metabolism in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7844-7850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTP is further metabolized to the gaseous methanethiol (16.Scislowski P.W. Bremer J. van Thienen W.I. Davis E.J. Heart mitochondria metabolize 3-methylthiopropionate to CO2 and methanethiol.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which has been reported to then be broken down into simpler molecules, including hydrogen sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, and formic acid, with the end products being carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide (17.Toue S.

Although initial reports on methionine transamination suggested that it provides a route for the degradation and clearance of methionine (19.Mitchell A.D. Benevenga N.J. The role of transamination in methionine oxidation in the rat.J. Nutr. 1978; 108: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), more recently researchers have claimed that transsulfuration serves as the major pathway for the detoxification of excessive methionine (20.Yamada H.

Med. 2012; 52: 1716-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Early studies in rats indicate that activity of the methionine transamination pathway is altered during fasting; however, no clear functional significance has been attributed to this pathway. Despite methionine transamination being suggested to occur in various rodent tissues including the liver, the fraction of methionine that is shunted through this pathway as well as its necessity in humans remains to be accurately determined. One of the mechanisms that functions to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range involves glucose production by the liver, which is differentially regulated during the fasting and fed states (21.Cahill Jr., G.F. Starvation in man.N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic gluconeogenesis is induced upon fasting and is extensively controlled by PGC-1α (22.Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Control of hepatic gluconeogenesis through the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1.Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). This transcriptional coactivator interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) to promote transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) genes, which encode two enzymes that significantly moderate gluconeogenesis (23.Puigserver P.

The activity, localization, and stability of PGC-1α are regulated by various post-translational modifications, including acetylation, which is known to impede its transcriptional co-activating ability and leads to the suppression of gluconeogenesis (25.Rodgers J.T.

The acetylation status of PGC-1α is primarily determined by opposing activities of the general control nonrepressed protein 5 (GCN5) acetyltransferase and the NAD+-dependent silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase (25.Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P.

These peptide hormones play a major role in defining the necessity for glucose production by the liver during fasting and fed states (30.Cherrington A.D. Stevenson R.W. Steiner K.E.

Identifying metabolites that link host nutritional status to hepatic glucose output is important for the development of novel therapeutics targeting diabetes. Here we report a potential role for methionine and its metabolic regulation in modulating PGC-1α-mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis and consequently blood glucose levels. Methionine flux down the transamination pathway leads to activation of the GCN5 acetyltransferase. This promotes PGC-1α acetylation and inhibition, leading to the suppression of hepatic glucose production. These results hint at the existence of cellular mechanisms that keep blood glucose levels in check through shunting metabolites down specific pathways in the liver to control gluconeogenesis. HEK293A and HepG2 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (CRL-1573 and HB-8065) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 7–10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by perfusion with liver digest medium (Life Technologies, 17703-034) followed by 70-μm mesh filtration. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from debris and other cell types by Percoll (Sigma, P7828) gradient centrifugation. Isolated hepatocytes were seeded in 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells per well) in plating medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 μm dexamethasone, 100 nm insulin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The medium was changed to maintenance medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) 3 h post-seeding. Medium was replaced daily with fresh maintenance medium for the duration of the experiment.

Adenoviruses were generated using the pAdTrack/pAdEasy system and amplified in HEK293A cells. Adenoviruses were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation and dialyzed in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, and 4% glycerol (v/v)). Cells were infected with the adenovirus (3 × 106 to 8 × 106 infectious particles per well) for 4 h after which the medium was changed. Cells were incubated for a further 48 h to allow for expression and then either lysed or treated with various stimuli before being lysed. Controls included infection with the adenovirus generated from the empty GFP backbone vector. Medium was replaced daily with fresh maintenance medium for the duration of the experiment as well as 3 h before harvesting. For treatment of primary hepatocytes with essential amino acids (EAAs), cells were incubated overnight with amino acid-free medium (Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.2% fatty-acid-free BSA, 25 mm glucose, Basal Medium Eagle (BME) vitamin mix, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) to deplete all amino acids in the medium. For treatment of hepatocytes with methionine or its metabolites/analogs, before treatment cells were incubated for 3 h (unless indicated otherwise) in medium lacking methionine (DMEM (no methionine, no cystine) supplemented with 0.2 mm cystine, 0.2% fatty-acid-free BSA, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). For experiments monitoring the ectopically expressed PGC-1α acetylation status, primary hepatocytes were incubated in appropriate starvation medium for the indicated times. Cells were then treated with EAAs, methionine, or methionine metabolites/analogs for 2 h, unless indicated otherwise, after which they were harvested. For gene expression analysis in primary hepatocytes, starvation of cells was performed for 3 h as mentioned above; however, after methionine (or its metabolites/analogs) stimulation, cells were incubated for 4 h before harvesting. For gene expression analysis in HepG2 cells, cells were treated with DMSO or forskolin (30 μm) overnight after which HEPES or 1 mm methionine was added to the cells for 3 h before harvesting. Inhibition of deacetylases was accomplished with trichostatin A (TSA) or EX-527 (1 μm), which was added 4 h before methionine treatment. For studies utilizing rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor (20 nm) was added 4 h before stimulation with methionine. In experiments involving aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), the inhibitor was added 30 min before stimulation with methionine (or its metabolites/analogs). After treatments, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) (Life Technologies) and lysed in ice-cold buffer. For whole cell extracts, cells were lysed in Buffer B (1× PBS (pH 7.4), 0.5% SDC (w/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% IGEPAL (v/v), 5 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 20 mm nicotinamide) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. To obtain nuclear extracts, cells were harvested in Buffer C (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.25% IGEPAL (v/v), 5 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 20 mm nicotinamide) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture. Once cytoplasmic fractions were separated, nuclear pellets were lysed in Buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% IGEPAL (v/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 20 mm nicotinamide) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture. Immunoprecipitation for ectopically expressed FLAG-HA-PGC-1α (for detection of PGC-1α acetylation) and FLAG-GCN5 (for GCN5 acetyltransferase activity assays) was performed with FLAG-beads (Sigma A2220) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Endogenous PGC-1α was immunoprecipitated with anti-PGC-1α antibody coupled to Dynabeads Protein A (Life Technologies 10001D). The lysates were precleared with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare 17-0780-01). All immunoprecipitated samples were washed at least four times with lysis buffer. For all endogenous immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as a negative control. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA or nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBST, chemiluminescence detection was performed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Antibodies were: anti-acetylated-lysine (#9441), anti-GCN5 (#3305), anti-S6 (#2217), and anti-phospho-S6 (Ser-235/236) (#4856) (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-PGC-1α (#sc-13067) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-lamin B1 (#ab16048) and anti-rabbit IgG (#ab37415) (Abcam); anti-β-tubulin (#05-661) (Millipore); anti-rabbit IgG secondary (#711-035-152) and anti-mouse IgG secondary (#715-035-150) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For gene expression analysis, after treatments, total RNA was isolated from cells or homogenized liver using TRIzol (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using random primers and a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). A CFX384 Real-TimePCRSystem (Bio-Rad) and PowerSYBRGreenPCRMaster Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used to perform quantitative real-time-PCR gene expression analysis. Gene expression data were corrected against 36B4 control gene expression and normalized using the ΔΔCT method. All primers are available upon request. Primary hepatocytes were infected with either GFP or FLAG-PGC-1α adenovirus. Two days post-infection, glucose production capacity of primary hepatocytes was measured by incubating the cells for 3 h in glucose-free medium (phenol-red/glucose-free DMEM, 0.2% BSA, ±2 mm sodium pyruvate, and ± 20 mm sodium lactate). Methionine (0.1, 3, 4 mm), MTP (4 mm), and methylthiopropylamine (4 mm) were added to the cells 3 h before collection of the medium samples. Medium aliquots were collected, and glucose levels were quantified using an enzyme-based glucose assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Eton Bioscience). The glucose concentration was calculated based on the difference between pyruvate/lactate-free medium and pyruvate/lactate-supplemented medium. Acetyltransferase assays were conducted with FLAG-tagged GCN5 immunoprecipitated from the nuclear fraction of hepatocytes infected with GCN5 adenovirus and treated with HEPES or 2 mm methionine as described earlier. Controls included immunoprecipitation from hepatocytes infected with the GFP adenovirus. FLAG-tagged GCN5 was eluted from FLAG antibody beads at 4 °C for 2 h with 3× FLAG peptide and used in a fluorometric acetyltransferase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif). For mouse experiments, 7-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. After a 1-week acclimation period, mice were handled for 3 days and then fasted overnight for 16 h. Through intraperitoneal injections, mice were administered PBS, EAAs (300 mg/kg, dissolved in PBS), or methionine (100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, dissolved in PBS). All mice were sacrificed 2 h post-injection, and livers were removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until processed further for gene expression analysis or immunoprecipitation of PGC-1α. Before sacrifice, glycemia was measured by tail-bleeding using an Ascensia Elite Blood Glucose Meter (Bayer). The generation of the Gcn5 flox allele was previously described (31.Lin W. Zhang Z. Srajer G. Chen Y.C. Huang M. Phan H.M. Dent S.Y. Proper expression of the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase is required for neural tube closure in mouse embryos.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 928-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To generate liver-specific deletion of Gcn5, Gcn5flox/flox (Gcn5f/f) mice were crossed with Gcn5flox/+; albumin-Cre+/− mice. Homozygous Gcn5f/f animals were identified using primers described in Lin et al. (31.Lin W. Zhang Z. Srajer G. Chen Y.C. Huang M. Phan H.M. Dent S.Y.

PGC-1α responds to nutrient and hormonal cues and plays a critical role in the regulation of energy metabolism in various tissues. Fasting induces PGC-1α activity in the liver to promote the gluconeogenic program. During fasting the availability of amino acids is also altered, and moreover, dietary amino acids are shown to contribute to the fed response along with insulin signaling (29.Lee Y. Dominy J.E. Choi Y.J. Jurczak M. Tolliday N. Camporez J.P. Chim H. Lim J.H. Ruan H.B. Yang X. Vazquez F. Sicinski P. Shulman G.I. Puigserver P. Cyclin D1-Cdk4 controls glucose metabolism independently of cell cycle progression.Nature. 2014; 510: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This suggests a possible role for the regulation of PGC-1α-mediated gluconeogenesis through amino acid signaling. To examine whether EAAs are able to regulate PGC-1α activity, we tested their ability to induce its acetylation in mouse primary hepatocytes, as this post-translational modification is known to inhibit the transcriptional coactivator gluconeogenic function. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed PGC-1α indicates an increase in its acetylation in hepatocytes treated with EAAs (Fig. 1A). To identify which of the EAAs contributed to the induction of PGC-1α acetylation, we"
https://openalex.org/W2316746658,"The accumulation of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). This response can trigger ER-associated degradation and autophagy, which clear unfolded proteins and restore protein homeostasis. Recently, it has become clear that ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy. In the present study, we investigated how the E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2 (Nedd4-2) interacts with ER stress and autophagy. In mice, we found that an increase in the expression of Nedd4-2, which was concomitant with the activation of the UPR and autophagy, was caused by a prolonged high-fructose and high-fat diet that induces ER stress in the liver. Pharmacologic induction of ER stress also led to an increase in Nedd4-2 expression in cultured cells, which was coincident with UPR and autophagy activation. The inhibition of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 significantly suppressed Nedd4-2 expression. Moreover, increased Nedd4-2 expression in vivo was closely associated with the activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 and increased expression of the spliced form of X-box binding protein 1. Furthermore, knockdown of Nedd4-2 in cultured cells suppressed both basal autophagy and ER stress-induced autophagy, whereas overexpression of Nedd4-2-induced autophagy. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that Nedd4-2 is up-regulated in response to ER stress by the spliced form of X-box binding protein 1 and that this is important in the induction of an appropriate autophagic response.—Wang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2320025934,"A top-down nanofabrication approach is used to develop silicon nanowires from silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers and involves direct-write electron beam lithography (EBL), inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) and a size reduction process. To achieve nanometer scale size, the crucial factors contributing to the EBL and size reduction processes are highlighted. The resulting silicon nanowires, which are 20 nm in width and 30 nm in height (with a triangular shape) and have a straight structure over the length of 400 μm, are fabricated precisely at the designed location on the device. The device is applied in biomolecule detection based on the changes in drain current (Ids), electrical resistance and conductance of the silicon nanowires upon hybridization to complementary target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In this context, the scaled-down device exhibited superior performances in terms of good specificity and high sensitivity, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 fM, enables for efficient label-free, direct and higher-accuracy DNA molecules detection. Thus, this silicon nanowire can be used as an improved transducer and serves as novel biosensor for future biomedical diagnostic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2319461026,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)--a widespread chronic inflammatory disease in industrialized countries--is characterized by a persistent and progressive joint destruction. The chronic pro-inflammatory state results from a mutual activation of the innate and the adaptive immune system, while the exact pathogenesis mechanism is still under discussion. New data suggest a role of the innate immune system and especially polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs, neutrophils) not only during onset and the destructive phase of RA but also at the chronification of the disease. Thereby the enzymatic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a peroxidase strongly abundant in neutrophils, may be important: While its peroxidase activity is known to contribute to cartilage destruction at later stages of RA the almost MPO-specific oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is also discussed for certain anti-inflammatory effects. In this study we used pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in Dark Agouti rats as a model for the chronic course of RA in man. We were able to shown that a specific detection of the HOCl-producing MPO activity provides a sensitive new marker to evaluate the actual systemic inflammatory status which is only partially detectable by the evaluation of clinical symptoms (joint swelling and redness measurements). Moreover, we evaluated the long-term pharmacological effect of the well-known anti-inflammatory flavonoid epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Thereby only upon early and continuous oral application of this polyphenol the arthritic symptoms were considerably diminished both in the acute and in the chronic phase of the disease. The obtained results were comparable to the treatment control (application of methotrexate, MTX). As revealed by stopped-flow kinetic measurements, EGCG may regenerate the HOCl-production of MPO which is known to be impaired at chronic inflammatory diseases like RA. It can be speculated that this MPO activity-promoting effect of EGCG may contribute to the pharmacological mode of action of this polyphenol."
https://openalex.org/W2334327095,"Community-based conservation (CBC) aims to benefit local people as well as to achieve conservation goals, but has been criticised for taking a simplistic view of ""community"" and failing to recognise differences in the preferences and motivations of community members. We explore this heterogeneity in the context of Kenya's conservancies, focussing on the livelihood preferences of men and women living adjacent to the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Using a discrete choice experiment we quantify the preferences of local community members for key components of their livelihoods and conservancy design, differentiating between men and women and existing conservancy members and non-members. While Maasai preference for pastoralism remains strong, non-livestock-based livelihood activities are also highly valued and there was substantial differentiation in preferences between individuals. Involvement with conservancies was generally perceived to be positive, but only if households were able to retain some land for other purposes. Women placed greater value on conservancy membership, but substantially less value on wage income, while existing conservancy members valued both conservancy membership and livestock more highly than did non-members. Our findings suggest that conservancies can make a positive contribution to livelihoods, but care must be taken to ensure that they do not unintentionally disadvantage any groups. We argue that conservation should pay greater attention to individual-level differences in preferences when designing interventions in order to achieve fairer and more sustainable outcomes for members of local communities."
https://openalex.org/W2326192542,"House mice (Mus musculus) live in social groups where they frequently interact with conspecifics, thus communication (e.g. chemical and/or auditory) is essential. It is commonly known that male and female mice produce complex vocalizations in the ultrasonic range (USV) that remind of high-pitched birdsong (so called mouse song) which is mainly used in social interactions. Earlier studies suggest that mice use their USVs for mate attraction and mate choice, but they could also be used as signal during hierarchy establishment and familiarization, or other communication purposes. In this study we elucidated the vocalization behaviour of interacting female mice over an extended period of time under semi-natural conditions. We asked, if the rate or structure of female vocalization differs between different social and non-social contexts. We found that female USV is mainly used in social contexts, driven by direct communication to an unknown individual, the rate of which is decreased over time by a familiarization process. In addition we could show that female mice use two distinct types of USVs, differing in their frequency, which they use differently depending on whether they directly or indirectly communicate with another female. This supports the notion that vocalization in mice is context dependent, driven by a reasonable and yet underestimated amount of complexity that also involves the interplay between different sensory signals, like chemical and auditory cues."

The extent of colorectal cancer (CRC) genetic ITH is not well understood in Chinese patients. Thus, we conducted deep sequencing by using the OncoGxOne™ Plus panel, targeting 333 cancer-specific genes in multi-region biopsies of primary and liver metastatic tumors from three Chinese CRC patients. We determined that the extent of ITH varied among the three cases. On average, 65% of all the mutations detected were common within individual tumors. KMT2C aberrations and the NCOR1 mutation were the only ubiquitous events. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the tumors evolved in a branched manner. Comparison of the primary and metastatic tumors revealed that PPP2R1A (E370X), SETD2 (I1608V), SMAD4 (G382T), and AR splicing site mutations may be specific to liver metastatic cancer. These mutations might contribute to the initiation and progression of distant metastasis. Collectively, our analysis identified a substantial level of genetic ITH in CRC, which should be considered for personalized therapeutic strategies."

Anthropometric, body composition and biochemical parameters were measured at randomization and after 12 weeks, and analyzed under the intention to treat principle using analysis of variance models.After 12 weeks, data was collected from 79 (91%) participants. BMI z-scores were significantly lower in both intervention groups compared to control after adjusting for baseline values, SLF vs. control, mean difference = -0.13 (95%CI = -0.18, -0.07), P<0.001; SMC vs. control, -0.14 (-0.19, -0.09), P<0.001, but there was no difference between the two intervention diet groups: SLF vs. SMC, 0.00 (-0.05, 0.04), P = 0.83.Both dietary patterns resulted in similar changes in weight, body composition and metabolic improvements compared to control.

The family is highly amplified in P. falciparum, with 65 predicted genes in the genome of the 3D7 isolate. In contrast, in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei 3 genes are identified, one of which is an apparent pseudogene. Transcripts of the P. berghei phist genes are predominant in schizonts, whereas in P. falciparum transcript profiles span different asexual blood stages and gametocytes. We pursued targeted disruption of P. berghei phist genes in order to characterize a simplistic model for the expanded phist gene repertoire in P. falciparum. Unsuccessful attempts to disrupt P. berghei PBANKA_114540 suggest that this phist gene is essential, while knockout of phist PBANKA_122900 shows an apparent normal progression and non-essential function throughout the life cycle. Epitope-tagging of P. falciparum and P. berghei phist genes confirmed protein export to the erythrocyte cytoplasm and localization with a punctate pattern.

https://openalex.org/W2333918503,"The suspension-feeding Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is a native species of the western Pacific that is now widely distributed around the globe because of its commercial importance. To determine the adaptive physiological responses to changing thermal and nutritional conditions, clearance, filtration, feces production, ammonium excretion, respiration rates, and scope for growth (SFG) were measured in adult clams. The clams were exposed to 24 treatments involving the combination of four water temperatures (8, 13, 18, and 23°C) and six concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM: 9.5 to 350.5 mg L(-1)). Physiological rates were standardized by using the mean (480 mg) of tissue dry weights of experimental clams using allometric equations between physiological variables and tissue dry weight. Higher clearance rates were recorded at higher temperatures and lower SPM concentrations, and these rates decreased with increasing SPM concentration at individual temperatures. Consumed energy increased with increasing temperature and SPM concentration, peaking at around 100-200 mg L(-1) at 18-23°C. Whereas fecal energy was largely determined by SPM concentration, ammonia excretion was mainly governed by temperature. Respiration rate studies revealed a predominant quadratic effect of temperature on the metabolism, indicating a lack of acclimatory adjustment of metabolic rate to rising temperature. SFG values were positive under almost all the treatment conditions and were much higher at higher SPM concentrations (> 45 mg L(-1)), with the highest level being recorded at 18°C and 100-200 mg L(-1) SPM. Increased filtration rate offset the increased metabolic cost at warm temperatures. Our holistic findings suggest that a high degree of physiological plasticity allows R. philippinarum to tolerate the wide range of temperatures and SPM concentrations that are found in tidal flats, accounting in part for the successful distribution of this species over a wide variety of geographical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2395412248,"The C1 domain represents the recognition module for diacylglycerol and phorbol esters in protein kinase C, Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein (RasGRP), and related proteins. RasGRP2 is exceptional in that its C1 domain has very weak binding affinity (Kd = 2890 ± 240 nm for [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. We have identified four amino acid residues responsible for this lack of sensitivity. Replacing Asn(7), Ser(8), Ala(19), and Ile(21) with the corresponding residues from RasGRP1/3 (Thr(7), Tyr(8), Gly(19), and Leu(21), respectively) conferred potent binding affinity (Kd = 1.47 ± 0.03 nm) in vitro and membrane translocation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in LNCaP cells. Mutant C1 domains incorporating one to three of the four residues showed intermediate behavior with S8Y making the greatest contribution. Binding activity for diacylglycerol was restored in parallel. The requirement for anionic phospholipid for [(3)H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding was determined; it decreased in going from the single S8Y mutant to the quadruple mutant. The full-length RasGRP2 protein with the mutated C1 domains also showed strong phorbol ester binding, albeit modestly weaker than that of the C1 domain alone (Kd = 8.2 ± 1.1 nm for the full-length protein containing all four mutations), and displayed translocation in response to phorbol ester. RasGRP2 is a guanyl exchange factor for Rap1. Consistent with the ability of phorbol ester to induce translocation of the full-length RasGRP2 with the mutated C1 domain, phorbol ester enhanced the ability of the mutated RasGRP2 to activate Rap1. Modeling confirmed that the four mutations helped the binding cleft maintain a stable conformation."

This can be achieved by a concerted action of peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases and PG-synthesizing/modifying enzymes. In a search for new regulatory mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of this equilibrium in Lactococcus lactis, we isolated mutants that are resistant to the PG hydrolase lysozyme. We found that 14% of the causative mutations were mapped in the guaA gene, the product of which is involved in purine metabolism. Genetic and transcriptional analyses combined with PG structure determination of the guaA mutant enabled us to reveal the pivotal role of the pyrB gene in the regulation of CW rigidity. Our results indicate that conversion of l-aspartate (l-Asp) to N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate by PyrB may reduce the amount of l-Asp available for PG synthesis and thus cause the appearance of Asp/Asn-less stem peptides in PG. Such stem peptides do not form PG cross-bridges, resulting in a decrease in PG cross-linking and, consequently, reduced PG thickness and rigidity. We hypothesize that the concurrent utilization of l-Asp for pyrimidine and PG synthesis may be part of the regulatory scheme, ensuring CW flexibility during exponential growth and rigidity in stationary phase. The fact that l-Asp availability is dependent on nucleotide metabolism, which is tightly regulated in accordance with the growth rate, provides L. lactis cells the means to ensure optimal CW plasticity without the need to control the expression of PG synthesis genes.

Peptidoglycan (PG) 8The abbreviations used are: PGpeptidoglycanPGHpeptidoglycan hydrolaseCWcell wallPBPpenicillin-binding proteinGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamineMurNAcN-acetylmuramic acid. is the major component of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall (CW), which envelops the cell as a multilayer sacculus. PG consists of a basic unit made up of N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid (GlcNAc-MurNAc) disaccharides bound to stem pentapeptides. Disaccharide pentapeptide units are synthesized intracellularly and transported through the cytoplasmic membrane as lipid-disaccharide pentapeptides called lipid II. These blocks are covalently linked to the pre-existing PG polymers by high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (1Matsuhashi M. Utilisation of lipid-linked precursors and the formation of peptidoglycan in the process of the cell growth and division: membrane enzymes involved in the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis and the mechanism of their regulation.in: Ghuysen J.M.

Class A PBPs contain both transglycosylation and transpeptidation domains, whereas class B PBPs are involved only in transpeptidation. Transglycosylation links the disaccharide pentapeptide to the pre-existing PG chain, whereas transpeptidation connects the stem pentapeptides to neighboring chains, which ensures PG cross-linking through the formation of an interpeptide bridge. Cross-linking in Lactococcus lactis involves the synthesis of an interpeptide bridge made of one d-amino acid (d-Asp or d-Asn), and in this species the PG cross-linking index was estimated to be 35.5% (2Chapot-Chartier M.P.

The basic PG structure is often modified as PG glycan chains can undergo N-deacetylation or O-acetylation, and free carboxyl groups of amino acids of peptide chains may be amidated (4Vollmer W. Structural variation in the glycan strands of bacterial peptidoglycan.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In L. lactis, MurNAc O-acetylase is encoded by the oatA gene and is associated with resistance to peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs) (5Moynihan P.J. Clarke A.J.

Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 1655-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). N-Deacetylation of the GlcNAc present in PG is achieved by the PG deacetylase PgdA and has also been shown to protect PG from PGH activity (6Meyrand M. Boughammoura A. Courtin P. Mézange C.

The free carboxyl groups of PG-forming amino acids are amidated intracellularly before the precursors are translocated through the cytoplasmic membrane (8van Heijenoort J. Lipid intermediates in the biosynthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 620-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In L. lactis, these amino acids include d-Glu found in stem peptides and d-Asp on side chains or cross-bridges (2Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Cell wall structure and function in lactic acid bacteria.Microb. Cell Fact. 2014; 13: S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Amidation of d-Asp takes place after it has been added to the PG precursor by AslA and is catalyzed by an asparagine synthase (AsnH) (9Veiga P. Erkelenz M. Bernard E. Courtin P. Kulakauskas S. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Identification of the asparagine synthase responsible for D-Asp amidation in the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan interpeptide crossbridge.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3752-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) because d-Asn is not a substrate for the aspartate ligase AslA (10Veiga P. Piquet S. Maisons A. Furlan S. Courtin P. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Identification of an essential gene responsible for D-Asp incorporation in the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan crossbridge.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In L. lactis, the d-Asp cross-bridge is only partially (75%) amidated during the exponential phase in contrast to other bacteria in which amidation is almost complete (2Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Cell wall structure and function in lactic acid bacteria.Microb. Cell Fact. 2014; 13: S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). d-Asp amidation of L. lactis PG decreases sensitivity to cationic antimicrobials, such as lysozyme or nisin, which may be related to a reduction of the net negative charge inside the cell wall (10Veiga P. Piquet S. Maisons A. Furlan S. Courtin P. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Identification of an essential gene responsible for D-Asp incorporation in the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan crossbridge.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A strong PG sacculus is needed to counteract both high turgor pressure and cell wall stress related to environmental factors. At the same time, cleavage of PG strands is needed to allow the insertion of newly synthesized PG blocks during bacterial cell growth and for daughter cell separation after division (2Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Cell wall structure and function in lactic acid bacteria.Microb. Cell Fact. 2014; 13: S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Chapot-Chartier M.P.

Charlier P. Foster S. Bacterial peptidoglycan (murein) hydrolases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). PG flexibility is especially advantageous during exponential growth. Two opposing features of PG, i.e. rigidity and flexibility, require the coordinated and balanced action of PG-synthesizing and degradation enzymes. The loss of this balance may cause growth arrest and/or cell lysis. In bacteria, such a balance is achieved mostly by regulating the activities of potentially lethal autolytic enzymes, such as PGHs (13Lee T.K. Huang K.C. The role of hydrolases in bacterial cell-wall growth.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The factors that affect CW sensitivity to autolysins include (i) their proteolytic degradation (14Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); (ii) their specific localization within the cell, often at the septal region; (iii) shielding of PG from PGH by secondary cell wall polymers, such as teichoic acids or wall polysaccharides; (iv) alanylation of (lipo)teichoic acids; (v) O-acetylation or N-deacetylation of PG; (vi) amidation of d-Glu and d-Asp in PG stem peptides; and (vii) glycosylation of autolysins (2Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Cell wall structure and function in lactic acid bacteria.Microb. Cell Fact. 2014; 13: S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition to the introduction of PG breaks by PGHs, PG flexibility in L. lactis could also result from defective PG synthesis and cross-linking due to a deficiency in PonA, one of the class A PBPs (15Mercier C. Domakova E. Tremblay J. Kulakauskas S. Effects of a muramidase on a mixed bacterial community.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 187: 47-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PG plasticity could also be enhanced by the incorporation of exogenously added non-canonical d-amino acids into PG (16Cava F. de Pedro M.A. Peptidoglycan plasticity in bacteria: emerging variability of the murein sacculus and their associated biological functions.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2014; 18: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, the weakening of CWs by incorporation of the achiral amino acid glycine is exploited for the preparation of competent cells of Gram-positive bacteria (17Buckley N.D. Vadeboncoeur C. LeBlanc D.J. Lee L.N. Frenette M. An effective strategy, applicable to Streptococcus salivarius and related bacteria, to enhance or confer electroporation competence.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3800-3804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cruz-Rodz A.L. Gilmore M.S. High efficiency introduction of plasmid DNA into glycine treated Enterococcus faecalis by electroporation.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is important to note that too rigid PG also has deleterious consequences for bacterial growth. Overexpression of the L. lactis oatA gene leads to PG that is excessively resistant to PGH and consequently results in growth arrest (7Veiga P. Bulbarela-Sampieri C. Furlan S. Maisons A. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Erkelenz M. Mervelet P. Noirot P. Frees D. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. Gruss A. Buist G. Kulakauskas S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 19342-19354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The lethal effect of overly strong PG is consistent with findings that several PGHs are collectively essential for the growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. This lethality could be related to the need for PGH-mediated PG remodeling during key steps in the cell cycle (19Bisicchia P. Noone D. Lioliou E. Howell A. Quigley S. Jensen T. Jarmer H. Devine K.M.

To identify factors that may be involved in maintenance of the balance between CW flexibility and CW rigidity during cell growth, we isolated mutants of L. lactis that were resistant to hen egg white lysozyme. Analysis of one class of resistant mutants, which had a deletion of a large chromosome fragment encompassing the guaA gene, led us to the potential mechanism that allows the adjustment of CW rigidity to bacterial growth rate requirements without the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This mechanism is based on the utilization of l-Asp for both PG and pyrimidine synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, the presented data are the first indication of a link between nucleotide metabolism and cell wall plasticity in bacteria. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. All L. lactis strains used here are derivatives of strain MG1363 (23Gasson M.J. Plasmid complements of Streptococcus lactis NCDO 712 and other lactic streptococci after protoplast-induced curing.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L. lactis was grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (BD Biosciences) that contained 0.5% glucose (M17G). Erythromycin (2.5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) were added when needed. E. coli was grown in LB medium (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated, in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/ml), erythromycin (100 μg/ml), or chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) when needed. Nisin was prepared in Me2SO (Sigma) and added at a final concentration of 0.1 ng/ml. Growth was monitored by absorbance measurement at 600 nm (A600) with a spectrophotometer (Spectronic 20 Genesys).TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this study and their relevant genetic propertiesStrainsRelevant genotypeSource/Ref.L. lactis MG1363Plasmid-free strain23Gasson M.J.

Overnight bacterial cultures were successively diluted 10-fold, and 5 μl of each dilution was spotted on M17G agar plates supplemented with different concentrations of lysozyme. A 1347-bp fragment containing the guaA gene was deleted from the chromosome using the pORI280 (lacZ+)/pVE6007 two-plasmid system (24Law J. Buist G. Haandrikman A. Kok J. Venema G. Leenhouts K.

First, the fragments upstream (578 bp) and downstream (607 bp) of the deletion site were PCR-amplified from L. lactis MG1363 genomic DNA using primer pairs guaA-bgl (5′-atgatgagatcttcaagctttctacattgcc; restriction site is underlined) and guaA-xmab (5′-atgatgcccgggatgagttctgagaaaacacc) and primer pairs guaA-xmax (5′-atgatgcccgggaaaacgtatcgtcaatgagg) and guaA-xba (5′-atgatgtctagacatctccaataaacatctgg). Then both fragments were digested with the restriction endonuclease SmaI (New England Biolabs) and PCR-amplified using primers guaA-bgl and guaA-xba. The amplified region was digested with BglII and XbaI and ligated with T4DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to a BglII-XbaI-digested pORI280, and the ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli JIM4646. The pORI280 derivative that was needed for construction of a guaA deletion mutant was obtained as an erythromycin-resistant transformant. The resulting plasmid, pVES4848, and a thermosensitive plasmid encoding chloramphenicol resistance, pVE6007, were introduced into MG1363; transformants were selected by erythromycin (2.5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (2.5 μg/ml) resistance. Plasmid pVES4848 was integrated in the resulting strain following overnight growth in erythromycin-supplemented M17G liquid medium at 37 °C, a temperature that prevents pVE6007 replication. The culture was then plated on M17G agar with erythromycin, and four independent chloramphenicol-sensitive clones were isolated and grown on M17G without antibiotics for at least 100 generations. Strain VES4883 (ΔguaA) was then selected as a white colony on M17G agar supplemented with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) and verified by PCR and nucleotide sequence determination. To inactivate the pyrB gene, we followed the same procedure using the primer pairs pyrBBglII (5′-tgttgtagatctcgatttatgtgattgctgg) and pyrBXmaR (5′-tgttgtcccgggaaggtctcctttaccctg) for amplification of the upstream 588-bp fragment and pyrBXmaF (5′-tgttgtcccgggatggccattcttgaagcc) and pyrBXbaI (5′-tgttgttctagacagtagcttgaagttggc) for the downstream 576-bp fragment. The resulting strain, VES6497, carried a deletion of the 888-bp fragment that contained pyrB. Similarly, the guaA deletion was introduced in strain VEL1378 (dltD), creating strain VES5160, and the pyrB deletion was introduced in strain VES4883 (ΔguaA), yielding VES6530. Also, the ΔacmA mutation was introduced in strain VES6497 by using the plasmid pINTAA and following the procedure described previously (14Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), thus creating strain VES6831. The ponA pyrB double mutant VES6949 was constructed by transforming strain VES6497 with plasmid pVE1837 (pRV300 carrying a 210-bp internal fragment of ponA (26Mercier C. Durrieu C. Briandet R.

With primers gua1 (5′-cggacttttgcaccttataa) and gua2 (5′-gcgttaatagaattatagcg), we PCR-amplified a 1786-bp fragment of L. lactis MG1363 genomic DNA but were unable to obtain the corresponding DNA fragment using DNA of the mutant VES2824 (Fig. 1). However, in the latter strain, we were able to amplify a 3590-bp DNA fragment using primers gua3 (5′-tttatacgggaatcgttgcg) and gua4 (5′-ttggcacttaattcttgccc). DNA sequence determination of this fragment revealed that it contained the IS905 transposon DNA sequence flanked by sequences that are situated upstream and downstream of IS905 transposons, indicating that VES2824 is missing the 33,893-bp chromosomal fragment situated between the two IS905s. The DNA fragment carrying the pyrB gene was PCR-amplified from L. lactis MG1363 genomic DNA using the primer pair 7.gibs.pyrB1 (5′-aaataaattataaggaggcactcaccATGTCAGTAAAAAATGGATTAGTTC, nucleosides in uppercase correspond to pyrB gene sequence; those in lowercase are plasmid sequence) and 8.gibs.pyrB2 (5′-agtggtaccgcatgcctgcagtaccAACTTACTTCGCTTTTTTTCCAGCAAG). The fragment was ligated to the NcoI-digested plasmid pMSP3545 using isothermal assembly (27Gibson D.G. Young L. Chuang R.Y. Venter J.C. Hutchison 3rd, C.A. Smith H.O. Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (5445) Google Scholar) and introduced in VES6497. The clone that carried plasmid pMSP3545::pyrB+ (nisin-inducible pyrB), VES6953, was verified by PCR and DNA nucleotide sequence determination. PG was extracted from cultures in the exponential (A600 0.4 for MG1363 and A600 0.2 for VES6497 (ΔpyrB) and VES4883 (ΔguaA)) and early stationary growth phases (A600 1.2 for MG1363) as described previously (28Courtin P.

https://openalex.org/W2326279138,"Background There is substantial evidence that chronic renal and cardiovascular diseases are associated with coagulation disorders, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and fibrosis. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Insertion/Deletion polymorphism (ACE I/D polymorphism) has also be linked to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to compare plasma levels of ultrassensible C-reactive protein (usCRP), PAI-1, D-dimer and TGF-β1 in patients undergoing HD with different ACE I/D polymorphisms. Methods The study was performed in 138 patients at ESRD under hemodialysis therapy for more than six months. The patients were divided into three groups according to the genotype. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood cells (leukocytes). ACE I/D polymorphism was investigated by single polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasma levels of D-dimer, PAI-1 and TGF-β1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the determination of plasma levels of usCRP was performed by immunonephelometry. Data were analyzed by the software SigmaStat 2.03. Results Clinical characteristics were similar in patients with these three ACE I/D polymorphisms, except for interdialytic weight gain. I allele could be associated with higher interdialytic weight gain (P = 0.017). Patients genotyped as DD and as ID had significantly higher levels of PAI-1 than those with II genotype. Other laboratory parameters did not significantly differ among the three subgroups (P = 0.033). Despite not reaching statistical significance, plasma levels of usCRP were higher in patients carrying the D allele. Conclusion ACE I/D polymorphisms could be associated with changes in the regulation of sodium, fibrinolytic system, and possibly, inflammation. Our data showed that high levels of PAI-1 are detected when D allele is present, whereas greater interdialytic gain is associated with the presence of I allele. However, further studies with different experimental designs are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms involved in these associations."

Methods This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. In-person interviews were conducted in early pregnancy to collect information regarding IPV history, and sleep traits. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated using logistic regression procedures. Results Lifetime IPV was associated with a 1.54-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (95% CI: 1.08–2.17) and a 1.93-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.33–2.81). Compared with women experiencing no IPV during lifetime, the aOR (95% CI) for stress-related sleep disturbance associated with each type of IPV were: physical abuse only 1.24 (95% CI: 0.84–1.83), sexual abuse only 3.44 (95%CI: 1.07–11.05), and physical and sexual abuse 2.51 (95% CI: 1.27–4.96). The corresponding aORs (95% CI) for poor sleep quality were: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.13–2.61), 2.82 (95% CI: 0.99–8.03), and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.30–4.81), respectively. Women reporting any IPV in the year prior to pregnancy had increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.17–3.67) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.30–3.97) during pregnancy. Conclusion Lifetime and prevalent IPV exposures are associated with stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be important mechanisms that underlie the lasting adverse effects of IPV on maternal and perinatal health."
https://openalex.org/W2315262250,"Tropical infectious disease prevalence is dependent on many socio-cultural determinants. However, rainfall and temperature frequently underlie overall prevalence, particularly for vector-borne diseases. As a result these diseases have increased prevalence in tropical as compared to temperate regions. Specific to tropical Africa, the tendency to incorrectly infer that tropical diseases are uniformly prevalent has been partially overcome with solid epidemiologic data. This finer resolution data is important in multiple contexts, including understanding risk, predictive value in disease diagnosis, and population immunity. We hypothesized that within the context of a tropical climate, vector-borne pathogen prevalence would significantly differ according to zonal differences in rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and vegetation condition. We then determined if these environmental data were predictive of pathogen prevalence. First we determined the prevalence of three major pathogens of cattle, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Theileria spp, in the three vegetation zones where cattle are predominantly raised in Ghana: Guinea savannah, semi-deciduous forest, and coastal savannah. The prevalence of A. marginale was 63%, 26% for Theileria spp and 2% for B. bigemina. A. marginale and Theileria spp. were significantly more prevalent in the coastal savannah as compared to either the Guinea savanna or the semi-deciduous forest, supporting acceptance of the first hypothesis. To test the predictive power of environmental variables, the data over a three year period were considered in best subsets multiple linear regression models predicting prevalence of each pathogen. Corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) were assigned to the alternative models to compare their utility. Competitive models for each response were averaged using AICc weights. Rainfall was most predictive of pathogen prevalence, and EVI also contributed to A. marginale and B. bigemina prevalence. These findings support the utility of environmental data for understanding vector-borne disease epidemiology on a regional level within a tropical environment."
https://openalex.org/W2320084820,"Modeling studies using hypothetical polygenic risk data can be an efficient tool for investigating the effectiveness of downstream applications such as targeting interventions to risk groups to justify whether empirical investigation is warranted. We investigated the assumptions underlying a method that simulates risk data for specific values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).The simulation method constructs risk data for a hypothetical population based on the population disease risk, and the odds ratios and frequencies of genetic variants. By systematically varying the parameters, we investigated under what conditions AUC values represent unique ROC curves with unique risk distributions for patients and nonpatients, and to what extend risk data can be simulated for precise values of the AUC.Using larger number of genetic variants each with a modest effect, we observed that the distributions of estimated risks of patients and nonpatients were similar for various combinations of the odds ratios and frequencies of the risk alleles. Simulated ROC curves overlapped empirical curves with the same AUC.Polygenic risk data can be effectively and efficiently created using a simulation method. This allows to further investigate the potential applications of stratifying interventions on the basis of polygenic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2328284214,"The genus Populus represents one of the most economically important groups of forest trees. It is composed by approximately 30 species used for wood and non-wood products, phytoremediation and biomass. Poplar is subjected to several biological and environmental threats although, compared to annual crops, we know far less about the genetic bases of biotic stress resistance. Woolly poplar aphid (Phloeomyzus passerinii) is considered a main pest of cultivated poplars in European and American countries. In this work we present two high density linkage maps in poplar obtained by a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach and the identification of QTLs involved in Ph. passerinii resistance. A total of 5,667 polymorphic markers (5,606 SNPs and 61 SSRs) identified on expressed sequences have been used to genotype 131 plants of an F1 population P ×canadensis obtained by an interspecific mate between Populus deltoides (resistant to woolly poplar aphid) and Populus nigra (susceptible to woolly poplar aphid). The two linkage maps, obtained following the two-way pseudo-testcross mapping strategy, have been used to investigate the genetic bases of woolly poplar aphid resistance. One major QTL and two QTLs with minor effects (mapped on LGV, LGXVI and LG XIX) explaining the 65.8% of the genetic variance observed in the progeny in response to Ph. passerinii attack were found. The high density coverage of functional markers allowed the identification of three genes belonging to disease resistance pathway as putative candidates for P. deltoides resistance to woolly poplar aphid. This work is the first report on genetic of woolly poplar aphid genetic resistance and the resistant loci associated markers identified represent a valuable tool in resistance poplar breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2334620521,"Background Until now, radiographic manifestations of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR- TB) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have not been reported. We conducted a study to investigate the imaging features of pulmonary computed tomography (CT) for type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with MDR-TB. Methods The clinical data and pulmonary CT findings of 39 type 2 diabetic patients with MDR-TB, 46 type 2 diabetic patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB), and 72 pure drug-susceptible TB cases (without T2DM and MDR) treated at Dalian Tuberculosis Hospital from 2012 to 2015 were collected, and the clinical features and imaging differences of the three groups were compared. Results The clinical characteristics of the three groups of patients were not significantly different except with respect to age and previous treatment history. However, on imaging, the patients with MDR-TB showed consolidation in and above the pulmonary segments was significantly more extensive than that seen in the DS-TB group with or without T2DM. Conclusion Consolidation in or above multiple pulmonary segments with multiple mouth-eaten cavities and bronchial damage on pulmonary CT images in type 2 diabetic patients with tuberculosis suggests the possibility of multi-drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2312538053,"RNase R is a 3′ to 5′ hydrolytic exoribonuclease that has the unusual ability to digest highly structured RNA. The enzyme possesses an intrinsic, ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that is essential in vitro for efficient nuclease activity against double-stranded RNA substrates, particularly at lower temperatures, with more stable RNA duplexes, and for duplexes with short 3′ overhangs. Here, we inquired whether the helicase activity was also important for RNase R function in vivo and for RNA metabolism. We find that strains containing a helicase-deficient RNase R due to mutations in its ATP-binding Walker motifs exhibit growth defects at low temperatures. Most importantly, cells also lacking polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), and dependent for growth on RNase R, grow extremely poorly at 34, 37, and 42 °C and do not grow at all at 31 °C.

Escherichia coli RNase R contains an intrinsic RNA helicase activity (10Awano N. Rajagopal V. Arbing M. Patel S. Hunt J. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Escherichia coli RNase R has dual activities, helicase and RNase.J.

In the E. coli protein, we also identified Walker A and Walker B motifs that are responsible for ATP binding and consequent RNA helicase activity, and found that they are conserved in most mesophilic bacterial genera, but are absent from thermophilic bacteria (8Hossain S.T.

This conclusion was reinforced by biochemical analyses showing that the helicase activity is essential for efficient nuclease activity in vitro, particularly at lower temperatures, with duplexes containing short 3′ overhangs, and with more stable RNA duplexes (8Hossain S.T.

Whether the helicase activity is also important for nuclease activity in vivo has been unclear. It is known that RNase R can complement the essential function of CsdA, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, during cold shock (11Awano N. Xu C. Ke H. Inoue K. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Complementation analysis of the cold-sensitive phenotype of the Escherichia coli csdA deletion strain.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5808-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that the helicase activity of RNase R can function in vivo. Moreover, this complementation activity persists even when the nuclease activity of RNase R has been eliminated by mutation. However, all of these studies were carried out under conditions in which RNase R was overexpressed, raising the question of whether the helicase ever functions physiologically in vivo independent of the nuclease activity of RNase R. On the other hand, because the helicase activity is important for efficient RNase R nuclease activity in vitro, it was of considerable interest for our understanding of RNase R function to determine whether the helicase also affects RNase R catalysis in vivo. In this study, we examine how the helicase activity affects RNase R function and RNA metabolism in vivo. We find that mutation of either the Walker A or Walker B motifs, which eliminates the helicase activity (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P.

Chem. 2015; 290: 15697-15706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), leads to growth defects even though all other RNA helicases are present. Most importantly, we show that mutant strains lacking the RNase R helicase activity, and also lacking polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), 2The abbreviation used is: PNPasepolynucleotide phosphorylase. cannot grow at 31 °C, and grow poorly even at 37 and 42 °C. In addition, these cells accumulate high levels of rRNA fragments. Because earlier studies from our laboratory had shown that only PNPase or RNase R is able to degrade such rRNA fragments (3Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), these data indicate that RNase R does not function properly in vivo when its intrinsic RNA helicase activity is eliminated. Based on these findings, we conclude that the helicase activity plays an essential role in RNase R function and in RNA metabolism. polynucleotide phosphorylase.

Bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc., [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, nylon membrane was from GE Healthcare Life Sciences, and ExpressHyb hybridization solution was from Clontech. All chemicals were reagent grade. All strains used in this study were derivatives of E. coli MG1655(Seq)* I−, which was considered to be wild type for this study. MG1655(Seq)*, an rph+ derivative of MG1655, was constructed by Donald Court (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and provided by Kenneth Rudd (University of Miami, FL). The RNase I− derivatives were constructed by recombineering (12Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues in the RNase R Walker A motif (K736A) and Walker B motif (D168A,D169A) in the chromosome were performed using oligonucleotides T1 and T2, respectively (supplemental Table 1), and the protocol described previously (15Liang W.

Aspartic acid 272 of RNase R was changed to asparagine using oligonucleotide T3 (supplemental Table 1), and recombinants were selected by PCR with primers S5 and S6 (supplemental Table 1). All the chromosomal mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant strains lacking PNPase and carrying Walker A (K736A) or Walker B (D168A,D169A) motif mutations were generated by P1-mediated transduction. Mutant strains were confirmed by kanamycin resistance. The E. coli MG1655*Δ6 helicase strain was kindly provided by Dr. Chaitanya Jain, University of Miami (16Jagessar K.L. Jain C.

The Δrnr derivative of the E. coli MG1655*Δ6 helicase strain was generated by phage P1-mediated transduction with rnr::kan and was confirmed by kanamycin resistance. For measurement of cell doubling times, overnight cultures were subcultured into fresh rich medium (LB medium) or minimal medium (1× M9 salts, 0.2% glucose). Antibiotics were added as required at the following concentrations: 50 mg/ml kanamycin, 20 mg/ml chloramphenicol, and 15 mg/ml tetracycline. Cultures were incubated with shaking at various temperatures as indicated to an A600 of ∼0.2. Samples were taken at regular time intervals to measure cell density during exponential phase growth, and doubling times were calculated from the data points obtained. Overnight cultures were subcultured into fresh LB medium and incubated with shaking at various temperatures as indicated to an A600 = 0.6. Total RNA was prepared by hot phenol/chloroform treatment of cell pellets and ethanol precipitation (17Huang S. Deutscher M.P. Sequence and transcriptional analysis of the Escherichia coli rnt gene encoding RNase T.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25609-25613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was resolved in a 1.2% agarose gel, and then stained with ethidium bromide. RNA was resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) and transferred to a nylon membrane using 1× TAE transfer solution by downward capillary transfer for 3 h. DNA oligonucleotide probes complementary to either 16S rRNA (16S(18–34), 5′-GCGTTCAATCTGAGCCATG-3′; 16S(790–812), 5′-CGGCGTGGACTACCAGGGTATC-3′; 16S(1520–1540), 5′-AGGAGGTGATCCAACCGCAGG-3′) or 23S rRNA (23S(35–55), 5′-CCTTCATCGCCTCTGACTGCC-3′; 23S(1501–1521), 5′-CACGCCTCAGCCTTGATTTTC-3′; 23S(2881–2901), 5′-GTTAAGCCTCACGGTTCATTA-3′) were 32P-labeled at their 5′ ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Probes were annealed to the transferred RNA using ExpressHyb hybridization solution by overnight incubation. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. E. coli MG1655* WT, E. coli MG1655*Δrnr, E. coli MG1655* Δ6helicase, and E. coli MG1655*Δrnr Δ6helicase were used. Plasmid pET44 containing RNase R WT and its mutant derivatives were used for the complementation analysis. Leaky expression of the inserted genes in this vector system in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used to keep overexpression low. After transformation, each strain was streaked on LB plates and incubated at different temperatures for various time periods, as indicated in the figures. In earlier studies, we found that in vitro the intrinsic helicase activity of RNase R is important for effective nucleolytic activity against dsRNA substrates, particularly at lower temperatures, with duplexes having short 3′ overhangs, and with more stable duplexes (8Hossain S.T.

The studies presented below examine the role of the helicase activity in RNase R function in vivo. To examine the importance of the RNase R helicase activity, we mutated conserved amino acids within the Walker A (Lys-736) or Walker B (Asp-168 and Asp-169) ATP-binding motifs to alanine residues. These mutations were previously shown to inactivate the helicase activity (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P.

For initial analysis of the mutant strains carrying each of these mutations in the chromosome, we measured their growth rates in rich medium and compared them with those of an RNase R deletion strain and with WT. Strains containing either the Walker A or Walker B mutant motifs grew essentially the same as the RNase R deletion strain at all temperatures between 42 and 15 °C (Table 1). Moreover, although all the mutant strains grew similarly to the WT at 42 and 37 °C, their growth rates slowed relative to WT at 31 °C, and the growth defect became even more pronounced as the temperature decreased further (Table 1). These data indicate that the presence of RNase R is most important at lower temperatures and that the absence of helicase activity is as deleterious to cell growth as complete removal of RNase R.TABLE 1Growth rates of RNase R Walker motif mutant strains in rich mediumDoubling time (min)Growth temperatureWTR−R736AR D168A,D169A42 °C22 ± 223 ± 222 ± 322 ± 237 °C26 ± 227 ± 228 ± 228 ± 231 °C41 ± 245 ± 248 ± 3*47 ± 3*25 °C74 ± 3114 ± 4123 ± 4**119 ± 4**20 °C121 ± 3197 ± 4213 ± 5**207 ± 4**15 °C235 ± 5396 ± 5417 ± 6**409 ± 6**Overnight cultures of the wild-type strain, MG*1655 I−, and its derivatives carrying RNase R gene deletion or a mutation in the Walker A or Walker B motifs were subcultured into rich medium and grown at temperatures between 42 and 15 °C.

Cell doubling times and standard deviations were calculated based on data from four replicate experiments. * denotes p < 0.01 and ** denotes p < 0.0001 by a two-tailed Student's t test as compared with the WT strain. We also determined the doubling times of WT and mutant strains in M9/glucose minimal medium at different temperatures. As shown in Table 2, all the growth rates were dramatically slowed in minimal medium as compared with rich medium, but the relative rates remained the same. The Walker motif mutants grew the same as the RNase R deletion strain at all temperatures examined. At higher temperatures (37 and 42 °C), the mutant strains had doubling times almost the same as that of the WT strain, but grew more slowly as the temperature decreased, particularly at 25 and 15 °C. Based on these data, it appears that the intrinsic helicase activity is an important component for the proper functioning of RNase R in vivo, and that its role becomes more pronounced at lower temperatures, consistent with our previous findings that the helicase activity is essential for efficient degradation of double-stranded RNA in vitro (8Hossain S.T.

In E. coli, in addition to RNase R, PNPase also participates in degradation of structured RNA (2Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. An important role for RNase R in mRNA decay.Mol.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells become inviable only when both nucleases are absent. Thus, to more accurately assess the specific role of the helicase activity for RNase R function, we introduced a PNP− mutation into the strains already mutated in their Walker A or Walker B motifs, and then measured growth of the resulting strains (Table 3). Cells lacking PNPase grew more slowly than those lacking RNase R at all temperatures examined, and the growth differential became more pronounced at lower temperatures, indicating that PNPase is required for normal cell growth, especially at temperatures below ∼25 °C. However, removal of the RNase R helicase activity by mutation of either Walker motif together with the absence of PNPase had a profound effect on cell growth. Cells were able to grow only at temperatures at or above 34 °C, and they grew extremely slowly as compared with cells lacking just PNPase; at 31 °C or below, cells were unable to grow. It should be noted that cells lacking both RNase R and PNPase are inviable even at the elevated temperatures (3Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. Quality control of ribosomal RNA mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These data clearly demonstrate that the helicase activity is required for the proper functioning of RNase R in vivo. Even at higher temperatures, conditions in which RNase R lacking helicase activity functions relatively normally in vitro (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. The helicase activity of ribonuclease R is essential for efficient nuclease activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15697-15706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the role of RNase R is severely compromised in vivo.TABLE 3Growth rates in rich medium of strains mutated in an RNase R Walker motif and lacking PNPaseGrowth temperatureDoubling time (min)R −PNP−PNP− RAPNP− RB42 °C23 ± 226 ± 271 ± 4*68 ± 4*37 °C27 ± 231 ± 2103 ± 5*98 ± 5*34 °C34 ± 242 ± 3315 ± 6*286 ± 7*31 °C45 ± 252 ± 3No growthNo growth25 °C114 ± 4136 ± 5No growthNo growth20 °C197 ± 4260 ± 5No growthNo growth15 °C396 ± 5613 ± 7No growthNo growthOvernight cultures of the indicated strains were subcultured into rich medium and grown measured at temperatures between 42 and 15 °C.

Data for the R− column were taken from Table 1 for comparison purposes. * denotes p < 0.0001 by a two-tailed Student's t test as compared with the PNP− strain. We also examined the doubling times of the strains lacking PNPase together with a Walker motif mutation in M9/glucose minimal medium and compared their growth with an RNase R deletion mutant strain and with a PNPase deletion mutant strain (Table 4). As before, cells grew more slowly in minimal medium, and as was observed in rich medium, cells containing a non-functional Walker motif, and also lacking PNPase, were unable to grow at 31 °C or below. Moreover, they grew more slowly than cells lacking RNase R or PNPase, even at 37 and 42 °C, temperatures more optimal for growth. From these observations, it is apparent that the RNase R helicase activity is essential for normal growth and viability of cells lacking PNPase, and therefore, these data also support the conclusion that the intrinsic helicase activity is an essential component for RNase R function in vivo.TABLE 4Growth rate in minimal medium of strains mutated in a Walker motif and lacking RNase RGrowth temperatureDoubling time (min)R −PNP−PNP− RAPNP− RB42 °C81 ± 684 ± 5142 ± 6*136 ± 6*37 °C65 ± 567 ± 5153 ± 7*149 ± 6*31 °C126 ± 6135 ± 7No growthNo growth25 °C183 ± 7202 ± 8No growthNo growthOvernight cultures of the same strains as in Table 3 were subcultured into M9/glucose minimal medium and grown measured at the indicated temperatures.

In previous studies, we found that strains lacking PNPase and RNase R are inviable because they accumulate large amounts of 23S and 16S rRNA fragments (3Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. Quality control of ribosomal RNA mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether the poor growth observed for strains missing PNPase and carrying an RNase R Walker motif mutation was also due to an inability to degrade rRNA fragments. To examine this point, cells were grown in LB medium to an A600 = 0.6 at either 37 °C or 37 °C and then switched to 31 °C, a temperature at which these cells cease growth. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed on an agarose gel. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, several new RNA fragments, detectable by ethidium bromide staining, appeared in cells lacking PNPase and also containing an RNase R Walker motif mutation that was absent in the WT, RNase R deletion mutant, or PNPase deletion mutant strains. More detailed examination was carried out by Northern analysis using multiple probes complementary to 16S or 23S rRNA. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, the RNA molecules that accumulated were, in fact, fragments of both 16S and 23S rRNA, and were present at a much lower level in the WT, the RNase R deletion mutant, and the PNPase deletion mutant strains as compared with cells lacking both PNPase and the RNase R helicase activity. Based on these data, we conclude that cells lacking PNPase and mutated in either Walker motif behave essentially the same with regard to accumulation of rRNA fragments as cells that lack both PNPase and RNase R activity (3Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. Quality control of ribosomal RNA mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These findings support the conclusion that in the absence of its RNA helicase activity, RNase R is relatively inactive in vivo. As reported earlier (3Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. Quality control of ribosomal RNA mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), cells require either active RNase R or active PNPase to maintain cell viability, and as shown above, growth cannot be maintained by RNase R alone at temperatures of 31 °C or below if the enzyme lacks its intrinsic helicase activity. A similar situation occurs with PNPase. Thus, in cells lacking RNase R, in which growth is dependent on the presence of active PNPase, growth ceased at temperatures of 31 °C or lower when the six known RNA helicases in E. coli were also absent (Fig. 2A, 6Hel−, R− strain). Cells lacking only RNase R or only the six RNA helicases could grow at all the temperatures tested (Fig. 2A). These data show that PNPase also requires RNA helicase activity to function in vivo. As an additional test of the importance of the RNase R helicase activity for RNase R function, we examined the ability of RNase R to complement the growth of the 6Hel−, R− strain at lower temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, growth was restored to the 6Hel−, R− strain when the WT RNase R gene was introduced. However, growth did not occur if the complementing RNase R gene was mutated in either its Walker A or its Walker B motif (Fig. 2B), which eliminates the intrinsic helicase activity. These data confirm that RNase R does not function in vivo at 31 °C or below when its RNA helicase activity is absent. Moreover, cells do not grow at 31 or 25 °C when the complementing RNase R gene lacks nuclease activity (D272N) despite the fact that this RNase R still retains helicase activity (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. The helicase activity of ribonuclease R is essential for efficient nuclease activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15697-15706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the helicase activity of RNase R, by itself, is unable to complement the six missing helicases. The studies presented here clearly show that the intrinsic RNA helicase activity of RNase R is essential for the proper functioning of RNase R in vivo, even at a temperature (37 °C) at which its catalytic activity is relatively unaffected in vitro (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. The helicase activity of ribonuclease R is essential for efficient nuclease activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15697-15706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. How RNase R degrades structured RNA: role of the helicase activity and the S1 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 7877-7887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of the helicase activity, cells grow extremely poorly, especially when PNPase is also missing such that growth is dependent on a fully active RNase R. Cells lacking both PNPase and RNase R are unable to grow, and accumulate massive amounts of rRNA fragments (3Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. Quality control of ribosomal RNA mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The fact that cells lacking PNPase, and containing a helicase-deficient RNase R, exhibit the identical phenotype shows that RNase R without its helicase activity is essentially non-functional in vivo. The slow rate of growth exhibited by these cells at 34–42 °C is likely due to a low level of residual RNase R nuclease activity combined with the greater “breathing” of RNA duplexes at the higher temperatures. However, growth is so slow under these conditions that any residual nuclease activity must be quite low. It is interesting that in vitro the nuclease activity of helicase-deficient RNase R is relatively normal at 37 °C (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. The helicase activity of ribonuclease R is essential for efficient nuclease activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15697-15706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas it is markedly deficient in vivo at this temperature. We believe that this difference is due to the much wider range of potential duplex substrates present in vivo as compared with the few synthetic substrates used to assess catalytic activity in the in vitro experiments. Moreover, duplex RNAs are probably stabilized in vivo as a consequence of their association with proteins, polyamines, and divalent cations as well as the very different ionic conditions that exist in cells as compared with those in the in vitro assays. Based on our findings, it is reasonable to conclude that exoribonucleases would require the assistance of an RNA helicase in vivo to digest through structured RNA. This helicase activity may be intrinsic to the nuclease, as in the case of RNase R, or it may be a distinct protein as occurs with PNPase in its association with components of the RNA degradosome (19Liou G.G. Chang H.Y. Lin C.S. Lin-Chao S. DEAD box RhlB RNA helicase physically associates with exoribonuclease PNPase to degrade double-stranded RNA independent of the degradosome-assembling region of RNase E.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41157-41162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. RhlB helicase rather than enolase is the β-subunit of the Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)-exoribonucleolytic complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16590-16595Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although bioinformatic analysis indicated that most RNase Rs contain Walker A and Walker B motifs indicative of an intrinsic helicase activity, the RNase Rs of some organisms lack these motifs (8Hossain S.T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. The helicase activity of ribonuclease R is essential for efficient nuclease activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15697-15706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, RNase Rs in thermophilic bacteria do not contain Walker motifs, suggesting that they lack an intrinsic RNA helicase activity, and raising the possibility that the activity is not necessary for cells living in a high temperature environment in which duplex RNA structures might be less stable. On the other hand, the RNase R of the psychrophilic bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae, also lacks Walker motifs, and this nuclease is part of a degradosome containing an RNA helicase (21Purusharth R.I. Madhuri B. Ray M.K. Exoribonuclease R in Pseudomonas syringae is essential for growth at low temperature and plays a novel role in the 3′ end processing of 16 and 5 S ribosomal RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16267-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Perhaps an intrinsic RNA helicase is insufficient to open the stable RNA duplexes expected to be present in an organism surviving at low temperatures, and only an energy-driven helicase suffices. Further work will be needed to answer these questions. One aspect of the RNase R helicase activity that is not yet fully understood is its ability to complement the cold shock function of CsdA, a DEAD-box helicase (11Awano N. Xu C. Ke H. Inoue K. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Complementation analysis of the cold-sensitive phenotype of the Escherichia coli csdA deletion strain.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5808-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CsdA is essential at low temperatures, and we believe this is because it associates with PNPase and is required for PNPase to function under these conditions (22Yamanaka K. Inouye M. Selective mRNA degradation by polynucleotide phosphorylase in cold shock adaptation in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2808-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Prud'homme-Généreux A. Beran R.K. Iost I. Ramey C.S. Mackie G.A. Simons R.W.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the absence of CsdA, PNPase would be unable to function properly, thereby leading to the same impaired growth as is observed for a PNP− strain. The single chromosomal copy of rnr is unable to provide sufficient activity to overcome the absence of PNPase activity, but RNase R can complement when overexpressed (10Awano N. Rajagopal V. Arbing M. Patel S. Hunt J. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Escherichia coli RNase R has dual activities, helicase and RNase.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This scenario would explain the earlier complementation data. What has not been easy to explain is how RNase R lacking its nuclease activity is still able to complement a csdA deletion (11Awano N. Xu C. Ke H. Inoue K. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Complementation analysis of the cold-sensitive phenotype of the Escherichia coli csdA deletion strain.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5808-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have now found in vitro that at high levels, nuclease-deficient RNase R can complement because it converts a duplex substrate to single strands, which then are easily digested by PNPase and RNase R (data not shown). If a similar situation occurs in vivo, such a mechanism would allow PNPase and the WT RNase R present in the strain to function in the absence of CsdA and lead to the apparent complementation by nuclease-deficient RNase R that was observed (11Awano N. Xu C. Ke H. Inoue K. Inouye M. Phadtare S. Complementation analysis of the cold-sensitive phenotype of the Escherichia coli csdA deletion strain.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5808-5815Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The work presented in this study greatly increases our appreciation of the importance of the RNA helicase activity to RNase R function. Taken together with our recent study (9Hossain S.T. Malhotra A.

Accordingly, the regulation of dendritic spine density in the hippocampus is thought to play a central role in learning and memory.

Cell exposure studies reveal that the increase in spine density can persist for days in the presence of these compounds, but returns to normal spine density levels within 24 h when the compounds are removed, demonstrating the capability to reversibly control spinogenic activity. Time-lapse imaging of dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures shows that these compounds promote a net increase in spine density through the formation of new spines. Biochemical studies support that promotion of spine formation by these compounds is accompanied by Ras activation. These spinogenic molecules were also capable of inhibiting a suspected mechanism for dendritic spine loss induced by Alzheimer-related aggregated amyloid-β peptides in primary neurons.

Interestingly, BTA-EG4 showed the capability to improve memory and learning in cognitive performance tests in both wild-type mice and in a mouse model for AD (18Megill A. Lee T. DiBattista A.M.

Because of the scarcity of small molecules known to increase dendritic spine density, this rare feature of benzothiazole amphiphiles is of particular interest and could be utilized as a tool to help study the relationship between spines and cognitive function. The in vivo results of BTA-EG4 suggest that it may provide broad therapeutic benefits for improving cognitive function in AD as well as in other dendritic spine-related diseases (20Penzes P.

However, we also observed toxicity of this compound in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that correlated with its ability to partition in membranes and induce membrane lysis (23Prangkio P. Rao D.K. Lance K.D. Rubinshtein M. Yang J. Mayer M. Self-assembled, cation-selective ion channels from an oligo(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Toxicity is one of the biggest issues at every stage of drug development (24Kramer J.A. Sagartz J.E. Morris D.L. The application of discovery toxicology and pathology towards the design of safer pharmaceutical lead candidates.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 636-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and the toxicity of BTA-EG4 precluded our capability to adequately evaluate the extent of its spinogenic biological activity. To further evaluate the ability of the benzothiazole agents to promote spinogenesis, herein we designed and characterized three novel structural variants of the BTA compounds. These new benzothiazole amphiphiles (BAMs) (1–3, Fig. 1) exhibit substantially less toxicity compared with the parent BTA compound. We show that these new BAM agents are capable of promoting an increase in dendritic spine density and can serve as either a pre- or co-treatment to negate the overall net spine loss induced by the presence of aggregated Aβ peptides. Additionally, these compounds are capable of directly inhibiting aggregated Aβ from inducing spine loss mediated by a Cofilin-dependent pathway. This spinogenic activity was dose-dependent in primary neurons, and, using BAM1-EG6 (1) as a representative example, we demonstrate that the increase in spine density is reversible by removal of the compound from the cellular environment. Time-dependent imaging studies of primary neurons treated with BAM1-EG6 reveal that these benzothiazoles can increase spine density through promoting the formation of new spines. Signal transduction studies support that these molecules promote spine formation by involving the activation of the Ras and do not directly affect overall F/G actin ratios or ARP2 expression levels in primary neurons. Taken together, these results demonstrate that these BAM agents represent new potential tools to study the relationship between dendritic spines and cognitive behavior and may open up a new avenue to explore the use of spinogenic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative and other spine-related cognitive disorders. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay (Product No: 30-1010K) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA).

The general synthetic procedures we used to prepare benzothiazole amphiphiles (BAMs 1–3) are outlined in Fig. 1B.

Extended detailed descriptions of syntheses and characterization of compounds can be found in the supplemental information.

Briefly, BAMs 1–3 and BTA-EG6 were diluted to a final concentration of 50 μm in deionized H2O, pure octanol, and a liposome suspension. The liposomes were prepared from a total lipid concentration of 10 mm diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DiPhyPC) in water by the gentle dehydration/rehydration method followed by tip sonication (32Huang C.-H. Phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Formation and physical characteristics.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). 200 μl of each sample was transferred to a cuvette (Helma Analytics, Quartz SUPRASIL (QS), 10 mm), and the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured in a PTI spectrofluorometer (0.5 nm step size) in water, octanol and an aqueous liposome suspension for BAMs 1–3 and BTA-EG6. Maximal excitation and emission values (λmax) for all compounds were as follows: BTA-EG6 (Ex/Em 355/420 nm), BAM1-EG6 (Ex/Em 355/420 nm), BAM2-EG6, (Ex/Em 365/428 nm), and BAM3-EG6 (Ex/Em 335/398 nm). Each experiment was repeated at least three separate times and error bars denote standard deviation from the mean. Data were processed using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Log P values were calculated using molinspiration cheminformatics software and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) values were calculated with PyMOL. Rat dissociated hippocampal neurons from postnatal day 1 Sprague-Dawley® outbred rats of both sexes were plated at a density of 45,000 cells/cm2 onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips or 96-well plates. Neurons were maintained in B27 supplemented Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) until days in vitro (DIV) 18–23, as previously described (33Djakovic S.N. Schwarz L.A. Barylko B. DeMartino G.N.

Overall neuronal health was monitored visually weekly and throughout the experimental process. An MTT cell viability assay was performed. Briefly, 21 DIV rat dissociated hippocampal neurons in 96-well plates were dosed with 100 μl of various samples solutions of either BTA-EG6 or BAMs 1–3 with final concentrations of 0 to 250 μm. Cells were exposed to these solutions for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. An MTT cell viability kit (ATCC, Product No: 30–1010K) was then used to determine cell viability. Briefly, 20 μl of the provided MTT reagent was added per well and cells were placed in the incubator for 3 h. The insoluble intracellular purple formazan was then dissolved by the addition of 100 μl of detergent reagent provided and let solubilize overnight at room temperature. The cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a Spectramax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). All results are presented as percent reduction of MTT relative to untreated cells (100% viability), and all wells were blanked with absorbance values from the wells containing medium, MTT reagent and detergent only. Rat dissociated neurons were lysed with RIPA buffer containing both protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with either 5% BSA or milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST), followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Proteins were visualized using the appropriate HRP-labeled secondary by ECL and detection was carried out on film (Freedom Imaging, SRX-101A). The intensity of each band was then quantified using ImageJ software. To analyze the levels of active Ras in the rat primary neuronal lysates treated with BTA-EG6, BAMs 1–3 or control, we used an Active-Ras Pulldown and Detection Kit (Thermo) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. To analyze the levels of filamentous (F-actin) and globular (G-actin) in rat primary neuronal lysates treated with BTA-EG6, BAMs 1–3 or control, we used a G-actin/F-actin in Vivo Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For all neuronal treatments, the following general protocol was followed: Briefly, 18–23 DIV rat dissociated hippocampal neurons were dosed with various concentrations (0–50 μm final concentration) of BAMs 1–3 or BTA-EG6 (with 0.1% final DMSO concentration) for various incubation times (24–72 h depending on the experiment). After dosing and at the desired time point, the medium was removed, and cells were rinsed with PBS-MC (phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2). Following rinsing, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/sucrose in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, coverslips were carefully rinsed (3× PBS-MC) and then mounted onto slides (Polysciences Inc., 18606) for imaging. After following the general procedure for neuronal treatment, fixed cells were then permeabilized, blocked in 5% BSA/PBS-MC, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Synapsin (1:1000) and anti-PSD95 (1:1000). After incubation with Alexafluor conjugated secondary antibodies, the coverslips were mounted for imaging. PalGFP SinRep5 DNA was obtained as a generous gift from Takahiro Furuta (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (35Furuta T. Tomioka R. Taki K. Nakamura K. Tamamaki N. Kaneko T. In vivo transduction of central neurons using recombinant Sindbis virus: Golgi-like labeling of dendrites and axons with membrane-targeted fluorescent proteins.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sindbis virion production was accomplished through RNA transcription using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Electroporation of RNA into baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) was completed using a BTX ECM 600 electroporator (BTX, Holliston, MA) at 220V, 129Ω, and 1050μF. After 24 h, virion was collected and concentrated by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 90 min using a Beckman Coulter Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). The treated neurons were infected with palGFP expressing sindbis 18 h prior to fixation. The palGFP (membrane targeting) signal was imaged directly in fixed neurons. For all imaging of neurons, we used a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope outfitted with a Yokogawa Spinning disk confocal head, an Orca ER High Resolution CCD camera (6.45 μm/pixel at 1×) (Hamamatsu), Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 na objective, and PerkinElmer solid-state laser with 488 nm excitation. Confocal z-stacks were acquired in all experiments, and all imaging was acquired in the dynamic range of 8-bit acquisition (0–255 pixel intensity units, respectively) with Volocity (PerkinElmer) imaging software. Imaged dendrites from one secondary dendrite per cell (after 1 branch) at a distance of 40–80 μm from the soma were straightened using ImageJ. We estimated spine density as the number of manually counted spines divided by dendrite segment length. The analyzer was blind to treatment and statistical significance was determined between experimental conditions by either unpaired t tests (two groups) or by ANOVA and indicated post hoc multiple-comparison test (>2 experimental conditions). For this study, 21 DIV neurons plated in 35 mm dishes (MatTek) were rinsed 3x with an excess of HBSS and then left in HBSS for the duration of imaging. For live imaging we kept cells at 37 °C and used a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope outfitted with a Yokogawa Spinning disk confocal head, an Orca ER High Resolution CCD camera (6.45 μm/pixel at 1×) (Hamamatsu), Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 na objective, and PerkinElmer solid-state laser with 488 nm excitation. The spine changes on the same neuron were monitored 1 h before dosing (−60 min) and up to 3 h after dosing (+180 min). Dosing occurred at t = 0 and consisted of either 0 (for control) or 5 μm BAM1-EG6. For each condition, neurons from three different neuronal preparations (prep) were used and two neurons per prep were monitored. Confocal z-stacks were acquired in all experiments, and all imaging was acquired in the dynamic range of 8-bit acquisition (0–255 pixel intensity units, respectively) with Volocity (PerkinElmer) imaging software. For analysis, imaged dendrites were straightened using ImageJ and the same dendrite length was analyzed for each condition. Spines gained were counted as any new spines found at each respective time point and spines lost were counted as spines that disappeared from the analyzed segment. The analyzer was blind to treatment. Aggregated Aβ-(1–42) was prepared as previously described (36Zhao X. Yang J. Amyloid-β peptide is a substrate of the human 20S proteasome.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2010; 1: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ-(1–42) was initially solubilized in 100% 1,1,1,3,3,3,-hexafluoro-2-propanal (HFIP) to 1 mm concentration at RT for 21 h with shaking. The solution was sonicated and vortexed before it was diluted in cold nanopure water (2:1 H2O:HFIP). Aliquoted fractions were lyophilized for 2 days, followed by storage at −80 °C until use. Solutions of Aβ were obtained by dissolving Aβ in sterile PBS to a concentration of 100 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days before use. Western blot analysis of the 3-day incubated Aβ was carried out to determine composition. We estimated the relative abundance of monomers, oligomers, and protofibrils of Aβ using ImageJ and percentage"

Another three cattle varieties very closely related to Hanwoo reside in Korea (Jeju Black and Brindle) and in China (Yanbian). These breeds have not been part of a breeding scheme to improve production traits. Here, we compare the selected Hanwoo against these similar but presumed to be unselected populations to identify genomic regions that have been under recent selection pressure due to the breeding program. Rsb statistics were used to contrast the genomes of Hanwoo versus a pooled sample of the three unselected population (UN). We identified 37 significant SNPs (FDR corrected) in the HW/UN comparison and 21 known protein coding genes were within 1 MB to the identified SNPs. These genes were previously reported to affect traits important for meat production (14 genes), reproduction including mammary gland development (3 genes), coat color (2 genes), and genes affecting behavioral traits in a broader sense (2 genes). We subsequently sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform) 10 individuals of the brown Hanwoo and the Chinese Yanbian to identify SNPs within the candidate genomic regions. Based on allele frequency differences, haplotype structures, and literature research, we singled out one non-synonymous SNP in the APP gene (APP: c.569C>T, Ala199Val) and predicted the mutational effect on the protein structure. We found that protein-protein interactions might be impaired due to increased exposed hydrophobic surfaces of the mutated protein. The APP gene has also been reported to affect meat tenderness in pigs and obesity in humans. Meat tenderness has been linked to intramuscular fat content, which is one of the main breeding goals for brown Hanwoo, potentially supporting a causal influence of the herein described nsSNP in the APP gene."
https://openalex.org/W2325968474,"The nervous and immune systems communicate bidirectionally, utilizing diverse molecular signals including cytokines and neurotransmitters to provide an integrated response to changes in the body's internal and external environment. Although, neuro-immune interactions are becoming better understood under inflammatory circumstances and it has been evidenced that interaction between neurons and T cells results in the conversion of encephalitogenic T cells to T regulatory cells, relatively little is known about the communication between neurons and naïve T cells. Here, we demonstrate that following co-culture of naïve CD4+ T cells with superior cervical ganglion neurons, the percentage of Foxp3 expressing CD4+CD25+ cells significantly increased. This was mediated in part by immune-regulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-10, as well as the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide while vasoactive intestinal peptide was shown to play no role in generation of T regulatory cells. Additionally, T cells co-cultured with neurons showed a decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ released upon in vitro stimulation. These findings suggest that the generation of Tregs may be promoted by naïve CD4+ T cell: neuron interaction through the release of neuropeptide CGRP."

In mice, deletion of functional Gimap5 gene affects the survival and renewal of hematopoietic stem cells in addition to the defects observed in T cells. Here we show that T cells from OTII TCR-transgenic Gimap5sph/sph mice do not proliferate in response to its cognate antigen. Furthermore, T cells from Gimap5 mutant rats and mice show decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 following stimulation with IL-7. Our results suggest that functional Gimap5 is required for optimal signaling through TCR and IL-7R in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2328073382,"p53 gene mutations are among the most common alterations in cancer. In most cases, missense mutations in one TP53 allele are followed by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), so tumors express only mutant p53. TP53 mutations and LOH have been linked, in many cases, with poor therapy response and worse outcome. Despite this, remarkably little is known about how TP53 point mutations are acquired, how LOH occurs, or the cells involved. Nutlin-3a occupies the p53-binding site in MDM2 and blocks p53-MDM2 interaction, resulting in the stabilization and activation of p53 and subsequent growth arrest or apoptosis. We leveraged the powerful growth inhibitory activity of Nutlin-3a to select p53-mutated cells and examined how TP53 mutations arise and how the remaining wild-type allele is lost or inactivated. Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colorectal cancer cells formed heterozygote (p53 wild-type/mutant) colonies when cultured in low doses of Nutlin-3a, whereas MMR-corrected counterparts did not. Placing these heterozygotes in higher Nutlin-3a doses selected clones in which the remaining wild-type TP53 was silenced. Our data suggest silencing occurred through a novel mechanism that does not involve DNA methylation, histone methylation, or histone deacetylation. These data indicate MMR deficiency in colorectal cancer can give rise to initiating TP53 mutations and that TP53 silencing occurs via a copy-neutral mechanism. Moreover, the data highlight the use of MDM2 antagonists as tools to study mechanisms of TP53 mutation acquisition and wild-type allele loss or silencing in cells with defined genetic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2323766542,"Evasion through immunomodulation is one of the several strategies adopted by pathogens to prolong their survival within the host. One such pathogen, Escherichia coli CFT073, utilizes an immunomodulatory protein, TcpC, to combat the host's innate immune defense. TcpC abrogates the function of MyD88 in macrophages, thus perturbing all the signaling processes that involve this adaptor protein. Although central to various signaling pathways initiated by IL-1, IL-18, and toll-like receptors, the precise contribution of MyD88 to the development of autoimmunity, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, still needs extensive exploration. Herein, by using the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain homologous C-terminal motif of TcpC, i.e. TIR-TcpC, we found MyD88 to be critical for the induction and progression of rheumatoid arthritis through its pivotal role in the development of Th17 cells, the subset of CD4(+) T-cells widely implicated in various autoimmune disorders. The TIR-TcpC mediated inhibition of signaling through MyD88, and subsequent amelioration of experimental autoimmune arthritis was observed to be an outcome of perturbations in the NF kappa B-ROR gamma t (RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t) axis."
https://openalex.org/W2330226503,"Promiscuous expression of tissue restricted antigens (TRAs) in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for negative selection of self-reactive T cells to establish central tolerance. Intercellular transfer of self-peptide-MHC complexes from mTECs to thymic dendritic cells (DCs) allows DCs to acquire TRAs, which in turn contributes to negative selection and regulatory T cell generation. However, mTECs are unlikely to express all TRAs, such as immunoglobulins generated only in B cells after somatic recombination, hyper-mutation, or class-switches. We report here that both mTECs and cortical TECs can efficiently acquire not only cell surface but also intracellular proteins from thymocytes. This reveals a previously unappreciated intercellular sharing of molecules from thymocytes to TECs, which may broaden the TRA inventory in mTECs for establishing a full spectrum of central tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2315353502,"It has been reported that exogenous cues accentuate contrast appearance. The empirical finding is controversial because non-veridical perception challenges the idea that attention prioritizes processing resources to make perception better, and because philosophers have used the finding to challenge representational accounts of mental experience. The present experiments confirm that when evaluated with comparison paradigms exogenous cues increase the apparent contrast. In addition, contrast appearance was also changed by simply changing the purpose of a secondary task. When comparison and discrimination reports were combined in a single experiment there was a behavioral disassociation: contrast enhanced for comparison responses, but did not change for discrimination judgments, even when participants made both types of judgment for a single stimulus. That a single object can have multiple simultaneous appearances leads inescapably to the conclusion that our unitary mental experience is illusory."

We found that glial and neural cells in the mudpuppy spinal cord expressed different types of connexins that include connexin 32 (Cx32), connexin 36 (Cx36), connexin 37 (Cx37), and connexin 43 (Cx43). Application of a battery of gap junction blockers from three different structural classes (carbenexolone, flufenamic acid, and long chain alcohols) substantially and consistently altered the locomotor-like activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, these blockers did not significantly change the amplitude of the dorsal root reflex, indicating that gap junction blockers did not inhibit neuronal excitability nonselectively in the spinal cord. Taken together, these results suggest that gap junctions play a significant modulatory role in the spinal neural networks responsible for the generation of walking-like activity in the adult mudpuppy."

The vibration modes of the cantilever plate are represented by combinations of beam functions. Using classical mechanics (the effect of size is not considered) and the corrected Cosserat's theorem (the effect of size is considered), we employ the Lagrange equations to establish a dynamic model of the plate-like micro-cantilever beam attached with multiple concentrated masses. The accuracy of the model proposed in this paper is verified by comparing with the results of published literature. Then, the natural frequencies of the cantilever plates are calculated with self-compiled algorithms, and the results of the plates with 1-5 masses are displayed. The results are in high accordance with the exact solution, and all errors are within 0.5%. The analysis shows that the proposed model and analysis method converges quickly and is highly efficient. In addition, the effects of characteristic lengths, Poisson's ratios and plate thickness on the micro-cantilever plate's resonant frequency for the first five modes are analyzed."
