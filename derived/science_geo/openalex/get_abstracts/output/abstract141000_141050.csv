https://openalex.org/W2149075105,"Triclosan is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial fatty acid synthesis at the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) step. Resistance to triclosan inEscherichia coli is acquired through a missense mutation in the fabI gene that leads to the expression of FabI[G93V]. The specific activity and substrate affinities of FabI[G93V] are similar to FabI. Two different binding assays establish that triclosan dramatically increases the affinity of FabI for NAD+. In contrast, triclosan does not increase the binding of NAD+to FabI[G93V]. The x-ray crystal structure of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex confirms that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between triclosan and both the protein and the NAD+ cofactor contribute to the formation of a stable ternary complex, with the drug binding at the enoyl substrate site. These data show that the formation of a noncovalent “bi-substrate” complex accounts for the effectiveness of triclosan as a FabI inhibitor and illustrates that mutations in the FabI active site that interfere with the formation of a stable FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex acquire resistance to the drug.

The fatty acid synthase system of Escherichia coli is the paradigm for the type II or dissociated fatty acid synthase systems (for reviews, see Refs. 1Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Cronan Jr., J.E.

Distinct genes encode each of the individual enzymes, and the same basic chemical reaction is often catalyzed by multiple isozymes. There are four basic reactions that constitute a single round of elongation. The first step is the condensation of malonyl-ACP 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; FabI, enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase; triclosan, 2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether; IC50, concentration giving 50% inhibition of activity; 4:1-NAC, crotonyl-N-acetylcysteamine; 8:1-NAC, trans-2-octadecenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine. with either acetyl-CoA to initiate fatty acid synthesis (FabH) or with the growing acyl chain to continue cycles of elongation (FabB or FabF). The β-ketoacyl-ACP is reduced by an NADPH-dependent β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG). Only a single enzyme is responsible for this step (4Zhang Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrases (FabA and FabZ) capable of forming trans-2-enoyl-ACP. The product of the fabA gene is specifically involved in the introduction of a cis double bond into the growing acyl chain at the β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP step and most efficiently catalyzes dehydration of short-chain β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs, whereas the FabZ dehydratase has a broader substrate specificity (5Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The last reaction in each elongation cycle is catalyzed by enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI). Contrary to the initial conclusion that there were two enoyl-ACP reductases, based on assays in crude extracts (6Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), E. coli cells possess only a single NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductases encoded by the fabI gene that utilizes all chain lengths (7Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The importance of fatty acid biosynthesis to cell growth and function makes this pathway an attractive target for the development of antibacterial agents. Two important control points in the cycle are the condensing enzymes and the enoyl-ACP reductase (8Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and both reactions are targeted by compounds that effectively inhibit fatty acid synthesis. Two natural products, cerulenin and thiolactomycin, are potent antibiotics that function by specifically inhibiting the condensing enzyme reactions (for reviews, see Refs. 3Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O.

The diazaborines, a class of heterocyclic antibacterials, inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis by blocking the FabI step (11Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance to the diazaborines arises from a missense mutation in the fabIgene that leads to the expression of a FabI[G93S] mutant protein (12Turnowsky F. Fuchs K. Jeschek C. Högenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6555-6565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Bergler H. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, the fabI analog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the inhA gene, encodes a cellular target for isoniazid and ethionamide. A point mutation in the inhAgene confers resistance to the drugs (14Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Both isoniazid and diazaborine bind at the substrate site of the respective enoyl-ACP reductases and covalently react with NAD+ to form tight binding bi-substrate complexes (15Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedeinikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Rozwarski D. Grant G. Barton D. Jacobs W. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Triclosan is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that enjoys widespread applications in a multitude of contemporary consumer products including, soaps, detergents, toothpastes, skin care products, cutting boards, and mattress pads (17Bhargava H.N. Leonard P.A. Am. J. Infect. Control. 1996; 24: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Triclosan is widely thought to be a nonspecific biocide that attacks bacterial membranes (18Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica (Basel). 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Vischer W.A. Regös J. Zentbl. Bakt. Hyg. I. Abt. Orig. A. 1974; 226: 376-389PubMed Google Scholar, 20Regös J. Hitz H.R. Zentbl. Bakt. Hyg. I. Abt. Orig. A. 1974; 226: 390-401PubMed Google Scholar), and if triclosan does not have a discrete mechanism of action, the acquisition of cellular resistance is unlikely. However, recent work reveals that resistant E. coli strains arise from missense mutations in the fabIgene (21McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and that triclosan and other 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers directly inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and FabI catalysis in vitro (22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which triclosan inhibits FabI. Sources of supplies were: American Radiochemicals, Inc., [adenine-2,8-3H]NAD (specific activity 25 Ci/mmol); Sigma, NADH and NAD+; and Millipore Corp., Ultrafree Probind centrifugal filtration units. The substrate analogs, 4:1-NAC and 8:1-NAC, were the generous gift of Rocco Gogliotti and John Domagala (Parke-Davis). Triclosan was the gift of KIC Chemicals, Inc. (Armonk, NY). All other chemicals were of the best grade available. The expression and purification of His-tag FabI was described previously (7Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). ThefabI G93V allele was amplified from the chromosome of the triclosan-resistant strain RJH108 (22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and ligated into the pET15b expression vector. DNA sequencing of the expression construct confirmed the presence of the single point mutation. The His-tagged FabI[G93V] was then expressed and purified to homogeneity by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using the same methods as described for the wild-type FabI (7Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). FabI activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorption at 340 nm using an adaptation of the spectrophotometric assay used by Bergleret al. (24Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Standard reactions contained 100 μm 8:1-NAC, 12 μg of homogeneous FabI (7Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), 200 μm NADH, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 300 μl. The reactions were performed at 24 °C in semimicro quartz cuvettes. The change in optical density was continuously monitored for 1 min, and the reaction rate was calculated from the slope of the trace. Triclosan was added to the final concentrations indicated in the figure legend from serially diluted stock solutions in Me2SO. The Me2SO concentration in all assays was maintained at 1.66%, which did not significantly affect FabI activity. The FabI specific activity in the absence of drugs under these experimental conditions was 0.36 μmol/min/mg. Data points were the mean of duplicate assays, and the individual values were within ± 5% of the average. Two methods were used to measure the binding of NAD+ to FabI in the presence and absence of triclosan. The first method employed gel filtration chromatography to separate [3H]NAD+ bound to FabI from free [3H]NAD+. A 0.7 × 8-cm column (3 ml) of Sephadex G-25 was equilibrated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 24 °C. Samples (50 μl) were applied, the column eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of approximately 0.25 ml/min, and 5-drop (110 μl) fractions were collected. The second method used binding of FabI to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to separate free from FabI-bound [3H]NAD+. Assays were placed into a Ultrafree-Probind centrifugal filtration unit containing a 0.2-cm (2Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Corp.). The filters were washed once with 100 μl of 0.1 msodium phosphate and counted in 5 ml of ScintSafe scintillation solution. Both assays contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1 μm [3H]NAD+ (specific activity 4 Ci/mmol), 2% Me2SO, the indicated concentrations of triclosan, and 7.6 μg of FabI or FabI[G93V] in a final volume of 50 μl. Samples were incubated at 24 °C for 15 min and then separated using one of the two methods outlined above. Crystals of FabI were grown from hanging drops (6 μl) containing 5 mg/ml FabI, 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml NADH, 50 mm sodium acetate, 4% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v), pH 4.6. The drops were equilibrated against a reservoir (600 μl) containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 8% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v). Large hexagonal bipyrimidal crystals appeared after equilibration for 1 day at 26 °C and reached dimensions of 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. Crystals of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex were prepared by soaking pregrown crystals of FabI in solutions containing 10 mg/ml NAD+, 10 mg/ml triclosan, 100 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v) for 7 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the IMCA beamline (17-ID) at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. The crystals used for data collection were first transferred to a cryoprotectant buffer containing 100 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.6, 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v), 25% glycerol (v/v) for 1 h and then flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen. X-ray data to 1.8-Å resolution were collected at 100 K using synchrotron X-radiation at a 1.0-Å wavelength and a Bruker 2 × 2 mosaic CCD x-ray detector. The x-ray data were then processed using the SAINT (Bruker x-ray, Madison, WI) program package. Crystals of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex were hexagonal, space group P6122 (number 178) with unit cell dimensionsa = b = 79.70 and c = 327.7 Å and two molecules of the ternary complex in the asymmetric unit. These crystals were isomorphous to those of the FabI-NAD+-diazaborine complex reported by Baldock et al. (15Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedeinikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The FabI structure was initially refined as a rigid body using XPLOR, and the positions and conformation of the bound NAD+ and triclosan molecules were determined from Fo-Fc difference electron density maps. In addition, the positions of the 185 tightly bound water molecules were determined from subsequent residual electron density maps. The entire structure containing 2 molecules of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex and 185 water molecules was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.232 using data from 8.0 to 1.8 Å resolution. Residues 194–210 were disordered in the structure. Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using a 1.4-Å probe with the SOLVATION module of the InsightII software (version 97.1, Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Previous work showed that FabI was inhibited by triclosan (22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and that a mutation in the fabI gene that results in the expression of a FabI[G93V] protein exhibited high level triclosan resistance (21McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). FabI[G93V] was cloned into the pET15b expression vector and expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The apparent K mvalues for the two substrates were determined for both the wild-type and mutant protein. The wild-type protein had an apparentK m for NADH of 15 ± 1 μm, whereas the FabI[G93V] exhibited an apparent K mfor NADH of 8 ± 2 μm. Thus, there were not major differences between the kinetic constants for NADH in the wild-type and mutant protein. We also measured the apparent K m for the enoyl substrate using 4:1-NAC. This substrate analog was selected for these experiments because it had the higher solubility in the assay buffer than 8:1-NAC. The apparent K m for 4:1-NAC was 25 ± 5 mm for FabI compared with 15 ± 2.2 mm for FabI[G93V]. The V max for FabI was 4.4 μmol/min/mg, and for FabI[G93V], theV max was 3.6 μmol/min/mg. These data illustrated that FabI and FabI[G93V] had similar specific activities and substrate and cofactor binding characteristics. The observation that cells expressing the FabI[G93V] protein have a minimum inhibitory concentration for triclosan that was 64-fold higher than the wild-type strain (0.5 compared with 32 μg/ml) (22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) suggested that the FabI[G93V] protein would be refractory to triclosan inhibitionin vitro. We directly tested this assumption using the spectrophotometric FabI assay and found that both FabI and FabI[G93V] were inhibited by triclosan (Fig. 1). The IC50 for FabI (2 μm) was lower than the IC50 for FabI[G93V] (10 μm). This ≈5-fold increase in the IC50 for FabI[G93V] was consistent with increased resistance of the enzyme to triclosan inhibition; however, the magnitude of this difference was significantly less than was predicted from the 64-fold difference in the effectiveness of triclosan against the mutant strain. This unexpected discrepancy between the minimum inhibitory concentration and IC50 data led us to examine the mechanism of FabI inhibition by triclosan in more detail. The data in Fig. 1 was obtained by starting the assay with the addition of FabI and measuring the initial rate of NADH oxidation from the linear portion of the trace within the first 1 min of the reaction. Examination of the time course of the reaction over a longer period of time (15 min) revealed a clear difference between the inhibition of FabI and FabI[G93V] by triclosan (Fig. 2). Although there was an initial burst of activity in the presence of triclosan, within 3 min of the start of the experiment, FabI catalysis essentially ceased (Fig.2 A). Thus, the inhibition of FabI by triclosan became irreversible as a function of time. In contrast, triclosan inhibition of FabI[G93V] was consistent throughout the 15-min time course, yielding a slower rate and no indication of increasing inhibition as a function of time (Fig. 2 B). These data suggested that the difference between the effectiveness of triclosan against wild-type strains compared with strain RJH108 (fabI G93V) was the ability of triclosan to irreversibly inhibit FabI, but not FabI[G93V], as a function of time. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggested that the irreversible inhibition of FabI by triclosan arose from the tight binding of the drug to the enzyme in conjunction with another component in the assay. This prediction was experimentally tested by measuring the association of [3H]NAD+ with either FabI or FabI[G93V] in the presence of triclosan by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.3). FabI bound approximately 80% of the [3H]NAD+ (0.2 mol/mol of FabI subunit) when triclosan was present, as evidenced from the shift in radioactivity from the included volume (fractions 18–40) to the excluded volume (fractions 11–17) of the column. In contrast, FabI[G93V] did not displace [3H]NAD+ from the included to the void volume of the column. The column was not equilibrated with triclosan; thus the appearance of label associated with FabI in the excluded volume indicated a stable association with the enzyme during the course of the separation (about 30 min). The binding of [3H]NAD+ to the two enzymes in the absence of triclosan was barely detectable and equivalent to the binding of [3H]NAD+ to FabI[G93V] in the presence of triclosan shown in Fig. 3 (not shown, see below). These data demonstrated that triclosan induced the high affinity binding of NAD+ to FabI but not to FabI[G93V]. This concept was experimentally verified using a filter binding assay developed to quantitate the binding of [3H]NAD+ to FabI in the presence and absence of triclosan. FabI exhibited saturable NAD+ binding in the presence of 4 μm triclosan (Fig.4 A). An apparent association constant (K) of 2.5 μm–1 for NAD+ in the presence of triclosan was calculated by analysis of the data using a double-reciprocal plot (Fig.4 B). There was no indication of cooperative binding or the existence of more than a single class of sites by analysis of the data using a Scatchard plot (not shown). In contrast, we detected virtually no binding of [3H]NAD+ to FabI in the absence of triclosan (Fig. 4 A). The affinity of FabI for NAD+ was so low that we measured only trace levels of [3H]NAD+ binding to the free enzyme by this technique. Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of NAD+as a product inhibitor of FabI using the spectrophototmetric assay. NAD+ was a poor inhibitor of the FabI reaction, with 50% inhibition occurring between 10 and 20 mm NAD+. These data indicated a very low apparent affinity of FabI for NAD+ in the 10–50 mm range (not shown). The filter binding assay was next used to examine the effect of triclosan concentration on NAD+ binding to FabI (Fig.5). The association of [3H]NAD+ with FabI was dependent on the concentration of triclosan and saturable (Fig. 5 A). The apparent K for triclosan binding was calculated as 4.2 μm–1 (Fig. 5 B). Thus, in the presence of triclosan, the affinity of FabI for NAD+increased by approximately 4 orders of magnitude (>10 mmto 2.5 μm–1).Figure 5Triclosan-dependent [3H]NAD+;1 binding to FabI. Panel A, dependence of [3H]NAD+binding to FabI on the concentration of triclosan. Panel B,double-reciprocal plot of the data in panel A. The apparent triclosan association constant (K) was 4.2 μm. The filter binding assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The binding studies suggested that the basis for the potency of triclosan as a FabI inhibitor was because of the formation of a high affinity FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex. Determining the structure of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex by x-ray crystallography directly tested this idea (see “Experimental Procedures”). Triclosan bound noncovalently in a location adjacent to the nicotinamide portion of NAD+ (Fig.6 A). There was 494.7 Å2 of surface area buried between triclosan and the protein and 238.5 Å2 of surface area buried at the interface with NAD+. The diphenyl ether of triclosan adopted a conformation with a dihedral angle of about 90° between the two phenyl rings of the inhibitor. The 2-hydoxy-3-chlorophenyl ring formed a parallel stack with the nicotinamide ring of the co-factor with an interplanar stacking distance of 3.4 Å. In addition to the nicotinamide ring, the hydroxychlorophenyl ring was surrounded by hydrophobic side chains on the protein including Tyr-146 and Tyr-156. The 2′-hydroxyl group of triclosan was involved in two strong hydrogen bonds. One bond was with the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose, and the second was to the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-156. The 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring of triclosan was rotated 90° of the plane of the hydroxychlorophenyl group. The chlorine substituent in the 4-position of the phenyl ring accepted a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of Ala-95 and formed hydrophobic contacts with the side chain of Met-159. These data supported the concept that the formation of a stable, ternary FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex accounted for the effective inhibition of the FabI reaction by this drug. The formation of a ternary FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex accounts for the effectiveness of triclosan as an antibacterial agent. Triclosan binds to the enoyl substrate site on FabI, and tight binding of the drug requires interactions between both the protein and the NAD+ cofactor (Fig. 6 A). There is a strong similarity between the mode of triclosan NAD+ binding to FabI (Fig. 6 A) and the structure of the FabI-NAD+-diazaborine complex described by Baldock et al. (15Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedeinikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B). The diazaborine compounds form covalent adducts with NAD+ at the FabI active site. The boron atom of the diazaborine is attached to the 2′-hydroxyl of the NAD+ ribose, and this is the same 2′-hydroxyl group that forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxychlorophenyl hydroxyl of triclosan. The FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complexes can be superimposed with the diazaborine complex with a root mean square deviation of 0.3 Å for the observed α-carbons. Residues 194–210 were not well defined in the electron density map of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex. These residues are also not observed in the native structure of FabI, but the positions of these residues are evident in the FabI-NAD+-diazaborine structure (15Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedeinikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). If the loop seen in the FabI-NAD+-diazaborine complex is modeled onto the triclosan complex structure, there are no conflicting contacts between triclosan and the protein. In this model Ile-200 is in van der Waals contact with the 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring of triclosan, and Phe-203 is in contact with the hydroxychlorophenyl group. These data support the conclusion that triclosan forms a ternary complex that acts as a dead-end inhibitor that effectively removes protein from the catalytic cycle. These results lead to the general conclusion that all 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether FabI inhibitors (22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) block enzyme activity through the formation of noncovalent bisubstrate complexes with NAD+. Missense mutations, like FabI[G93V], confer resistance by preventing the formation of the FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex. Strains expressing either FabI[G93S] and FabI[G93V] have significantly elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations for triclosan (21McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Although FabI[G93V] activity is still inhibited at high triclosan concentrations (Fig. 2 B), the drug is not capable of forming a stable complex with the reductase. Triclosan is neither a dead-end inhibitor of FabI[G93V] (Fig. 2) nor does it form a FabI[G93V]-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex based on the inability of FabI[G93V] to bind [3H]NAD+(Fig. 3). These biochemical results are interpreted by modeling the Val-93 into the Gly-93 position in the structure of the triclosan complex. Gly-93 lies on one side of the substrate binding pocket, and the branched hydrophobic side chain of Val protrudes into the pocket and occupies the same space as the dichlorophenyl ring of triclosan (see Fig. 6). Therefore, we conclude that the substitution of Gly-93 with bulkier amino acid residues imparts resistance to 2-hydroxydiphenyl ethers because of steric interference. Our identification of a ternary FabI-NAD+-triclosan complex reinforces the conclusion that FabI is a specific intracellular target for triclosan. Triclosan permeabilizes the bacterial envelope (18Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica (Basel). 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Vischer W.A.

A. 1974; 226: 390-401PubMed Google Scholar), and these findings have justified the widespread and increasing use of triclosan in consumer personal care products based on the reasoning that bacteria would not acquire resistance to a nonspecific membrane disrupter. However, this type of evidence is not sufficient to conclude that a compound has nonspecific membrane effects, because agents that block fatty acid biosynthesis perturb membrane assembly by stopping phospholipid production. For example, the temperature-sensitivefabI mutant was initially designated envM because it was isolated through a genetic selection for strains with envelope-permeability defects (25Egan A.F. Russell R.R.B. Genet. Res. 1973; 21: 3603-3611Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, the diazaborine class of FabI inhibitors are known to perturb membrane function as well (12Turnowsky F. Fuchs K. Jeschek C. Högenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6555-6565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first evidence that triclosan has a specific cellular target was provided by McMurray et al. (21McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) who found that triclosan-resistant strains have missense mutations in thefabI gene. The biochemical analysis of FabI inhibition by triclosan (22Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and the delineation of its mechanism of binding (this study) provide definitive evidence that enoyl-ACP reductase is the primary site for triclosan action. Thus, the reported effects of triclosan on membrane structure and function are a consequence of its specific inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis at the FabI step. The ability of E. coli to acquire genetic resistance to triclosan and related compounds through missense mutations in thefabI gene suggests that the widespread use of this drug will lead to the appearance of resistant organisms that will compromise the usefulness of triclosan. The ubiquitous occurrence of type II fatty acid synthase systems in bacteria and the essential nature of the FabI reaction make this enzyme an attractive target for antibacterial drugs. Accordingly, triclosan is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria (17Bhargava H.N. Leonard P.A. Am. J. Infect. Control. 1996; 24: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), including multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26Bartzokas C.A. Paton J.H. Gibson M.F. Graham F.

The design and development of second generation FabI inhibitors based on their ability to form ternary FabI-NAD+-drug complexes will supplement the arsenal against a broad spectrum of bacteria.

The genes for many PI 3-kinases have been isolated from a wide range of tissues and organisms. They are divided into three major classes based on their amino acid sequence, the homology among their lipid-kinase domains, and substrate specificities (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G.

Class I PI 3-kinases phosphorylate the 3′ sites of PtdIns, PtdIns 4-phosphate, and PtdIns 4,5-diphosphate to form PtdIns 3-phosphate, PtdIns 3,4-diphosphate, and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Class I PI 3-kinases can be further divided into two subclasses. The class IA PI 3-kinases, which include at least three isozymes, α, β, and δ, are heterodimers of a catalytic 110-kDa subunit (p110) and a regulatory subunit of 85 or 55 kDa (p85/p55) (10Domin J.

The interaction of p85/p55 and p110 via the inter-Src homology 2 domain on p85/p55 and the amino-terminal 123 amino acids of p110 is critical for achieving maximal activity of this class of PI 3-kinases in mammalian cells at 37 °C (11Klippel A.

Despite a wealth of knowledge of the biochemistry and cell biological effects of phosphoinositides, very little information is available on the particular physiological roles played by these different enzymes and isozymes during mammalian development. Inhibitors of PI 3-kinases such as wortmannin (17Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and LY294002 (18Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.T. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are very useful for probing the functions of these enzymes but as with all inhibitor studies suffer from questions of specificity as to which enzymes and isozymes are being inhibited at the dosages used in a particular study. In contrast, specific mutations in genes encoding these enzymes would provide greater specificity. We have therefore begun a systematic program of generating mice carrying deletion alleles of the PI 3-kinases. Here we report the successful targeting of the α isoform of p110 to create a deletion allele that, in the homozygous state, leads to embryonic lethality at E9.5 due to a severe defect in the proliferative capacity of the embryo. 7.5 × 105 plaques from a 129SV mouse genomic library in the λFIX II vector (Stratagene) were screened (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.19Google Scholar) with probes derived from Pik3ca cDNA. Of three positive phage clones, one (F1) was selected for further study and subcloning, and an 8-kbSalI fragment was isolated and found to contain the first three coding exons of Pik3ca (see Fig. 1). A tetranucleotide repeat (CCTT) within an intron of Pik3ca was used for chromosome mapping using the Jackson Lab C57BL/6J and Mus spretusbackcross DNA panel map service. Two PCR primers flanking the tetranucleotide repeat (forward, GTA GGG ATG AAG GTG GAG AGG; backward, AGC TGA CTC AAT GGA AGT AGG G) were used for the amplification. PCR reaction was performed on 50 ng of DNA in a 20-μl volume containing 400 nm each primer, 200 nm of dNTP, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase. Reactions were denatured at 94 °C for 5 min and then subjected to 30 step cycles consisting of 94 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR products were loaded on 3.5% MetaPhore agarose gel and separated at 70 V for 3 h. The targeting construct was made in the pPNT vector (20Tybulewicz V.L. Tremblay M.L. LaMarca M.E. Willemsen R.

Electroporation into TC1 ES cells (21Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) and selection for homologous recombination were by published procedures. Recombinant ES cell lines were screened by PstI genomic Southern blot using probe B, located outside the targeted region of homologous recombination, and positive cell lines were confirmed by SacI genomic Southern blot using probe E (see Fig. 1). All studies described in this report were performed on mice carrying the mutant alleles on a 129/SV inbred background. Animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the National Human Genome Research Institute's Animal Care and Use Committee under National Institutes of Health guidelines, “Using Animals in Intramural Research.” DNA was extracted from yolk sac (22Oakey R.J. Matteson P.G. Litwin S. Tilghman S.M. Nussbaum R.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 667-674PubMed Google Scholar) and tails (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.19Google Scholar) by published methods. Two PCR reactions were performed for genotyping. One pair of primers derived from the exon deleted in the deletion allele (P110N, forward, CTC CCC AAT GGA ATG ATA GTG, and P110N, reverse, TCT TTT CTT CAC GGT TGC CT) amplifies a 260-bp fragment only from the wild type. The second pair of primers derived from the neomycin resistance gene (Neo1, 5′-AGA GGC TAT TCG GCT ATG ACT G, and Neo2, 3′-TTC GTC CAG ATC ATC CTG ATC) amplifies a 430-bp fragment only from the disrupted Pik3ca gene. PCR amplification was performed per the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA extracted from 9.5-day-old embryos (22Oakey R.J. Matteson P.G. Litwin S. Tilghman S.M. Nussbaum R.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 667-674PubMed Google Scholar) was used for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR per the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Inc.). Four pairs of primers were used for PCR amplification: P110N, forward, CTC CCC AAT GGA ATG ATA GTG, and reverse, TCT TTT CTT CAC GGT TGC CT, 260 bp; Neo1, 5′-AGA GGC TAT TCG GCT ATG ACT G, and Neo2, 3′-TTC GTC CAG ATC ATC CTG ATC, 431 bp; p110α, RT-1, sense primer, CTG TAT AAT GCT GGG GAG GAT GC, and RT-2, antisense primer, ATG CGG TAC AGG CCA GAG ATT C, 505 bp, amplify 825–1329 of p110α cDNA; p110α, RT-3, sense primer, TCT GTC CCC TCT GAA TCC TGC TC, and RT-4, antisense primer, TAT ATC TCG CCC TTG TTC TTG TCC, 416 bp, amplify 2253–2669 of p110α cDNA. To control for spurious amplification due to DNA contamination, primers were designed to cross intron-exon boundaries, and reactions without RT were included in every assay. Cells obtained fromPik3ca +/+, Pik3ca +/del, and Pik3ca del/del E9.5 embryos were collected by trypsinization on the third day of culturing. Cultured cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were frozen on dry ice immediately. Cell pellets were lysed in 25 μl of deionized H2O on ice, the lysates were separated on 6% SDS/polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane according to the manufacturer's protocols (Millipore). Filters were used for Western blotting (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar) with either rabbit anti-human p85α serum (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or rabbit anti-human p110α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7174) in 0.1% Tween-20/1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at RT, and the signal was detected using peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody and chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocols (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak) for 25 min at room temperature. Pregnant mice from aPik3ca +/del ×Pik3ca +/del cross were injected intraperitoneally at day E9.5 with BrdUrd (Sigma, 100 μg/g body weight). E9.5 embryos were separated from their yolk sacs, which were used for determining Pik3ca +/+ andPik3ca del/del genotypes. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and then embedded in paraffin. Sagittal sections were mounted onto silanized slides without staining, dewaxed, hydrated in decreasing ethanol solutions, treated with 3% H2O2, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were exposed to anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton Dickinson) and developed in goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) using peroxidase-conjugated Elite ABC (Vector Lab) and Sigma Fast DAB as described (24Lacy E.R. Kuwayama H. Cowan K.S. King J.S. Deutz A.H. Sistrunk S. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 259-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pik3ca +/+ andPik3ca del/del E9.5 embryos were separated from their yolk sacs, which were used for genotyping. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight then transferred into 70% EtOH. Sagittal and parasagittal sections from the midline of embryos were stained by standard hematoxylin and eosin staining and the number of apoptotic cells assayed by TUNEL assay (25Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). A novel tetranucleotide repeat (CCTT)n within the fourth intron of Pik3ca was identified when this fragment was sequenced to determine the exon/intron boundaries. The repeat was found to be polymorphic between strains of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. A backcross between these two strains provided by the Jackson Laboratories Backcross DNA Panel Map Service was used to map the locus.Pik3ca maps cleanly to chromosome 3 at 12.9 centimorgans between Il7 and D3Mit21, with no crossovers with markers D3Bir4 and #Sno. This location is syntenic with the region between D3S3682 and D3S1564 on the long arm of human chromosome 3 where human PIK3CA maps (SHGC-12912). A clone (F1) isolated from a 129SV mouse genomic library (Stratagene) contained the first four coding exons of Pik3ca (Fig.1). The first coding exon contains 76 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and the first 352 bp of coding sequence including the translation initiation codon (numbering according to GenBankTM accession number U03279). The targeting construct (Fig. 1) contains 4.8 kb of sequence 3′ and 3 kb 5′ to the first coding exon. Homologous recombination of the targeting construct shown in Fig. 1 results in deletion of this exon. The transcript of the deleted allele lacks the translation initiation codon as well as the domain that mediates the binding to the inter-Src homology 2 domain of a regulatory subunit that is required for catalytic activity of p110 in mammalian cells (11Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The next downstream, in-frame ATG occurs at base 15 of the second coding exon (ATTGGCATGCCAGT); this ATG would allow the rest of the transcript to be translated in frame, although it sits within an incomplete Kozak consensus context (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 115: 887-903Crossref Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) that lacks a G in position +4. Eight out of seventy-two (∼11%) ES colonies showed the expected recombinant pattern by genomic Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1). The recombinant ES cells were injected into blastocysts (C57BL6) to generate chimeric males. The chimeras transmitted the disruptedPik3ca gene to the next (F1) generation. Genotyping of 98 liveborn F2 mice from breeding of F1Pik3ca +/del heterozygotes showed 32 werePik3ca +/+ and 66 werePik3ca +/del with noPik3ca del/del mice identified (TableI). The absence ofPik3ca del/del offspring was highly significant (p = 5 × 10−13, exact binomial test); the ratio of Pik3ca +/+ toPik3ca +/del mice (32:66) fit the expected 1:2, consistent with a purely recessive lethality in the homozygote.Pik3ca +/del were fertile and showed no abnormalities in growth or development.Table IGenotypes of offspring from Pikca+/del × Pikca+/delcrossesAgeNumber of viable embryos or newborn miceGenotypeProbability+/++/deldel/delE8.517485NS (χ2test)1NS, not significant.E9.560173112NS (χ2test)E10.5168801Three del/del embryos were found at 10.5 days but were clearly nonviable and undergoing tissue autolysis.p= 0.01 (binomial test)Liveborn9832660p< 10−12 (binomial test)a Three del/del embryos were found at 10.5 days but were clearly nonviable and undergoing tissue autolysis.b NS, not significant. Open table in a new tab To identify the stage of embryogenesis at which lethality is occurring in Pik3ca del/del embryos, embryos at different stages of embryonic development were examined and genotyped (Table I). At 10.5 days of embryonic development, no viablePik3ca del/del homozygote embryos were observed among 19 genotyped. Genotyping of 60 E9.5 embryos showed 17Pik3ca +/+, 31Pik3ca +/del, and 12Pik3ca del/del as well as 9 apparent resorptions that could not be genotyped. Although there appeared to be a deficiency of Pik3ca del/del embryos, a deficiency that could be accounted for by the nine resorptions, the 17:31:12 ratio was not significantly different from the expected ratios of 15:30:15 (chi-square with Yates' correction). At E8.5, 17 embryos showed normal Mendelian ratios (Table I). From these data, we conclude that homozygote embryos survive to E8.5, begin to die at E9.5, and do not survive to E10.5. Most Pik3ca del/del homozygote embryos at E9.5 appeared to be viable, with obvious cardiac function, and histological analysis of E9.5 embryo sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed no defect in organogenesis. They were, however, smaller than normal embryos, with fewer somites (average 22) compared with the normal embryos (average 25) from the same litter. The head region of E9.5 Pik3ca del/del homozygote embryos was smaller as compared with normal, and hemorrhage was observed at forehead, snout, and other parts of the body of thePik3ca del/del embryos (Fig.2). Heterozygous embryos were normal in appearance. Northern blot analysis of RNA from wild type embryos and adult mouse tissues revealed three transcripts (7.5, 5.4, and 4.4 kb) detected by a cDNA probe containing the coding region of Pik3ca cDNA (data not shown). The different transcripts result from alternative splicing in untranslated portions of the gene and are not the result of alternative splicing of coding exons (data not shown). All three transcripts appeared to be expressed at similar levels from E7 to E17 of embryonic development and in different tissues of adult mice, although there was variability in the expression levels of the different sized transcripts among various tissues. Whole mount in situ hybridization at E9.5 showed that the Pik3ca transcript was expressed uniformly throughout the whole embryo (data not shown). RT-PCR analysis of RNA obtained from Pik3ca +/+and Pik3ca del/del embryos revealed that the deletion allele was transcribed. As shown in Fig.3, Pik3ca transcripts were present in both Pik3ca +/+ andPik3ca del/del embryos, when assayed by RT-PCR of two segments downstream of the deletion (primer pair RT-1 and RT-2 and primer pair RT-3 and RT-4), whereas the portion of the transcript deleted by the targeted event was missing fromPik3ca del/del RNA (primer pair p110-F and p110-R). As control, the neomycin resistance gene transcript was amplified from Pik3ca del/del embryos. The PI 3-kinases have been implicated both in signaling through growth factors (8Hawkins P.T. Welch H.

The delayed embryonic development and lethality ofPik3ca del/del embryos and the inability of cells derived from these embryos to expand in culture could be due either to failure to proliferate or to excessive apoptosis or both. We tested E9.5 Pik3ca del/del embryos for their ability to proliferate using BrdUrd incorporation in vivo (24Lacy E.R. Kuwayama H. Cowan K.S. King J.S. Deutz A.H. Sistrunk S. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 259-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as examining them for excess apoptosis by TUNEL assay (25Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). In wild type mice, the cells in three rapidly dividing regions of an E9.5 embryo revealed heavy BrdUrd labeling, whereas the same regions ofPik3ca del/del littermate embryos incorporated very little BrdUrd (Fig. 4). In contrast to the severe proliferative defect, no abnormality in apoptosis was seen (Fig. 5). The number of cells undergoing apoptosis was counted and averaged in six sagittal and parasagittal sections; wild type embryos contained an average of 58.8 apoptotic cells per section, whereasPik3ca del/del contained an average of 48.0 apoptotic cells per section (p > 0.05, Student'st test). The apoptotic cells were mostly located in forebrain and hindbrain with a similar distribution in both genotypes (Fig. 5).Figure 5TUNEL assay of wild type andPik3ca del/del embryos at E9.5. A–C are from wild type, with B and Cshowing higher magnification; D–F are from thePik3ca del/del embryo, with E andF showing higher magnification of similar locations as shown in B and C. No significant difference in BrdUrd incorporation into nuclei by terminal transferase was seen inPik3ca del/del embryos as compared with wild type embryos, indicating that there is no significant difference in apoptosis between wild type and Pik3ca del/delembryos.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells from wild type, heterozygote, and homozygote embryos were obtained by explanting E9.5 embryos. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts grew normally from explants of wild type and Pik3ca +/del heterozygous embryos. In contrast, when explants were obtained from E9.5Pik3ca del/del embryos, cells would adhere to tissue culture plates but could not be induced to expand in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and a variety of growth factors (bombesin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and lysophosphatidic acid), used either singly or in combination. These growth factors were chosen because they were reported to bypass a block in mitogenic signaling in cultured cells caused by antibodies to Pik3ca (28Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The deletion mutation in Pik3ca eliminates the p85/p55 binding site, but the transcript containing the deletion could theoretically still be translated into a protein lacking the first 122 residues of the full-length p110α. Antibody directed against residues 189–390 of p110α was used for Western blot analysis of fibroblasts from wild type and Pik3ca del/del embryos. Although this region of p110α was not deleted in the knock-out construct, no p110α protein was seen (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, by comparing two different amounts of protein (18 and 36 μg) from wild type and heterozygous embryos, the amount of p110α was clearly reduced in the heterozygotes, consistent with loss of expression of p110α resulting from the targeting event. Another difference betweenPik3ca +/+ andPik3ca del/del embryos was also apparent when rabbit anti-human p85 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used for Western blotting of cells derived fromPik3ca +/+ andPik3ca del/del embryonic tissue. An 85-kDa fragment recognized by rabbit anti-human p85 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) polyclonal antibody in the wild type appeared to be substantially increased in Western blot of Pik3ca del/delembryo tissues (Fig. 6 B). Other proteins detected by the antibody were either unchanged or decreased in intensity in lysate fromPik3ca del/del embryos. PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate has been implicated in the response to growth factor signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors for platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, colony-stimulating factor 1, nerve growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and stem cell growth factor (8Hawkins P.T. Welch H. McGregor A. Eguinoa A. Gobert S. Krugmann S. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Stephens L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the 3 position of the inositol ring, including PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate, are generated by the type IA PI 3-kinases, which also interact with Ras proteins in a GTP-dependent manner (31Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Akt Ser/Thr protein kinases, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase and protein kinase C are considered to be downstream targets of PI 3-kinases by receptor-stimulated signaling (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 233-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Other PI 3-kinases have also been found to participate in protein trafficking (7DeCamilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal organization (32Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), and regulation of apoptosis (29Franke T.F. Kaplan D.F. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 30Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that there are so many PI 3-kinases involved in so many cellular processes, it is important to ask to what extent each of the isozymes of PI 3-kinase is either necessary or sufficient for carrying out these many functions of PI 3-kinases. In particular, is the α isozyme of PI 3-kinase essential for normal embryonic development or is it redundant because a deficiency could be compensated for by other activities, such as the β isozyme? We created mice homozygous for a deletion within Pik3ca by gene targeting and demonstrated loss of expression of p110α by Western analysis using an antibody directed against a region of the protein not involved in the deletion event.Pik3ca del/del homozygotes have delayed development and undergo intrauterine death between E9.5 and E10.5 of embryonic development. The developmental delay and growth failure were due to an inability of Pik3ca del/del embryos to proliferate in response to mitogenic stimulation. Consistent with this severe proliferation defect was our finding that all attempts to grow cells obtained from explants of E9.5Pik3ca del/del embryos from 129/SV inbred matings failed. Cells from Pik3ca del/del embryos failed to expand in culture and appeared resistant to the mitogenic effects of fetal calf serum as well as defined growth factors such as bombesin, lysophosphatidic acid, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results were consistent with the findings of Nave et al.(33Nave B.T. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), who reported PI 3-kinase is involved in signaling through phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but contrasts with the findings of Rocheet al. (28Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), who reported that neither bombesin nor lysophosphatidic acid uses signaling pathways involving PI 3-kinase to stimulate growth. Because of the observation that PI 3-kinases activate the AKT protein kinase and inhibit apoptosis in the nervous system (29Franke T.F. Kaplan D.F. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 30Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were particularly interested in determining whether there was increased apoptosis in the Pik3ca −/− embryos, particularly in the developing brain. In fact, embryos did not demonstrate increased numbers of apoptotic cells, either in the region of the developing brain or elsewhere. We conclude from these experiments that the PI 3-kinase encoded by Pik3ca is absolutely required for normal embryonic growth and development; the phenotype seen in Pik3ca del/del mice results from an inability to proliferate in response to growth factor signaling rather than from unregulated apoptosis. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that abnormalities in other phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the 3 position of inositol by the class IA PI 3-kinase we disrupted in these mice may play a role in the embryonic lethality through other unknown mechanisms. Given the wide variety of cellular processes in which PI 3-kinases are involved, a puzzling aspect of the phenotype ofPik3ca del/del homozygotes is that the embryos manage to survive to E9.5 of embryonic development. There may be an alternative supply of PI 3-kinase that is either lost or becomes inadequate by E9.5 in face of a sharp increase in demand for PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate that occurs normally at this stage of development. For example, a maternal contribution of p110α in the oocyte may only be sufficient to support limited early development. Alternatively, embryonic forms of PI 3-kinase with limited temporal expression might compensate early in development but not after E9.5. Finally, other PI 3-kinase catalytic subunits, such as the p110β subunit, might be sufficient to allow development to occur prior to E9.5. The period between E9.5 and E10.5 is a time of markedly increased proliferation and differentiation as organogenesis and placentation accelerate rapidly in the embryo (34Rugh R. The Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993Google Scholar). A four-chambered heart begins to beat, and angiogenesis allows the vascular system to expand in order to deliver nutrients and remove waste products. We might hypothesize that as the E9–E9.5 embryo faces markedly increased demands for proliferation, growth, and differentiation, intrauterine death ofPik3ca del/del embryos occurs at this stage because the increased demand exceeds generate residual capacity of PI 3-kinase pathways to phosphatidylinositols required for proliferation. It is interesting to note that the Pik3ca del/delembryos demonstrated areas of extravasated blood, suggestive of defective angiogenesis. A role in angiogenesis for phosphatidylinositols phosphorylated by PI 3-kinase at the 3 position of inositol is supported by studies in which wortmannin inhibited angiogenesis in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane system (35Oikawa T. Shimamura M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 318: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One interesting finding in the Pik3ca del/delhomozygous embryos was an apparent increase in p85/p55 as determined by Western blot analysis of embryo tissue obtained at E9.5. These data raise the intriguing possibility that one component of the deleterious effect of the Pik3ca del allele on embryonic development may be mediated through excess p85/p55 rather than simple loss of function of p110α. Overexpression of p85 can interfere with the binding of PI 3-kinases to other proteins by disrupting the binding between the Src homology 2 domains of the p85 subunits of the PI 3-kinases with their targets (36Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Hung Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18528-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). There is very little information on the regulation of transcription and turnover of p85/p55 and an investigation into the mechanism of this elevation of p85/p55 is greatly hampered by our inability to propagatePik3ca del/del cell lines. The increase in p85 protein seen in the Pik3ca del/del embryos points to a previously unrecognized aspect of p85 regulation that deserves further investigation. We thank Drs.

Levels of Cox-2 protein and mRNA were markedly suppressed by wt p53 but not by mutant p53. Nuclear run-offs revealed decreased rates of <i>Cox-2</i> transcription in cells expressing wt p53. The activity of the <i>Cox-2</i> promoter was reduced by 85% in cells expressing wt p53 but was reduced only by 30% in cells expressing mutant p53 compared with cells null for p53. The effect of p53 on the suppression of <i>Cox-2</i> promoter activity was localized to the first 40 base pairs 5′ from the transcription start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that p53 competed with TATA-binding protein for binding to mouse<i>Cox-2</i> or human <i>Cox-2</i> promoter extending from −50 to +52 base pairs. The results of this study suggest that interactions between p53 and Cox-2 could be important for understanding why levels of Cox-2 are undetectable in normal cells and increased in many tumors."

The PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), which is mutated in the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia, has been shown to interact with PI(3,4,5)P3 in vitro. In this study, a fusion protein containing the PH domain of Btk and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (BtkPH-GFP) was constructed and utilized to study the ability of this PH domain to interact with membrane inositol phospholipids inside living cells. The localization of expressed BtkPH-GFP in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells was indistinguishable from that of GFP alone, both being cytosolic as assessed by confocal microscopy. In NIH 3T3 cells coexpressing BtkPH-GFP and the epidermal growth factor receptor, activation of epidermal growth factor or endogenous platelet-derived growth factor receptors caused a rapid (<3 min) translocation of the cytosolic fluorescence to ruffle-like membrane structures. This response was not observed in cells expressing GFP only and was completely inhibited by treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 292004. Membrane-targeted PI 3-kinase also caused membrane localization of BtkPH-GFP that was slowly reversed by wortmannin. When the R28C mutation of the Btk PH domain, which causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia, was introduced into the fluorescent construct, no translocation was observed after stimulation. In contrast, the E41K mutation, which confers transforming activity to native Btk, caused significant membrane localization of BtkPH-GFP with characteristics indicating its possible binding to PI(4,5)P2. This mutant, but not wild-type BtkPH-GFP, interfered with agonist-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in COS-7 cells. These results show in intact cells that the PH domain of Btk binds selectively to 3-phosphorylated lipids after activation of PI 3-kinase enzymes and that losing such binding ability or specificity results in gross abnormalities in the function of the enzyme. Therefore, the interaction with PI(3,4,5)P3 is likely to be an important determinant of the physiological regulation of Btk and can be utilized to visualize the dynamics and spatiotemporal organization of changes in this phospholipid in living cells.

This study was designed to investigate whether the isolated PH domain of Btk is sufficient to interact with membrane phosphoinositides within intact living cells with similar specificity to that described in vitro and whether this interaction can localize the protein to the membrane without additional binding motifs. Expression of the Btk PH domain fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (BtkPH-GFP) has demonstrated that PI 3-kinase activation recruits these molecules to the plasma membrane, suggesting that they specifically recognize 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids without binding to PI(4,5)P2.

Ionomycin, LY 294002, bisindolylmaleimide I, and BAPTA were purchased from Calbiochem, and wortmannin was a gift from Kyowa Hakko Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of high pressure liquid chromatography or analytical grade. The PH domains of PLCδ1(amino acids 1–170) and of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (amino acids 1–177) were amplified with the Advantage Klentaq polymerase mixture (CLONTECH) from human cDNAs (Marathon cDNA from brain and K562 leukemia cells, CLONTECH) with the following primer pairs: PLCδ, 5′-GGCATGGACTCGGGCCGGGACTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-AAGATCTTCCGGGCATAGCTGTCG-3′; Btk, 5′-CCAAGTCCTGGCATCTCAATGCATCTG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGACTGGTGCTGCTGCTGGCTC-3′. The amplified products were subcloned into the pGEM-Easy T/A cloning vector (Promega) and sequenced with dideoxy sequencing (Thermosequenase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A second amplification reaction was performed from these plasmids with nested primers that contained restriction sites for appropriate cloning into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (CLONTECH) to preserve the reading frame. Plasmids were transfected into COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting for the presence of the GFP fusion constructs using a polyclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH). Mutations were created with the QuickChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, and the expression of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 30-mm diameter circular glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 104 cells/dish and cultured for 3 days before transfection with plasmid DNAs (1 μg/ml) using the LipofectAMINE reagent (10 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, and the coverslip was placed into a chamber that was mounted on a heated stage with the medium temperature kept at 33 °C. Cells were incubated in 1 ml of the Krebs-Ringer buffer, and stimuli were added in 0.5 ml of prewarmed buffer after removing 0.5 ml of medium from the cells. Cells were examined in an inverted microscope under a 40× oil immersion objective (Nikon Inc.) and a Bio-Rad laser confocal microscope system (MRC-1024) with Lasersharp acquisition software (Bio-Rad). Inositol phosphates were analyzed in COS-7 cells transfected with the AT1a angiotensin II receptor together with selected PH domain-GFP fusion constructs after labeling withmyo-[3H]inositol for 24 h as described previously (16Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Balla T. Sim S.S. Baukal A.J. Rhee S.G. Catt K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled inositol phosphates were analyzed with Dowex minicolumns. To follow the localization of isolated PH domains within intact cells, they were fused to GFP and expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A (left panel), expressed GFP (without any attached sequence) was found to be cytosolic and was also present in the nucleus. Addition of the Btk PH domain (amino acids 1–177) to the N terminus of GFP had no effect on its localization in quiescent cells (after serum deprivation) and was indistinguishable from GFP alone (Fig. 1 A, center panel). In contrast, fusion of the PLCδ PH domain to GFP caused prominent membrane localization of the construct due to its interaction with membrane PI(4,5)P2 (18Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A,right panel). These results suggest that, unlike the PH domain of PLCδ, the PH domain of Btk does not possess high enough affinity to interact with PI(4,5)P2 so that it would be sufficient for its membrane targeting. Next we examined whether stimulation of cells with growth factors that are known to activate PI 3-kinases and to increase formation of PI(3,4,5)P3 causes any change in the distribution of the BtkPH-GFP protein. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the BtkPH-GFP construct alone or together with the cDNA encoding the human EGF receptor and were stimulated either with PDGF (25–100 ng/ml) (to activate the endogenous PDGF receptor) or with EGF (100 ng/ml) after serum starvation. As shown in Figs. 1 B and2, stimulation of either receptor caused a translocation of the cytosolic fluorescence to the plasma membrane. The decrease in cytosolic fluorescence was most obvious when compared with the bright nuclear signal that did not change in intensity following stimulation in the NIH 3T3 cells. This was in contrast with our previous finding in the same cell type, where the nuclear intensity of the PLCδ PH domain-GFP fusion protein slowly followed the cytoplasmic changes, although with a slight delay (19Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The redistribution of fluorescence was clearly demonstrated by comparing line intensity histograms calculated at selected “cross-sections” of the cell. Dividing the fluorescence intensity of the plasma membrane (I pm) by that of the cytosol (I cyt) yields a ratio that can be used as an index of membrane localization (Fig. 1 B, right panels). To determine whether a similar translocation of BtkPH-GFP takes place in response to stimulation of other receptors that activate PI 3-kinases, NIH 3T3 cells were also stimulated with EGF (via expressed EGF receptors). EGF stimulation also evoked a translocation response, and we could not detect a notable difference in the localization of the fluorescent signal whether PDGF or EGF was used as the agonist (Fig. 2,A and B). To examine the effects of insulin, another known activator of PI 3-kinases, immortalized hepatocytes (20Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were transfected with the BtkPH-GFP construct and subjected to a 6–12-h serum deprivation. Addition of insulin (100 nm) to such cells also stimulated the translocation of the fluorescent signal to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, in this case, localization of the construct to intracellular vesicular structures that moved toward the plasma membrane was also observed. It is also noteworthy that, in the hepatocytes, the nuclear signal intensity decreased in parallel with the insulin-induced membrane localization (Fig.2 C). To determine whether the Btk PH domain binds to PI(3,4,5)P3, the lipid product of PI 3-kinase, we used the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 to prevent formation of the lipid in growth factor-stimulated cells. Addition of wortmannin or LY 294002 to cells after EGF or PDGF stimulation caused dissociation of BtkPH-GFP from the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A andC). This finding suggested that the Btk PH domain localizes to the membrane by a mechanism that requires the sustained activity of PI 3-kinase(s) and supports the notion that PI(3,4,5)P3 is the membrane component to which the PH domain of Btk binds in living cells. These results also show that PI(3,4,5)P3 is actively dephosphorylated during stimulation since, after blocking its increased synthesis, its level rapidly decreases as indicated by the dissociation of BtkPH-GFP from the plasma membrane. The finding that the maintenance of PI(3,4,5)P3 levels requires the sustained phosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 by PI 3-kinases prompted us to investigate whether decreasing the level of PI(4,5)P2 has an indirect effect on the localization of the Btk PH domain. Addition of ionomycin (which elevates intracellular [Ca2+] and thereby induces hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2) to EGF-stimulated cells caused the rapid release of the fluorescence from the membranes back to the cytosol (data not shown). Since PI(3,4,5)P3 is not hydrolyzed directly by any known PLC, these findings are consistent with the sensitivity of PI(3,4,5)P3 levels both to PI 3-kinase activity and to changes in the level of its substrate, PI(4,5)P2. Next we tested whether cellular production of 3-phosphorylated inositides without receptor stimulation is sufficient to cause the translocation of the Btk PH domain construct to the plasma membrane. For this, we cotransfected NIH 3T3 cells with a membrane-targeted form of PI 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ-CAAX) (21Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and BtkPH-GFP. Expression of this PI 3-kinase construct has been shown to cause production of PI(3,4,5)P3 and a high level of activation of the Akt protein kinase in COS-7 cells (21Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, this manipulation yielded cells in which the fluorescent construct was localized to the membranes, but unlike after hormonal stimulation, this localization was not confined to the plasma membrane. In many cells, there were intracellular bright spots that, in some cases, formed “aggregates” with high fluorescent intensities (data not shown). Moreover, very little nuclear localization of fluorescence was observed in these cells. Addition of wortmannin (300 nm) caused the release of fluorescence from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, but it required a significantly longer time than in cases of acute stimulation by agonists. Also, the spotty intracellular signal appeared to be more resistant to wortmannin treatment. The C1 region of various protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes has been shown to interact with the Btk PH domain based on in vitro binding assay (22Yao L. Suzuki H. Ozawa K. Deng J. Lehel C. Fukamachi H. Anderson W.B. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13033-13039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This interaction was found to be inhibited by agents that bind either to the C1 domain of PKC (such as phorbol esters) or to the Btk PH domain (such as PI(4,5)P2). Moreover, recently, the PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase PDK-1 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate PKCζ (23Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of phorbol esters and PKC inhibitors on the membrane translocation response of the Btk PH domain. Stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells with phorbol esters (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, 100 nm to 1 μm) had no effect on the distribution of BtkPH-GFP (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, stimulation with EGF (or PDGF) induced translocation of BtkPH-GFP in cells that either were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Gö 6850, up to 500 nm, 10 min) (Fig. 4 B) or were treated with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 12 h before PDGF stimulation (data not shown). Similarly, addition of the PKC inhibitor to PDGF-stimulated cells (after Btk PH domain translocation to the membrane had taken place) had no significant effect on the distribution of fluorescence, whereas subsequent addition of wortmannin rapidly released the fluorescence from the membranes (data not shown). (The PKC inhibitor applied at this concentration reversed the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on a variety of cell responses in our laboratory.) Although these data cannot rule out PKC being a regulator of the holoprotein Btk, they did not suggest an important role of PKC in the PI 3-kinase-mediated membrane targeting of the Btk PH domain. Several mutations of Btk that are responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia are located within the PH domain of the protein and impair its membrane association (11Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of the best characterized mutant, R28C (which is unable to bind PI(3,4,5)P3 in vitro (6Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 8Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar)), to localize to the membrane in living cells in response to stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3 (B and C), no membrane localization of the R28C mutant of BtkPH-GFP was observed after PDGF or EGF stimulation in NIH 3T3 cells (or in COS-7 cells; data not shown). The E41K mutation, which causes transformation in NIH 3T3 cells and shows enhanced membrane association (15Li T. Tsukada S. Satterthwaite A. Havlik M.H. Park H. Takatsu K. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), was also introduced into the BtkPH-GFP construct, and its localization within intact cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the E41K mutant displayed significant membrane localization even in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells and still displayed translocation in response to EGF (100 ng/ml). Application of wortmannin (300 nm) reversed the EGF-induced increase in membrane association, but did not reduce it below its initial level. Wortmannin also failed to affect the basal localization of the construct when added to cells that were not stimulated with EGF (data not shown). In view of the ability of the E41K mutant to associate with membranes of unstimulated cells, which contain only small amounts (if any) of PI(3,4,5)P3, we investigated the possibility that this mutant BtkPH-GFP has a diminished binding specificity for PI(3,4,5)P3 and hence is also able to bind to PI(4,5)P2 that is present in membranes of unstimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A (panels d–h), PI(4,5)P2 breakdown evoked by the addition of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin caused a complete release of the membrane-bound fluorescence into the cytosol, whereas subsequent chelation of Ca2+ by BAPTA caused a reappearance of the signal at the plasma membrane. The effect of ionomycin was inhibited by preincubation with 10 mm neomycin (to inhibit PLC; data not shown). The relocalization of fluorescence after Ca2+chelation was not prevented by 300 nm wortmannin, but was abolished by the addition of 100 μm quercetin, which inhibits PI(4,5)P2 resynthesis (19Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). These changes were very similar to those observed with the PLCδ PH domain-GFP construct (which binds to PI(4,5)P2 (18Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar,24Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar)) and are consistent with the assumption that the E41K mutation impairs the ability of the Btk PH domain to discriminate between PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 effectively. To further investigate whether the E41K mutant Btk PH domain is able to bind to membrane PI(4,5)P2within the intact cell, we examined the ability of this construct to interfere with agonist-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. As shown earlier for the PLCδ PH domain (25Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and for the pleckstrin PH domain (26Abrams C.S. Wu H. Zhao W. Belmonte E. White D. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14485-14492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (both of which bind to PI(4,5)P2), expression of these molecules inhibited receptor-mediated inositol phosphate production, presumably by interfering with PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2. As shown in Fig.6, neither the wild-type Btk PH domain nor the R28C mutant had a significant effect on angiotensin II-stimulated inositol phosphate production in COS-7 cells expressing the AT1a receptor together with the GFP construct of interest. In contrast, E41K mutant BtkPH-GFP showed a significant inhibitory effect, although this inhibition was not as strong as that caused by expression of PLCδ PH domain-GFP (Fig. 6). The important role of the Btk PH domain was originally recognized after identifying and analyzing mutations that cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans (14Vihinen M. Iwata T. Kinnon C. Kwan S.P. Ochs H.D. Vorechovsky I. Smith C.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several (although not all) of these mutations are within the PH domain of Btk. Some mutations cause a folding defect, and others affect its function, presumably interfering with the binding characteristics of this module (27Hyvönen M. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3396-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The ability of Btk to interact with membranes appears to be the key regulatory element in determining the function(s) of the kinase, and several lines of evidence suggest that the PH domain is a critical region of the molecule for membrane association (27Hyvönen M. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3396-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (28Tsukada S. Simon M. Witte O. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The participation of the carbonate radical in the oxidation of substrates was inferred from the reactivity of peroxynitrite with inorganic ions in the presence of carbon dioxide (11,12).Table IIReactions (2Kissner R.

It has been proposed that peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) promotes one-electron oxidations following a rate-limiting unimolecular activation to a species whose chemical identity, an activated form of peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH*) or the hydroxyl radical, remained under debate for a long time (3Beckman J.S.

It was only recently that clear experimental evidence was obtained demonstrating that a significant portion of the oxidative activity of peroxynitrous acid is because of the hydroxyl radical (19,20). The controversy was difficult to resolve because spin trapping of the hydroxyl radical with DMPO, 2The abbreviation used is: DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide.2The abbreviation used is: DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. the most unambiguous method for detecting the hydroxyl radical by EPR (21Buettner G.R. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), was compromised by the reactivity of peroxynitrite with spin traps and spin adducts (15Augusto O. Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Gatti R.M. Alvarez B. Vasquez-Vivar J. Radi R. Augusto O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of the participation of the carbonate radical in oxidations mediated by peroxynitrite in the presence of carbon dioxide (Scheme 1A) could be anticipated to be similarly difficult. There is only one report of spin trapping of the carbonate radical with nitromethane in irradiated aqueous solutions at pH 12 (22Behar D. Fessenden R.W. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 76: 1710-1721Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At physiological pHs, the DMPO-carbon dioxide radical anion produced during irradiation of bicarbonate and DMPO solutions was incorrectly attributed to the carbonate radical adduct (23Wolcott R.G. Franks B.S. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have tried to trap the carbonate radical in systems containing peroxynitrite and bicarbonate under different experimental conditions but did not succeed. Consequently, we considered it worth trying to detect the carbonate radical directly by continuous fast flow EPR of peroxynitrite and bicarbonate solutions. Our results provided unambiguous evidence for the formation of the carbonate radical in these mixtures. All reagents were purchased from Merck, Aldrich, or Sigma and were analytical grade or better. Sodium bicarbonate labeled with 13C (98%) was obtained from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Peroxynitrite was synthesized from sodium nitrite (0.6 m) and hydrogen peroxide (0.65 m) in a quenched-flow reactor (3Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar, 9Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar); excess hydrogen peroxide was used to minimize nitrite contamination (24Saha A. Goldstein S. Cabelli D. Czapski G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To eliminate excess hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite was treated with manganese dioxide. Synthesized peroxynitrite contained low levels of contaminating hydrogen peroxide (< 1%) and nitrite (10–30%) that were determined as described previously (2Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) by the titanyl method and by absorbance measurements at 354 nm (ε = 24.6 m−1cm−1), respectively. The concentration of peroxynitrite stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1670m−1 cm−1 (3Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar, 9Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). All solutions were prepared with distilled water treated in a Millipore Milli-Q system. The EPR fast-flow spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at 9.68 GHz and 100 KHz field modulation equipped with a Bruker ER 4117 D-MTV dielectric mixing resonator with a 9-mm distance between the mixing cell and the resonator center. Sodium bicarbonate solutions were prepared in 0.1–1 m phosphate buffer of various pHs and left undisturbed for 15 min to permit bicarbonate-carbon dioxide equilibrium (7Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar); the pH of each solution was determined after bicarbonate addition and equilibration. Peroxynitrite solutions were prepared with water or 0.2 m dipotassium hydrogen phosphate to a final pH of 12. These solutions were transferred to 2 20-ml syringes mounted on a syringe infusion pump (Harvard apparatus pump 22). Most spectra were recorded 15 ms after mixing under a continuous flow of 7 ml/min. The dispensed mixtures were collected for pH measurements at the end of the experiments to detect changes caused by mixing with the alkaline stock solutions of peroxynitrite. In some experiments, stock solutions of bicarbonate and peroxynitrite were prepared in buffers bubbled with nitrogen for 20 min. The concentrations of the carbonate radical were estimated by double integration of their EPR spectra and comparison with a doubly integrated signal obtained under the same experimental conditions from 10 μm 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy radical (g = 2.0056) (25Mehlhorn R.J. Keith A.D. Fox C.F. Keith A.D. Membrane Molecular Biology. Sinauer Associations, Stamford, CT1972: 192-227Google Scholar), which was also used to calibrate the magnetic field. Simulations were carried out using the Gepasi software, version 3.2 (26Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Fast flow mixing of concentrated solutions of peroxynitrite (10 mm final concentration) and bicarbonate (50 mmfinal concentration) in 0.5 m phosphate buffer at pH 6.9 led to the detection of a one-line EPR spectrum (Fig.1 A) that was not detectable after stopping the flow (Fig. 1 B). Also, no signal was detected in fast flow mixtures of the buffer with either bicarbonate (Fig. 1 C) or peroxynitrite alone (Fig. 1 D), indicating that the radical is produced from the reaction between peroxynitrite and carbon dioxide. Accordingly, the EPR signal varied significantly with the pH of the mixtures, and the intensities were maximum around pH 6.4 (Fig. 2). This value is similar to those obtained for maximum decomposition rates of peroxynitrite in the presence of carbon dioxide, which was in the pH range of 6.2–6.5 (7Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 9Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). These values are consistent with a rate-limiting reaction between the peroxynitrite anion (pK a = 6.8) (3Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar) and carbon dioxide (pK a apparent = 6.4) (28Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 12th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1979: 5-13Google Scholar) to produce the nitrosoperoxocarboxylate adduct whose homolysis would generate the carbonate radical (Scheme 1A).Figure 2Representative plot of the effects of pH on the yield of the carbonate radical anion produced in fast flow mixtures of peroxynitrite and bicarbonate. The yields of the radical were expressed as the peak height of the EPR signal in arbitrary units (a.u.). Final concentrations of peroxynitrite, bicarbonate and phosphate buffer were 10, 50, and 500 mm, respectively. Bicarbonate solutions were prepared in 1 m phosphate buffer of various pHs, and the pH was checked for each mixture before and after mixing with peroxynitrite solutions (pH = 12). The changes in pH before and after mixing were ≤0.2 pH units, and the average pH values were used in the plot. The spectra were recorded 15 ms after mixing (flow of 7 ml/min) as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the same instrumental conditions as shown in Fig. 1. The data represent a series of experiments obtained on the same day with the same peroxynitrite preparation. The same profile was obtained in a different set of experiments; the data were not presented as the average ±S.D. because of the difficulties in obtaining exactly the same final pH values in different sets of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To better characterize the radical detected during fast flow mixing of the peroxynitrite and bicarbonate solutions, we tried to increase the detectable radical concentrations under our instrumental conditions. As expected, the EPR signal shown in Fig. 1 increased with the flow in the 4–8 ml/min range, but the available instrumentation only permitted flows of up to 8 ml/min. The EPR signal did not change significantly when the buffer solutions were purged free of oxygen but grew when the concentrations of both peroxynitrite or bicarbonate were increased. Consequently, to obtain higher radical concentrations, we took advantage of the relatively slow carbon dioxide hydration-dehydration equilibrium as compared with peroxynitrite protonation and decay to nitrate (Scheme 1B) (7Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). For this purpose, solutions of 100 mm bicarbonate in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, were fast mixed with alkaline solutions of 40 mmperoxynitrite to give solutions of pH 8.4 whose transient carbon dioxide concentrations (∼25 mm) were much higher than equilibrium values (∼1.23 mm). Under these conditions, the EPR signal obtained (Fig.3 A) was more intense than that obtained under conditions of equilibrium (Fig. 1 A). Qualitatively, the signal was the same and showed EPR parameters, a line width of 5.5 G, and a g value of 2.0113, which were in good agreement with those previously reported for the carbonate radical in solid matrices if allowance is made for the very different media used,i.e. solutions versus solid matrix (29Hisatsune I.C.

Physiol. 1962; 5: 589-599Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Indeed, the matrix itself changes the EPR parameters of the carbonate radical, and some of the values reported in the literature are listed in Table I and compared with those determined here in aqueous solutions (Fig. 3 A).Table IEPR parameters of the carbonate radical in various media at 25 °CMediag valueLine widtha(13C)ReferenceGGKCl matrix2.01133.711.929Hisatsune I.C.

Open table in a new tab The parameters in aqueous solutions were determined from the spectra shown in Fig. 3, which were obtained from fast flow mixing of bicarbonate and peroxynitrite solutions as described in the legend to the figure. Unequivocal proof that the radical detected directly in fast flow mixtures of peroxynitrite with bicarbonate is the carbonate radical was obtained in experiments with bicarbonate labeled with 13C (Fig. 3 B). In this case, the singlet signal of the unlabeled carbonate radical (Fig. 3 A) split into a half-height doublet signal (Fig. 3 B) because of the contribution of the13C atom (I = 1/2). The determined hyperfine splitting constant of 13C is 11.7 G (Fig. 1 B), a value in excellent agreement with those previously reported as experimental (Table I) (29Hisatsune I.C. Adl T. Beahm E.C. Kempf R.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 74: 3225-3231Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Chantry G.W. Horsfield A. Morton J.R. Whiffen D.H. Mol. Physiol. 1962; 5: 589-599Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and calculated values (11 G) (31Symons M. Chemical and Biochemical Aspects of Electron Spin Resonance. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 16-25Google Scholar) for the labeled carbonate radical. The concentrations of the carbonate radical were estimated to be about 3 × 10−6m under equilibrium conditions at pH 6.9 (Fig. 1 A) and 5 × 10−6m under nonequilibrium conditions at pH 8.4 (Fig.3 A). These values should be taken as rough estimates, because the experiments were run close to the detection limits of the instrument, and EPR itself presents inherent quantification problems (32Wertz J.E. Bolton J.R. Electron Spin Resonance: Elementary Theory and Applications. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1972: 450-457Google Scholar). Still, the obtained values are of the same order of magnitude as those calculated by computer simulation considering reactions 2–10 (Table II) in which the decomposition of nitrosoperoxocarboxylate produces the carbonate radical anion with 35% yield (reaction 5a, Table II) and with k 4assumed to be 1 × 106 s−1 (7Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 17Merényi G. Lind J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this scheme (Table II), the carbonate radical anion was assumed to decay via three major pathways, including O·̄ transfer to nitrogen dioxide (reaction 7), dismutation (reaction 8), and oxidation of residual nitrite (reaction 9) (33Lilie J. Hanrahan R.J. Henglein A. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1978; 11: 225-227Google Scholar, 34Simic M.G. Hunter E.P.L. Bors W. Saran M. Tait D. Oxygen Radicals Chemistry and Biology.

Under the same conditions as shown in Fig. 1 A, the simulation showed that the transient concentration of the carbonate radical anion is 6 μm at 15 ms (Fig. 4). It is important to note that the one-line signal shown in Fig.3 A did not visibly split when the pH was changed over the 6–9 range or by the use of modulation amplitudes as low as 1 G (data not shown). This indicates that either the proton hyperfine splitting constant of the carbonate radical is lower than 1 G or that the species is not protonated (see Reaction 11) over the studied pH range of 6–9. Although the literature contains conflicting evidence regarding the protonated state of the carbonate radical over the 6–12 pH range (36Chen S. Hoffman M.Z. J. Phys. Chem. 1973; 77: 1111-1116Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar,37Eriksen T.E. Lind J. Merényi G. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1985; 26: 197-199Google Scholar), recent studies by time resolved RAMAN spectroscopy have found no evidence for its protonation at pHs between 7.5 and 12.3 (38Bisby R.H. Johnson S.A. Parker A.W. Tavender S.M. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 2069-2072Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These studies are in agreement with our EPR data indicating that the radical is not protonated at physiological pHs. CO·̄3+H+⇌HCO·̄3 REACTION11 A role for the carbonate radical in peroxynitrite-mediated processes was first suggested by Radi and co-workers (39Radi R. Cosgrove T.P. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that bicarbonate greatly increased luminol chemiluminescence triggered by peroxynitrite. The direct reaction between peroxynitrite and carbon dioxide was then characterized by Lymar and Hurst (7Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). That this reaction should be a significant fraction of the biological reactivity of peroxynitrite and that it produces reactive oxidizing and nitrating species is currently supported by the work of many investigators (8Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 372: 335-343Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem.

Pryor W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The chemical nature of these reactive intermediates has also been proposed, but this is the first report presenting direct spectroscopic evidence for one of these intermediates, the carbonate radical anion (Figs 1 and 3, TableI). The proposed mechanisms of carbonate radical formation (reactions 3 and 5a) and consumption (reactions 7–9) (Fig. 4; Table II) are consistent with the carbonate radical levels (∼3–5 × 10−6m) quantified experimentally under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. Our results confirmed that the carbonate radical is not protonated at physiological pHs (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) (38Bisby R.H. Johnson S.A. Parker A.W. Tavender S.M. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 2069-2072Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As discussed by Bisby et al. (38Bisby R.H. Johnson S.A. Parker A.W. Tavender S.M. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 2069-2072Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the carbonate radical anion is slightly more oxidizing in neutral solutions (Em,i ∼ 1.80 V) than previously assumed considering a pK a of 9.6 (Em,i ∼ 1.64 V) (38Bisby R.H. Johnson S.A. Parker A.W. Tavender S.M. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 2069-2072Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although local concentrations of carbon dioxide and biological targets will determine the decomposition pathway of peroxynitrite that might be formed in a particular physiological compartment, a significant fraction of peroxynitrite (35%) will produce reactive free radicals such as nitrogen dioxide and carbonate radical anion (Scheme 1A). Formation of hydroxyl radical is also possible (Scheme 1B) (19Gatti R.M. Alvarez B. Vasquez-Vivar J. Radi R. Augusto O. Arch. Biochem.

Soc. 1998; 120: 7211-7219Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) but unlikely to be significant under physiological conditions, because the rate of peroxynitrite homolysis is too slow to efficiently compete with peroxynitrite attacking the many available biological targets (5Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Squadrito G.L. Pryor W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Both the hydroxyl radical and the carbonate radical anion can oxidize substrates by hydrogen atom abstraction, but in the case of the hydroxyl radical, the faster addition reactions would be likely to predominate in most conditions (40Pryor W.A Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1988; 4: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This can explain why peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of aromatic amino acids is increased in the presence of carbon dioxide (5Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Squadrito G.L. Pryor W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Direct EPR detection of the carbonate radical anion is important to unravel mechanistic details of oxidative damage inflicted not only by peroxynitrite but also by other oxidizing species such as hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical. On the one hand, normal plasma bicarbonate and carbon dioxide concentrations are 25 and 1.3 mm, but higher levels could be achieved during pathologic events such as respiratory distress syndrome or ischemia reperfusion (41Levinski N.G. Harrison T.R. Isselbacher K.J. Braunwald E. Wilson J.D. Martin J.B. Farrer A.S. Petersorf R.G. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 13th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1994: 253-262Google Scholar). On the other hand, the carbonate radical has been proposed to be responsible for the effects of bicarbonate increasing photodamage to erythrocytes (42Michelson A.M. Maral J. Biochimie (Paris). 1983; 65: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the bactericidal activity of the hydroxyl radical (5Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23Wolcott R.G. Franks B.S. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbonate radical, however, has never been characterized in these systems. In a recent paper published by Hurst and co-workers (23Wolcott R.G. Franks B.S. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a role for the carbonate radical in the bactericidal effects of the hydroxyl radical is evidenced by the overall data. The claimed detection of the carbonate radical, however, was not substantiated by the presented spin trap results. The authors show that irradiated solutions of DMPO and bicarbonate presented a composite EPR spectrum whose components were the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct, the DMPO-hydrogen radical adduct, and a third adduct whose EPR parameters coincided with those of the DMPO-carbon dioxide radical adduct. This coincidence led the authors to conclude that they trapped the carbonate radical. However, in the carbon dioxide radical, most of the electron density is on the carbon atom, whereas in the carbonate radical, most of the electron density is on the oxygen atoms (30Chantry G.W. Horsfield A. Morton J.R. Whiffen D.H. Mol. Physiol. 1962; 5: 589-599Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Bisby R.H. Johnson S.A. Parker A.W. Tavender S.M. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 2069-2072Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and adducts of these radicals with DMPO are unlikely to have similar EPR parameters. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has been able to trap the carbonate radical with DMPO. There is a report of trapping of the carbonate radical with nitromethane by irradiation at alkaline pHs, and as expected, the nitromethane-carbonate radical adduct has EPR parameters similar to those of the hydroxyl radical (22Behar D. Fessenden R.W. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 76: 1710-1721Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), an oxygen-centered radical. The radical detected by Hurst and co-workers should, indeed, be the carbon dioxide radical anion produced from reduction of carbon dioxide by hydrogen atoms not completely quenched in their system; the presence of hydrogen atoms is proved by their detection of the DMPO-hydrogen radical adduct (Reactions 12–R14). In our experience, it is common to detect DMPO-carbon dioxide radical adduct from air-equilibrated buffer solutions in the presence of reducing agents such as hydrazine (43.Gomes, L. F., The Role of Carbon-centered Radicals on Hydrazine Toxicity. Ph.D. thesis, 1996, Instituto de Quı́mica, Universidade de São Paulo.Google Scholar). CO2+H⋅→CO·̄2+H+ CO·̄2+DMPO→DMPO−CO·̄2 H⋅+DMPO→DMPO−H⋅ REACTIONS12–14In summary, our results represent the first detection of the carbonate radical anion in aqueous solutions at physiological pHs. Detection and characterization of the radical as negatively charged at neutral pHs should contribute to the understanding of the roles of ubiquitous carbon dioxide in modulating the pathogenic mechanisms of peroxynitrite and other oxidizing intermediates."

However, the molecular mechanism of channel regulation by the NO-PKG pathway has not been determined on cloned channels. The present study was designed to clarify PKG-mediated modulation of channels at the molecular level. The cDNA encoding the α-subunit of the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel,cslo-α, was expressed in HEK293 cells. Whole cell and single channel characteristics of cslo-α exhibited functional features of native large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels in smooth muscle cells. The NO-donor sodium nitroprusside increased outward current 2.3-fold in whole cell recordings. In cell-attached patches, sodium nitroprusside increased the channel open probability (NPo) ofcslo-α channels 3.3-fold without affecting unitary conductance. The stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside was inhibited by the PKG-inhibitor KT5823. Direct application of PKG-Iα to the cytosolic surface of inside-out patches increased NPo 3.2-fold only in the presence of ATP and cGMP without affecting unitary conductance. A point mutation of cslo-α in which Ser-1072 (the only optimal consensus sequence for PKG phosphorylation) was replaced by Ala abolished the PKG effect on NPo in inside-out patches and the effect of SNP in cell attached patches. These results indicate that PKG activates cslo-α by direct phosphorylation at serine 1072.

Although BKCachannels are usually not involved in setting resting potential, they play a key role as a negative feedback mechanism to limit depolarization and contraction (5Latorre R. Oberhauser A.

Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 129-137PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in native cells suggest that PKG activates BKCa channels through phosphorylation of the channel (23Alioua A. Huggins J.P. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L1057-L1063PubMed Google Scholar). These results are supported by biochemical studies of cloned BKCa channels, which demonstrate PKG-induced phosphorylation of the channel (24Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P.

The primary sequence of BKCa has been determined using molecular cloning techniques in Drosophila (25Atkinson N.S. Robertson G.A. Ganetzky B.

These studies indicate that BKCa isoforms belong to the voltage-gated K+ (KV) channel superfamily. The primary sequence of the S1-S6 segment of BKCa channels is homologous to the corresponding regions in KV channels. The long carboxyl terminus is the region of Ca2+-sensing (29Wei A. Solaro C.

Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar). However additional putative PKG phosphorylation sites have been identified in other splice variants (31Saito M. Nelson C. Salkoff L. Lingle C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expression of theslo channel in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells gives rise to voltage-gated, Ca2+-sensitive currents with electrophysiological and pharmacological features similar to those of native BKCa (32Adelman J.P.

However, although many studies of native cells suggest that BKCa channel activity is also modulated by various protein kinases (35Lechleiter J.D. Dartt D.A. Brehm P.

Two studies in whichslo channels have been expressed in either oocytes (27Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar) or Chinese hamster ovary cells (39Zhou X.B. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Korth M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have reported that PKG was without effect on slo channel activity. In contrast, Perez et al. (33Perez G. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. Toro L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that an endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase-like activity activated dslo-α channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A recent study showed that PKG-Iα phosphorylated hslo channels reconstituted into lipid bilayers but had no effect on channel activity in inside-out patches expressed in Xenopus oocytes (24Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P.F. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine PKG-induced modulation of cloned BKCa channels and determine whether direct phosphorylation of the channel was involved. The α-subunit ofcslo, a BKCa channel α-subunit cloned from canine colon, was expressed in HEK293 cells, and currents were measured using both the whole cell mode as well as cell-attached and detached patches. Evidence was obtained suggesting that the activity of cloned BKCa channels is enhanced by the NO/PKG pathway and that stimulation is mediated by direct phosphorylation of Ser-1072 ofcslo-α by PKG. The cDNA encoding the α-subunit of the BKCa channel (cslo-α) was previously cloned from canine colonic smooth muscle using reverse transcription and a polymerase chain reaction (GenBank™ accession number U-41001). Northern blot analysis showed that thecslo-α transcripts are expressed in the muscles of the canine gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels (27Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar). Thecslo-α construct was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pZeoSV (Invitrogen, CA). The S1072A mutation of cslo-α was created by recombinant mutagenesis (40Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Briefly, linearized cslo-α plasmid was modified and amplified simultaneously by PCR in two separate reactions. Two primer pairs were used for PCR. In the first amplification reaction, one-half of the plasmid was amplified using a forward primer containing the S1072A mutation, spanning nucleotides 3194 to 3233 (5′-AGTCCTCCAGCAAGAAGAGCGCCTCCGTGCACTCCATCCC-3′) and a reverse primer complementary to the plasmid sequence (5′-GAACGGCACTGGTCAACTTGGCCATGGTGGCCCTC-3′). The second half of the reaction amplified the remaining half of the plasmid using the reverse-mutating primer (5′-AGTCCTCCAGCAAGAAGAGCGCCTCCGTGCACTCCATCCC-3′) and the forward plasmid-specific primer (5′-ATGGCCAAGTTGACCAGTGCCGTTCCGGTGCTCAC-3′). Both the mutating and plasmid primers were designed to contain a ≥24-base pair homology at their 5′ ends, which generated an overlap between the ends of the two PCR products. The homologous ends of the PCR products undergo recombination in vivo following transformation of RecAEscherichia coli cells. PCR amplification was performed in 50-μl reactions containing 1× PCR buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 8.3); Invitrogen), 200 μm each dNTP (Invitrogen), 25 pmol of primer, 2 ng of plasmid template, 10% Me2SO, and 2. 5 units ofTaq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Reactants underwent an initial denaturation (94 °C × 1 min), 30 amplification cycles (94 °C × 30 s, 50 °C × 30 s, and 72 °C × 3 min) and a final extension of 72 °C × 10 min. PCR products were gel-purified, and 2.5 μl of each PCR reaction were mixed and transformed directly into 50 μl of Max CompetentTM DH5α E. coli (Life Technologies, Inc) and selected on low salt LB zeocin plates (25 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was prepared from overnight cultures using the QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen, CA). Plasmid DNA of the correct size was sequenced using the ABI Prism cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, CA) and analyzed on a Perkin-Elmer 310 Genetic Analyzer. HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (cell line number CRL-1573, Manassas, VA) and maintained in modified RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO) and 1% glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were subcultured twice a week by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cslo-α DNA was transfected into HEK cells by electroporation. Electroporation was performed as follows. After harvesting the HEK cells by trypsin-EDTA, the cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer solution and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate buffer solution at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in the cuvette for electroporation. Each cuvette was supplemented with appropriate combinations of CD8 (a lymphocyte cell-surface antigen) in the πH3-CD8 plasmid construct as a marker for transfection (4 μg), cslo-α, or S1072Acslo-α in the pZeoSV vector (20 μg). After a 10-min incubation on ice, electroporation was done by applying a 330-V pulse using a pulse generator (Electroporator II, invitrogen, CA). HEK cells expressing cslo-α were subcultured on glass coverslips for electrophysiological recording. Current recording was performed 1 to 4 days after the electroporation procedure. Transfected cells were identified by their binding to CD8-coated beads (Dyna-beads M-450 CD8; Great Neck, NY) (41Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). The patch-clamp technique was used to measure membrane currents in whole cell and single cell configuration. Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate grass capillaries pulled with a three-stage micropipette puller (P.80/PC, Sutter, CA) and heat-polished with a microforge (MF-83, Narishige, Japan). The pipettes had tip resistances of 2 to 5 megaohm for whole cell recordings and 8 to 10 megaohm for single-channel recordings. Coverslips containing HEK cells were placed in a recording chamber (volume 1.0 ml) mounted on the stage of an Olympus inverted microscope and superfused with bath solution at a rate of 1.0 ml/min. Standard gigaohm seal patch-clamp recording techniques were used to measure the currents of whole cell, cell-attached, and excised inside-out configurations. An Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, CA) was used to measure whole cell and single-channel recordings. Capacitance and series resistance compensation were performed. The output signals were filtered at 1 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter, digitized at a sampling rate of 3 kHz, and stored on the hard disk of a computer for off-line analysis. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with pClamp software (version 6.0.4., Axon Instruments). Channel open probability (NPo) in patches was determined from recordings of more than 3 min by fitting the sum of Gaussian functions to an all-points histogram plot at each potential. Single channel conductance was determined from all-point amplitude histograms using Fechan and Pstat programs (Axon Instruments). For whole cell recordings of HEK cells, the bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4), and the pipette solution contained 50 mm KCl, 70 mm l-aspartic acid monopotassium, 8 mm NaCl, 0.826 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm NaGTP, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (pH 7.2). For single channel recordings in the inside-out mode, the bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (pH 7.2). The concentration of free Ca2+ in the bath solution was changed from 10−8m to 10−4m to determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa channels. Ca2+ concentration was estimated by a computer program (42Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Methods in Cell Biology: A Practical Guide to the Study of Ca2+in Living Cells. 40. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar), and the appropriate amounts of CaCl2 were added. The ionized Ca2+concentration was confirmed using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). For single channel recordings in the cell-attached mode, the bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4), and the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). All patch-clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). PKG-Iα and KT5823 were purchased from Calbiochem. Diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide (DETA/NO) was from RBI (Natick, MA) and other drugs were from Sigma. Data are expressed as mean ±S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test for paired observations. Membrane currents of nontransfected native HEK cells were measured in whole cell voltage clamp configuration. Depolarizing steps triggered an outward current in native HEK cells. The current showed little or no inactivation during the pulse. The steady-state current at +50 mV was 0.29 ± 0.04 nA (n = 10). This current was suppressed by the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (0.09 ± 0.03 nA at 1 mm; n = 4) but was unaffected by the specific BKCa channel inhibitor iberiotoxin (IBTX 100 nm; n = 3). Expression of CD8 DNA (marker plasmid) in HEK cells had no effect on the current (n = 6). The amplitude of outward current in HEK cells expressingcslo-α was considerably larger than in native HEK cells. Mean current amplitude obtained under steady-state conditions at +50 mV in cells expressing cslo-α was 4.56 ± 0.42 nA (n = 10). Representative whole cell currents obtained in transfected and native cells are shown in Fig.1 A. The current-voltage relationships of transfected and native cells are shown in Fig.1 B. Membrane conductance plotted as a function of voltage in HEK cells expressing cslo-α is shown in Fig.1 C. Discernible conductance was apparent at potentials positive to −40 mV, and maximum conductance was reached at approximately +60 mV. The V 0.5 was +20.3 mV, and the slope was 15.1. BKCa channels are specifically blocked by IBTX purified from venom of the scorpion (43Galvez A. Gimenez-Gallego G. Reuben J.P. Roy-Contancin L. Feigenbaum P. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11083-11090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine whether outward currents recorded incslo-α cells were blocked by IBTX. The addition of IBTX (100 nm) to the bathing solution produced a marked reduction in outward current at all voltages tested as seen in Fig.2, A and B. In 5 cells expressing cslo-α, IBTX significantly (p < 0.01) reduced current amplitude by greater than 90% (Fig. 2 C). The current remaining in the presence of IBTX was not different from that of native currents recorded in HEK cells (p > 0.05). To further examine the properties of outward currents in cells transfected withcslo-α, single channel activity was recorded in inside-out patches in a symmetrical KCl solution (140 mm KCl). Channel openings could be detected at membrane potentials from −60 mV to +60 mV (Fig. 3 A). The activity of these channels was voltage-dependent, i.e. NPo increased from 0.064 ± 0.030 at −60 mV to 0.942 ± 0.192 at +60 mV (n = 5). The current voltage relationship of channels was linear between −60 mV to +60 mV (Fig. 3 B) with a mean slope conductance of 253 ± 9.7 pS (n = 8) and a reversal potential of ≈0 mV. When the Ca2+concentration on the cytosolic side of the membrane patch was increased, ranging from 10−8 to 10−4m, channel activity increased dramatically (holding potential = +40 mV, see Fig. 3 C). The relationship between Ca2+ concentration and Po of the cslo-α channel at +40 mV is shown in Fig. 3 D. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) increased the activity of native BKCa channels in smooth muscle (13Mistry D.K. Garland C.J. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine the action of SNP on cells expressingcslo-α using the whole cell patch-clamp mode. The addition of SNP (10−4m) to the bathing solution led to a significant increase in whole cell outward current (Fig.4, A and B). In 8 cells tested, SNP significantly (p < 0.01) increased outward current amplitude 2.3-fold at + 50 mV (Fig. 4 C). When SNP was removed from the bathing solution, current amplitude returned to the prestimulus amplitude. Cytosolic Ca2+concentration was buffered at 10−5m withN-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid in these experiments. Because SNP significantly enhances whole cell cslo-α current amplitude, additional experiments were performed to determine whether changes also occur in single channel activity recorded in cell-attached patches. The addition of SNP (10−4m) to the bathing solution led to a marked increase in cslo-α channel activity, which returned to near control levels 10–15 min after wash-out (Fig. 5, A andC). In Fig. 5 B, the time course of changes incslo-α activity after the addition of SNP is shown. SNP increased NPo from 0.092 to 0.656 in this cell. In 8 cells, SNP significantly (p < 0.01) increased NPo 3.3-fold (holding potential = +40 mV; see Fig. 5 C) but had no effect on unitary current amplitude (control 253 ± 11.3, SNP 262 ± 13.1, wash-out 258 ± 8.8 pS, n = 8,p > 0.05). SNP had no significant effect oncslo-α activity in the presence of the PKG-specific inhibitor KT5823 (10−6m) in cell-attached patches (Fig. 5 D). SNP had no effect on cslo-α channels in inside-out patches (NPo; control 0.318 ± 0.123, SNP 0.370 ± 0.184, n = 8, p > 0.05). Additional experiments were performed with the NO donor, DETA/NO (300 μm), because there is evidence that different donors may have differing effects upon potassium channels (44Goyal R.K. He X.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1185-G1192PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to SNP, DETA/NO increased cslo-α channel activity in the absence (NPo: control, 0.036 ± 0.023; DETA/NO, 0.072 ± 0.029, n = 6, p < 0.05) and in the presence (NPo: control, 0.152 ± 0.121, DETA/NO, 0.249 ± 0.117, n = 8, p < 0.05) of KT5823 in cell-attached patches. Our experiments with SNP suggest that cslo-α channels are activated by the cGMP/PKG pathway. To provide more direct evidence for PKG-induced modulation of cslo-α, we examined the effects of PKG-Iα on cslo-α channel activity in inside-out patches. Application of PKG-Iα to the cytosolic side of the membrane did not modify cslo-α currents (Fig.6, B and C). The effect of ATP (1 mm) on cslo-α channel was variable (11 of 21 increased, 7 of 21 decreased, 3 of 21 showed no change), so that overall, no significant change was observed in the pooled data (Fig. 6 C). ATP (1 mm) plus cGMP (0.1 mm) also had no effect on cslo-α current (Fig.6, A and C). However, when PKG-Iα was added to the bath solution in the presence of ATP (1 mm) plus cGMP (0.1 mm), cslo-α channel activity significantly (p < 0.05) increased (Fig. 6,A and C). Wash out of PKG led to a return of channel activity to the control level (Fig. 6 C). PKG had no effect on the unitary conductance of cslo-α channels (control 253 ± 9.7; PKG + ATP + cGMP, 252 ± 8.3; wash-out, 248 ± 8.6 pS, n = 10, p > 0.05). Activation of PKG may indirectly activate BKCa channels through other kinases or related proteins. To clarify this point, we made a point mutation on the cslo-α channel. The amino acid sequence of cslo-α has only one optimal consensus sequence for PKG phosphorylation at Ser-1072. Thus a point mutation of cslo-α was created in which Ser-1072 was replaced by Ala. The general characteristics of mutatedcslo-α channels is shown in Fig.7, A–C. The mutated cslo-α channel was activated by membrane depolarization, and its conductance (247.2 ± 13 pS,n = 10) was not different (p > 0.05) from that of wild-type cslo-α channels. Increases in Ca2+ concentration at the cytosolic surface activated the channel in a concentration-dependent manner. These characteristics of the mutated cslo-α channel were comparable with wild-type cslo-α channels. However, application of PKG-Iα in the presence of ATP (1 mm) plus cGMP (0.1 mm) was without effect on mutatedcslo-α channel activity (n = 10; Fig. 7,D and E). The single channel conductance of thecslo-α channel was also unchanged by PKG (n = 10; Fig. 7 F). SNP also had no effect on mutated cslo-α channel activity in cell-attached patches (NPo: control, 0.049 ± 0.042; SNP, 0.054 ± 0.051,n = 6, p > 0.05). This study provides direct evidence that cloned BKCachannels expressed in HEK cells can be activated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Activation required ATP and cGMP, suggesting that PKG stimulates BKCa channels through phosphorylation. Mutation of cslo-α at Ser-1072, the only optimal consensus phosphorylation site for PKG on cslo-α, abolished the stimulatory effect of PKG on cslo-α channels. These results indicate that PKG activates cslo-α channels through direct phosphorylation at Ser-1072. Native outward currents in HEK cells were small and inhibited by 4-aminopyridine but not by IBTX, suggesting that these currents were largely because of delayed rectifier-type K+ channels with little contribution from BKCa channels. This result agrees with another recent study of these cells (45Yu S.P. Kerchner G.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Several kinds of Cl− channels also contribute to native HEK cell currents (46Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, under the conditions of our experiments, both delayed rectifier and chloride currents were minimal compared with currents recorded in cells transfected with cslo-α. Whole cell outward currents recorded in transfected cells were blocked by IBTX and exhibited a voltage dependence comparable with native BKCachannel currents. cslo-α channel activity recorded in single channel mode was enhanced by membrane depolarization and by increases in Ca2+ concentration at the cytosolic surface. Half-maximal activation of cslo-α for Ca2+ at +40 mV was 10−5m. This Ca2+sensitivity is comparable with the sensitivity observed by others when only slo-α is expressed (3Toro L. Wallner M. Merra P. Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar, 39Zhou X.B. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Korth M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but is 10 to 20 times less than the Ca2+ sensitivity observed whenslo-α is co-expressed with the β-subunit (27Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar) or when native BKCa channel currents are recorded (47Carl A. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C470-C480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the single channel conductance of cslo-α (253 pS) was similar to that of native BKCa channels. These results indicate that cslo-α current expressed in HEK cells exhibits functional features of native BKCa channels in smooth muscle cells. In this study, SNP activated whole cell BKCa channel currents and increased NPo of cslo-α channels in cell-attached patches without a change in single channel conductance. There are three possible mechanisms by which SNP could activate thecslo-α channel. First, NO derived from SNP may directly activate the cslo-α channel (12Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 39Zhou X.B. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Korth M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Second, NO may activate PKG, which then leads to direct phosphorylation of thecslo-α channel. Third, activation of PKG by NO may lead to stimulation of a phosphatase (possibly phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A), which dephosphorylates the channel (39Zhou X.B. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Korth M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 48White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the mechanism involved in activation of cslo is dependent upon the NO donor used. In the case of SNP, activation ofcslo appears to be because of a PKG-dependent mechanism without an appreciable contribution from the direct activation of channels by NO. This conclusion was reached because 1) SNP was without affect when applied to the cytosolic surface of the membrane in inside-out patches, 2) the stimulatory effect of SNP was blocked by the PKG inhibitor KT5823 in cell-attached patch recordings, and 3) SNP was without effect on mutated cslo-α channel activity. Further support for this conclusion comes from studies by other laboratories suggesting that the cGMP-PKG pathway is functional in HEK cells (49Dinerman J.L. Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V. Snyder S.H. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 50Bischof G. Serwold T.F. Machen T.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In contrast to SNP, the effect of DETA/NO was not blocked by the PKG inhibitor KT 5823, suggesting that this NO-donor may have direct effects upon the cslo-α channel. This conclusion is in good agreement with studies by Zhou et al.(39Zhou X.B. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Korth M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) who recently reported that hslo-α channels expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells are directly activated by NO derived from diethylamine/NO via S-nitrosylation. The differences between SNP and DETA/NO may be because of the differences in the redox state of NO generated by these NO-donors as suggested by others (44Goyal R.K. He X.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1185-G1192PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experiments were undertaken to distinguish between direct PKG-mediated phosphorylation of the channel versus more indirect effects of PKG. Exposure of the cytosolic surface of inside-out patches to PKG-Iα in the presence of ATP plus cGMP increased NPo of cslo-α channels as previously reported for native BK channels (10Robertson B.E. Schubert R. Hescheler J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C299-C303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Alioua A. Huggins J.P. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L1057-L1063PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the action of PKG involves a phosphorylation event. In a previous study by our laboratory using cslo-α (27Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar) and a study using hslo-α channels (24Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P.F. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) expressed in oocytes, PKG did not activate slochannels, although, interestingly, PKG-induced regulation was observed when the hslo-channels were reconstituted in a lipid bilayer (24Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P.F. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In our studies, neither ATP alone nor ATP plus cGMP increased the activity of channels, suggesting that significant quantities of PKG are not bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the isolated patch. This result differs from a study by Fujino et al. (14Fujino K. Nakaya S. Wakatsuki T. Miyoshi Y. Nakaya Y. Mori H. Inoue I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 371-377PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that cGMP plus ATP increased BKCa channel activity in isolated patches of porcine coronary artery myocytes. However, it is in agreement with studies of vascular (7Taniguchi J. Furukawa K.I. Shigekawa M. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Robertson B.E. Schubert R. Hescheler J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C299-C303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tracheal (36Yamakage M. Hirshman C.A. Croxton T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L338-L345PubMed Google Scholar) smooth muscles in which cGMP plus ATP were without affect in isolated patches. These disparate results suggest that mammalian expression systems and different smooth muscle preparations may contain differing amounts of bound PKG. PKG has been reported to phosphorylate many proteins that regulate smooth muscle tone (21Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 129-137PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that PKG could regulate BKCa channel activity indirectly by phosphorylating a protein that then regulates channel activity. A particularly intriguing target in this regard are phosphatases that could regulate channel activity through dephosphorylation (39Zhou X.B. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Korth M. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 48White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 53Zhou X.B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19760-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKG directly acts on the channel or, alternatively, requires some intermediary protein, we mutated the single optimal consensus sequence for PKG phosphorylation in the carboxyl-terminal region of thecslo-α channel (i.e. KKSS at 1069–1072). Mutation of Ser-1072 abolished PKG-induced modulation of channel activity but did not change the electrophysiological characteristics of the channel. The mutated cslo-α channels exhibited all of the features described for wild-type channels, i.e. they were activated by membrane depolarization and by elevation of Ca2+ on the cytosolic side of the membrane and had the same single channel conductance as the wild-type cslo-α channel. Thus, the lack of effect of PKG on mutated channels could not be attributed to general channel dysfunction. These mutation experiments suggest that PKG enhances channel activity through direct phosphorylation of the channel rather than requiring the actions of a phosphatase. In studies of reconstituted hslo-α channels, it was also concluded that activation of channels by PKG involved phosphorylation rather than dephosphorylation (24Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P.F. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cloned human slo channel hslo-α has the same optimal consensus phosphorylation site as cslo-α, and this channel has been reported to be directly phosphorylated by PKG-Iα (24Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P.F. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In summary, we have found that the cslo-α channel activity recorded in whole cell and single channel configuration is increased by the NO donor SNP, presumably through activation of PKG. Direct application of PKG-Iα also activated cslo-α channels but only in the presence of ATP and cGMP. A point mutation at the only optimal consensus phosphorylation site for PKG on cslo-α abolished the stimulatory effects of PKG. From these results we conclude that PKG activates cslo-α channel by direct phosphorylation at serine 1072. We are grateful to N. Horowitz for help with the cell cultures. We also thank L. Toro for providing their paper in press."

In addition, β-arrestins play a central role in mediating GPCR endocytosis, a key regulatory step in receptor resensitization. In this study, we visualize the intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin2 in response to activation of several distinct GPCRs including the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR), dopamine D1A receptor (D1AR), endothelin type A receptor (ETAR), and neurotensin receptor (NTR). Our results reveal that in response to β2AR activation, β-arrestin2 translocation to the plasma membrane shares the same pharmacological profile as described for receptor activation and sequestration, consistent with a role for β-arrestin as the agonist-driven switch initiating receptor endocytosis. Whereas redistributed β-arrestins are confined to the periphery of cells and do not traffic along with activated β2AR, D1AR, and ETAR in endocytic vesicles, activation of AT1AR and NTR triggers a clear time-dependent redistribution of β-arrestins to intracellular vesicular compartments where they colocalize with internalized receptors. Activation of a chimeric AT1AR with the β2AR carboxyl-terminal tail results in a β-arrestin membrane localization pattern similar to that observed in response to β2AR activation. In contrast, the corresponding chimeric β2AR with the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail gains the ability to translocate β-arrestin to intracellular vesicles. These results demonstrate that the cellular trafficking of β-arrestin proteins is differentially regulated by the activation of distinct GPCRs. Furthermore, they suggest that the carboxyl-tail of the receptors might be involved in determining the stability of receptor/βarrestin complexes and cellular distribution of β-arrestins. β-Arrestins are multifunctional proteins identified on the basis of their ability to bind and uncouple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) from heterotrimeric G proteins.

At least in the case of the β2AR, the agonist-dependent sequestration of the receptor to an endosomal compartment not only promotes receptor dephosphorylation but is essential for the re-establishment of normal receptor responsiveness (5Zhang J.

Recent studies suggest that β-arrestins participate in GPCR sequestration by directing receptors to clathrin-coated vesicles (4Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L.

However, while the phenomenon of β-arrestin cellular trafficking is potentially important for understanding mechanisms underlying GPCR internalization and resensitization, the detailed pharmacology of the receptor-mediated β-arrestin redistribution has never been characterized. As a consequence, it is not clear whether the pharmacological profile of β-arrestin translocation recapitulates the pharmacology described for GPCR endocytosis. Moreover, the cellular fate of β-arrestin proteins following association with various GPCRs also remains unknown, as well as where and when β-arrestins dissociate from each receptor. In the case of rhodopsin, it was demonstrated that the interaction of visual arrestin with rhodopsin prevented the dephosphorylation and resensitization of the receptor (20Palczewski K. McDowell J.H.

Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the dissociation of the β-arrestin/receptor complex contributes to the regulation of responsiveness for other GPCRs. In the present study, we used a green fluorescent protein conjugate of β-arrestin2 (βarr2GFP) (18Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) to examine the cellular trafficking of β-arrestin upon stimulation of several distinct GPCRs. Our data demonstrate that the pharmacology of β-arrestin2 translocation in living cells could account for the agonist dependence of β2AR sequestration. Moreover, β-arrestin2 was observed to redistribute to distinct subcellular locations in response to activation of different GPCRs. This differential redistribution of β-arrestins likely involves the function of the carboxyl-terminal region of the receptors. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were provided by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Tissue culture media and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Isoproterenol and dopamine were purchased from Research Biochemicals International. Endothelin and neurotensin were from Peninsula Laboratories, and angiotensin II was from Sigma. Rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Babco and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Sigma, and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fabs was obtained commercially from Organon Teknika. [125I]Cyanopindolol was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. β-Arrestin1 with GFP conjugated to its COOH terminus (βarr1GFP) was constructed in a manner similar to βarr2GFP (18Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) by replacing the terminal stop codon of β-arrestin1 with aSalI restriction site and inserting the modified cDNA in frame into the polylinker of p(S65T)GFP-N3 (CLONTECH) (18Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-AT1A R-β2AR-CT and pcDNA1-Amp-β2AR-AT1AR-CT were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. The chimeric AT1AR with the β2AR carboxyl-terminal tail (AT1AR-β2AR-CT) contains the first 302 amino acids (Met1–Tyr302) of the AT1AR fused to the last 87 amino acids (Cys327–Leu413) of the β2AR. The chimeric β2AR with the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail (β2AR-AT1AR-CT) includes the first 348 amino acids (Met1–Lys348) of the β2AR fused to the last 38 amino acids (Ala324–Glu359) of the AT1AR. The sequences of the DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). The cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transiently transfected with the cDNAs described in the figure legends by a modified calcium phosphate method (22Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Following transfection (∼18 h), the cells were incubated with fresh medium and allowed to recover 7–9 h before being reseeded into 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek) or into six-well dishes (Falcon) containing or not containing 22-mm square glass coverslips coated with collagen (Sigma). The use of HEK 293 cells expressing β2AR-GFP was described previously (23Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). β2AR expression was measured by saturating [125I]cyanopindolol binding done at 30 °C for 60 min (24Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The expression of other receptors was measured by flow cytometry and normalized according to the β2AR expression measured at the same time by both flow cytometry and saturating binding (16Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The receptor expression levels was between 2000 and 4000 fmol/mg of whole cell protein for the experiments assessing β-arrestin translocation with confocal microscope (see below) and between 1000 and 2000 fmol/mg of whole cell protein for all other experiments. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope using either Zeiss 40 × 1.3 or Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lenses. For characterizing the pharmacology of β-arrestin translocation in living cells, HEK 293 cells expressing β2AR and low levels of βarr2GFP were plated on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes and kept warm at 30 °C in serum-free MEM on a heated microscope stage. βarr2GFP fluorescent signals were collected sequentially using the Zeiss LSM software time scan function in the photon counting mode using single line excitation (488 nm). Drugs were applied to the cells either prior to or during the scanning of βarr2GFP labeled cells. For studying β-arrestin trafficking in response to activation of other receptors, HEK 293 cells expressing the receptor of interest and low levels of βarr2GFP were seeded on 22-mm square glass coverslips, stimulated with saturating concentrations of drugs at 30 °C for 1 h or as indicated, and then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. βarr2GFP fluorescent signals were collected using single line excitation (488 nm). Colocalization studies of βarr2GFP and rhodamine-labeled receptor fluorescence were performed using dual excitation (488, 568 nm) and emission (515–540 nm, GFP; 590–610 nm, rhodamine) filter sets. Specificity of labeling and absence of signal cross-over were established by examination of single-labeled samples. For performing colocalization studies of βarr2GFP and rhodamine-labeled β2AR in live cells, HEK 293 cells expressing HA epitope-tagged β2AR and βarr2GFP grown on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes were incubated in serum-free MEM containing anti-HA polyclonal antibody at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold MEM and incubated for 30 min on ice in the presence of rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fabs. Cells were washed an additional three times with serum-free MEM at 30 °C and imaged by confocal microscopy as described above. For studying colocalization of βarr2GFP and AT1AR, HEK 293 cells expressing HA epitope-tagged AT1AR were grown on 22-mm square glass coverslips and incubated in serum-free MEM containing rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody on ice for 45 min. Cells were then washed, stimulated with a saturating concentration (500 nm) of angiotensin II for 1 h, washed again, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and imaged by confocal microscopy as described above. The changes in βarr2GFP distribution to the plasma membrane were analyzed with IP Labs software. The magnitude of βarr2GFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane were determined by integration of the fluorescence signal along the cell perimeter. The relative magnitude of βarr2GFP distribution along a linear slice of the cell was quantitated by the line scan function provided with the Zeiss LSM 410 image analysis software. βarr2GFP translocation time course and dose-response curves were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. All data points represent the mean ± S.D. As described previously (18Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), in the absence of receptor activation βarr2GFP fluorescence was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and exhibited no apparent enhanced plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1,A and C; control). However, upon agonist-activation of the β2AR, a time-dependent rapid redistribution of βarr2GFP to the plasma membrane occurred (Fig. 1,A and B). The time course of β-arrestin translocation determined here, t 1/2 = 2.3 min (Fig. 1 B), followed β2AR phosphorylation (t 1/2 = 15–40 s) (24Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6201-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and preceded β2AR internalization (t 1/2 = 10 min) (4Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). At first βarr2GFP appeared diffusely at the plasma membrane, but with time a punctate pattern became apparent. Moreover, the redistribution of βarr2GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane was agonist dose-dependent (Fig. 1,C and D). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of agonist was calculated to be 6 nm (Fig. 1 D), a value comparable to that reported for β2AR sequestration in HEK 293 cells (11 nm) (24Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). No significant βarr2GFP translocation in response to agonist exposure was observed in cells lacking overexpressed β2AR (data not shown). To further test the agonist specificity of βarr2GFP translocation, cells were treated 5 min with 1 μm isoproterenol to induce βarr2GFP translocation and then exposed to a saturating concentration of the antagonist propranolol in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 1 E). Following the treatment of cells with the antagonist, the distribution of βarr2GFP fluorescence reversed, with βarr2GFP redistributing over time from the plasma membrane back to the cytoplasm. However, the redistribution of βarr2GFP back into the cytoplasm was not immediate, but proceeded over a time course of 5–10 min consistent with previous reports describing agonist-dependent and independent steps of receptor internalization (26von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the pharmacology of βarr2GFP translocation accurately reflected the agonist dependence of β2AR sequestration, these results suggest that β-arrestin translocation and receptor binding serve as the agonist-dependent switch triggering endocytosis of the β2AR. While βarr2GFP was observed to translocate to the plasma membrane and cluster at coated pits (18Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), βarr2GFP labeling of intracellular endocytic vesicles following β2AR activation was never observed. The overall distribution pattern of βarr2GFP appeared different from that of a GFP-conjugated β2AR (23Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, A and B). In response to agonist stimulation, the β2AR-GFP redistributed from a diffuse plasma membrane localization to a membrane-associated vesiculated pattern, followed by the appearance of β2AR-GFP in endocytic vesicles randomly distributed throughout the cytosol of the cell (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we examined the agonist-induced intracellular trafficking of both the β2AR and βarr2GFP in the same living cells. To do this, β2ARs engineered with an amino-terminal HA epitope tag were expressed in HEK 293 cells with βarr2GFP and labeled with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies, which were themselves labeled with rhodamine-conjugated anti- Fabs. β2ARs labeled in this manner were still able to respond normally to agonist activation (Fig. 2 C). In the absence of agonist, β2AR immunofluorescence (red) was localized solely to the plasma membrane, whereas βarr2GFP fluorescence (green) was limited to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C). In response to agonist activation of β2ARs, βarr2GFP translocated to the receptors at the plasma membrane. This was followed by the redistribution of both the receptors and β-arrestin to clathrin-coated pits, as denoted by the appearance of yellow hot spots (Fig. 2 C). However, whileyellow vesicles could be observed close to the membrane surface, no colocalization of βarr2GFP with β2AR-bearing vesicles was ever observed in the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 2 C). A similar agonist-mediated redistribution of βarr1GFP to plasma membrane-localized β2AR, but not β2AR localized in endocytic vesicles, was also observed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that β2AR/β-arrestin complex dissociates at or close to the plasma membrane, and therefore β-arrestins are excluded from endocytic vesicles shortly following their formation. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that although the AT1AR can utilize a distinct endocytic mechanism, overexpression of exogenous β-arrestins mobilizes the receptor for internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis similar to that utilized by the β2AR (16Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction of β-arrestin with the AT1AR, receptor-mediated βarr2GFP trafficking was examined in HEK 293 cells co-expressing the AT1AR and βarr2GFP. The cells were stimulated with angiotensin II for various periods of time at 30 °C and observed under confocal microscope. Similar to that observed with the β2AR, βarr2GFP was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the absence of agonist, but underwent a rapid translocation to the plasma membrane in response to AT1AR activation (Fig.3 A). However, activation of the AT1AR for a longer period of time (>4 min) resulted in a clear redistribution of βarr2GFP to intracellular endocytic vesicles. βarr1GFP was also observed to undergo a similar redistribution to AT1AR-containing endocytic vesicles. 2R. Oakley, personal communication. With time, the βarr2GFP-containing vesicular structures grew in size and were mobilized to cluster at the perinuclear region of the cells (Fig.3 A). In contrast, under parallel conditions, βarr2GFP remained confined to the plasma membrane even when the β2AR was activated by isoproterenol for 1 h (Fig. 3 B). To further confirm that the redistribution of β-arrestins is receptor-driven, we examined the localization of agonist-activated AT1AR and βarr2GFP in the same HEK 293 cells. To do this, AT1ARs engineered with an amino-terminal HA epitope tag were expressed in HEK 293 cells with βarr2GFP and labeled with rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies. When the cells were activated by angiotensin II, an agonist-dependent colocalization of AT1AR red immunofluorescence and βarr2GFP green fluorescence was observed and persisted for up to 1 h, as reflected by the predominant intracellular yellow vesicular structures located at the perinuclear region (Fig.4). These data demonstrate a functional interaction between the AT1AR and β-arrestin proteins. In addition, our results also indicate that, unlike the β2AR/β-arrestin complex, the AT1AR/β-arrestin complex remains intact and is mobilized to the interior of the cell driven by receptor internalization.Figure 4Colocalization of the AT1AR and βarr2GFP following stimulation by angiotensin II. Confocal visualization of the intracellular distribution and colocalization (overlay) of βarr2GFP (green) with 12CA5 epitope-tagged AT1ARs (red) labeled at 4 °C with rhodamine-conjugated 12CA5 monoclonal antibody in HEK 293 cells. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pGFP-N3/βarr2 and 5 μg of 12CA5 epitope-tagged AT1AR in pcDNA1-Amp. Shown are representative confocal microscopic images of AT1AR and βarr2GFP distribution following AT1AR activation with 500 nm angiotensin II at 30 °C for 1 h. The experiment was performed on two different occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since the activation of β2AR and AT1AR promoted β-arrestin trafficking to distinct subcellular locations, we examined the redistribution of βarr2GFP in response to activation of several other GPCRs to address the generality of the two different β-arrestin translocation patterns. To do this, βarr2GFP was co-expressed in HEK 293 cells with different GPCRs including dopamine D1A receptor (D1AR), endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) and neurotensin receptor (NTR). As shown in Fig. 5, in response to activation of the D1AR and the ETAR, βarr2GFP underwent a rapid membrane translocation and remained in a punctate pattern at the periphery of the cells for as long as 1 h, similar to that observed following β2AR stimulation. In contrast, in HEK 293 cells overexpressing the NTR, neurotensin stimulation resulted in the redistribution of βarr2GFP fluorescence to intracellular vesicular structures with a pattern reminiscent of that observed following AT1AR activation. Therefore, different GPCRs either separate from β-arrestins at the level of plasma membrane or internalize with β-arrestin in intracellular vesicles. This property appears independent of both the types of G protein-coupling and agonists. Previous studies of GPCR internalization have suggested that the carboxyl-terminal region is important for receptor interaction with β-arrestins (4Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether the carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptors contributes to the differential trafficking of β-arrestin, we engineered chimeric mutants of the AT1AR and β2AR with their carboxyl-terminal region exchanged for that of the other. Like the wild-type AT1AR and β2AR, the chimeric AT1AR and β2AR mutants (namely AT1AR-β2AR-CT and β2AR-AT1AR-CT) underwent rapid internalization in response to agonist stimulation (Fig.6 B). However, when co-expressed with βarr2GFP, angiotensin II activation of the AT1AR-β2AR-CT did not result in β-arrestin trafficking to intracellular vesicles, but rather resulted in a β-arrestin membrane localization pattern similar to that observed in response to β2AR activation (Fig.6 A). In fact, βarr2GFP fluorescence was retained at the plasma membrane for up to 1 h and was never localized to intracellular vesicular structures in response to activation of the chimeric AT1AR mutant. In contrast, the corresponding β2AR chimeric mutant with AT1AR carboxyl-tail displayed “AT1AR-like” phenotype and acquired the ability to mediate β-arrestin translocation to intracellular vesicles (Fig. 6 A). In addition, a β2AR-βarr2GFP fusion protein with βarr2GFP attached to the carboxyl terminus of the β2AR was also localized to large intracellular vesicular structures similar to the vesicular population containing βarr2GFP following AT1AR stimulation (Fig.6 C). These results demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal region of the receptors is involved in determining the mode of interaction of the receptors with β-arrestin proteins, and subsequently the agonist-dependent redistribution of β-arrestins. In the present work, we use green fluorescent protein-conjugated β-arrestin2 to study the cellular trafficking of β-arrestin proteins in response to several different GPCRs in both living and fixed cells. By doing so, we show that the pharmacology of β-arrestin translocation underlies the inherent agonist dependence of β2AR endocytosis. More interestingly, our results demonstrate that the cellular fate of β-arrestin2 (or β-arrestin1) is differentially regulated following activation of distinct GPCRs. A popular assumption in the field has been that β-arrestins are associated with internalized receptors in intracellular vesicles (reviewed in Refs. 21Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, and 28Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). While this appears to be true for some receptors such as the AT1AR and NTR, we found that in the case of the β2AR, D1AR, and ETAR, β-arrestins do not traffic with the receptors to endosomes and appear to dissociate from receptor-bearing vesicles shortly following their formation. In addition, swapping of the carboxyl-terminal regions between the AT1AR and β2AR switches the phenotype of both receptors in terms of their ability to mobilize plasma membrane-associated β-arrestin to cytosolic vesicular structures. This indicates that the carboxyl-terminal region of the receptors is important in determining receptor/β-arrestin association and receptor-mediated β-arrestin cellular distribution to the plasma membrane and/or endosomes. Considerable effort has been expended to uncover receptor endocytic motifs underlying the agonist-dependent endocytosis of GPCRs. The expectation was that discrete amino acid motifs on the GPCRs, similar in function to those utilized by single transmembrane spanning receptors, would be identified (21Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 29Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem.

However, the matching pharmacology for β-arrestin translocation and β2AR sequestration described here strongly indicates that β-arrestin binding replaces the exposure of discrete amino acid motifs as the agonist-driven switch regulating receptor endocytosis. In contrast, the agonist dependence of the endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases is thought to involve the exposure of tyrosine-containing motifs on the receptors (30Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F.

Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). It is likely that the effect of agonist binding to the receptor is to induce an intramolecular rearrangement of multiple intracellular GPCR domains. This results in a generalized receptor conformation that is necessary to promote GRK phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding. Interestingly, this conformational requirement may account for the failure of some opioid agonists to induce the sequestration of the mu opioid receptor and the sequestration defect described for the β2AR-Y326A mutant (11Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 24Ferguson S.S. Menard L.

Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments using β2AR/β3AR chimeric receptors showed that normal sequestration of the resulting chimeras required the swapping of several intracellular domains, including the first and second intracellular loops and the carboxyl tail between the two receptor proteins (36Jockers R. Da Silva A. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9355-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that the endocytic switching function of β-arrestins is related to their role in receptor desensitization, i.e. the binding to and uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein. Once receptors are bound to β-arrestin, they then gain the ability to traffic to clathrin-coated pits. Indeed, photobleaching experiments of β2AR-GFP in HEK 293 cells suggest that desensitized receptors (i.e.complexed with β-arrestins) are free moving in the plasma membrane and that their movement to coated pits is not rate-limiting for β2AR endocytosis (23Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction of β-arrestin with the β2AR represents the initiating event for receptor endocytosis. Whereas there is growing evidence supporting β-arrestins as a general endocytic intermediate for many GPCRs, it is somewhat surprising that β-arrestins do not traffic to the same cellular compartments upon activation of distinct receptors. The internalization of β-arrestin with some GPCRs but not with others suggests that the properties of β-arrestin/receptor interactions differ for different GPCRs. For example, in the case of the α2-adrenergic receptor, β-arrestins were demonstrated to bind to the third intracellular loop, whereas β-arrestin interactions with the β2AR appear to involve multiple receptor domains including the receptor carboxyl terminus (36Jockers R. Da Silva A. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9355-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, peptide inhibition studies suggest that the third and, to a lesser extent, the first intracellular loops of rhodopsin may play an important role in arrestin binding to light-activated forms of rhodopsin (38Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, these differences are highlighted by the ability of β-arrestin2 to internalize with the AT1AR and NTR, but not the β2AR, D1AR, and ETAR. In the case of the AT1AR, it appears that the carboxyl-terminal tail contributes directly to β-arrestin interactions. While it is plausible that these differences are the consequence of the high affinity and slow off-rate of peptidic ligands that might trap receptors in a conformation favoring stable β-arrestin binding, the observation that the ETAR do not internalize with β-arrestin bound does not support this apparently simple explanation. Rather, the present experiments with an AT1AR-β2AR carboxyl-terminal tail chimera as well as a β2AR-AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail chimera suggest that these differences appear to be regulated by differences in either the tertiary structure or β-arrestin-interacting sequences in the carboxyl-terminal domains of these receptors. Presumably, the carboxyl-terminal domain in conjunction with other intracellular receptor domains determines the relative stability of receptor/β-arrestin complexes. In a previous study, we have reported that, although the AT1AR is capable of utilizing a dynamin- and β-arrestin-independent endocytic pathway, co-expression of β-arrestins significantly increases the level of dynamin-dependent AT1AR internalization (16Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This suggests that the AT1AR has the ability to directly interact with β-arrestins. In this study, using the GFP-conjugated β-arrestin2, we were able to visualize an agonist-dependent co-trafficking of the receptor with β-arrestins to endocytic vesicles. This represents the first direct demonstration of AT1AR association with β-arrestins. As GRKs were shown to phosphorylate and desensitize the AT1AR (39Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it is probable that, similar to their role in β2AR function, β-arrestins also play an important role in AT1AR regulation by binding to the GRK-phosphorylated form of the receptor. In addition to the AT1AR and β2AR, we also visualized the trafficking of several other receptors with β-arrestins, including the D1R, ETAR, and NTR. The activation of the NTR resulted in an “AT1AR-like” β-arrestin distribution pattern, whereas the activation of the other two receptors triggered a membrane localization of β-arrestins similar to that observed for the β2AR. These observations indicate that, while GPCR/arrestin interactions represent a general GPCR regulatory mechanism, the stability of receptor/β-arrestin complexes differs from receptor to receptor. The binding of arrestin proteins to GRK-phosphorylated GPCRs serves to desensitize various GPCRs, following which, the agonist-promoted receptor internalization is proposed to contribute to receptor dephosphorylation and resensitization (21Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 40Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Jaber M. Giros B. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Receptors Channels. 1997; 5: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). A critical step leading to effective GPCR dephosphorylation and resensitization is the dissociation of the GPCR/arrestin complex, since dephosphorylation of rhodopsin was demonstrated to be blocked when the receptor is arrestin-bound (20Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Jakes S. Ingebritsen T.S. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15770-15773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that β-arrestins dissociate from the β2AR shortly following the redistribution of β-arrestins to coated pits. This early dissociation of GPCR/β-arrestin complexes is presumably appropriate to allow the β2AR to associate with receptor phosphatase and dephosphorylate in early endosomes (15Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for GPCRs that internalize with β-arrestins bound, it might be expected that the kinetics of dephosphorylation of these receptors would be slower. While β-arrestin binding to receptors may be a general feature of GPCR regulation, our results suggest that the nature of this association or the stability of receptor/β-arrestin complex differs depending upon the receptor studied. Therefore, studies on the dissociation of receptor/β-arrestin complex should be valuable for understanding the mechanisms by which receptor desensitization and resensitization are achieved. The development of mutant or chimeric receptors with altered ability to interact with β-arrestins should greatly facilitate this goal. We thank Sobha Budduluri for expert technical assistance."

The 165-amino acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) is a mitogen for endothelial cells and a potent angiogenic factor in vivo. Heparin binds to VEGF165 and enhances its binding to VEGF receptors. However, native HSPGs that bind VEGF165 and modulate its receptor binding have not been identified. Among the glypicans, glypican-1 is the only member that is expressed in the vascular system. We have therefore examined whether glypican-1 can interact with VEGF165. Glypican-1 from rat myoblasts binds specifically to VEGF165 but not to VEGF121. The binding has an apparent dissociation constant of 3 × 10−10m. The binding of glypican-1 to VEGF165 is mediated by the heparan sulfate chains of glypican-1, because heparinase treatment abolishes this interaction. Only an excess of heparin or heparan sulfates but not other types of glycosaminoglycans inhibited this interaction. VEGF165 interacts specifically not only with rat myoblast glypican-1 but also with human endothelial cell-derived glypican-1. The binding of125I-VEGF165 to heparinase-treated human vascular endothelial cells is reduced following heparinase treatment, and addition of glypican-1 restores the binding. Glypican-1 also potentiates the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to a soluble extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor KDR/flk-1. Furthermore, we show that glypican-1 acts as an extracellular chaperone that can restore the receptor binding ability of VEGF165, which has been damaged by oxidation. Taken together, these results suggest that glypican-1 may play an important role in the control of angiogenesis by regulating the activity of VEGF165, a regulation that may be critical under conditions such as wound repair, in which oxidizing agents that can impair the activity of VEGF are produced, and in situations were the concentrations of active VEGF are limiting.

Recent studies in mammalian cells indicated that glypican-1 binds to members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family.

Furthermore, glypican-1 modulates the biological activities of these growth factors, and this modulation can be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the FGF type (11Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M.

Taken together, these findings indicate that the glypicans play an important regulatory role in the control of cellular growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are mitogens for endothelial cells and are potent angiogenic factors in vivo. Five VEGF isoforms, designated VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206, are generated via an alternative splicing mechanism from a unique gene (14Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The active form of the VEGFs is a homodimer, but active heterodimers have also been observed. Two VEGF tyrosine-kinase receptor types have been characterized. These tyrosine-kinase receptors do not differentiate between the various VEGF forms. The KDR/flk-1 receptor mediates the mitogenic activity of VEGF, whereas flt-1 stimulates VEGF-induced cell migration (17Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, endothelial cells express VEGF165-specific receptors of unknown function. These receptors do not bind VEGF121 or VEGF145 (16Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The best characterized VEGF forms are VEGF121 and VEGF165 (165- and 121-amino acid-long polypeptide, respectively). VEGF165 contains the peptide encoded by exon-7 of the VEGF gene, whereas VEGF121 lacks this peptide. The presence of exon-7 confers on VEGF165 the ability to bind heparin-like molecules. Removal of heparan sulfates (HS) from the surface of endothelial cells by heparinase digestion reduces the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to its receptors, and addition of heparin restores125I-VEGF165 binding. We have recently shown that part of the effect of heparin involves restoration of125I-VEGF165 binding to KDR/flk-1 by a chaperone-like effect that recuperates the biological activity of VEGF165 that was damaged by oxidizing agents (18Gitay-Goren H.

Such a role of heparin-like molecules may be important under conditions like wound repair, hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, or inflammation, in which oxidants or free radicals are produced and may damage VEGFs (19Schraufstatter I.U. Halsey W.A. Hyslop P.A. Cochrane C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Heck D.E. Laskin D.L. Gardner C.R. Laskin J.D. J. Biol.

Unlike VEGF165, VEGF121 is irreversibly inactivated by oxidizing reagents, and heparin cannot restore its receptor binding ability (18Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S.

Recent evidence strongly suggests that VEGFs play a critical role in the process of tumor angiogenesis. This process is essential for tumor progression and for the subsequent process of tumor metastasis. A number of molecules that display some structural similarity to heparin such as suramin and pentosan sulfate exert an anti-angiogenic effect. These observations, together with the findings that HS-degrading enzymes can inhibit tumor angiogenesis (22Sasisekharan R. Moses M.A. Nugent M.A. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggest that HSPGs play an important role in the angiogenic process. So far, HSPGs that can bind VEGFs and modulate their biological activities have not been identified. Among glypicans, glypican-1 is the only member expressed in the vascular system (23Rosenberg R.D.

We have therefore examined whether glypican-1 can interact with VEGFs and modulate their interaction with VEGF receptors. We show here that purified glypican-1 binds VEGF165 with high affinity and supports its binding to heparinase-treated endothelial cells. Furthermore, glypican-1 can also restore the receptor binding ability of oxidized VEGF165and can therefore be viewed as a native, cell surface-localized proteoglycan that displays a chaperone-like activity.

Enzymatic deglycosylation was carried out in PBS containing 125I-glypican-1 and 0.5 units/ml of heparinase I+III. Incubation was for 2 h at 37 °C. Degradation of the core protein of glypican-1 was carried out overnight with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml). To ensure that digestion was complete, a parallel incubation was carried out in the presence of radioiodinated glypican-1, and digestion was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The GAG side chains were then separated from the protease and degradation products by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography as described (11Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A.

The concentrations of glypican-1 are relative to its HS concentration, which accounts to about two-thirds of the total PG concentration (11Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A.

Prior to performing the study we examined the biological activity of glypican-1 by testing its ability to enhance binding of FGF-1 and FGF-2 to FGF receptor 1 and to modulate the biological activities of FGF-7 and FGF-1 as described previously (11Bonneh-Barkay D.

Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of the 125I-VEGF165 and the 125I-VEGF121 were about 105cpm/ng. Radiolabeled glypican-1 was separated from free iodine by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (11Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K.

Specific activities of iodinated glypican-1 were in range of 6–12 × 106 cpm/μg. Binding of radioiodinated glypican-1 to wells coated with VEGF165 and various other proteins was done essentially as described (35Gengrinovitch S. Greenberg S.M. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Rockwell P. Maione T.E. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15059-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μg of each protein in 100 μl of coating buffer were adsorbed to 96-well ELISA plates for 2 h at room temperature, and binding was performed with125I-glypican-1 for 2 h at room temperature. Free125I-glypican-1 was removed by three washes with wash buffer (35Gengrinovitch S. Greenberg S.M. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Rockwell P. Maione T.E. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15059-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Estimation of bound 125I-glypican-1 was done following solubilization with 0.2 m NaOH. All the experiments were done in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. Nonspecific binding was estimated as described under “Results,” and it was less than 10% of the total binding. Standard deviation between replicates in all the experiments was less than 10%. 35S-HSPGs were partially purified from conditioned medium of metabolically labeled HUVEC cells as described (11Bonneh-Barkay D.

The filters were blocked with coating buffer (35Gengrinovitch S. Greenberg S.M. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Rockwell P. Maione T.E. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

Following extensive washes, one filter was air dried and taken for autoradiography to confirm binding of radiolabeled HSPGs, and the remaining filters were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against human glypican-1 (monoclonal antibody S1) or with a anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) as described (36de Boeck H. Lories V. David G. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Detection of bound antibodies was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Binding and cross-linking of VEGFs to a soluble extracellular domain offlk-1 fused to secreted human alkaline phosphatase (designated flk/SEAP) was done as described previously (18Gitay-Goren H.

Binding and cross-linking to HUVEC cells was essentially performed as described previously, except that instead of using adherent cells, the binding was performed using cells in suspension. The cells were first treated with heparinase (0.5 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and then detached from the tissue culture dishes using PBS solution containing 2 mm EDTA. The cells were collected, washed twice with PBS and once with binding buffer, and then subjected to the binding assay. Following binding the cells were washed extensively with PBS, and cross-linking was performed in solution. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were loaded onto each lane. Oxidation of VEGF165 was performed essentially as described (18Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of growth factor in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) were incubated for 1 min with 0.1% of H2O2 in a final reaction volume of 40 μl. The reaction was terminated by sodium metabisulfite, and the growth factor was separated from the H2O2 and sodium metabisulfite using heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (recovery was over 90%). A solid phase assay was utilized to investigate the ability of glypican-1 to bind VEGF165 and VEGF121. Increasing concentrations of radioiodinated glypican-1 were bound to microtiter plates precoated with 0.2 μg/well of VEGF165 or VEGF121 as well as FGF-7, which was previously reported to bind glypican (11Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, only VEGF165and FGF-7 bind similarly to 125I-glypican, whereas VEGF121 or BSA did not exhibit any binding capacity. Binding was saturable and Scatchard analysis yielded an apparent dissociation constant of 1.2 × 10−10mfor VEGF165 and 3 × 10−10mfor FGF-7 (Fig. 1 B). To test the specificity of this interaction we measured the ability of a panel of proteins to compete with 125I-glypican for binding to VEGF165. As shown in Fig.2, all three FGF members inhibited binding. This finding is with accordance with the previously reported capacity of these growth factors to bind glypican (11Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). By contrast, VEGF121, insulin, transferrin, and BSA could not compete with 125I-glypican for binding to VEGF165. To determine whether glypican-1-derived GAGs are involved in VEGF165 binding, we prepared heparinase-digested or protease-digested glypican. Heparinase treatment abolished the ability of glypican-1 to compete with intact 125I-glypican-1 for binding to VEGF165, whereas the free glypican-1-derived GAGs competed with 125I-glypican-1 as efficiently as intact glypican-1 (Fig. 3 A). These findings suggest that the interaction of glypican-1 with VEGF is mediated by its GAG side chains. To further verify these findings we compared the ability of intact glypican, glypican-1-derived GAGs, heparin, commercial HS, and non-HS GAGs to inhibit the binding of glypican-1 to VEGF165. Glypican-1-derived HS inhibited the binding in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3 B). Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at a concentration of about 180 ng/ml glypican-1-derived HS. This concentration was 8-fold higher as compared with the heparin concentration required for half-maximal inhibition but about 10-fold lower than that of commercial HS. By contrast neither chondroitin sulfate nor hyaluronic acid were able to compete with glypican-1 for binding to VEGF165. These results establish that the HS side chains of glypican-1 mediate binding to VEGF165. VEGF165 binds to three VEGF receptors on HUVEC-derived endothelial cells (28Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger of these receptors is KDR/flk-1, whereas the identity of the other two is not yet known (18Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Heparin enhances the binding of VEGF165 to all three receptors (28Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin is not a normal constituent of endothelial cells, whereas glypican-1 is known to be expressed in these cells (24Mertens G. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. Vermylen J. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20435-20443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Ron, unpublished results. We have therefore examined whether glypican-1 can modulate the binding of VEGF165 to cell surface receptors in untreated and in heparinase-digested endothelial cells. Digestion of the endothelial cells by heparinase inhibited almost completely the binding of125I-VEGF165 to the two smaller receptors, whereas the binding to KDR/flk-1 (18Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was inhibited by about 80% (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Exogenously added glypican-1 restored the binding to all three receptors (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Glypican-1 also potentiated the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the two smaller receptors in untreated cells (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). The ability of glypican-1 to potentiate the binding of VEGF165 to KDR/flk-1 was also confirmed utilizing a soluble extracellular domain of this receptor (flk-1/SEAP) in a cell-free assay (26Tessler S. Rockwell P. Hicklin D. Cohen T. Levi B. Witte L. Lemischka I.R. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12456-12461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potentiation of125I-VEGF165 binding to the soluble receptor was concentration-dependent and was maximal at about 1 μg/ml of glypican-1 (Fig. 4 B). These findings wer"

However, the extent to which they are formed in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether D2/E2-isoprostanes undergo dehydration in vivo to form A2/J2-isoprostanes. Oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro generated a series of compounds that were confirmed to be A2/J2-isoprostanes by mass spectrometric analyses. A2/J2-isoprostanes were detected in vivo esterified to lipids in livers from normal rats at a level of 5.1 ± 2.3 ng/g, and levels increased dramatically by a mean of 24-fold following administration of CCl4. An A2-isoprostane, 15-A2t-isoprostane, was obtained and found to readily undergo Michael addition with glutathione and to adduct covalently to protein. A2/J2-isoprostanes could not be detected in the circulation, even following CCl4administration, which we hypothesized might be explained by rapid formation of adducts. This was supported by finding that essentially all the radioactivity excreted into the urine following infusion of radiolabeled 15-A2t-isoprostane into a human volunteer was in the form of a polar conjugate(s).

These compounds have attracted considerable attention because they exert unique biological actions. CP-PGs are actively incorporated into cells and accumulate in the nucleus (1Narumiya S. Ohno K.

Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar). They have been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation with a G1 cell cycle arrest and to induce differentiation, an effect that may be related to their ability to modulate a variety of growth-related and stress-induced genes (3Fukushima M.

Chegini N. Wittliff J.L. Exp. Cell Biol. 1987; 55: 18-27PubMed Google Scholar). CP-PGs can also activate nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and suppress macrophage activation and inflammatory responses (9Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M.

Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CP-PGs exhibit antiviral activity (12Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The common feature in these compounds is the presence of a reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group, which is very susceptible to nucleophilic addition reactions and seems to be essential for many of their biological effects (13Boyland E. Chasseaud L.F. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.

Although the biological effects exerted by CP-PGs have been studied in some detail, the extent to which they are formed in vivo has been the subject of continuing controversy for over 2 decades (16Attallah A. Payakkapan W. Lee J. Carr A. Brazelton E. Prostaglandins. 1974; 5: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Middledtich B.S. Prostaglandins. 1975; 9: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Jonsson H.T. Middleditch B.S. Schexnayder M.A. Desiderio D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 1-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fueling this controversy has always been the uncertainty as to what extent dehydration of PGE2 and PGD2 ex vivo during sample processing contributes to the amount of PGA2 and PGJ2 detected. Recently, Δ12-PGJ2 was definitively identified in human urine by Hayaishi and co-workers (19Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the amounts in urine from males were >2-fold higher than the amounts in urine from females. This is difficult to reconcile with the evidence suggesting that there is no sexual difference in the amount of PGD2 producedin vivo in humans (20Morrow J.D. Prakash C. Awad J.A. Duckworth T.A. Zakert W.E. Blair I.A. Oates J.A. Roberts II, L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Convincing evidence was presented that the Δ12-PGJ2 detected in urine unlikely arose as a result of dehydration of urinary PGD2 ex vivo during sample processing. However, it is difficult to know to what extent PGD2 may undergo dehydration in the genitourinary tract prior to voiding. This is of particular interest since the same authors recently reported that high levels of PGD synthase are present in human male reproductive organs and that seminal plasma greatly facilitates dehydration of PGD2 (21Tokugawa Y. Kunishige I. Kubota Y. Shimoya K. Nobunaga T. Kimura T. Saji F. Murata Y. Eguchi N. Oda H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they also recently reported that the level of PGD synthase in male urine is approximately twice that found in female urine (22Melegos D.M. Diamandis E.P. Oda H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 1984-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that at least some of the Δ12-PGJ2 detected in urine may have arisen from dehydration of PGD2 in the genitourinary tract and may explain the higher levels of Δ12-PGJ2 in urine from males. This does not confute the occurrence of Δ12-PGJ2 in human urine, but only raises the question of its origin, that being whether it arose from systemic sources or from local production in the genitourinary tract. Therefore, it still remains unclear whether CP-PGs are ubiquitously produced throughout the body. Free radicals have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of human disease processes (23Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar, 24Marinez-Cayuela M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the discovery of PG-like compounds, now termed isoprostanes (IsoPs), that are produced in vivo nonenzymatically as products of free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonoyl lipids (25Morrow J.D.

Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Our initial report described the formation of PGF2-like compounds (F2-IsoPs). Subsequently, we reported the finding that PGD2- and PGE2-like compounds (D2/E2-IsoPs) are also produced in abundance in vivo (27Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.Z. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the studies reported herein, we explored whether D2/E2-IsoPs undergo dehydration in vivo to produce CP-IsoPs (A2/J2-IsoPs). Our interest in this stems from the fact that such compounds may be identified as a new class of reactive compounds that are formed as products of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation that exert unique biological actions relevant to the pathobiology of oxidative stress. 8-Iso-[3H]PGA2, termed 15-A2t-IsoP according to the approved nomenclature for IsoPs (28Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), was obtained by treatment of 15-E2t-[3H]IsoP (8-iso-PGE2) (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) with 0.1 n HCl (29Fitzpatrick F.A.

Sci. 1977; 66: 1590-1595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), purified by normal phase HPLC, and analyzed by NMR for structural confirmation. A2/J2-IsoPs were analyzed by GC/NICI/MS using a modification of methods described for the analysis of other IsoPs (31Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 300: 3-12Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ng of [2H4]PGA2 was added to samples as an internal standard, after which compounds were partially purified using C18 and Silica Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters), methoximated, and converted to pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters. Compounds were then purified by chromatography on silica 60ALK6D TLC plates (Whatman) using a solvent system of hexane/acetone (70:30, v/v). Compounds migrating in the region from 0.5 cm below the PFB ester of PGJ2 to 1 cm above the PFB ester of PGA2 were scraped, extracted with ethyl acetate, converted to a trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivative, and then analyzed by GC/NICI/MS. The major ions generated in the NICI mass spectra of the PFB ester,O-methyloxime, TMS ether derivative of A2/J2-IsoPs and [2H4]PGA2 are the carboxylate anions at m/z 434 and m/z438, respectively. Quantitation was performed by integration of the peak areas. Treatment of PGA with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and piperidine has been shown to convert it to a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative, which is specific for A-ring prostanoids (32Rosello J. Gelpi E. J. Chromatogr. Sci. 1978; 6: 177-182Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed for the formation of this derivative with CP-IsoPs. PFB esters of putative CP-IsoPs were treated with a 1:1 mixture of BSTFA/piperidine for 1 h at 60 °C and analyzed by GC/NICI/MS monitoring of the carboxylate anions atm/z 562 for the IsoPs andm/z 566 for [2H4]PGA2. Putative A2/J2-IsoPs generated during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro were subjected to purification using two HPLC systems: (a) normal-phase HPLC on a 5-μm Econosil SI column using an isocratic solvent system of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (97:3:0.1, v/v/v) and (b) reversed-phase HPLC on a 5-μm Econosil C18 column using an isocratic solvent system of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (38:62:0.1, v/v/v). 15-A2t-[3H]IsoP was added prior to HPLC purification, and compounds that coeluted with 15-A2t-[3H]IsoP were then converted to a PFB ester, O-methyloxime, TMS ether derivative and analyzed by GC/electron ionization/MS. Analysis of D2/E2-IsoPs by GC/NICI/MS was performed as described (27Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.Z. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of D2/E2-IsoPs reported in this study differ from those in our previous reports (27Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.Z. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous reports, quantification was based on the intensity of a single prominent peak, whereas in this study, the integrated area under all peaks was used for quantification. Non-esterified arachidonic acid was dissolved in ethanol and then oxidized in 50 mm Tris buffer for 45 min using an iron/ADP/ascorbate oxidizing system as described (33Longmire A.W. Swift L.L. Roberts L.J. Awad J.A. Burk R.F. Morrow J.D Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine was prepared and oxidized in an identical fashion as non-esterified arachidonic acid at a concentration equivalent to 1 mg/ml arachidonic acid. After oxidation, the phospholipid was extracted and hydrolyzed as described below for liver phospholipids. Free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in liver was induced in rats by administration of CCl4 (25Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Two hours after treatment, animals were killed. Livers were then removed, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and either processed immediately or stored at –70 °C. Lipids from livers of CCl4-treated and control rats were extracted as described (31Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 300: 3-12Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were then hydrolyzed enzymatically using Apis mellifera bee venom phospholipase A2 (27Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.Z. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled 15-A2t-IsoP and PGA2 were incubated at 37 °C with GSH in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) in the presence of 19 units/ml glutathioneS-transferase (Sigma). The molar ratio of the prostanoids to GSH was 1:10. At the designated time points, aliquots were removed, acidified immediately to pH 3, and extracted twice with 2 volumes of methylene chloride. The formation of a GSH conjugate was assessed by determining the percent of radioactivity that did not extract into organic solvent (14Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We predetermined that 93 ± 4% (mean ± S.E.) of PGA extracts into methylene chloride from buffer solutions at pH 3. Control incubations were carried out in the absence of GSH and enzyme. Radiolabeled PGA2 and 15-A2t-IsoP were incubated at 37 °C with 20 mg/ml human serum albumin in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The molar ratio of prostanoids to albumin was 1:20. At the designated time points, aliquots were withdrawn, and 10 volumes of cold ethanol were immediately added to precipitate the albumin. The formation of covalent albumin adducts was assessed by determining the percent of radioactivity present in the albumin precipitate after centrifugation. Control incubations were carried out in the absence of albumin. After informed consent was obtained, a small tracer quantity (1 μCi) of 15-A2t-[3H]IsoP (150 Ci/mmol) was dissolved in 200 μl of ethanol, diluted to 10 ml with sterile saline, and infused over 10 min into the antecubital vein of a normal male volunteer. Individual voided urine specimens were collected over a period of 10 h and assayed for radioactivity. The formation of polar conjugates was assessed by determining the percent of radioactivity in a 1-ml aliquot of urine that did not extract into 2 volumes of methylene chloride at pH 3. Initially, we explored whether A2/J2-IsoPs are formed during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro(Fig. 1). In the upperm/z 434 chromatogram are multiple peaks with a similar retention time as the m/z 438 peaks representing the syn- andanti-O-methyloxime isomers of [2H4]PGA2 (lower chromatogram), consistent with the formation of CP-IsoPs. The amount of the compounds formed was 529 ± 135 ng/mg of arachidonic acid (mean ± S.E., n = 4). Additional analyses further supported the identity of these compounds as A2/J2-IsoPs. First, nom/z 433 peaks were present, indicating that them/z 434 peaks were not natural isotope peaks of compounds generating an ion less than m/z 434. When analyzed as [2H9]TMS ether andO-[2H3]methyloxime derivatives, all of the original m/z 434 peaks disappeared, and an identical pattern of new peaks appeared 9 and 3 Da higher, respectively (data not shown), indicating that all of the compounds had one hydroxyl and one carbonyl group. When analyzed following catalytic hydrogenation, there was a disappearance of them/z 434 peaks and the appearance of new intense peaks 6 Da higher at m/z 440 (Fig.2). No peaks were detected atm/z 436, 438, or 442. This indicated that the compounds contained three double bonds. In addition, analysis following treatment with BSTFA/piperidine resulted in the formation of a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative (Fig.3). The amount of A2/J2-IsoPs analyzed as this derivative was calculated to be 118 ± 32 ng/mg of arachidonic acid (mean ± S.E., n = 4), which is less than the amount formed when analyzed as an O-methyloxime, TMS ether derivative. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that we have found that, whereas treatment of PGA2 with BSTFA/piperidine efficiently converts it to the piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative, only trivial amounts of this derivative are formed with PGJ2. By analogy, therefore, only a portion of the mixture of A2/J2-IsoPs would be expected to form this derivative.Figure 3Analysis of A2/J2-IsoPs generated during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro as a PFB ester, piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative. The peaks in the m/z 566 chromatogram represent the [2H4]PGA2 internal standard. In the m/z 562 chromatogram are a series of peaks consistent with the formation of a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative of CP-IsoPs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further evidence for the identity of these compounds as CP-IsoPs was obtained by analyzing the compounds by electron ionization/MS to obtain complete mass spectra. Compounds were analyzed as a PFB ester,O-methyloxime, TMS ether derivative. One of the mass spectra obtained is shown in Fig. 4. As noted, a molecular ion is present at m/z 615. Other prominent ions are present at m/z 600 (M − 15, loss of ·CH3), m/z584 (M − 31, loss of ·OCH3),m/z 544 (M − 71, loss of ·CH2(CH2)3CH3),m/z 525 (M − 90, loss of Me3SiOH), m/z 494 (M − (90 + 31)), m/z 308 (M − 307, loss of ·CH2CH=CH(CH2)3COOC6F5),m/z 277 (M − (307 + 31)),m/z 218 (M − (307 + 90)),m/z 199 (+CH=CH–CH(Me3SiOH)(CH2)4CH3),m/z 181 (base) (+CH2C6F5), andm/z 173 (Me3SiO+=CH(CH2)4CH3). These ions or analogous ions and losses of other derivatives are also intense ions in the mass spectra of CP-PGs (34Pace-Asciak C.R. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 18: 1-565PubMed Google Scholar), 2Y. Chen, W. E. Zackert, L. J. Roberts II, and J. D. Morow unpublished data. indicating that this was a mass spectrum of a 15-series CP-IsoP in which the side chain hydroxyl is located at C-15. Although the structure depicted in Fig. 4is an A-ring IsoP, ions are not present that would allow a differentiation between an A-ring and a J-ring compound. We then explored whether CP-IsoPs are also formed in vivo. Previously, we showed that IsoPs are initially formed in situ esterified in tissue phospholipids (26Morrrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed for the presence of A2/J2-IsoPs esterified in livers from rats that had been treated with CCl4 to induce lipid peroxidation (Fig.5 A). Again, a series ofm/z 434 peaks were present similar to what was found following oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro, although the pattern of the peaks differed somewhat. This may be explained by our observation that there appears to be a steric influence of phospholipids on the formation of different IsoP isomers. In support of this notion, the pattern of peaks present following oxidation of arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine in vitro was found to be very similar to the pattern of peaks detected in esterified lipids in liver (Fig. 5 B). Further evidence for the identity of these compounds generated in vivo as A2/J2-IsoPs was obtained utilizing similar approaches used for the structural identification of the compounds formed in vitro. Analysis as a [2H9]TMS ether derivative, anO-[2H3]methyloxime derivative, and following catalytic hydrogenation indicated that all of the compounds had one hydroxyl group, one carbonyl, and three double bonds (data not shown). Furthermore, the compounds formed a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative (Fig.6), and the pattern of peaks was almost identical to that formed by the CP-IsoPs generated in vitro(Fig. 3), although the relative abundance of individual peaks differed somewhat. We then compared the relative amounts of A2/J2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs present in livers from both normal and CCl4-treated rats to determine the extent to which D2/E2-IsoPs undergo dehydration in vivo (Fig. 7). Of interest was the finding that A2/J2-IsoPs could be detected esterified in the livers of normal rats at a level of 5.1 ng/g of liver. Relative to the amounts of D2/E2-IsoPs measured, A2/J2-IsoPs were present at levels indicating that the extent to which D2/E2-IsoPs undergo dehydration in vivo is not inconsequential. Following administration of CCl4, the levels of both A2/J2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs increased dramatically and to a similar extent by a mean of 23.9- and 21.2-fold, respectively. We then carried out experiments to exclude the possibility that dehydration of D2/E2-IsoPs ex vivoduring sample processing contributed significantly to the levels measured in liver. That this was not the case was supported by the finding that <1% of either PGE2 or PGD2 that was added to a lipid extract of liver and then processed and analyzed had undergone dehydration to form PGA2 and PGJ2, respectively. Our major interest in the possibility that CP-IsoPs may be formedin vivo is because these compounds should be reactive molecules that are susceptible to nucleophilic addition reactions. Therefore, we compared the ability of one of the CP-IsoPs, 15-A2t-IsoP, and PGA2 to conjugate with GSH and adduct to protein, using albumin as a model. We recently showed that one of the E2-IsoPs that is produced in vivo is 15-E2t-IsoP (25Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Its dehydration product, 15-A2t-IsoP should therefore also be one of the CP-IsoPs that is produced in vivo. We initially determined the time course of conjugation of GSH with radiolabeled 15-A2t-IsoP and PGA2 in the presence of glutathioneS-transferase. Formation of GSH conjugates was assessed by determining the percent of radioactivity that did not extract into methylene chloride at pH 3. Approximately 70% of 15-A2t-IsoP had conjugated with GSH within 2 min, and the conjugation was complete by 8 min (Fig.8). The time course for the conjugation of PGA2 with GSH was found to be essentially identical. In the absence of glutathione S-transferase, no appreciable conjugation occurred with either compound over the same time period (data not shown). Similarly, the time course for the formation of covalent adducts with albumin was essentially identical for both PGA2 and 15-A2t-IsoP (Fig.9).Figure 9Time course of covalent adduction of 15-A2t-IsoP and PGA2 with albumin.Formation of the adducts was monitored over time and is expressed as the percent of total radioactivity present in the protein pellet following precipitation with cold ethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Following administration of CCl4 to rats, plasma concentrations of non-esterified F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs increase to very high levels (25Morrow J.D.

However, we unable to detect CP-IsoPs in the circulation of rats following administration of CCl4 in the experiments described above. We hypothesized that this may be due to rapid formation of polar conjugates, e.g. with GSH, following the hydrolysis of the compounds from phospholipids. To test this hypothesis, we infused a tracer quantity of radiolabeled 15-A2t-IsoP into a normal human volunteer and determined the percent of radioactivity excreted into the urine that did not extract into methylene chloride. Approximately 95% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted during the first 4 h following the infusion, representing ∼30% of the total amount of radioactivity infused. Only ∼5% of the radioactivity present in the urine was recovered in the organic extract, suggesting that all or almost all of the compounds were present in the form of a polar conjugate(s). We report the finding that PGA2- and PGJ2-like compounds are formed in vivo as products of the IsoP pathway. Important and interesting was the finding that these compounds not only were detected in abundant quantities esterified in rat livers following induction of an oxidant injury, but were also present in readily detectable quantities in the livers of normal rats. The discovery of the formation of CP-IsoPs opens up numerous new avenues for scientific inquiry. The reactive nature of these compounds conferred by the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety that characterizes these molecules provides a basis for hypotheses regarding their potential role in the pathogenesis of oxidant injury. As mentioned previously, CP prostanoids exert unique biological effects. They inhibit cellular proliferation via their ability to modulate a variety of growth-related and stress-induced genes, induce apoptotic cell death at higher concentrations, and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (3Fukushima M.

Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). The reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl seems essential for many of these biological actions (15Honn K.V. Marnett L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this regard, one might anticipate that all of the CP-IsoPs might exert similar biological effects, lessening the potential importance of elucidating the precise structures of individual compounds in the mixture. As shown in Fig. 8, PGA2 and 15-A2t-IsoP covalently adduct to protein. Interestingly, however, in intact cells, PGA2seems to preferentially bind to particular proteins, the functions of which remain to be elucidated (35Parker J. Prostaglandins. 1995; 50: 359-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, PGA2 and 15-A2t-IsoP also rapidly undergo glutathione S-transferase-catalyzed conjugation with GSH. We have previously shown that Δ12-PGJ2 also rapidly conjugates with GSH, but does require catalysis by glutathioneS-transferase (14Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, we (36Atsmon J. Freeman M.L. Meredith M.J. Sweetman G.J. Roberts II, L.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar) and others (37Kim H.-S. Lee J.-H. Kim I.-K. Prostaglandins. 1996; 51: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown that conjugation with GSH acts to prevent the ability of CP-PGs to inhibit cellular proliferation and to induce apoptosis. Therefore, much remains to be known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate the biological effects of CP prostanoids. Furthermore, the breadth of our understanding of the biological actions of CP prostanoids is probably far from complete. For example, virtually nothing is known about the biological consequences of the adduction of these molecules with DNA in regards to their potential mutagenicity. Dehydration of PGE2 and PGD2 occurs in physiologic buffers, but has also been shown to be catalyzed by plasma and albumin and more recently also by human semen (21Tokugawa Y. Kunishige I. Kubota Y.

A. 1984; 81: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Plasma components could be involved in promoting dehydration of E-ring and D-ring IsoPs following their release from tissue phospholipids into the circulation. However, this study, we identified the presence of CP-IsoPs esterified in tissue membrane lipids. Whether there are also factors in cellular membranes that promote the dehydration of D2/E2-IsoPs remains to be explored. Nonetheless, identification of factors that may promote this dehydration may reveal potential avenues for intervention to modulate the formation of CP-IsoPs in vivo. Our observation that 15-A2t-IsoP undergoes extensive conjugation in vivo in humans is consistent with our previous findings that Δ12-PGJ2 also undergoes extensive conjugation in rats (14Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These observations have potentially very important implications. This may explain the difficulty in the past in demonstrating the formation of CP-PGsin vivo because efforts were focused on detecting these compounds in free form. Even if detected in free form in small amounts,e.g. in urine as reported by Hirata et. al (19Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this could potentially lead to the erroneous conclusion that the amounts formed in vivo may not be biologically relevant. However, quantification of the conjugated form(s) of CP-IsoPs in plasma and/or urine may provide an approach that more accurately assesses the magnitude of endogenous production of both CP-PGs and CP-IsoPs. In the case of CP-IsoPs, it is possible to assess their formation esterified in tissues of interest, but this is not amenable to human investigation. More important, as well, measurement of a conjugate of CP-PGs and CP-IsoPs would completely eliminate the confounding problem of artifactual formation ex vivo of what is being measured. This clearly provides the impetus for future studies aimed at elucidating the nature of these conjugates. In summary, we have reported the discovery of a new class of reactive products of lipid peroxidation that are formed in vivo via the IsoP pathway. This provides a rational basis to explore in depth the biological activities of these novel molecules that may provide new insights into the biological consequences of their formation as it relates to the pathobiology of oxidant injury. Addendum—Since submission of the manuscript, we carried out a study to determine if 15-A2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGA2) is one of the CP-IsoPs that is produced in vivo. We found that a single compound isolated from the livers of CCl4-treated rats coeluted with radiolabeled 15-A2t-IsoP through four high resolving HPLC purification procedures, indicating that 15-A2t-IsoP is in fact one of the CP-IsoPs formed in vivo. Furthermore, the data indicated that the first two HPLC procedures eliminated all other CP-IsoPs. This suggests that the mass spectrum of the compound shown in Fig. 4 that coeluted with radiolabeled 15-A2t-IsoP through two HPLC purification procedures is likely a mass spectrum of 15-A2t-IsoP. We extend our appreciation to Dr. Thomas Harris for valuable assistance in the NMR analysis of 15-A2t-IsoP."

Del1 is expressed in an endothelial cell-restricted pattern during early development. In studies reported here, recombinant baculovirus Del1 protein was shown to promote αvβ3-dependent endothelial cell attachment and migration. Attachment of endothelial cells to Del1 was associated with clustering of αvβ3, the formation of focal complexes, and recruitment of talin and vinculin into these complexes. These events were shown to be associated with phosphorylation of proteins in the focal complexes, including the time-dependent phosphorylation of p125FAK, MAPK, and Shc. When recombinant Del1 was evaluated in an in ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, it was found to have potent angiogenic activity. This angiogenic activity was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against αvβ3, and an RAD mutant Del1 protein was inactive. Thus Del1 provides a unique autocrine angiogenic pathway for the embryonic endothelium, and this function is mediated in part by productive ligation of integrin αvβ3.

The study of vascular development is important because of the fundamental embryological principles that underlie this complex and essential process, and the potential for therapeutic manipulation of vascular formation in human disease processes. The assembly of endothelial cells into vascular structures requires specific signals from luminal surface receptors that are activated by soluble ligands, and signals from the extracellular matrix mediated through receptors on the abluminal surface of the endothelial cell (1Risau W.

Virtually all molecules of the matrix are able to communicate to cells by binding to integrins (3Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9044) Google Scholar). The integrin receptors are noncovalently associated heterodimeric glycoproteins that reside in the cell membrane where their cytoplasmic domains connect to elements of the cytoskeleton. These molecules support a variety of functions, including cell attachment and migration, and activation of cytoplasmic signaling molecules (4Hynes R.O.

Also, αvβ3-mediated signaling through the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; Del1 MJR, developmental endothelial locus-1 major isoform; Del1 MNR, developmental endothelial locus-1 minor isoform; VN, vitronectin; FN, fibronectin; Del1 RAD, developmental endothelial locus-1 major isoform with RGD-→ RAD mutation; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; Shc, C-terminal SH2 domain; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinases, MEK, MAP or ERK kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. pathway, specifically through sustained activation of MAPK, appears to be critical for the angiogenic program (7Eliceiri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To search for new molecular pathways of vascular development, we have recently characterized a locus identified by an enhancer trap event in a line of transgenic mice (8Hidai C. Zupancic T. Penta K. Mikhail A. Kawana M. Quertermous E.E. Aoka Y. Fukagawa M. Matsui Y. Platika D. Auerbach R. Hogan B.L.M. Snodgrass R. Quertermous T. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 21-33Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The gene located in this locus, Del1, was shown to be expressed in an endothelial-restricted pattern in early embryonic development. The proteins encoded in the locus were characterized by genomic and cDNA cloning. The isoform encoded by the common transcript, Del1 major (Del1 MJR), was found to contain a signal sequence, three EGF-like repeats, and two discoidin I-like domains. A less frequent transcript, Del1 minor (Del1 MNR), was noted to be truncated in the amino-terminal discoidin I-like domain due to alternative splicing. Both transcripts had an RGD motif in the B loop of the second EGF-like repeat. Preliminary data suggested that Del1 MJR is a matrix protein, and that the RGD motif could mediate endothelial cell attachment through integrin ligation. In vitro andin vivo functional studies suggested that Del1 may have a complex role in the regulation of vascular formation, serving to inhibit endothelial cell differentiation or contribute to the complex process of vascular remodeling. Such a functional role was not easily reconciled with the molecular interaction of Del1 with the αvβ3 integrin receptor. To further characterize the ability of Del1 to initiate integrin-mediated events, and to investigate whether Del1 ligation of integrin receptors triggers signaling pathways similar to other RGD ligands, a series of experiments were conducted with recombinant baculovirus proteins. Cell attachment assays revealed that Del1 could mediate endothelial cell attachment at concentrations similar to that observed with known matrix proteins such as vitronectin (VN) and fibronectin (FN), and that the majority of this activity was mediated through αvβ3. Also, Del1 was shown to mediate endothelial cell migration through binding to this integrin. Endothelial cells on Del1 were found to form focal complexes that contained phosphorylated proteins characteristic of integrin signaling. In addition, studies employing an in ovo chick CAM assay have documented a novel angiogenic activity of Del1 that is dependent on αvβ3 signaling. Human VN (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) was resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to a final concentration of 14 μm and stored frozen until further use. Cycloheximide, FN, protease inhibitors such as leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were all purchased from Sigma. Synthetic peptides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and correspond to sequences GRGDSP, GRGESP, GPenGRGDSPCA (Pen RGD), where Pen stands for penicillamine. The Del1 peptide represents amino acids 89–106, CEISEAYRGDTFIGYBCK, was synthesized as a linear molecule, and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Other peptides were dissolved in DPBS at 2 mg/0.1 ml, and stored until further use.

Phospho-specific MAPK antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Polyclonal anti-p125FAK (C-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (16Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA. Recombinant bacterial Del1 protein was produced inEscherichia coli as described previously (8Hidai C. Zupancic T. Penta K. Mikhail A. Kawana M. Quertermous E.E. Aoka Y. Fukagawa M. Matsui Y. Platika D. Auerbach R. Hogan B.L.M. Snodgrass R. Quertermous T. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 21-33Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recombinant Del1 proteins were also expressed in baculovirus. cDNA fragments encoding the Del1 MJR, Del1 MNR, and Del1 MJR protein with RAD substituted for the RGD motif (Del1 RAD) were cloned into the shuttle vector pACGP67B and transfected into Sf9 cells with the Baculogold reagents (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Del1 RAD was derived by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as per established protocols (17Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Diffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 613-630Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus expressing Del1 proteins were generated and amplified as per the suppliers instructions (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting of lysates of infected Sf9 cells with polyclonal antisera to Del1. Recombinant protein was purified with His-Bind resin (Novagen, Madison, WI), and subsequently evaluated by SDS-PAGE according to well established methodology (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar). Human 143B osteosarcoma cells were engineered to express high levels of the murine Del1 MJR, through stable transfection and selection of clones by Northern and Western blot (8Hidai C. Zupancic T. Penta K. Mikhail A. Kawana M. Quertermous E.E. Aoka Y. Fukagawa M. Matsui Y. Platika D. Auerbach R. Hogan B.L.M. Snodgrass R. Quertermous T. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 21-33Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A 7-step column based purification strategy was developed to purify the expressed Del1 MJR protein from conditioned media derived from these cells, employing heparin-Sepharose, gel filtration, and ion exchange resins. Mammalian cell protein purified in this fashion was estimated to be at least 95% pure by SDS-PAGE, and documented to be endotoxin free by limulus assay. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were a kind gift from Dr. D. Vaughan (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). BAEC were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HUVEC were maintained in EGM medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and growth factors. Cells were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes and employed in experiments between passages 4–7. Test adhesive substrates were diluted in DPBS to stated concentrations, and 50 μl/well were added to 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and placed overnight at 4 °C. After coating, wells were rinsed with DPBS, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h and maintained in the drug during the entire assay period. Cells were detached with minimum trypsinization (1 to 2 min), followed by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Pelleted cells were washed with trypsin inhibitor in DPBS, spun down again, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 1 mg/ml BSA. Approximately 30,000 cells/100 μl were applied to each well and allowed to adhere for 60–90 min at 37 °C. In experiments where RGD peptides or soluble adhesive ligands were used, cells were preincubated with the respective reagents for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition to the wells. For experiments with integrin receptor blocking antibodies, cells were mixed with the appropriate antibody with no preincubation, and allowed to attach to the matrix for 15 min at 37 °C. For all experiments, nonadherent cells were removed with warm DPBS, and the remaining cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue for 5 min and rinsed with water. Stained cells were solubilized with 1.0% SDS and quantified on a microtiter plate reader at 595 nm. Experiments described were performed in quadruplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. Results from a representative experiment are presented as mean and standard deviation. The adhesion assay protocol was validated in our experimental conditions as described previously (19Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Test substances were diluted to appropriate concentrations in DMEM containing 200 μg/ml BSA and placed in the bottom wells of a modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD), unless otherwise indicated. Standard assays were performed with BAEC exactly as reported by Liaw et al. (20Liaw L. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Chambers A.F. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Blocking actions of monoclonal antibodies were evaluated in migration experiments with HUVEC using transwell dishes as described previously (21Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Del1 (100 nm) was employed in assays with 50 μg/ml anti-αvβ3 (clone LM609), 25–50 μg/ml anti-αvβ5 (clone P156), 1:20 dilution anti-β1 (clone JB1a), and 20–40 μg/ml anti-α2β1 (JBS2). Integrin receptor blocking antibodies and cells were applied to the wells simultaneously. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. Coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with the adhesive substrates diluted in DPBS at a final concentration of 100 nm, washed 3 times with DPBS, and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in DPBS for 3 h at 37 °C. After growing cells on the coverslips for 3 h, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, permeabilized with acetone for 3 min, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phallicidin. For vinculin, phosphotyrosine, and anti-β3 clone (AP3) staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and permeabilized for 2 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (VIN-11-5, Sigma) was used at a 1:60 dilution, the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100, and anti-β3 at 1:50 dilution. For talin staining, cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min on ice and the anti-talin monoclonal used at a 1:100 dilution. Application of all monoclonal antibodies was followed by a secondary Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Inc.). All antibodies were applied in DPBS containing both 3% BSA and 2% goat serum. All primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out for 1 h each at 37 °C. Thirty-five-mm tissue culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with VN, FN, or Del1 in DPBS at 100 nm final coating concentration. Subconfluent BAEC were serum starved with 0.5% serum for 24 h. Before addition of cells, coated dishes were washed 3 times with DPBS and nonspecific sites were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. BAEC were harvested as described for the adhesion assay, suspended in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA and allowed to stand for 20 min at 37 °C. Approximately 1.5–2 × 106 cells were applied to each dish and allowed to adhere. After 30, 60, or 120 min at 37 °C, cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer or MAPK buffer (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). One group of serum-starved BAEC were washed with DPBS and lysed in the dish, and referred to as attached cells. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C. Supernatants precleared with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) or anti-p125FAK (C-20) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following day, immune complexes were harvested after a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads at 4 °C, washed 3 times with ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer, boiled with 2 × Laemmli buffer for 5 min, resolved with 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by incubating with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody at 1:1000 dilution. At a similar dilution polyclonal anti-p125FAK antibody was used to detect immunoprecipitated p125FAK. To verify equivalent amounts of p125FAK between samples, p125FAKimmunoprecipitations on Western blot were probed with p125FAK antibody. All primary antibody incubations were performed in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were extensively washed with TBST buffer followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody at 1:4000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. After washing, immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence. For MAPK experiments, cell lysates were prepared in the MAPK lysis buffer as described above in a total volume of 100 μl. Approximately 5–10% of the total lysates were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to Western blotting as above. An anti-phospho-specific MAPK antibody that detects p42 and p44 MAPK only when catalytically activated by phosphorylation at Tyr204and Thr202 (New England Biolabs) was used as an immunoprobe, followed by a secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin. Total MAPK protein was evaluated by probing the Western blots with a MAPK polyclonal antiserum. For evaluation of phosphorylation of Shc, identical techniques were employed as for p125FAK and MAPK, except immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Shc antibody, and evaluated on Western blot with antibodies to phosphotyrosine and Shc (23Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Recombinant Del1 protein expressed in both mammalian cells and in insect cells was employed in in ovo CAM assays according to well established methodology (24Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were candled to illuminate blood vessels under the shell and an area with a minimum of small blood vessels thus identified. A window was cut in the egg shell and a filter disc 5 mm in diameter saturated with equal volumes of bFGF at 59 nm (total of 30 ng/disc), Del1 proteins at 100 nm, or 1 μm (total of 0.2 and 2.0 μg/disk, respectively), or equal amounts of VN or FN at 1 μm were placed on the CAM. The window was sealed with adhesive tape and the egg incubated for 4 days. In one group of experiments, Del1 or a buffer control were evaluated as putative inhibitors of bFGF induced angiogenesis by application to the filter disc or injection intravenously 24 h later. In other experiments, the anti-αvβ3 monoclonal antibody LM609 (75 μg of affinity purified antibody) or a negative control antibody of the same isotype directed against an myosin heavy chain class I marker (W632, 75 μg) were injected intravenously at 24 h. In all cases, CAMs were harvested on the fourth day of stimulation by excising the region adherent to and surrounding the filter disc and placed in a 30-mm culture dish. Vessels were then visualized in a dissecting microscope and vessel branch points quantified within the 5-mm disc area. At least 10 embryos were used per treatment group. Data was evaluated in terms of average number of branch points per treatment group. Recombinant Del1 MJR, Del1 MNR, and Del1 RAD proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells, purified on a nickel column, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal Del1 antisera. Both Del1 MJR and Del1 RAD mutant proteins migrated at the expected size of 52 kDa, while the MNR form resolved into multiple bands at approximately 25 kDa (Fig.1, A and B). Multiple bands observed with electrophoresis of the MNR protein may represent variation in glycosylation, other post-translational modification, or minor proteolytic degradation. Preimmune sera failed to recognize any of the recombinant forms of Del1 protein (data not shown). Both BAEC and HUVEC adhered to wells coated with recombinant bacterial and baculovirus forms of Del1, VN, and FN in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). VN and FN were used as positive control adhesive substrates, based on earlier reports of their ability to promote endothelial cell adhesion (25Macarak E.J. Howard P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 116: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Dose-dependent adhesion was observed when coating solutions containing up to 100 nm of either of the two Del1 proteins were used, and half-maximal effect was observed using solutions containing 7 nm Del1, 10 nm VN, and 10 nm FN. Cell adhesion to Del1 was thus comparable to that observed with VN and FN substrates. To investigate the role of the RGD motif in cell adhesion, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to construct a cDNA encoding a form of Del1 MJR with an RAD motif in the B loop of EGF repeat 2, instead of RGD. This mutant, Del1 RAD, was compared with the wild-type Del1 MJR, and the truncated protein that is encoded by the less common alternative Del1 transcript, Del1 MNR. The Del1 MNR protein contains the same signal sequence and three EGF-like regions as Del1 MJR, but has only a small portion of the amino-terminal discoidin I-like domain (8Hidai C. Zupancic T. Penta K. Mikhail A. Kawana M. Quertermous E.E. Aoka Y. Fukagawa M. Matsui Y. Platika D. Auerbach R. Hogan B.L.M. Snodgrass R. Quertermous T. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 21-33Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). High titer baculovirus encoding these three proteins were generated and used to produce protein in Sf9 cells, and recombinant proteins compared for their ability to mediate endothelial cell attachment (Fig. 1, A and D). Adhesion of BAEC to all the three forms of Del1 at 1, 10, 100, and 500 nm final coating concentrations were compared (Fig.1 D). Both Del1 MJR and Del1 MNR showed a dose-dependent increase in attachment of BAEC, with a half-maximal effect for Del1 MJR at 7 nm. In contrast, the RAD mutant form of Del1 MJR supported cell attachment poorly, suggesting that the RGD motif in Del1 protein plays an important role in endothelial cell adhesion. The effect of soluble Del1 on the adhesion of BAEC to extracellular matrix proteins was investigated. Microtiter wells were coated overnight with the test ligands at a final concentration of 100 nm, and cells were preincubated in solutions containing 1, 10, 100, and 250 nm Del1 for 30 min at 37 °C before applying them to the wells. Del1 protein was an effective competitor of BAEC adhesion to VN, with 50% inhibition obtained at 100 nm soluble Del1 protein (Fig.2 A). Dose-dependent inhibition of BAEC adhesion to FN was also observed, with a maximum of 40% at 250 nm final concentration of soluble Del1. These data suggest that Del1 is capable of blocking a significant portion of the integrin-mediated endothelial cell attachment to VN and FN, but that Del1 interacts with only a subset of the receptors for each of these ligands. In a similar series of experiments, the ability of soluble VN and FN to compete for cell adhesion to Del1 was investigated. The ability of BAEC to adhere to microtiter wells coated with 100 nm final coating concentration of Del1 in the presence of competing soluble adhesive ligands 10, 100, and 250 nm soluble VN and FN. A dose-dependent inhibition of BAEC adhesion to Del1 was observed (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, an equivalent amount of inhibition was seen with both VN and FN, suggesting that Del1 may employ integrin receptors that are recognized by both VN and FN. In peptide blocking studies, BAEC adhesion to Del1 at 10 nm coating concentration was inhibited with 100 μm GRGDSP hexamer peptide, with significant inhibition seen with as low as 10 μm peptide (Fig.3 A). This inhibition of cell attachment is similar to that seen with RGD peptides competing for attachment to FN and VN substrates (Fig. 3 B, and data not shown). In contrast, even high concentration (500 μmfinal) of the control GRGESP peptides showed no significant inhibition. The concentrations of competing peptides used in these adhesion assays are typical for RGD-containing peptides used to compete other RGD-dependent binding activities (26Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the RGD sequence in Del1 showed similar dose-dependent inhibition of adhesion of BAEC to Del1 protein, with approximately 50% inhibition achieved with 100 μm peptide. The RGD-Del1 peptide could also compete for attachment of BAEC to VN and FN substrates in a similar adhesion assay (data not shown). Experiments were also conducted with a peptide containing the penicillamine motif, Gly-Pen-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ala, which has been shown to have some specificity for integrin receptors containing the αv subunit (26Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Del1, VN, and FN were evaluated at 100 nm coating concentration, with peptides at 250 μm. The penicillamine containing RGD peptide strongly inhibited BAEC adhesion to both Del1 and VN, suggesting these cells use similar αv receptors to attach to Del1 and VN (Fig. 3 B). RGD and control RGE peptides included in these experiments showed that inhibition of endothelial cell attachment by RGD peptides was equivalent for these two proteins. To further define the integrin receptors involved in endothelial cell adhesion, blocking studies were performed with HUVEC and well characterized monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody against αvβ3 (LM609) routinely blocked 75% HUVEC adhesion to Del1, and this was comparable to results seen with VN (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, blocking antibodies that recognize another VN receptor, anti-αvβ5 (PIF6), consistently showed less blocking activity for cells on Del1, suggesting a lower affinity interaction with this receptor. Antibodies to the α6 subunit had no blocking activity associated with Del1 adhesion, but inhibited adhesion to laminin by approximately 80% (data not shown). Monoclonal antibodies to the β1 integrin subunit (clone JB1a) also failed to show significant inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest that Del1 mediates endothelial cell attachment primarily through molecular interaction with the αvβ3 receptor VN recept"

Ceramides, the major components of these multilayered membranes, derive in large part from hydrolysis of glucosylceramides mediated by stratum corneum β-glucocerebrosidase (β-GlcCerase). Prosaposin (pSAP) is a large precursor protein that is proteolytically cleaved to form four distinct sphingolipid activator proteins, which stimulate enzymatic hydrolysis of sphingolipids, including glucosylceramide. Recently, pSAP has been eliminated in a mouse model using targeted deletion and homologous recombination. In addition to the extracutaneous findings noted previously, our present data indicate that pSAP deficiency in the epidermis has significant consequences including: 1) an accumulation of epidermal glucosylceramides together with below normal levels of ceramides; 2) alterations in lipids that are bound by ester linkages to proteins of the cornified cell envelope; 3) a thickened stratum lucidum with evidence of scaling; and 4) a striking abnormality in lamellar membrane maturation within the interstices of the stratum corneum. Together, these results demonstrate that the production of pSAP, and presumably mature sphingolipid activator protein generation, is required for normal epidermal barrier formation and function. Moreover, detection of significant amounts of covalently bound ω-OH-GlcCer in pSAP-deficient epidermis suggests that deglucosylation to ω-OH-Cer is not a requisite step prior to covalent attachment of lipid to cornified envelope proteins.

Proteolytic cleavage of SAP precursor (pSAP) in acidic compartments releases four homologous polypeptides (i.e. SAP-A, SAP-B, SAP-C, and SAP-D), thought to function either by direct activation of their respective enzyme or as biological detergents that lift substrates out of the membrane plane (3Fischer G.

One of the activator proteins, SAP-C, has been shown to stimulate lysosomal glucosylceramide (GlcCer) degradation by β-glucocerebrosidase (β-GlcCerase) (6Ho M.W. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In terrestrial mammals, the permeability barrier that restricts excess transepidermal water loss is maintained by unique arrays of lamellar membranes localized in the interstices of the outermost stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. These lamellar arrays derive from the extruded lipid contents of lamellar bodies after fusion of these organelles with the apical plasma membrane of the outermost granular cell. The initially secreted lipids are processed by a set of co-localized lipid hydrolases into a more hydrophobic mixture, enriched in ceramides (Cer). The resultant Cer, comprising a family of compounds with complex chemical structures, together with free fatty acids and cholesterol are the dominant constituents of the stratum corneum (SC) lamellar membranes (11Elias P.M. Menon G.K. Adv. Lipid Res. 1991; 33: 301-313Google Scholar). Two of these species, which possess an ω-hydroxy moiety on the N-acyl fatty acid, are covalently bound to structural proteins of the cornified cell envelope forming a hydrophobic surface on terminally differentiated keratinocytes (12Wertz P.W.

The postsecretory processing of lamellar body-derived GlcCers to ceramides by β-GlcCerase is essential for maintenance of permeability barrier homeostasis (14Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Menon G.K.

Because SAP-C stimulates lysosomal GlcCer degradation in vivo, it seems reasonable to predict that expression of pSAP would also be important for epidermal barrier formation. Decreased levels of pSAP have been detected in atopic skin, suggesting a role for SAPs in epidermal function (18Chang-Yi C. Kusuda S. Seguchi T. Takahashi M. Aisu K. Tezuka T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 20-week pSAP-deficient human fetus, with a phenotype resembling acute neuronopathic (type 2) Gaucher disease, displayed extensive cutaneous lysosomal storage deposits and neutral glycosphingolipid accumulation in dermal fibroblasts (19Bradová V. Smı́d F. Ulrich-Bott B. Roggendorf W. Paton B.C. Harzer K. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A SAP precursor-deficient mouse (pSAP −/−) has recently been created by targeted gene disruption and homologous recombination (20Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Popko B. Maeda N. Klein A. Henseler M. Sandhoff K. Nakayasu H. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because of the deficiency of the complete precursor protein, none of the four SAPs are generated in any cell type. Initial characterization of these mice exhibited two distinct phenotypes, i.e. neonatally fatal and later onset. The pathology of the latter is complex, including severe hypomyelination and storage of multiple sphingolipids in the brain (20Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Popko B. Maeda N. Klein A. Henseler M. Sandhoff K. Nakayasu H. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,21Oya Y. Nakayasu H. Fujita N. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as well as an ichthyosiform dermatosis. Thus, in the present work, we focused on the physiologic function of pSAP in the context of cutaneous permeability barrier formation and investigated the effects of pSAP deficiency on epidermal lipid composition and structure. Generation of SAP-deficient mice through targeted gene disruption has been described previously (20Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Popko B. Maeda N. Klein A. Henseler M. Sandhoff K. Nakayasu H. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Newborn knockout mice (homozygous, n = 9; heterozygous,n = 8) as well as newborn wild-type littermates (n = 7) were studied. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The primers used had the following sequence: forward primer, 5′-GCC CAC AGC GGT GAG TGC-3′, matching on the pSAP genomic DNA on exon 2/intron 2; reverse primer, 5′-CAG CAA GTT CCC AGC TTC GG-3′, matching on exon 3. With those primers a band of 1300 bp appeared in the pSAP −/− mice, a band of 806 bp appeared in pSAP +/+ mice, and both bands appeared in pSAP +/− mice. Whole skin was removed at autopsy from newborn mice. Epidermis was separated from dermis after floating the skin on Dispase (Boehringer Mannheim, grade II) diluted 1:1 in Hanks' buffer at 4 °C overnight. Tissue samples were homogenized, lyophilized, and weighed. Epidermal lipids were extracted for 24 h at 37 °C in each of three solvent mixtures (chloroform/methanol/water 1:2:0.5 (v/v/v); chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v), and chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v). Total lipid extracts were applied to thin-layer Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck Darmstadt, Germany). All plates were washed with chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v) before sample application. For separation of glucosylceramides, the chromatograms were developed with chloroform/methanol/water (70:30:5, v/v/v). Ceramides were resolved twice using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (190:9:1, v/v/v) as developing solvent. For quantitative analytical TLC determination, increasing amounts of standard lipids (N-stearoyl-sphingosine (kind gift of Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg, Germany), sphingomyelin (Sigma), and glucosylceramide (purified from Gaucher spleen in our laboratory)) were applied. After development, plates were air-dried, sprayed with 8% (w/v) H3PO4 containing 10% (w/v) CuSO4, and charred at 180 °C for 10 min, and lipids were quantitated by photodensitometry (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). After sequential extraction of epidermal samples as described above, pellets were extracted three times for 5 min at room temperature with methanol followed by two additional extractions for 2 h with 95% methanol at 60 °C. The final fraction was checked for lipid content. Covalently bound lipids were released by incubation with 1 ml of 1m KOH in 95% methanol for 2 h at 60 °C. Lipids were subsequently recovered by adding 2 ml of water and 2 ml of chloroform. The chloroform layer was removed, and the aqueous phase was extracted once more with 2 ml of chloroform. The organic phases were combined and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were applied to prewashed (chloroform/methanol 9:1, v/v) thin-layer Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) and separated using 2× chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (190:9:1, v/v/v) as developing solvent. Quantification of lipids was performed as described above. For quantification of fatty acids, increasing amounts of palmitic acid (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were applied to the plates. Aliquots of lipid extracts were separated by TLC techniques as described above. Individual sphingolipids were scraped from plates and redissolved in chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v). Approximately 50–200 pmol of lipid were mixed with 20 μg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (ICN Biochemicals) directly on the target. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a TofSpec E (MicroMass, Manchester, UK) mass spectrometer operating at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. External calibration was performed using PEG-1000 (Sigma). Skin samples were taken at autopsy, either immediately or 24 h after birth, and processed for light and electron microscopy. For light microscopy, samples were fixed by immersion in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (4%), embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm), stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and photographed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. For electron microscopy, samples were minced to <0.5 mm, fixed overnight in HEPES buffer (0.16m, pH 7.3) containing glutaraldehyde/formalin (1.25:0.5%) and 0.1 mm CaCl2, and postfixed in both ruthenium tetroxide, as described previously (22Hou S.Y.E. Stephen H. Mitra A.K. White S.H. Menon G.K. Ghadially R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 215-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide, each containing 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide. After fixation, all samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and embedded in an Epon/epoxy mixture. Ultrathin sections were examined, with or without further contrasting with lead citrate, in an electron microscope (Zeiss 10A, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) operated at 60 kV. Statistical evaluation of data was performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. To address the question of whether the pSAP product SAP-C is involved in the processing of epidermal GlcCer to Cer and therefore important for epidermal barrier formation, we first determined the GlcCer and Cer levels in the epidermis of pSAP knockout mice. After extraction, sphingolipids were separated by TLC and quantitated by photodensitometry. Aliquots of lipid extracts taken in parallel were used to isolate individual sphingolipids by TLC for MALDI mass spectrometric analysis. Although we had proposed likely compositions for sphingolipid structures, we could not distinguish differences in fatty acid and sphingoid chain length distribution from masses of intact molecular ions. In this work, structural data are presented in accordance with the epidermal Cer terminology proposed by Mottaet al. (23Motta S. Monti M. Sesana S. Caputo R. Carelli S. Ghidoni R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and modified by Robson et al. (24Robson K.J. Stewart M.E. Michelsen S. Lazo N.D. Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2060-2068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the Cer structures are denoted by the composition of the sphingoid base (either sphingosine (S) or phytosphingosine (P)) and theN-acyl fatty acid by the presence of α-hydroxy group (A), ω-hydroxy group (O), or no-hydroxy group (N) and whether the ω position is further acylated (i.e. esterified (E)). Distinct differences in the epidermal lipid composition were evident between pSAP-deficent and wild-type animals. First, the content of each of the three distinct GlcCer fractions that were readily separated by TLC (see mass spectrometric analysis for structural assignments below) was significantly elevated in the epidermis of pSAP −/−versus wild-type littermates (Fig.1, A and C). In the absence of pSAP, GlcCer(EOS) accumulated 5.2-fold (p < 10−8, n = 9), whereas the more polar (i.e., lower Rf value) GlcCer A/B and GlcCer(C16-AS) accumulated 2.1-fold (p < 10−4) and 2.2-fold (p < 0.02), respectively. In heterozygous mice, which demonstrate nearly 50% reduction in the expression of pSAP protein (20Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Popko B. Maeda N. Klein A. Henseler M. Sandhoff K. Nakayasu H. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), only the GlcCer(EOS) fraction showed significant accumulation (1.4-fold, p < 0.03), whereas the other GlcCer fractions remained unchanged. These results suggest not only that the processing of epidermal GlcCers by acidic β-GlcCerase requires the production of pSAP, and presumably mature SAP generation, but that the hydrolysis of the more hydrophobic epidermal GlcCers (e.g. GlcCer(EOS)) is more dependent upon the presence of SAP-C. The storage of GlcCers was accompanied with a decrease in the level of epidermal ceramides. Ceramides were separated into five fractions (Fig.1 B) and later identified by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis (see below). With the exception of Cer(C16-AS), all of the other epidermal ceramides were modestly decreased in the SAP −/− epidermis in comparison with wild-type littermates (by approximately 20%) (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, the least hydrophobic ceramide, Cer(C16-AS), accumulated 1.3-fold over control (p < 0.05). Moreover, the Cer levels of heterozygous mouse epidermis were not significantly different from normal littermates (Fig. 1 D). The diminished levels of epidermal Cer in conjunction with the preferential accumulation of hydrophobic GlcCer (noted above) strongly suggest a role for either pSAP itself or a mature SAP, presumably SAP-C, in the hydrolytic processing of GlcCer-to-Cer in epidermis. We next identified each of the GlcCer and Cer fractions separated by TLC. Using MALDI mass spectrometric analysis, the most hydrophobic glycolipid, GlcCer(EOS), was found to contain ω-OH fatty acids of various chain lengths (C28–C36) and degrees of saturation with a majority being C32:0 (M + Na, 1224.7 atomic mass units) and C34:1 (M + Na, 1250.6 atomic mass units) (Fig.2 A). The ω-OH moiety of this GlcCer fraction is known to be acylated in the epidermis with linoleic acid, as shown here and previously (25Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 753-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcCer A/B (Fig.2 B) comprised a complex mixture of GlcCers (i.e. GlcCer(NS) GlcCer(NP), and GlcCer(C24,26-AS)). Non-hydroxy fatty acids with dominant chain length of C24:0, C25:0, and C26:0 were attached to either sphingosine or phytosphingosine. The less abundant α-hydroxy fatty acids in GlcCer A/B showed a similar pattern with C24:0-OH (M + Na, 850.4 atomic mass units), C25:0-OH (M + Na, 864.4 atomic mass units), and C26:0-OH (M + Na, 878.4 atomic mass units). The presence of significant amounts of C25 and other odd-chain fatty acids in epidermal ceramides has also previously been reported (26Madison K.C. Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 657-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Wertz P.W. Miethke M.C. Long S.A. Strauss J.S. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 410-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because of the differences in molecular polarity, it seems likely that the upper part of the double band, GlcCer A/B, represents GlcCers with non-hydroxy fatty acids, whereas the lower part corresponds to the GlcCers containing α-hydroxylated fatty acids. The most hydrophilic glycolipid, GlcCer(C16-AS), was identified as a homogenous GlcCer containing mainly a C16:0-OH fatty acid (M + Na, 738.5 atomic mass units, Fig. 2 C). MALDI mass spectrometric analysis of ceramides revealed sphingoid and fatty acid compositions similar to those found in their corresponding glucosylceramide precursors as well. With regard to the ceramide moiety, GlcCer(EOS) appeared to correspond to Cer(EOS) having the same fatty acid pattern, again with a majority being C32:0 (M + Na, 1062.9 atomic mass units) and C34:1 (M + Na, 1088.8 atomic mass units) (Fig.2 E). Cer(NS) contained different non-hydroxy fatty acids with chain length between C24 and C26 (Fig. 2 F). Cer(NP) appeared to be hydroxylated in the sphingoid backbone because it comigrated with synthetic phytoceramide on TLC chromatograms. The molecular masses indeed demonstrated an additional hydroxyl group in Cer(NP) together with various degrees of saturation of long chain fatty acids (Fig. 2 G). Cer(C24,26-AS) and Cer(C16-AS) both were identified as ceramides containing α-hydroxy fatty acids attached to sphingosine. In Cer(C24,26-AS) C24:0-OH (M + Na, 688.5 atomic mass units), C25:0-OH (M + Na, 702.6 atomic mass units), and C26:0-OH (M + Na, 716.6 atomic mass units) fatty acids were found (Fig.2 H). Taken together, Cer(NS), (NP), and (C24,26-AS) comprised the lipid backbones of GlcCer A/B. The most hydrophilic ceramide, Cer(C16-AS), possessed mainly a C16:0-OH fatty acid and therefore corresponds to GlcCer(C16-AS) (Fig. 2 D). Processing of sphingomyelin to Cer by acidic sphingomyelinase (SMase) could also contribute to the pool of Cer available for barrier formation within the epidermis. A significant in vivoactivation of acidic SMase by SAPs could not be concluded from lipid profiles of brain and liver from pSAP knockout mice (20Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Popko B. Maeda N. Klein A. Henseler M. Sandhoff K. Nakayasu H. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, in the epidermis the sphingomyelin level was increased 1.5-fold over that in wild-type mice (p < 0.02, data not shown). Terminally differentiated keratinocytes (corneocytes) are coated by a monolayer of ω-OH ceramides, ester-linked to proteins of the outer surface of the cornified cell envelope. This lipid-bound envelope is thought to be essential for either corneocyte cohesion and/or organization of extracellular lipid lamellae (28Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 109-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized these lipids obtained after exhaustive prior extraction of epidermal samples followed by alkaline hydrolysis (12Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the recovered lipids were indeed covalently attached, each sample was checked to ensure that there was no residual extractable lipids before undergoing base hydrolysis (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1, 3, and 5). A mixture of long chain fatty acids, Cer(OS), and ω-OH fatty acids were released from the wild-type epidermis (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). In addition to these lipids, substantial amounts of GlcCer(OS) were covalently attached to the cornified cell envelope in pSAP −/− mice (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). All three ω-OH species had the same fatty acid chain length distribution with a majority being C32:1, C32:0, and C34:1 as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (Fig.4). Furthermore, the levels of bound Cer(OS) and ω-OH fatty acids in homozygous knockout mice were significantly decreased to 80% (p = 0.05) and 48% (p = 0.002) of normal control, respectively. Comparably low levels of covalently bound GlcCer(OS) could also be detected in pSAP +/− as well as in wild-type epidermis. In summary, these data show that in pSAP −/− mice there is a switch from a hydrophobic to a more hydrophilic lipid-bound envelope.Figure 4Mass spectrometry of ester-linked epidermal lipids.

These findings are consistent with a defect in the epidermal permeability barrier and suggest underlying defects in the critical membrane domains in the stratum corneum. Therefore, to ascertain the significance of pSAP deficiency in the epidermis, we first analyzed epidermal sections at the light microscopic level (Fig.5). In the homozygous knockout mice, morphological alterations were limited to the stratum corneum and the stratum lucidum, which represents the interface between the upper stratum granulosum and the lower stratum corneum. The thicker stratum lucidum in the knockout mice in comparison with the wild-type mice could be the result of an accumulation of unprocessed GlcCer. Furthermore, large parts of the stratum corneum were absent in sections of the knockout animals, possibly because of reduced mechanical stability resulting from swelling of intercellular domains. To further delineate the basis for the cutaneous abnormalities induced by the deficiency of pSAP in the epidermis, micrographs from pSAP knockout, heterozygous, and wild-type littermates were compared (Fig.6). The pSAP-deficient epidermis (−/−) displayed a striking abnormality in lamellar membrane maturation within the interstices of the lower-to-middle stratum corneum (Fig. 6,A and B) when compared with that of normal (Fig.6 C) littermates. The distinctive membrane unit structures seen in the normal stratum corneum (Fig. 6 C) were replaced by arrays of foreshortened lamellae in loose, discontinuous aggregates in the pSAP-deficient stratum corneum (Fig. 6, A andB, arrows), resembling those seen with β-GlcCerase deficiency (14Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Menon G.K. Legler G. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Holleran W.M. Ginns E.I. Menon G.K. Grundmann J.U. Fartasch M. McKinney C.E. Elias P.M. Sidransky E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1756-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Although normal quantities of lamellar bodies were present and secreted normally in pSAP-deficient epidermis (Fig. 6 E, arrowheads), their internal structure appeared to be altered from those in heterozygous or normal littermates (Fig. 6 D and inset); individual organelles often appeared enlarged and engorged with non-lamellar, electron-dense material, which in turn disrupts the internal contents normally seen in wild-type epidermis. Moreover, the secreted lamellar body-derived contents in the intercellular spaces at the stratum corneum-stratum granulosum interface in pSAP −/− animals retained a compact, spherical pattern (Fig. 6 A, asterisks) rather than progressively unfurling into linear configurations, as occured in the heterozygous and wild-type stratum corneum. These studies indicate that a profound deficiency of pSAP does not disrupt production, trafficking, or secretion of lamellar body contents into the intercellular domains. Instead, pSAP deficiency results in major abnormalities in the following: (a) the internal organization of lamellar body contents; (b) dispersal after secretion; and (c) extracellular processing of extruded lamellar body contents. Heterozygous animals, although expressing approximately 50% of the pSAP protein levels (20Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Popko B. Maeda N. Klein A. Henseler M. Sandhoff K. Nakayasu H. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), did not display abnormalities in the contents or maturation of the lamellar body, suggesting that sufficient pSAP is expressed to sustain the extracellular hydrolytic activity required to generate mature lamellar membrane organization. In this work, we isolated lipids from murine epidermis and for the first time presented a complete mass spectrometric characterization of both epidermal ceramides and corresponding glucosylceramides. Our data on the ceramides are in good agreement with previous structural characterization of murine Cer(EOS), Cer(NS), and Cer(C16-AS) (26Madison K.C. Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Dow"
https://openalex.org/W1992475433,"The liver is responsible for the clearance and metabolism of unconjugated bilirubin, the hydrophobic end-product of heme catabolism. Although several putative bilirubin transporters have been described, it has been alternatively proposed that bilirubin enters the hepatocyte by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane. In order to elucidate the mechanism of bilirubin uptake, we measured the rate of bilirubin transmembrane diffusion (flip-flop) using stopped-flow fluorescence techniques. Unconjugated bilirubin rapidly diffuses through model phosphatidylcholine vesicles, with a first-order rate constant of 5.3 s−1 (t12=130ms). The flip-flop rate is independent of membrane cholesterol content, phospholipid acyl saturation, and lipid packing, consistent with thermodynamic analyses demonstrating minimal steric constraint to bilirubin transmembrane diffusion. The coincident decrease in pH of the entrapped vesicle volume supports a mechanism whereby the bilirubin molecule crosses the lipid bilayer as the uncharged diacid. Transport of bilirubin by native rat hepatocyte membranes exhibits kinetics comparable with that in model vesicles, suggesting that unconjugated bilirubin crosses cellular membranes by passive diffusion through the hydrophobic lipid core. In contrast, there is no demonstrable flip-flop of bilirubin diglucuronide or bilirubin ditaurate in phospholipid vesicles, yet these compounds rapidly traverse isolated rat hepatocyte membranes, confirming the presence of a facilitated uptake system(s) for hydrophilic bilirubin conjugates. The liver is responsible for the clearance and metabolism of unconjugated bilirubin, the hydrophobic end-product of heme catabolism. Although several putative bilirubin transporters have been described, it has been alternatively proposed that bilirubin enters the hepatocyte by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane. In order to elucidate the mechanism of bilirubin uptake, we measured the rate of bilirubin transmembrane diffusion (flip-flop) using stopped-flow fluorescence techniques. Unconjugated bilirubin rapidly diffuses through model phosphatidylcholine vesicles, with a first-order rate constant of 5.3 s−1 (t12=130ms). The flip-flop rate is independent of membrane cholesterol content, phospholipid acyl saturation, and lipid packing, consistent with thermodynamic analyses demonstrating minimal steric constraint to bilirubin transmembrane diffusion.

Unconjugated bilirubin is the principal degradation product of heme metabolism. Although the physiologic isomer, bilirubin IXα, is a dicarboxylic acid, the molecule has minimal aqueous solubility at physiologic pH (1Brodersen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2364-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ostrow J.D. Mukerjee P. Tiribelli C. J. Lipid. Res. 1994; 35: 1715-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (3Bonnett R. Davies J.E. Hursthouse M.B. Sheldrick G.M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1978; 202: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For this reason, bilirubin undergoes biotransformation in the liver to more polar conjugates prior to secretion in the bile. However, while unconjugated bilirubin is not hydrophilic, neither can it be characterized as lipophilic (55Goessling W. Zucker S.D. Hepatology. 1997; 26 (abstr.): 385Google Scholar), since this compound is equally insoluble in apolar solvents (e.g. n-hexane, 1-pentanol). These unique physical-chemical properties have generated controversy regarding the mechanism of bilirubin uptake by the liver. Based on the spontaneous leakage from multilamellar liposomes (4Hayward D. Schiff D. Fedunec S. Chan G. Davis J.P. Poznansky M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that bilirubin is able to diffuse through cellular membranes (5Wennberg R.P. Pediat. Res. 1988; 23: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Schmid R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 287: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in vivo (7Scharschmidt B.F. Waggoner J.G. Berk P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and whole organ (8Stollman Y.R. Gartner U. Theilmann L. Ohmi N. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Paumgartner G. Reichen J. Clin. Sci. Mol. Med. 1976; 51: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar) studies indicate that hepatic bilirubin uptake is saturable and occurs against a concentration gradient, findings that support a protein-mediated transport mechanism. To date, four putative bilirubin transporters have been identified in liver cells: BSP/bilirubin-binding protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide, bilitranslocase, and organic anion-binding protein. Each of these proteins facilitates uptake of the hydrophilic organic anion, sulfobromophthalein (BSP), 1The abbreviations used are: BSP, sulfobromophthalein; BDT, bilirubin ditaurate; BDG, bilirubin diglucuronide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cbBSA, Cascade Blue-labeled BSA; bLPM, basolateral (sinusoidal) liver plasma membranes; dansyl-PE, N-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine; pyranine, 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid. a process that is competitively inhibited by bilirubin (10Stremmel W. Berk P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the substantial body of evidence in support of protein-mediated bilirubin uptake, none of the aforementioned candidate proteins has been directly shown to transport unconjugated bilirubin. This is due, in part, to the use of BSP as a surrogate for bilirubin, based on the long standing assumption that these two compounds share a common transporter (12Sottocasa G.L. Passamonti S. Battiston L. Pascolo L. Tiribelli C. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 36-41PubMed Google Scholar, 13Berk P.D. Potter B.J. Stremmel W. Semin. Liver. Dis. 1997; 7: 165-176Google Scholar). However, the cellular uptake of bilirubin and BSP can be dissociated (14Gartner U. Stockert R.J. Levine W.G. Wolkoff A.W. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 1163-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Kanai N. Lu R. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F319-F325PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting distinct transport mechanisms. While it has been argued that the unique “permeability” of hepatocytes to bilirubin confirms the presence of a specific transporter (12Sottocasa G.L. Passamonti S. Battiston L. Pascolo L. Tiribelli C. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 36-41PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baldini G. Passamonti S. Lunazzi G.C. Tiribelli C. Sottocasa G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 856: 1-10Google Scholar), other studies have demonstrated nonsaturable and non-energy-dependent bilirubin uptake (17Iga T. Eaton D.L. Klaassen C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 236: C9-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicative of a diffusional process. Moreover, fibroblasts transfected with cDNA for the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, do not express any of the candidate transporters yet are effectively able to take up and conjugate bilirubin (18Seppen J. Tada K. Hellwig S. Bakker C.T.M. Prasad V.R. Roy-Chowdhury N. Roy-Chowdhury J. Bosma P.J. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In an attempt to reconcile these disparate results and to further delineate the mechanism whereby bilirubin traverses cellular membranes, we devised a stopped-flow fluorescence system to facilitate detailed kinetic analysis of bilirubin flip-flop in model and isolated native membrane vesicles. Our data suggest that unconjugated bilirubin is capable of rapid, spontaneous diffusion through lipid bilayers, findings with important implications for bilirubin clearance by the liver. Nigericin, valinomycin, and essentially fatty acid-free bovine and human serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Bilirubin IXα (purity >99.5% by absorbance in chloroform, ε453 = 62,000m−1·cm−1) and bilirubin conjugate (ditaurate·2Na) were obtained from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT). Grade 1 egg lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) was purchased from Lipid Products (Surrey, United Kingdom), and cholesterol was obtained from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, andN-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). The fluorescent probes 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (pyranine) and Cascade Blue-conjugated bovine serum albumin as well as anti-Cascade Blue antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by probe sonication using a modification (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) of the technique of Barenholzet al. (20Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) A chloroform solution of phosphatidylcholine was evaporated to dryness under argon atmosphere, solubilized in ether, and re-evaporated to form a uniform film. The lipids then were desiccated overnight under vacuum to remove traces of ether, suspended in 0.1m potassium phosphate solution at pH 7.4 (unless otherwise stated), and sonicated until clear. For the preparation of fluorescence-labeled vesicles, dansyl-PE was added to the lecithin-containing chloroform solution so as to comprise 1 mol % of total phospholipid. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared using a modification (21Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the injection method of Kremer et al.(22Kremer J.M.H. Esker M.W.J. Pathmamanoharan C. Wiersema P.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3932-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) Constituent phospholipids were suspended in ethanol and slowly injected into a magnetically stirred aqueous solution of 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), with vesicle size regulated by the concentration of phospholipid in the injected ethanol. Cascade Blue-conjugated bovine serum albumin (cbBSA) was entrapped at the time of vesicle preparation by injecting the ethanolic phospholipid solution into phosphate buffer containing 50 μm cbBSA. The vesicle suspension (5 ml) was subjected to dialysis against 100 volumes of phosphate buffer three successive times to remove retained ethanol, and unentrapped cbBSA was separated from the vesicles by elution on a Sepharose 4B column (42 × 2.5 cm). Mean vesicle hydrodynamic diameter was determined by quasielastic light scattering (21Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat liver microsomal membranes were isolated from fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats, as described previously (21Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein concentration was quantified by the Bio-Rad assay. Hepatocyte basolateral (bLPM) and canalicular liver plasma membranes were prepared by the method of Meier and Boyer (23Meier P.J. Boyer J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with appropriate enrichment documented by enzymatic assay (21Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies to the α-subunit of the plasma membrane Na+/K+ATPase and with monoclonal antibodies to the canalicular ecto-ATPase (generously provided by Dr. R. Green). Membranes were loaded with cbBSA (50 μm) by homogenization in the presence of the probe, followed by exhaustive washes. The flip-flop rate for unconjugated bilirubin was determined from fluorescence recordings of bilirubin equilibration between a suspension of dansyl-PE-labeled small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles and bovine serum albumin (Fig. 1 A). The binding of bilirubin to dansyl-PE-labeled vesicles causes a reduction in fluorescence intensity due to resonance energy transfer between bilirubin and the dansyl moiety (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since unconjugated bilirubin is poorly soluble at neutral pH, incorporation into phospholipid vesicles was accomplished by dissolving bilirubin in alkaline (pH 12) potassium phosphate (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The addition of a small aliquot (≤1%, v/v) of the bilirubin solution to a suspension of phospholipid vesicles buffered at pH 7.4 in 0.1m potassium phosphate caused no detectable alteration in pH. Alternatively, when indicated, bilirubin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and a small aliquot (≤1%, v/v) was added to the vesicle suspension (24Pascolo L. del Vecchio S. Koehler R.K. Bayon J.E. Webster C.C. Mukerjee P. Ostrow J.D. Tiribelli C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At this low concentration, Me2SO has no discernible affect on membrane physical properties (25Anchordoguy T.J. Carpenter J.F. Crowe J.H. Crowe L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Nogales D. Lightner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the use of either method to solubilize bilirubin yielded identical kinetic results. All steps were performed in diminished light to minimize bilirubin photodegradation. An Aminco-Bowman II fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with an SLM-Aminco MilliFlow stopped-flow reactor (mixing time: 3 ms) facilitated the rapid mixing of a suspension of dansyl-labeled vesicles containing bound bilirubin with an equal volume of a bovine serum albumin solution. Bilirubin equilibration is manifest by a time-dependent reemergence of dansyl fluorescence (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 525 nm), reflecting the transfer of bilirubin from the vesicles to BSA (27Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1074-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The time course was analyzed by fitting the fluorescence curves to the function, F(t)=∑Aiexp(−kit)+CEquation 1 where t is time, k i is theith order rate constant, A i is the amplitude, and C is a constant term. Quality of fit was assessed by regression analysis, and an F-test was applied to determine if the inclusion of an additional term provided a statistically significant improvement in curve fit (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the rapid rate of bilirubin solvation (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), analysis of bilirubin-membrane dissociation was performed with an Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK) fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with an SPF-17 stopped-flow device (mixing time: 0.7 ms). An alternative method utilized for monitoring bilirubin flip-flop involved the preparation of a suspension of bilirubin-containing phosphatidylcholine vesicles, which were mixed, using stopped-flow techniques, with a solution of free cbBSA. Bilirubin binding to cbBSA induces a concentration-dependent decrease in Cascade Blue fluorescence (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 430 nm), and flip-flop rates were calculated from the time course of the quenching of cbBSA. The rate of bilirubin transmembrane diffusion also was determined from the quenching of cbBSA entrapped within model or native membrane vesicles (Fig. 1 B). Membranes were preincubated with anti-Cascade Blue antibodies in order to completely neutralize all residual unincorporated probe; therefore, the quenching of Cascade Blue fluorescence is predicated on bilirubin traversing the acceptor membrane and binding to the entrapped cbBSA. For these studies, bilirubin was incorporated into unlabeled small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine donor vesicles or, alternatively, solubilized in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing Me2SO (20%, v/v). In order to minimize light-scattering effects, experiments utilizing isolated native membrane vesicles employed an emission wavelength of 450 nm with a 440-nm cut-on filter. We previously have shown that the equilibration of bilirubin between unilamellar phospholipid vesicles and BSA occurs via aqueous diffusion (27Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1074-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Assuming that bilirubin flip-flop is significantly slower than membrane dissociation, the equilibration rate (R) can be described by the expression (27Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1074-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Nichols J.W. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), R=KaBSAKaV+[V][BSA]KaBSAKaV1kff+[V][BSA]1koffBSAEquation 2 where k ff represents the flip-flop rate constant, koffBSA represents the dissociation rate constant from BSA, K a represents the association constant, and [BSA] and [V] represent the concentrations of bovine serum albumin and vesicle phospholipid, respectively. Based on this equation, a plot of R versus [V]/[BSA] intersects the y axis atk ff and asymptotically approaches koffBSA at high molar ratios of phospholipid to BSA. Values for the various kinetic parameters were determined by measuring the bilirubin equilibration rate over a range of phospholipid:albumin molar ratios and fitting the data to Equation2. Bilirubin diglucuronide (BDG) was isolated from bile enriched by the intravenous administration of 20 mm unconjugated bilirubin in 3.2% bovine serum albumin to anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (29Blanckaert N. Gollan J.L. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). BDG was extracted with chloroform/ethanol and NaCl-saturated acidified glycine and isolated by thin layer chromatography. The purity of the BDG preparation (>95%) was measured by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (30Spivak W. Carey M.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 255: 787-805Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with the initial mobile phase consisting of a 35% solution of 1% acetic acid and 65% 25 mm sodium acetate in methanol/chloroform (95:5, v/v). After 30 s, the sodium acetate solution was increased in a linear fashion to 100% over 8 min, followed by a linear decrease to 80% over 5 min. The flow rate was maintained constant at 1 ml/min. In order to determine the effect of bilirubin on the internal pH of membrane vesicles, 0.5 mm pyranine, a hydrophilic pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, was dissolved in 25 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) and entrapped within small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles by sonication (31Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Unentrapped pyranine was removed from the medium by elution on a Sephadex G-25 (coarse grade) column (40 × 1 cm). Pyranine-loaded vesicles were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mm phospholipid, and 2 ml of total volume was placed in a temperature-controlled, stirred cuvette. The internal pH of the vesicles, as reflected by the fluorescence intensity of the entrapped pyranine, was monitored continuously at 25 °C using steady-state techniques. Excitation (405 nm) and emission (520 nm) wavelengths were selected so as to minimize bilirubin inner filter effects. At these wavelengths, pyranine fluorescence intensity correlates inversely with pH such that an increase in hydrogen ion concentration manifests as a corresponding increase in probe fluorescence. Flip-flop of bilirubin from the outer to the inner bilayer hemileaflet was monitored by changes in pyranine fluorescence following the addition of a small (10-μl) aliquot of unconjugated bilirubin. To facilitate distinction between fluorescence changes induced by bilirubin absorbance versus those due to alterations in the pH of the entrapped volume, vesicles were pH-clamped by pretreatment with 3 μl (1 μg/mg phospholipid) of an ethanolic solution of the proton/potassium ionophore, nigericin (31Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed to document that the small volume of added ethanol (0.15%, v/v) did not alter the permeability of the vesicles to protons and that there was no effect of the bilirubin vehicle on pyranine fluorescence, either in the presence or absence of nigericin. Flip-flop of bilirubin from the inner to the outer hemileaflet of the membrane bilayer was examined by adding a 10-μl aliquot of bovine serum albumin dissolved in 25 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) to bilirubin-containing vesicles, producing a final BSA concentration of 5 μm. In order to determine whether unconjugated bilirubin is able to spontaneously traverse a membrane bilayer, we studied the equilibration of bilirubin between 1 mol % dansyl-PE-labeled small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles and bovine serum albumin (Fig.2). The resultant fluorescence curve is best described by a double exponential function, suggesting that the equilibration process consists of two kinetically distinct events. We postulate that the fast phase reflects bilirubin dissociation from the external hemileaflet of the vesicle bilayer, while the slow phase, which is readily resolved using a longer sampling interval (Fig. 2,inset), represents bilirubin flip-flop from the inner to the outer hemileaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. In support of this hypothesis, the rate constant for the fast component (k fast) is identical to previously reported bilirubin off-rates from small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The finding that the ratio of the amplitudes of the fastversus slow phases of transfer (A fast:A slow) is identical to the outer:inner surface area of the vesicles (1.8:1) further supports the contention that the slower process corresponds to transmembrane diffusion from the internal to the external hemileaflet of the membrane bilayer. A fluorescence system utilizing phosphatidylcholine vesicles loaded with cbBSA also was employed to verify that the slow component of bilirubin transfer represents bilirubin transmembrane flip-flop. Small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine donor vesicles were preincubated with bilirubin and then rapidly mixed with a suspension of cbBSA-loaded acceptor vesicles (Fig. 3,left panel). Alternatively, when bilirubin was solubilized in phosphate buffer containing 20% Me2SO (in the absence of donor vesicles), a similar flip-flop signal was observed, since bilirubin must traverse the acceptor vesicle bilayer in order to quench cbBSA fluorescence. While the curve obtained in the presence of Me2SO equilibrates at a slightly higher base line due to the enhanced aqueous solubility of bilirubin, the finding that the equilibration rate constant is unaffected by the presence or absence of donor vesicles indicates that diffusion of bilirubin across the acceptor membrane is rate-limiting. Control experiments demonstrate that neither vesicles nor Me2SO have a direct effect on cbBSA fluorescence (Fig. 3, left panel). The transfer of bilirubin from unlabeled phosphatidylcholine donor vesicles to free cbBSA (Fig. 3, right panel) exhibits kinetics comparable with cbBSA-loaded acceptor vesicles, although, in this case, the fluorescence signal reflects bilirubin flip-flop from the inner to the outer hemileaflet of the donor vesicles. This hypothesis is supported by the nearly instantaneous decline in fluorescence that occurs when bilirubin is solubilized in 20% Me2SO, since there is no intervening membrane to impede bilirubin access to cbBSA, and the association rate of bilirubin for cbBSA is more rapid than can be resolved by the stopped-flow apparatus. Hence, the quenching of cbBSA by bilirubin is nearly complete before the first data point is recorded. These findings confirm that a flip-flop signal is observed only when bilirubin and cbBSA are separated by a membrane bilayer. Moreover, the similarity in the equilibration rate between unlabeled (Fig. 3, right panel) and dansyl-labeled (Fig. 2, inset) vesicles indicates that the presence of the dansyl-PE probe does not affect bilirubin flip-flop kinetics. We examined whether the non-hydrogen-bonded, water-soluble bilirubin derivative, bilirubin ditaurate (BDT), is able to diffuse spontaneously through phospholipid bilayers. Since BDT is less efficient than unconjugated bilirubin at quenching cbBSA fluorescence (Fig.4, inset), a 10-fold higher concentration was utilized to ensure that a flip-flop signal would be readily detectable. In contradistinction to unconjugated bilirubin, bilirubin ditaurate causes no significant attenuation in the fluorescence of entrapped cbBSA over a 150-s time course (Fig. 4), indicating that spontaneous diffusion of BDT across phosphatidylcholine bilayers is extremely slow. In control experiments, 20% Me2SO had no effect on the rate of BDT flip-flop, verifying that Me2SO does not alter membrane permeability to this bilirubin conjugate. Results identical to BDT were obtained with the principal physiologic bilirubin conjugate, BDG, while mesobilirubin XIIIα (kindly provided by Dr. D. Lightner), a bilirubin isomer that retains internal hydrogen bonding (26Nogales D. Lightner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), exhibited a flip-flop signal identical to that of bilirubin IXα. These findings suggest that internal hydrogen bonds are permissive to bilirubin transmembrane diffusion. In order to determine the rate of bilirubin transmembrane diffusion, equilibration of bilirubin between dansyl-PE-labeled small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles and BSA was studied over a broad range of donor and acceptor concentrations, and the measured first-order rate constants were plotted against the phospholipid:BSA molar ratio (Fig.5). It is notable that individual transfer curves (Fig. 5, inset) constitute approximately one-third of the total change in fluorescence signal from base line (0 μm BSA), consistent with the internal:external surface area of the vesicles. According to Equation 2, at low ratios of phospholipid to BSA, the equilibration rate (R) approachesk ff, the value of which is calculated to be 5.3 ± 0.6 s−1 (t12=130±15ms; ±S.E.) based on the best fit of the data. Conversely, at high ratios of phospholipid to albumin, R asymptotically approaches koffBSA. The value of 0.16 s−1 obtained from the curve fit is consistent with previously reported bilirubin off-rates from BSA (27Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1074-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Comparable results were obtained when bilirubin equilibration between unlabeled (nonfluorescent) phosphatidylcholine vesicles and cbBSA was examined (data not shown). While it previously has been shown that membrane lipid packing and cholesterol content are key determinants of bilirubin solvation (21Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that neither vesicle hydrodynamic diameter (TableI), nor phospholipid:cholesterol ratios up to 50 mol % (data not shown) significantly altered the rate of bilirubin flip-flop. There also was no difference in the flip-flop rate for vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine as compared with egg phosphatidylcholine, suggesting that acyl chain length and saturation have little impact on the flip-flop process. To investigate why membrane composition and lipid packing do not alter the rate of bilirubin flip-flop, we determined thermodynamic activation parameters by examining bilirubin equilibration between small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles and cbBSA over a temperature range of 10–40 °C (19Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From an Arrhenius plot of the data (Fig.6), the free energy of activation (ΔG ‡) at 25 °C was calculated to be 16.9 kcal/mol, the principal de"

The C-terminal arginine-serine domain of these proteins, such as SF2/ASF, mediates protein-protein interactions and is phosphorylatedin vivo. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SF2/ASF-affinity chromatography, the SF2/ASF kinase activity was co-purified from HeLa cells with a 95-kDa protein, which was recognized by an anti-SR protein kinase (SRPK) 1 monoclonal antibody. Recombinant SRPK1 and SRPK2 bound to and phosphorylated GST-SF2/ASF in vitro. Phosphopeptide mapping showed that identical sites were phosphorylated in the pull-down kinase reaction with HeLa extracts and by recombinant SRPKs. Epitope-tagged SF2/ASF transiently expressed in COS7 cells co-immunoprecipitated with SRPKs. Deletion analysis mapped the phosphorylation sites to a region containing an (Arg-Ser)8 repeat beginning at residue 204, and far-Western analysis showed that the region is required for binding of SRPKs to SF2/ASF. Further binding studies showed that SRPKs bound unphosphorylated SF2/ASF but did not bind phosphorylated SF2/ASF. Expression of an SRPK2 kinase-inactive mutant caused accumulation of SF2/ASF in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that the formation of complexes between SF2/ASF and SRPKs, which is influenced by the phosphorylation state of SF2/ASF, may have regulatory roles in the assembly and localization of this splicing factor. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins play an important role in constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. The C-terminal arginine-serine domain of these proteins, such as SF2/ASF, mediates protein-protein interactions and is phosphorylatedin vivo. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SF2/ASF-affinity chromatography, the SF2/ASF kinase activity was co-purified from HeLa cells with a 95-kDa protein, which was recognized by an anti-SR protein kinase (SRPK) 1 monoclonal antibody. Recombinant SRPK1 and SRPK2 bound to and phosphorylated GST-SF2/ASF in vitro. Phosphopeptide mapping showed that identical sites were phosphorylated in the pull-down kinase reaction with HeLa extracts and by recombinant SRPKs. Epitope-tagged SF2/ASF transiently expressed in COS7 cells co-immunoprecipitated with SRPKs. Deletion analysis mapped the phosphorylation sites to a region containing an (Arg-Ser)8 repeat beginning at residue 204, and far-Western analysis showed that the region is required for binding of SRPKs to SF2/ASF.

These results suggest that the formation of complexes between SF2/ASF and SRPKs, which is influenced by the phosphorylation state of SF2/ASF, may have regulatory roles in the assembly and localization of this splicing factor. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential process required for the expression of most eukaryotic protein-coding genes. Splicing catalysis occurs in a spliceosome complex (1Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Components of the spliceosome include the U1, U2, and U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; SR protein, serine/arginine-rich protein; SRPK, SR protein-specific kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RS domain, domain rich in arginine-serine dipeptide repeat; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; aa, amino acid.1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; SR protein, serine/arginine-rich protein; SRPK, SR protein-specific kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RS domain, domain rich in arginine-serine dipeptide repeat; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; aa, amino acid.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The latter include all members of the SR protein family, which play important roles during mammalian spliceosome assembly. All SR proteins have one or two N-terminal RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal domain rich in arginine-serine dipeptide repeats (RS domain). The RS domain is involved in protein-protein interactions with related domains of other splicing factors, and these interactions are thought to be important for splice site selection (4Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 5Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Gercia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).The SR proteins are phosphorylated at multiple serines located predominantly within the RS domain (6Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 7Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). At least eight members of the SR family contain phosphopeptides that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody mAb104 (8Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides derived from SF2/ASF showed that the RS domain of this protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites both in vivo and in vitro (7Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of SR protein phosphorylation is unknown, recent studies suggested that phosphorylation of the RS domain of SF2/ASF enhances the interactions between this domain and the U1–70K polypeptide and that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation cycles may be required for splicing (9Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 10Cao W. Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA. 1997; 3: 1456-1467PubMed Google Scholar).Several protein kinases can phosphorylate SR proteins, such as SF2/ASF, within its RS domain in vitro. A U1 snRNP-associated kinase was the first kinase activity reported to phosphorylate RS domains although cDNAs encoding this kinase have not been isolated (11Woppmann A. Will C.L. Kornstadt U. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Luhrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2275-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A second kinase, SRPK1, was purified and cloned on the basis of its ability to phosphorylate SC35 or other SR proteins in vitro(6Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 12Gui J.F. Tronchere H. Chandler S.D. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10824-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The Clk/Sty kinase has an RS domain at its N terminus and was found to interact with several members of the SR protein family in a yeast two-hybrid screen (7Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). SRPK2, for which we isolated a mouse brain cDNA, also gave the same pattern of serine phosphorylation of SF2/ASF in vitro as SRPK1 (13Kuroyanagi N. Onogi H. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 242: 357-364Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and is probably identical to WBP, a cDNA fragment isolated as encoding a WW-domain-binding protein in a two-hybrid screen (14Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A human cDNA for SRPK2 was also recently isolated from a fetal brain library (15Wang H.-Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition to these recently identified kinases, protein kinases C and A can also phosphorylate SF2/ASF in vitro (7Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), as can the p34cdc2 kinase (32Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Honda R. Yasuda H. Wakabayashi T. Nimura Y. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 872-878Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA topoisomerase I has been reported to phosphorylate SR proteins although it has no obvious kinase domain (16Rossi F. Labourier E. Fornr T. Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J.F. Antone E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Finally, a nuclear envelope-bound kinase activity phosphorylates the RS motif at the N-terminal domain of the lamin B receptor (17Nikolakaki E. Meier J. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6208-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).To identify kinases that bind specifically to SF2/ASF in mammalian cells, we performed pull-down kinase assays using a GST-SF2/ASF fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. We found that SRPK1 and SRPK2 interact specifically with the RS domain of SF2/ASF in a manner that depends on the phosphorylation state of SF2/ASF. This interaction appears to modulate the subcellular localization of SF2/ASF.RESULTSRecombinant human GST-SF2/ASF was expressed in and purified fromE. coli. The protein was incubated with HeLa cell extract and recovered by pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then used for kinase reactions in the presence of radiolabeled ATP (Fig. 1 A). Phosphorylation of the 60-kDa GST-SF2/ASF protein, detected by autoradiography (lane 1), suggested the existence of an SF2/ASF-associated kinase in HeLa cell extracts.To purify the kinase that binds to and phosphorylates SF2/ASF in HeLa cells, we used affinity chromatography. The extracts were loaded on a GST-SF2/ASF-glutathione-Sepharose column, and bound material was eluted with a salt gradient. Individual fractions were assayed and SF2/ASF kinase activity eluted between 300–500 mm salt, whereas the bulk of bound protein eluted between 100–200 mm salt (Fig. 1 B). SDS-PAGE and silver staining analysis of the active fractions revealed a prominent band with a relative molecular mass of 95 kDa (Fig. 1 C). The 95-kDa protein reacted with a monoclonal antibody against SRPK1 (Fig. 1 D).The association of SRPK1 in HeLa extracts with GST-SF2/ASF was confirmed by Western blotting of the complexes with anti-SRPK1 antibody (Fig. 2). GST-SF2/ASF or GST were incubated in HeLa cell nuclear (NE, lanes 1 and3) or cytosolic S100 (lanes 2 and 4) extract and recovered by pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The complexes were recovered and analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against SRPK1.Figure 2Western blotting of GST-SF2/ASF-bound SRPK1 of HeLa cells. GST or GST-SF2/ASF were incubated in HeLa cell nuclear (NE, lanes 1 and 3) or cytosolic S100 (lanes 2 and 4) extracts and recovered by pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The complexes were recovered and analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against SRPK1. The mobility of SRPK1 is indicated on theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The pull-down kinase assays were also carried out using recombinant SRPK1 and SRPK2, instead of the HeLa extract (Fig.3 A). Both SRPK1 and SRPK2 bound stably to and subsequently phosphorylated GST-SF2/ASF under these conditions (lanes 2 and 3), whereas Clk/Sty did not (lane 4).Figure 3Pull-down assay of recombinant SF2/ASF kinases. A, GST-SF2/ASF was incubated with HeLa cell extract (lane 1), recombinant HA-SRPK1 (lane 2), HA-SRPK2 (lane 3), or GST-Clk/Sty kinase (lane 4). As a negative control, GST protein was incubated with SRPK1 (lane 5), SRPK2 (lane 6), or Clk/Sty (lane 7). After incubation, the GST-SF2/ASF and GST proteins were recovered by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the immobilized complexes were phosphorylated in vitro. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The mobility of GST-SF2/ASF is indicated on the right. B, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of phosphorylated GST-SF2/ASF. After the pull-down kinase assay, the phosphorylated SF2/ASF bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, digested with trypsin, and the fragments were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a, HeL, HeLa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We compared the phosphorylation sites of SF2/ASF phosphorylated by the GST-SF2/ASF-bound kinase in HeLa extracts (Fig. 3 B,panel a), recombinant SRPK1 (Fig. 3 B, panel b), or recombinant SRPK2 (Fig. 3 B, panel c) using two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography. The resulting patterns are indistinguishable. These results suggest that the SRPKs are the major kinases capable of associating with GST-SF2/ASF in HeLa cell extracts.To determine whether SRPKs interact with SF2/ASF in vivo, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments. HA-tagged SRPK1 or SRPK2 and myc-tagged SF2/ASF expression plasmids were transiently transfected into COS7 cells, and the cells were harvested and lysed at 48 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with either anti-c-Myc (Fig. 4 A) or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4 B), and the immunoprecipitates were then incubated in kinase buffer in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. Phosphorylated SF2/ASF was detected only when both SRPK and SF2/ASF expression plasmids were co-transfected (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 4 B,lanes 2 and 3), although the endogenous kinase gave a faint band (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). These results indicate that SF2/ASF and the SRPKs can form stable complexesin vivo. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis (Fig. 4 C). Complexes between SF2/ASF and SRPKs were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA polyclonal antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and epitope-tagged SF2/ASF was detected with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. When myc-tagged SF2/ASF was co-transfected with HA-tagged SRPK1 or SRPK2, the 35-kDa myc-tagged SF2/ASF polypeptide was detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate (Fig.4 C, lanes 2 and 3), again demonstrating a stable interaction between SF2/ASF and the SRPKs.Figure 4Binding of SRPK1 or SRPK2 to SF2/ASF in COS7 cells. A, COS7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing myc-tagged SF2/ASF and a HA-tagged kinase: SRPK1 (lane 2) or SRPK2 (lane 3). Extracts were prepared at 48 h post-transfection, and myc-SF2/HA-kinase complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were incubated under in vitrophosphorylation conditions, and labeled proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The mobility of epitope-tagged SF2/ASF is indicated on the right. B, same as panel A, but the complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA polyclonal antibody. C, same as panel B, but the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because the RS domain of SR proteins is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (4Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 5Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Gercia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), we constructed several deletion mutants of the RS domain of SF2/ASF to determine what regions are required for stable interaction with the SRPKs (Fig.5 A). The deleted proteins, ΔRS (aa 1–197), Δ204 (aa 1–203), Δ227 (aa 1–226), Δ234 (aa 1–233), and Δ238 (aa 1–237), as well as the wild-type parent protein (aa 1–248) were prepared as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig. 5 B, top). The ability of these proteins to interact with SRPKs was examined by a far-Western assay. The recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The filters were incubated with recombinant HA-SRPK1, and the bound kinase was detected using anti-SRPK1 antibody (Fig.5 B, middle). SRPK1 bound to Δ227, Δ234, and Δ238 but not to ΔRS or Δ204. The latter two mutants lack a segment of eight consecutive RS dipeptide repeats. In agreement with these results, Δ227, Δ234, and Δ238 were phosphorylated by SRPK1in vitro, whereas neither ΔRS nor Δ204 proteins could be phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B, bottom). Identical results were obtained with SRPK2 (data not shown). Together, these results show that the SRPK phosphorylation sites in SF2/ASF are located within a region containing the eight RS repeats (aa 204–226) and that the same site is required for stable interaction between these kinases and SF2/ASF.Figure 5Deletion analysis of SF2/ASF domains required for SRPK1 binding.

The blot was incubated with SRPK1 protein, and SF2/ASF-bound SRPK1 was visualized with anti-SRPK1 antibody. Bottom, in vitrophosphorylation of SF2/ASF mutants by SRPK1. 0.3 μg of the indicated proteins was phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant SRPK1. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we examined the effect of SF2/ASF phosphorylation on protein-protein interactions between SF2/ASF and SRPK1. The phosphorylation state of SF2/ASF was checked by the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, left panel). The interaction of HA-tagged SRPK1 with either phosphorylated (ATP+) or unphosphorylated (ATP−) SF2/ASF was examined by the far-Western assay (Fig. 6, right panel), and the interaction efficiencies were quantitated by the relative intensity of the staining for HA-SRPK1. The SRPK1 bound to unphosphorylated SF2/ASF was 5 times more than that bound to phosphorylated SF2/ASF, indicating that the interaction between these proteins depends on the phosphorylation state of SF2/ASF.Figure 6Effect of SF2/ASF phosphorylation state on interaction with SRPK1. Left, Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining; right, SF2/ASF was incubated with SRPK1 in the presence (+) or absence (−) of ATP. Phosphorylated (+) or unphosphorylated (−) SF2/ASF were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with SRPK1 and probed with anti-SRPK1 antibody as in Fig. 5 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As addition of SRPK1 kinase to permeabilized cells or overexpression of Clk/Sty kinase results in a diffuse distribution of SC35, it has been suggested that hyperphosphorylation of the RS domains may control the subcellular distributions of SR proteins (6Gui J.F.

We likewise observed that expression of SRPK2 induced changes in the subcellular localization of transfected SF2/ASF (Fig.7, g and h) and endogenous SC35 (13Kuroyanagi N. Onogi H. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 242: 357-364Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SRPK1 also changed the subcellular localization of both endogenous and transiently expressed SF2/ASF (Fig. 7, c-f). To examine the effect of direct interaction of SF2/ASF with SRPKs on the subcellular localization of SF2/ASF, we analyzed the distribution of SF2/ASF in cells expressing a catalytically inactive kinase mutant, SRPK2K108R, and observed that SF2/ASF accumulated in the cytoplasm of cells expressing the inactive SRPK2 (Fig. 7, i and j). In contrast, a mutant that lacks the presumed SF2/ASF-interaction domain, had no effect on the distribution of SF2/ASF (data not shown).Figure 7Effect of SRPKs expression on SF2/ASF distribution. HeLa cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing myc-tagged SF2/ASF and HA-tagged SRPKs and then fixed 24 h after transfection. Localization of endogenous SF2/ASF (a and d) and myc-SF2/ASF (b,f, h, and j) were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence staining of transfected HeLa cells using an anti-SF2/ASF monoclonal antibody or an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody followed by Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody.

Mayeda A. Maniatis T. Krainer A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11224-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of SR proteins appears to influence their activities in general, and alternative splicing, as well as their subnuclear localization and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport properties. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) can block an early step of spliceosome assembly (23Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and can affect alternative 5′ splice-site selectionin vitro (24Cardinali B. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These effects are thought to occur via dephosphorylation of SR proteins, because addition of phosphorylated SR proteins relieved the block to spliceosome assembly (23Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Nuclear speckles are subnuclear domains where SR proteins and other splicing components are concentrated, and they are thought to represent sites of storage or assembly for splicing factors (25Fu X.-D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). SRPK1 was originally identified as a kinase of SC35 in extracts from HeLa cells (6Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 12Gui J.F. Tronchere H. Chandler S.D. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10824-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Addition of purified SRPK1 to permeabilized cells or overexpression of SRPK1 or Clk/Sty in transfected cells results in an apparent disassembly of the nuclear speckles (6Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 7Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These results suggest that phosphorylation, or hyperphosphorylation, causes release of these factors from the speckles, or perhaps that the integrity of these structures is compromised.Information about kinases that can phosphorylate SR proteins has recently been obtained. Although the kinase domains of SRPK1 and Clk/Sty are approximately 30% identical, including key amino acids that are expected to be involved in substrate specificity (6Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), SRPK1 has a more restricted substrate specificity in vitro (26Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Cáceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24569-24575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Clk/Sty phosphorylates the basic proteins histone H1 and myelin basic protein, albeit to a lower specific activity than it phosphorylates SF2/ASF. It does not phosphorylate more acidic substrates, such as β-casein, enolase, or an N-terminal region of c-Jun (26Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Cáceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24569-24575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SRPK1 was calculated to be 150-fold more active with SF2/ASF than Clk/Sty with SF2/ASF as the substrate (26Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Cáceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24569-24575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The K m values for SF2/ASF were similar (0.28 μm for SRPK1, 0.40 μm for Clk/Sty), indicating that SRPK1 turns over SF2/ASF much faster than Clk/Sty does. Our present findings are consistent with these published data. We found that SRPK1 and SRPK2 interact more strongly with SF2/ASF than Clk/Sty does but that this interaction is weakened upon phosphorylation, allowing product release.Clk/Sty has an RS domain at its N-terminus, through which it was shown to interact with five RNA-binding proteins, including three SR proteins, in a two-hybrid screen (7Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Our pull-down kinase assay failed to detect an interaction between SF2/ASF and Clk/Sty. The discrepancy may be attributable to the higher sensitivity of the two-hybrid screen for what may be weak or transient interactions, or perhaps the phosphorylation states of the SF2/ASF and Clk/Sty RS domains are different in vitro and in yeast, with the latter resulting in more stable interactions. Alternatively, the interaction of the Clk/Sty RS domain with SF2/ASF may be weak but long lived compared with the interaction between the SRPKs and SF2/ASF, resulting in the slower release of SF2/ASF from Clk/Sty.SRPK1 was reported to be closely related in sequence to a hypotheticalCaenorhabditis elegans kinase (CEHK) and to the fission yeast kinase Dsk1 (6Gui J.F.

Onogi H. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 242: 357-364Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of SRPK2 is 58% identical to that of human SRPK1 and 32% similar to that of yeast Dsk1. Immunolocalization experiments showed that both SRPK1 and SRPK2 are primarily localized in the cytoplasm, despite having putative nuclear localization signals (13Kuroyanagi N. Onogi H. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 242: 357-364Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, SF2/ASF accumulates in the nucleus, concentrating in the speckle domains (29Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The RS domain of SF2/ASF is a nuclear targeting signal, although it is not sufficient to direct accumulation in the speckle domains. The RS domain of SF2/ASF is also involved in shuttling of the protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and co-expression of Clk/Sty, presumably resulting in hyperphosphorylation of SF2/ASF, interferes with shuttling, resulting in accumulation of SF2/ASF in the cytoplasm (30Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Expression of a catalytically inactive kinase mutant, Clk/StyK190R had a much more limited effect on the distribution of SR proteins, suggesting that the phosphorylation state of SR proteins strongly influences their cellular distribution. The present study, however, shows that SF2/ASF accumulated in the cytoplasm even in cells expressing the catalytically inact"

TIMP-3 behaved more like TIMP-2 than TIMP-1, showing rapid association with gelatinases A and B. Experiments with the N-terminal domain of gelatinase A, the isolated C-terminal domain, or an inactive progelatinase A mutant showed that the hemopexin domain of gelatinase A makes an important contribution to the interaction with TIMP-3. The exchange of portions of the gelatinase A hemopexin domain with that of stromelysin revealed that residues 568–631 of gelatinase A were required for rapid association with TIMP-3. The N-terminal domain of gelatinase B alone also showed slower association with TIMP-3, again implying significant C-domain interactions. The isolation of complexes between TIMP-3 and progelatinases A and B on gelatin-agarose demonstrated that TIMP-3 binds to both proenzymes. We analyzed the effect of various polyanions on the inhibitory activity of TIMP-3 in our soluble assay. The association rate was increased by dextran sulfate, heparin, and heparan sulfate, but not by dermatan sulfate or hyaluronic acid. Because TIMP-3 is sequestered in the extracellular matrix, the presence of certain heparan sulfate proteoglycans could enhance its inhibitory capacity.

In this study, we have assessed the ability of TIMP-3 to associate with active MMPs using a kinetic method, and we have compared this with TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. We have also investigated the contribution of the C-terminal domains of both gelatinase A and gelatinase B to the interaction with TIMP-3, because this has important implications for the regulation of proenzyme activation. We have tested the effect of heparin and other polyanions on TIMP-3 activity in our soluble kinetic assay to determine whether interaction with similar components of the extracellular matrix could affect the capacity of TIMP-3 to inhibit MMPs.

The effect of ionic strength was analyzed by increasing the concentration of NaCl in the standard buffer from 0.1 m to 0.25 m and 0.5m. For competition assays, various concentrations of (Δ1–414)gelatinase A or proE375A-gelatinase A were added to the cuvette with the gelatinase A before the addition of TIMP-2 or TIMP-3. Because the K i values for the TIMP:gelatinase A interaction are unknown, the K i and theK d for the TIMP:competitor interaction are expressed as relative values using an arbitrary value of 1 for theK i. The relationship between the two dissociation constants is given in Equation 1: Kd=(Ff·EI)(FI·Ef)·KiEquation 1 in which EI and E f are the TIMP:gelatinase A complex and free gelatinase A, respectively, whereasFI and F f are the TIMP:competitor complex and free competitor, respectively. Equation 1 can be rewritten as: Kd=(Ft−FI)(Et−Ef)(It−[Et−Ef]−If)·Ef·KiEquation 2 in which F t, E t, and I t are total reagent concentrations. In our assays, F t≫FI, andI f is negligible, so Equation 2 can be simplified to Equation 3, from which the relative K dcan be readily calculated.

Complexes with progelatinases were isolated on gelatin-Sepharose that had been blocked with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TCABN. The column was washed with TCABN, and bound material was eluted with TCABN containing 15% dimethyl sulfoxide. Eluates were analyzed by rabbit collagenase diffuse collagen fibril assays (39Murphy G.

Approximately 1 μg of each TIMP was applied to heparin-agarose (blocked with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in TCABN buffer. Columns were washed with TCABN, and proteins were eluted stepwise with the same buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and then 2 m NaCl. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed for TIMP content by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining and by rabbit collagenase diffuse collagen fibril assay (39Murphy G.

TIMPs were diluted in fluorometry buffer and used in assays as above. We analyzed the inhibition of active gelatinase A, gelatinase B, stromelysin-1, and matrilysin by TIMP-3 using continuous fluorometric assays with the appropriate fluorescent peptide substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). As discussed previously for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (20Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we were unable to obtain accurate values ofK i (<200 pm). Our measurements were therefore limited to the association rate constants (k on) at low reagent concentrations, over a range where the observed rate was linear with TIMP concentration. In Table I, the data are compared withk on values for TIMP-2 that were re-assayed at the same time and k on values for TIMP-1 derived from our previous work (25Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J.P. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three TIMPs bound relatively slowly to stromelysin-1 and matrilysin. In general, we found that TIMP-3 was more like TIMP-2 than TIMP-1, showing rapid binding to gelatinase A and slower association with gelatinase B. The contribution of the C-terminal domains of gelatinase A and gelatinase B to TIMP-3 binding was assessed by measuring the association rate of the isolated catalytic domains, (Δ418–631)gelatinase A and (Δ426–688)gelatinase B. Whereas TIMP-2 binding was only affected by the loss of the gelatinase A C-terminal domain, TIMP-3 association was slower in the absence of the C-terminal domains of both gelatinase A and gelatinase B (1400-fold and 12.5-fold, respectively). The effect of ionic strength on the rate of association of gelatinase A and TIMP-3 was analyzed at increasing NaCl concentrations. Similar to TIMP-2 (20Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), there was a marked decrease in k onfrom 16.0 × 106m−1·s−1 in 0.1 mNaCl to 9.6 × 106m−1·s−1 (0.25 mNaCl) and 7.3 × 106m−1·s−1 (0.5 mNaCl), suggesting that ionic interactions are involved in the association of gelatinase A and TIMP-3. The contribution of the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A to TIMP-3 binding was assessed by measuring the effect of adding increasing amounts of (Δ1–414)gelatinase A (the isolated C-terminal domain) or proE375A-gelatinase A (an inactive form of progelatinase A) to the inhibition assay and observing the effect on the association rate for active full-length gelatinase A. The effect on inhibition by TIMP-2 was also measured for comparison. The increase in the final steady-state velocity and the decreased rate of inhibition observed with increasing concentrations of (Δ1–414)gelatinase A and proE375A-gelatinase A were deduced to be due to an effective decrease in TIMP-3 concentration by binding to the C-terminal domain, as was seen for TIMP-2 (20Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to obtain an estimate for K d, the dissociation constant, relative to the K i for the appropriate TIMP:gelatinase A interaction (Table II). The interaction of TIMP-3 with (1–414)gelatinase A was significant but was around 16-fold weaker than the interaction of TIMP-2. The interaction between TIMP-3 and proE375A-gelatinase A was about five times weaker than that for TIMP-2. In both cases, the interaction of the TIMPs with proE375A-gelatinase A was stronger than that with the isolated C-terminal domain, which suggests that additional sites of interaction exist in the proenzyme-TIMP complex.Table IIEstimation of the dissociation constant for binding of (Δ1–414)gelatinase A or proE375A-gelatinase A to TIMP-3 and TIMP-2TIMPCompetitorRelativeK d ± S.E.TIMP-3(Δ1–414)Gelatinase A1366 ± 425 (n = 10)TIMP-2(Δ1–414)Gelatinase A88 ± 15 (n = 10)TIMP-3proE375A-gelatinase A231 ± 66 (n = 10)TIMP-2proE375A-gelatinase A50 ± 8 (n = 8)Inhibition assays were carried out at 25 °C with increasing amounts of either (Δ1–414)gelatinase A or proE375A-gelatinase A.

To further characterize the region of gelatinase A responsible for the C-terminal domain interaction, we used two C-terminal domain mutants: regions of the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A were exchanged for the corresponding regions of the C-terminal domain of stromelysin-1, which does not interact significantly with the TIMPs (25Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As was the case for TIMP-2 (36Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. Schade van Westrum S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), replacement of residues 418–474 in N-G.C-SGG did not affect the rate of association with TIMP-3 (k on= 17.0 × 106m−1·s−1, compared with 16.5 × 106m−1·s−1 for gelatinase A). However, the additional substitution of residues 568–631 in N-G.C-SGS reduced the rate of association of TIMP-3 with gelatinase A by a factor of 100 to 0.1 × 106m−1·s−1, suggesting that residues 568–631 of gelatinase A are crucial for the interaction with TIMP-3. Because the kinetic data suggested that TIMP-3 has significant interactions with the hemopexin domains of gelatinase A and gelatinase B, we assessed the ability of TIMP-3 to bind to various pro form constructs of gelatinases A and B, in which normal catalytic domain interactions are precluded due to the presence of the propeptide domain (Table III). A small amount of TIMP-3 alone bound to the gelatin-Sepharose matrix. Enhanced retention of TIMP-3 was observed after preincubation with progelatinase A or progelatinase B, suggesting that TIMP-3 shows significant binding to both proenzymes. TIMP-3 was recovered in the unbound fraction after incubation with pro(Δ418–631)gelatinase A or pro(Δ426–688)gelatinase B. TIMP-3 bound to gelatin-Sepharose after preincubation with proN-G.C-SGG but did not bind if proN-G.C-SGS or proN-GL.C-SL were used. TIMP-2 was re"

Four human ACAT-1 mRNAs (7.0, 4.3, 3.6, and 2.8 kilobases (kb)) share the same short 5′-untranslated region (exon 1) and coding sequence (exons 2–15). The 4.3-kb mRNA contains an additional 5′-untranslated region (1289 nucleotides in length; exons Xa and Xb) immediately upstream from the exon 1 sequence. One ACAT-1 genomic DNA insert covers exons 1–16 and a promoter (the P1 promoter). A separate insert covers exon Xa (1277 base pairs) and a different promoter (the P7 promoter). Gene mapping shows that exons 1–16 and the P1 promoter sequences are located in chromosome 1, while exon Xa and the P7 promoter sequence are located in chromosome 7. RNase protection assays demonstrate three different protected fragments, corresponding to the 4.3-kb mRNA and the two other mRNAs transcribed from the two promoters. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the 4.3-kb mRNA is produced from two different chromosomes, by a novel RNA recombination mechanism involving trans-splicing of two discontinuous precursor RNAs."

We demonstrate that a novel LCT (TcdB-1470) from Clostridium difficile strain 1470 is a functional hybrid between “reference” TcdB-10463 andClostridium sordellii TcsL-1522. It bound to the same specific receptor as TcdB-10463 but glucosylated the same GTP-binding proteins as TcsL-1522. All three toxins had equal enzymatic potencies but were equally cytotoxic only when microinjected. When applied extracellularly TcdB-1470 and TcdB-10463 were considerably more potent cytotoxins than TcsL-1522. The small GTP-binding protein R-Ras was identified as a target for TcdB-1470 and also for TcsL-1522 but not for TcdB-10463. R-Ras is known to control integrin-extracellular matrix interactions from inside the cell. Its glucosylation may be a major determinant for the cell rounding and detachment induced by the two R-Ras-attacking toxins. In contrast, fibroblasts treated with TcdB-10463 were arborized and remained attached, with phosphotyrosine containing structures located at the cell-to-cell contacts and β3-integrin remaining at the tips of cellular protrusions. These components were absent from cells treated with the R-Ras-inactivating toxins. The novel hybrid toxin will broaden the utility of the LCTs for clarifying the functions of several small GTPases, now including also R-Ras.

The novel hybrid toxin will broaden the utility of the LCTs for clarifying the functions of several small GTPases, now including also R-Ras. Bacteria of the genus Clostridium produce a wide variety of toxins displaying different enzymatic activities. Among them, the large clostridial cytotoxins (LCTs) 1The abbreviations used are: LCTs, large clostridial cytotoxins; TcdA, C. difficile toxin A; TcdB, C. difficile toxin B; TcsH, C. sordelliihemorrhagic toxin; TcsL, C. sordellii lethal toxin; Tcnα, C. novyi α-toxin; CPE, cytopathic effect; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellularly regulated kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. comprise the largest bacterial protein toxins known, ranging in size from 250 to 308 kDa (1Eichel-Streiber C.V. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). So far, five toxins belong to this group: the Clostridium difficile toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB), the Clostridium sordellii hemorrhagic and lethal toxins (TcsH and TcsL) and α-toxin (Tcnα) from Clostridium novyi. TcdA and TcdB are responsible for the symptoms in C. difficile-induced antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, whereas TcsH, TcsL, and Tcnα are virulence factors in gas gangrene (1Eichel-Streiber C.V. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In cultured cells the LCTs elicit cytopathic effects (CPEs) characterized by collapse of the actin cytoskeleton followed by arborization and/or rounding up of the cells. This effect is due to a glycosylation of different small GTP-binding proteins (2Thelestam M. Florin I. Chaves-Olarte E. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 141-158Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sugar moiety from either UDP-glucose or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine is transferred to a conserved threonine in the effector region of the target protein. The GTP-binding protein is inactivated, its proper interaction with immediate downstream effectors is impaired, and normal cell signaling is interrupted (3Aktories K. Just I. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The CPEs induced by the different LCTs depend on the targets attacked. In fibroblasts TcdA, TcdB, and Tcnα induce an arborizing effect (1Eichel-Streiber C.V. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reported to arise upon modification of Rho alone, although these toxins also affect Rac and Cdc42 (3Aktories K.

It is not known which GTP-binding protein target(s) is crucial for the TcsL-induced morphology. A new member of the LCT family was recently identified in a sero group F strain of C. difficile and named TcdB-1470 (the number indicates the strain from which it was isolated) (8Eichel-Streiber C.V. Meyer D. Habermann E. Sartingen S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Depitre C. Delmee M. Avesani V. Haridon R.L. Roels A. Popoff M. Corthier G. J. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 38: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this toxin shows an overall identity of 93 and 75% with TcdB-10463 (“reference” TcdB) and TcsL-1522, respectively. Despite the high overall identity of TcdB-1470 with TcdB-10463, it is only 79% in the first 560 amino acids comprising the catalytic domain (Fig.1). On the other hand, the identity is 99% in the carboxyl-terminal domain where the receptor-binding region is located (10Sauerborn M. Leukel P. Eichel-Streiber Cv. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 155: 45-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to this polarized identity of TcdB-1470 with TcdB-10463, the sequence comparison with TcsL reflects the overall identity in both domains (Fig. 1). In this work we have characterized TcdB-1470, in terms of its cell surface binding, cytotoxic and enzymatic potencies, substrate pattern, and type of CPE. Comparing these parameters with those of TcdB-10463 and TcsL-1522 established the hybrid character of TcdB-1470. Importantly, R-Ras was identified as a major substrate for TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522. The significance of this novel substrate for development of the TcsL-like CPE is discussed. TcdB-10463, TcsL-1522, and TcdB-1470 were prepared as described (11Eichel-Streiber C. Harperath C. Bosse D. Hadding U. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 2: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The toxin preparations showed >95% purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE. UDP-[14C]Glc (specific activity, 318 mCi/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products andN-succinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxy, 5[125I]iodophenyl)propionate (specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-vinculin antibody was from Sigma, and anti-ERK1 antibody and anti-β3-integrin antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Goat antiserum against TcdB was obtained from Dr. D. M. Lyerly (Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA). Mouse antiserum against TcsL was provided by Dr. M. R. Popoff (Institut Pasteur, Unité de Toxines Microbiennes, Paris, France). Recombinant proteins Rho, Rac, Cdc42, Ras, and Rap were provided by Dr. P. Boquet (INSERM, Nice, France). A GST-Ral fusion protein was made as follows: The rat RalA clone (accession number L19698, a gift from Gary M. Wildey, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) and the primers: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCTGCAAACAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCGTTATAAAATGCAGCA-3′ were used for polymerase chain reaction. The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-KT and verified by sequencing. The plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL-21 strain, and expression of the RalA-GST fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The GST-R-Ras fusion protein construct was a generous gift from Adrienne Cox (University of North Carolina). All recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and cleaved with the appropriate protease. Proteases were removed with benzamidine Sepharose 6B. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from local commercial sources. Binary alignment was performed by the SIM software (ExPASy Molecular Biology Server) (12Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar) after translation of DNA sequences with the following accession numbers: TcdB-10463, X53138; TcsL-1522, X82638; and TcdB-1470, Z23277. Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (Don cells, CCL-16; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Crister Höög (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden) and cultured in Dulbecco's medium supplemented as above. Both cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cytotoxic activities were titrated on cells cultivated to 90% confluence in 96-well plates. The initial toxin concentration was 2 μg/ml, and subsequent 1:10 dilutions were made. Cytotoxicity was scored microscopically, and the results were expressed as percentages of affected cells. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (13Chaves-Olarte E. Florin I. Boquet P. Popoff M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6693-6925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 75-cm2 flasks were rinsed, mechanically removed, and washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.8) and sonicated five times for 5 s. After centrifugation (14,000 g, 3 min), the supernatant was used as postnuclear cell lysate. The amount of protein in lysates was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subconfluent Don and Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with TcdB-10463 (50 ng/ml for 1 h), TcdB-1470 (50 ng/ml for 1 h), and TcsL-1522 (600 ng/ml for 6 h). Control cells were not treated. After treatment the cells were chemically immobilized with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, at 4 °C for 2 h and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Agar Scientific Lta., Cambridge, UK) in phosphate buffer for 30 min. The fixed cells were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and frozen in tert-butyl alcohol (T. J. Baker, Inc., Phillisburg, NJ). Cells were freeze-dried by sublimation and coated with 20 nm of gold/palladium (10 mAmp, 2 min). Cells were observed and photographed with a S-570 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) Scanning Electron Microscope operating at 15 kV. Don cells were cultivated on 13-mm slides for 48 h. Toxin antiserum (1:100) was added to the medium to neutralize any toxin molecules leaking from the injection needle. Goat anti-TcdB-10463 was used for both TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470 injections. Mouse anti-TcsL was used for TcsL-1522 injections. Semiconfluent cells were microinjected (Automatic Eppendorf Microinjector) with TcdB-10463, TcsL-1522, or TcdB-1470 diluted in 0.01m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at the concentrations defined in figure legends. The solution contained 2% fluorescein dextran to localize microinjected cells. After microinjection, cells were incubated 2 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Fisher). The CPE of microinjected cells was determined by phase contrast microscopy. Three different fields (400×) were analyzed per experiment, and the activity of the toxins was expressed as the percentage of affected cells/microinjected (fluorescent) cells. 5 μl of UDP-[14C]Glc dissolved in ethanol were vacuum dried, and 10 μl of cell lysate (5 mg protein/ml) or 10 μl of lysis buffer containing recombinant Rho, Rac, Cdc42, Rap1, Rap2, Ras, Ral, or R-Ras (1–3 μg) were added. The final concentration of UDP-[14C]Glc was 30 μm. The mixtures were incubated 1 h at 37 °C with TcdB-10463, TcsL-1522, or TcdB-1470 at the concentrations defined in figure legends. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C in sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (15O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands or spots were detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity of the bands was calculated using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The result was expressed as a percentage of the labeling obtained with the highest toxin concentration (5 μg/ml). For differential glucosylation experiments, cells were treated in vivo with the indicated toxins until 100% CPE was achieved. Cell lysates were then prepared and processed for glucosylation as described above. TcdB-10463 was labeled with125I as described previously (16Chaves-Olarte E. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Total binding of125I-TcdB-10463 was determined by the addition of ice-cold125I-TcdB-10463 (2 μg/ml) to precooled (15 min at 4 °C) Don cells in 96-well plates. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 50 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40, and the radioactivity was measured in an automated γ counter. Competition experiments were performed following the same protocol but using a 50-fold excess of the indicated cold competitor. Experiments examining the effects of LCTs on EGF-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of ERK were performed as follows. Confluent Swiss 3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight in medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum. These cells were treated with TcdB-10463 (50 ng/ml) or TcdB-1470 (50 ng/ml) for 30 min or with TcsL-1522 (600 ng/ml) for 6 h. When 100% of the cells showed a clear CPE, they were exposed to EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. This step was omitted in control cells. Then cells were lysed with Laemmli sample buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and 20 μg of total protein/lane were loaded. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated with monoclonal anti-ERK1 antibodies (1:250). Finally, blots were developed with a Chemiluminiscence Western blotting kit (Boehringer Mannheim) using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The cross-reaction of the anti-ERK1 antibody with ERK2 (44 kDa) has been documented in rat cells (catalog of Transduction Laboratories) and was also observed in a previous study (5Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with 3T3 fibroblasts. Triplicate cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts in 24-well plates were incubated with TcdB-10463 or TcdB-1470 (50 ng/ml) 1 h at 37 °C. Control cells were not treated. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove detached cells. Remaining cells were collected with 0.1% trypsin (10 min at 37 °C), suspended in 200 μl of PBS, recovered by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min), and lysed in 30 μl of 1% SDS. The protein concentration in lysates was taken as a measure of the number of cells remaining attached after toxin treatment. Swiss 3T3 cells on 13-mm glass coverslips were left untreated (control cells) or treated with 50 ng/ml of TcdB-10463 or TcdB-1470 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated 1 h at room temperature with the antibodies specified in figure legends. Then the cells were washed three times in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with rhodamine-conjugated antibody, followed by three washes with PBS. The cells were analyzed at 600 × using a confocal microscope (Molecular Dynamics). As viewed by scanning electron microscopy, TcdB-1470 induced 3T3 cell rounding with a mitotic-like morphology, indistinguishable from that induced by TcsL-1522 (Fig. 2). All cell-to-cell contacts disappeared after treatment with these toxins. In contrast, TcdB-10463 induced the characteristic arborizing effect (Fig.2), and cell-to-cell contacts were retained. Similar CPEs were induced in Don cells (data not shown). Light microscopy indicated that fibroblasts treated with TcdB-1470 or TcsL-1522 detached easily from the plastic substrate, whereas cells treated with TcdB-10463 remained attached. Indeed, the protein concentration in lysates of TcdB-10463-treated cells (799+-21 μg/ml) was equal to control cells (765+-70 μg/ml), whereas it was greatly diminished in cultures exposed to TcdB-1470 (158+-51 μg/ml), reflecting a massive detachment of cells. The cytotoxic potency of extracellularly applied TcdB-1470 was determined in Don cells by titration and compared with the potencies of TcdB-10463 and TcsL-1522. TcdB-1470 was almost as strongly cytotoxic as TcdB-10463, whereas TcsL-1522 showed a weak potency (Fig.3 a), in agreement with previous reports on other cell lines (17Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Giry M. Popoff M.R. Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the cytotoxic potencies were determined after intracellular application by microinjection, all three toxins showed similar activities (Fig.3 b). In the presence of UDP-[14C]Glc TcdB-1470 modified 20–30-kDa target proteins in cell lysates confirming its glucosyltransferase character. The activities of the toxins were compared in terms of the glucosyltransferase reaction. All three toxins exhibited similar enzymatic potency (see Fig. 5 a). This result, together with the similar cytotoxic potencies observed after microinjection (Fig. 3 b), indicates that the low cytotoxicity of TcsL-1522 is not a matter of a low enzymatic activity but rather due to an inefficient binding and/or internalization into the cell.Figure 5In vitro and in vivoglucosylation of cellular substrates by TcdB-10463, TcsL-1522, and TcdB-1470. a, Don cell lysates were incubated with the indicated concentrations of TcdB-10463, TcsL-1522, and TcdB-1470 in the presence of 30 μmUDP-[14C]Glc. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Cellular proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (left panel) or two-dimensional electrophoresis (right panel). Labeled proteins were detected by PhosphorImager analysis.b, confluent Don cells in 75-cm2 flasks were left untreated (control) or treated with either TcdB-10463 or TcdB-1470 until 100% of the cells showed a visible CPE. The cells were lysed, and the lysate proteins were glucosylated in vitro with either TcdB-10463 or TcsL-1522 (5 μg/ml) in the presence of UDP-[14C]Glc (30 μm). Proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and detected by PhosphorImager analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the possibility that TcdB-1470 uses the same receptor as TcdB-10463, competition experiments were performed. Pretreatment with TcdB-1470 reduced the binding of125I-TcdB-10463 to Don cell surfaces at 4 °C, almost to the same extent as cold TcdB-10463 did (Fig.4), suggesting that TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470 share the same receptor on these cells. In contrast, TcsL-1522 did not compete with 125I-TcdB-10463 (Fig.4) and thus binds to a different receptor on Don cell surfaces. The substrate pattern of TcdB-1470, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE, was very similar to that of TcsL-1522, particularly with respect to a 30-kDa band typically seen after TcsL-1522 modifications (Fig. 5). Accordingly, the patterns obtained by two-dimensional electrophoresis showed great similarity between TcsL-1522 and TcdB-1470, whereas a different pattern of labeled GTPases was obtained with TcdB-10463 (Fig. 5 a). The only observable major difference between TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522 was an acidic spot of approximately 20 kDa labeled by the latter. To determine whether TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522 modify the same substrates also in intact cells, a differential glucosylation experiment was performed. TcsL-1522 labeled its substrates in lysates from TcdB-10463-treated cells almost to the same extent as in lysates from nontreated cells (Fig. 5 b). The GTPase, which is obvious inlane 4 but not labeled in lane 5, probably represents Rac, the only known common substrate of TcdB-10463 and TcsL-1522. In lysates from TcdB-1470-treated cells, however, TcsL-1522 was no longer able to glucosylate its substrates (Fig. 5 b). On the other hand TcdB-10463 labeled its substrates in lysates from TcdB-1470-treated cells (Fig. 5 b), demonstrating that TcdB-1470 in intact cells does not modify the substrates recognized by TcdB-10463. The actual substrates of TcdB-1470 were determined with a panel of recombinant small GTPases. Rac, Rap1, Rap2, and RalA were labeled by TcdB-1470, whereas Cdc42 was modified to a lower extent (Fig. 6 a). Interestingly, R-Ras, a small GTP-binding protein important in integrin activation (19Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), was glucosylated both by TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522 but not by TcdB-10463 (Fig. 6 b). Thus, inactivation of R-Ras might play a role in the cell rounding (Fig. 2) and detachment induced by TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522. To determine the cellular effect of TcdB-1470 on activation of ERKs, serum-starved 3T3 cells were treated with toxin until 100% CPE was observed. After stimulation with EGF for 5 min, phosphorylation of ERKs was assessed as a shift in their molecular weights. This shift occurred in TcdB-1470- and TcdB-10463-treated cells to the same extent as in nontreated control cells (Fig. 7). As an additional control we included TcsL-1522, which is known to inhibit the EGF stimulation of ERK (5Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We conclude that inactivation of R-Ras did not affect the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The different CPEs induced by TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470 might reflect a differential effect of these toxins on focal adhesion complexes. Thus, toxin-treated 3T3 cells were probed with anti-vinculin, anti-β3-integrin, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Both TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470 caused vinculin to disappear from focal adhesions after only 20 min (Fig.8, a–c). However, β3-integrin-containing protrusions remained at the ruffling edges of the fibroblasts after treatment with TcdB-10463 (Fig.8 e), whereas TcdB-1470 completely disrupted these structures (Fig. 8 f). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins remained at most cell-to-cell contacts (Fig. 8 h) in TcdB-10463-treated cells, whereas TcdB-1470 completely disrupted also these structures. (Fig.8 i). Thus, TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470 affect focal adhesion components differentially. Some C. difficile sero group F strains do not elaborate TcdA (9Depitre C. Delmee M. Avesani V. Haridon R.L. Roels A. Popoff M. Corthier G. J. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 38: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although they produce the cytotoxin TcdB-1470 (8Eichel-Streiber C.V. Meyer D. Habermann E. Sartingen S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which differs somewhat from the classic cytotoxin TcdB-10463. Here we characterize the enzymatic properties of this novel toxin and compare its cytotoxic effects with those of the most closely related LCTs,i.e. TcdB-10463 and TcsL-1522. As discussed below TcdB-1470 turns out to be an interesting addition to the family of LCTs, behaving functionally as a TcsL-1522/TcdB-10463 hybrid, with the same cytotoxic potency as TcdB-10463 but inducing a TcsL-like CPE. All three toxins had equal cytotoxic potencies upon microinjection,i.e. when the normal receptor binding and internalization routes were bypassed. In contrast, extracellularly applied TcsL-1522 was remarkably less cytotoxic than TcdB-10463 or TcdB-1470. In view of the equal enzymatic potencies when tested in vitro, we propose that this difference is mainly determined by the receptor binding event of each toxin. The high cytotoxic potency of extracellularly applied TcdB-1470 probably depends on its specific binding to the same receptor as used by TcdB-10463. This was predicted from the high identity (99%) between the receptor-binding domains of TcdB-1470 and TcdB-10463 (8Eichel-Streiber C.V. Meyer D. Habermann E. Sartingen S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and here substantiated by cell surface binding experiments, demonstrating a competition between TcdB-1470 and125I-TcdB-10463. That this competition was somewhat lower than with TcdB-10463 could be due to a slightly lower affinity of TcdB-1470 for the receptor. In contrast, TcsL-1522 could not compete out 125I-TcdB-10463 at all, suggesting that it binds to a different receptor. The nature of the receptors is not known, but the existence of a specific receptor for TcdB-10463 on the fibroblast surface was recently demonstrated (16Chaves-Olarte E. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In Don cells this TcdB-1470/TcdB-10463 receptor should be present in considerably higher numbers than the putative receptor for TcsL-1522. Alternatively TcsL-1522 might have a very weak affinity for its own receptor. Despite the similar cytotoxic potencies of TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470, they induce different types of CPE. TcdB-10463 induces a collapse of the actin cytoskeleton with retraction of the cell body. Because protrusions remain attached to the extracellular matrix, this morphology is designated arborizing, actinomorphic, or neurite-like (2Thelestam M. Florin I. Chaves-Olarte E. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 141-158Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). TcdB-1470, in contrast, induced a complete rounding of the fibroblast body, conferring a mitotic-like appearance indistinguishable from that induced by TcsL-1522. The respective CPEs should somehow correlate with the substrates modified. Indeed, Rho was previously shown to be the crucial substrate for the arborizing CPE, because transient transfection with Rho could protect cells against TcdB-10463 but not TcsL-82 (18Giry M. Popoff M.R. Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crucial substrate(s) for the rounding CPE by TcsL-1522 and TcdB-1470 is not known, but we hypothesized that these two toxins modify the same or similar substrates. This concept was substantiated by two-dimensional electrophoresis showing similarin vitro substrate patterns and by the differential glucosylation experiments (Fig. 5), which confirmed that the same substrates are also modified in vivo. Thus, the substrate pattern of TcdB-1470 is similar to that of TcsL-1522 with the only difference that TcsL-1522 is also able to modify Ras (5Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The possibility of an additional substrate for TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522 was considered because none of the known substrates could adequately explain the TcsL-like rounding CPE: (i) Rac is a common substrate for all LCTs, including those that induce the arborizing effect, (ii) Rap has been shown to be also modified by TcdA (16Chaves-Olarte E. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which induces the arborizing effect, (iii) Ras is modified only by TcsL-1522 and not by TcdB-1470, and (iv) Ral is mainly present in neuronal tissue and was almost undetectable with specific polyclonal antibodies in the fibroblasts used here (data not shown). R-Ras, being a member of the Ras subfamily of small GTPases, shows a high sequence identity with Ras (20Lowe D. Capon D. Delwart E. Sakaguchi A. Naylor S. Goeddel D. Cell. 1987; 48: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) but has partially differing downstream targets (21Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, R-Ras was found recently to control the activation of integrins from inside the cell (19Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). GTP-loaded R-Ras activates integrins, whereas GDP-loaded R-Ras inactivates them, thereby inducing detachment from the extracellular matrix (19Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This new function of R-Ras suggested it could be involved in the rounding CPE induced by TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522. Indeed, R-Ras turned out to be a major substrate for both toxins, whereas TcdB-10463 did not modify this GTPase (Fig. 6 b). The molecular weight of the uppermost band labeled by TcdB-1470 and TcsL-1522 in Fig. 5 agrees with the reported molecular weight of R-Ras (20Lowe D. Capon D. Delwart E. Sakaguchi A. Naylor S. Goeddel D. Cell. 1987; 48: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We propose that modification of R-Ras in fibroblasts treated with either TcdB-1470 or TcsL-1522 inactivates this small GTP-binding protein and that this in turn leads to inactivation of integrins from inside the cell. This would induce the loss of integrin adhesiveness to extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in the observed rounding and detachment of cells. This hypothesis is supported by the TcdB-1470-induced efficient fibroblast detachment, whereas TcdB-10463-treated cells remained attached. Inactivation of integrins is also known to induce a disassembly of focal adhesion complexes. Indeed, cells treated with either toxin showed a disappearance of vinculin from focal adhesion complexes. However, TcdB-10463-treated cells showed two peculiarities that did not occur in TcdB-1470-treated cells: (i) β3-integrin remained at the tip of the protrusions surrounding the cells and (ii) phosphotyrosine containing structures were detected at the cell-to-cell contacts. Based on these findings we speculate that inactivation of R-Ras in cells treated with TcdB-1470 or TcsL-1522 causes a collapse of the entire focal adhesion complexes. In contrast, the inactivation of Rho by TcdB-10463 probably induces only a partial disassembly of the focal adhesion complexes. The disappearance of vinculin may be initiated at a point “downstream” the cytoplasmic tail of integrins, closer to the actin filaments. Therefore, integrins remain in place and active, explaining the persisting attachment of TcdB-10463-treated cells to the substrate, and the remaining protrusions that confer the arborizing or neurite-like appearance. Furthermore, glucosylation of Rho apparently does not destroy the cell-to-cell contacts because TcdB-10463-treated cells retained phosphotyrosine-containing structures at these sites (Fig. 8). Thanks to their highly specific mechanisms of action, bacterial toxins can be used as exquisite tools in cell biology. The addition of TcdB-1470 to the panel of already known LCTs broadens the possibilities to apply this family of toxins for elucidating the functions of several small GTPases, now including also R-Ras for two of the LCTs. TcdB-10463 and TcdB-1470 together form a particularly useful pair because they have the same enzymatic potency and bind the same (or a similar) receptor. Thus they enter cells by the same internalization pathway, implying that the only difference in cells treated with these toxins is the GTPase substrate attacked. These features allow accurate comparisons of the cellular consequences at various levels of inactivation of the different GTPases. The fact that these two toxins act rapidly is another advantage for their use as cell biology tools, because secondary pleiotropic effects due to long incubation times are avoided. Finally, we also want to emphasize the potential utility of TcdB-1470 for understanding the pathogenic significance of the various toxin domains. The use of this natural hybrid toxin might enable clarification of the respective roles of the binding and catalytic regions in the action of TcdB on host tissues, whether in the induction of colitis or in its lethal effect.

https://openalex.org/W2055932799,"The F plasmid-carried bacterial toxin, the CcdB protein, is known to act on DNA gyrase in two different ways. CcdB poisons the gyrase-DNA complex, blocking the passage of polymerases and leading to double-strand breakage of the DNA. Alternatively, in cells that overexpress CcdB, the A subunit of DNA gyrase (GyrA) has been found as an inactive complex with CcdB. We have reconstituted the inactive GyrA-CcdB complex by denaturation and renaturation of the purified GyrA dimer in the presence of CcdB. This inactivating interaction involves the N-terminal domain of GyrA, because similar inactive complexes were formed by denaturing and renaturing N-terminal fragments of the GyrA protein in the presence of CcdB. Single amino acid mutations, both in GyrA and in CcdB, that prevent CcdB-induced DNA cleavage also prevent formation of the inactive complexes, indicating that some essential interaction sites of GyrA and of CcdB are common to both the poisoning and the inactivation processes. Whereas the lethal effect of CcdB is most probably due to poisoning of the gyrase-DNA complex, the inactivation pathway may prevent cell death through formation of a toxin-antitoxin-like complex between CcdB and newly translated GyrA subunits. Both poisoning and inactivation can be prevented and reversed in the presence of the F plasmid-encoded antidote, the CcdA protein. The products of treating the inactive GyrA-CcdB complex with CcdA are free GyrA and a CcdB-CcdA complex of approximately 44 kDa, which may correspond to a (CcdB)2(CcdA)2 heterotetramer.

The ability to modulate the topological state of DNA is essential to bacteria. One of the enzymes responsible for this critical function is DNA gyrase (a bacterial type II topoisomerase). In Escherichia coli, DNA gyrase consists of two subunits, GyrA 1The abbreviations used are: GyrA, DNA gyrase A subunit; GyrB, DNA gyrase B subunit; GyrA59 and GyrA64, the 59- and 64-kDa N-terminal domain proteins of the DNA gyrase A subunit; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and GyrB, of molecular masses 97 and 90 kDa, respectively, encoded by the gyrA andgyrB genes; the active enzyme is an A2B2 complex. The A subunits mediate the ability of the enzyme to introduce and rejoin double-strand breaks in DNA. The B subunits mediate energy transduction and ATP hydrolysis (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Menzel R. Gellert M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 39-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Wigley D.B. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 9. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 165-176Google Scholar). Gyrase was first identified by its ability to convert relaxed circular DNA into a negatively supercoiled form at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (4Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Given its role in the maintenance of proper levels of negative supercoiling, and the overall role of supercoiling in transcription, replication, and recombination (1Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Menzel R. Gellert M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 39-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), gyrase influences nearly all DNA transactions in prokaryotic cells. DNA gyrase is the target of several antibacterial agents, including the coumarin and quinolone families of antibiotic drugs (6Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Drlica K. Kreiswirth B.

The coumarin antibiotics inhibit supercoiling activity by interfering with ATP binding and hydrolysis. The quinolones block all activities of gyrase that involve DNA strand passage. However, quinolone drugs tend to exert their bactericidal action through complex formation with gyrase and DNA rather than through simple elimination of gyrase activity. The quinolones are thought to trap a reaction intermediate in which gyrase has broken the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, while the broken DNA ends are prevented from separation by binding to the enzyme. This intermediate is often referred to as the “cleavable complex.” In this complex, the DNA is covalently joined to gyrase by phosphoryl tyrosine bonds between the 5′ ends of the cleaved DNA and Tyr122 of the GyrA subunits (10Horowitz D.S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5339-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quinolone drugs can be considered to “poison” the DNA-gyrase complex by stabilizing the DNA lesion. Double-strand breaks in the DNA are revealed upon subsequent addition of a protein denaturant such SDS or alkali. Using temperature-sensitive mutations, Kreuzer and Cozzarelli (11Kreuzer K.N.

Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that growth of some bacteriophages is very sensitive to nalidixic acid but not to the elimination of gyrase supercoiling activity; they proposed that the gyrase-nalidixic acid complex on DNA could form a barrier to the passage of polymerases. The observation of Willmottet al. (12Willmott C.J.R. Critchlow S.E. Eperon I.C. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), that the gyrase-quinolone complex with DNA leads to the blocking of transcription by E. coli and T7 RNA polymerases in vitro, supports this hypothesis. In vivo, it is thought that blocking of DNA polymerase may be the critical event that leads to cell death. Killing appears to be caused by events (subsequent to blockage of DNA replication) that may result in release of the broken DNA ends from the cleavage complex (13Chen C.-R. Malik M. Snyder M. Drlica K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms that have been suggested for such a displacement of DNA ends from a drug-stabilized topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complex include dissociation of the gyrase tetramer (13Chen C.-R. Malik M. Snyder M. Drlica K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), protein denaturation during an attempt to repair the DNA lesion (14Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and helicase unwinding of the DNA (15Howard M.T. Neece S.H. Matson S.W. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12031-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring protein inhibitors that cause gyrase-dependent killing of E. coli with a mode of action similar to that of the quinolone antibiotics have also been found. Microcin B17 targets GyrB protein (16Visàn J.L. Hernandez-Chico C. del Castillo I. Moreno F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the CcdB protein encoded by the E. coli F plasmid targets GyrA (17Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). TheccdB gene is one partner of a two-gene system in the F plasmid (together with ccdA) that results in the death of cells that have lost the plasmid (18Bex F. Karoui H. Rokeach L. Drèze P. Garcia L. Couturier M. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Miki T. Yoshioka K. Horiuchi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 605-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In F-containing cells both genes are expressed, and CcdA protein (8.3 kDa) specifically blocks the lethal action of CcdB (11.7 kDa). However, CcdA protein is metabolically unstable due to its sensitivity to Lon-dependent proteolysis (20Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As a consequence, cells that lose F ultimately retain only CcdB and are killed. Both CcdA and CcdB are involved in the negative autoregulation of their own synthesis at the transcriptional level (21Tam J.E. Kline B.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Salmon M.A. Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutations in ccdBthat produce non-lethal proteins were found to cause amino acid substitutions or deletions in the three C-terminal residues (23Bahassi E.M. Salmon M. Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,24Kaneko T. Mizushima T. Ohtsuka Y. Kurokawa K. Kataoka K. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 593-600PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested that gyrase is the intracellular target of CcdB protein. Independently isolated CcdB resistance mutations were found to map in the gyrA gene; one of these mutants, A 462 , was sequenced and found to produce an amino acid substitution of Arg462to Cys (17Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Separately, CcdB-tolerant mutations have been isolated in several genes: gyrA, groES (mopB), andgroEL (mopA) (25Miki T. Park J.A. Nagao K. Murayama N. Horiuchi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); and tldD andtldE (pmbA) (26Murayama N. Shimizu H. Takiguchi S. Baba Y. Amino H. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 483-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The role of thegroE, tldE, and tldD gene products is still unclear but they have been proposed to act as factors implicated in the interaction between the CcdB protein and DNA gyrase. Bernard and Couturier (17Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and Bernard et al. (27Bernard P. Kézdy K. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have shown that CcdB interacts with gyrase to cause double-strand breaks in DNA bothin vivo (which were revealed after SDS and proteinase K treatment of lysates or of total DNA extracted from cells that express plasmid-encoded CcdB in the absence of CcdA) and in vitro,and have proposed that CcdB converts gyrase into a DNA poison in a manner similar to the quinolone drugs by trapping gyrase in the cleavable complex. The CcdA protein was able to prevent and to reverse CcdB-induced DNA cleavage in vitro. Furthermore, gyrase reconstituted with the purified CcdB-resistant mutant GyrA462 subunit (see above) was refractory to CcdB-induced DNA cleavage. Critchlow et al. (28Critchlow S.E. O'Dea M.H. Howells A.J. Couturier M. Gellert M. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that, like the quinolone drugs, CcdB forms a complex with gyrase and DNA that can block transcription in an in vitro assay system. Independently, Maki et al. (29Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) examined DNA supercoiling in cells overproducing the CcdB protein, and found that plasmid DNA in those cells was relaxed. GyrA protein purified from this strain was found as a complex with CcdB, and was unable to catalyze DNA supercoiling in the presence of GyrB protein. GyrB-dependent supercoiling activity of the GyrA in this complex could be restored by addition of CcdA protein. These authors suggested that the intracellular DNA relaxation was due to gyrase inactivation by formation of the complex between GyrA and CcdB, and that this process could be a cause of cell killing. However, they were unable to reproduce this inactivation of gyrase by CcdB proteinin vitro. They concluded that gyrase inactivation and topoisomerase poisoning by CcdB are two independent processes. In this work, we have reconstituted the inactive GyrA-CcdB complexin vitro, by denaturation-renaturation, and compared its properties with those of the complex made in vivo. We have reactivated the complex by the addition of CcdA or of CcdA41, a 41- residue C-terminal fragment of CcdA that has lost its autoregulatory properties but retains the ability to reverse the lethal effects of CcdB (31Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and characterized the products of the reactivation procedure. We have also investigated the CcdB-resistant GyrA462 protein (17Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the truncated GyrA 64- and 59-kDa N-terminal domain proteins (28Critchlow S.E. O'Dea M.H. Howells A.J. Couturier M. Gellert M.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), all of which are unable to participate in CcdB-mediated cleavage of DNA, for their ability to replace wild-type GyrA or CcdB in the formation of the inactive complex. MAX Efficiency DH5αF′IQTM competent E. coli cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. E. coli JM109 (34Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar) was from New England Biolabs. The plasmid pPH3 (35Hallet P. Grimshaw A.J. Wigley D.B. Maxwell A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) containing thelacI q gene and the gyrA gene under control of the tac promoter was a gift from A. Maxwell. This plasmid has two PstI sites, one inside the gyrAgene and the other one in the vector. To remove the one in the vector, the plasmid was partially digested with PstI restriction enzyme, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and religated with T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid that has lost the vectorPstI site was called pPH31. TheKpnI-PstI gyrA fragment from pPH31 was replaced by the same fragment from pULB2229 (17Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) containing thegyrA 462 mutation and was called pPH310. Plasmids pRJR242 and pRJR10.18 (32Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol.

The pMLOccdB plasmid was constructed by cloning theBamHI fragment from pULB2250 plasmid (27Bernard P. Kézdy K. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P. Couturier M. J. Mol.

Lobocka, unpublished data. which was derived from pGB2ts (36Clerget M. Nat. New Biol. 1991; 3: 780-788Google Scholar), a mini-pSC101 vector thermosensitive for replication. Plasmid pMP1625 (27Bernard P. Kézdy K. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P. Couturier M. J. Mol.

Higgins N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) cloned at the BamHI site of pBR322, was used to perform cleavage assays. Relaxed or negatively supercoiled pBR322 was used in DNA supercoiling or relaxation assays, respectively. DNA gyrase was reconstituted from individual subunits, which were purified as was described by Mizuuchi et al. (38Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of gyrase A and B subunits, determined in DNA supercoiling assays, were 3.5 × 106 and 5 × 105 units/mg of protein, respectively. The GyrA462 protein was isolated from a JM109/pPH310 strain according to the same protocol. Its specific activity was 4 × 106 units/mg of protein. The N-terminal 64- and 59-kDa fragments of GyrA were expressed from pRJR242 and pRJR10.18 by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in DH5αF′IQTM and purified to near homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by chromatography on Hi-Trap Heparin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Supercoiling assays were performed as described by Mizuuchi et al. (38Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CcdB and oxolinic acid-induced cleavage of DNA was performed usingPstI-digested linear pMP1625 plasmid as substrate, under supercoiling conditions and under the CcdB cleavage conditions of Bernard and Couturier (17Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and Bernard et al. (27Bernard P. Kézdy K. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CcdB or oxolinic acid (Sigma) were added at 1 and 0.05 mg/ml, respectively, and ATP was either omitted or added at 1.4 mm. Cleavage assays were terminated by addition of 0.2% SDS and 0.08 mg/ml proteinase K (Beckman) and further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA relaxation assays were performed under the reaction buffer conditions described for CcdB-mediated cleavage (27Bernard P. Kézdy K. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but the final incubation with SDS and proteinase K was omitted. CcdA protein was produced in CSH50lon::Tn10 carrying the pULB2709 CcdA-overproducing plasmid (27Bernard P. Kézdy K. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and purified as described (39Van Melderen L. Thi M.H.D. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). CcdA41 was synthesized by A. Tartar, Institut Pasteur de Lille (France). CcdB and CcdBo15 (23Bahassi E.M. Salmon M. Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) proteins were expressed in a host strain carrying the CcdB resistance mutationgyrA 462 and purified as described (40Steyaert J. Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Dao Thi M.H. Loris R. Wyns L. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: After ammonium sulfate precipitation and resuspension in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), the precipitated proteins were dialyzed against buffer A and applied to a MonoQ anion exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer. The fractions containing CcdB or CcdBo15 were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and loaded onto a MonoS cation exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The elution yielded about 30 mg of pure CcdB or CcdBo15/liter of cell culture. Analytical gel filtrations were performed using a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 precision column on a Smart System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 700 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, at a flow rate of 50 μl/min, or using a Superdex 75 HR (10/30) FPLC column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl at 1 ml/min. Molecular weight markers used to calibrate these columns were: ferritin (440,000), catalase (232,000), aldolase (158,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000), and ribonuclease A (13,700); or a gel filtration standard mixture (Bio-Rad) containing gamma globulin (158,000), ovalbumin (44,000), myoglobin (17,000), and vitamin B12 (1,350). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was done using 4–20% Tris-glycine or 10–20% Tricine gradient gels and Tris-glycine-SDS or Tricine-SDS running buffers obtained from Novex. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was done using Novex 6% polyacrylamide gels in TBE or in Tris-glycine native running buffers. The inactive complex between CcdB and GyrA was formed by denaturation/renaturation, by mixing GyrA (60 μg/ml) and an 8-fold molar excess of CcdB (60 μg/ml) in buffer consisting of 5m urea in 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NH4Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the mixture was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer without urea. Purification of the inactivated GyrA-CcdB complex from free GyrA and free CcdB was carried out using a Hi-Trap Heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with five column volumes of equilibration buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient of 0.0–1.0 m NaCl in the equilibration buffer. The protein composition of each peak was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the peak containing the inactive complex was further characterized by GyrB-dependent supercoiling assays performed in the presence and absence of CcdA. Complexes between the N-terminal GyrA 64- or 59-kDa proteins and CcdB were also prepared by denaturation in the presence of urea, followed by renaturation upon dialysis, as described above. Under non-denaturing conditions, a CcdB complex with the GyrA 59-kDa protein was prepared by slowly adding 195 μl of a 3 mg/ml solution of CcdB to 1.33 ml of a 1 mg/ml GyrA59 solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, at 14.1 °C, over a period of 45 min (15 injections of 13 μl each, with a 3-min interval between additions). This complex was separated from free CcdB on a Superdex 75 HR (10/30) column in the same buffer. Production and purification of the in vivoGyrA-CcdB complex was performed as described (30Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. In order to obtain a large amount of inactivated GyrA, while allowing a better bacterial growth rate, we have used the pPH31 plasmid, which overproduces GyrA protein and supplies the LacIq repressor to regulate the CcdB and GyrA protein production. CcdB protein was co-produced from pMLOccdB. DH5αF′IQTM, which also produces the LacIqrepressor, was used as the host strain. Reconstituted GyrA-CcdB complex, which was obtained by denaturation-renaturation and purified by Hi-Trap Heparin chromatography (20 μg), and CcdA protein (10 μg) or CcdA41 (10 μg) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 700 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The mixture was then resolved on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The truncated gyrase A 59-kDa N-terminal protein was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 6 mg of GyrA59/ml of CNBr-Sepharose, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1 ml FPLC column was prepared and equilibrated at room temperature with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl prior to loading 10 ml of 0.55 mg/ml CcdB in the same buffer. The column was extensively washed with equilibration buffer to remove all free CcdB, and then eluted with 10 ml of 0.3 mg/ml CcdA in the same buffer. The eluted CcdA-CcdB complex was further fractionated using a Superdex 75 HR (10/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same buffer, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We have reconstituted an inactive GyrA-CcdB complex in vitro by denaturation and renaturation of purified GyrA in the presence of excess CcdB. In order to directly compare the purification behavior and the physical and catalytic properties of this reconstituted complex with those of the previously reported complex formed in vivo, we also purified the inactive GyrA-CcdB complex from a strain overproducing GyrA and CcdB proteins according to a protocol similar to that described (30Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). At the last step of this purification, a Hi-Trap Heparin column, two separate peaks were obtained late in the gradient; the first at 0.65 m NaCl corresponded to free GyrA and the second at 0.7 m NaCl to the inactive GyrA-CcdB complex. The identity of each peak was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The in vitro complex between GyrA and CcdB was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When a portion of the renatured material was subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration, two peaks were found (Fig.1 A). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the peak that eluted first contained both GyrA and CcdB; the second peak was free CcdB (Fig. 1 B). The remainder of the renatured sample was then subjected to Hi-Trap Heparin column chromatography. Late in the gradient, only one peak was obtained, at 0.7 m NaCl, which corresponds to the GyrA-CcdB complex; free GyrA was not detected. The inactive GyrA-CcdB complexes produced in vitro andin vivo co-migrate in native gels at a position different from those of the free GyrA and CcdB proteins (data not shown) and exhibit a 90–95% inhibition of GyrB-dependent DNA supercoiling activity (Fig. 2; Refs. 29Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand 30Maki S. Takiguchi S. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The strong resemblance between the in vivo andin vitro complexes indicates that the complex reconstitutedin vitro is equivalent to that formed in vivo in CcdB-overproducing strains. No inactive complex and no reduction of GyrA-dependent supercoiling activity could be detected inin vitro control samples where the urea treatment was omitted. Inactive complexes between the GyrA N-terminal 64- or 59-kDa protein fragments and CcdB were also formed during a denaturation and renaturation procedure. Although these truncated GyrA proteins do not perform efficient ATP-dependent DNA supercoiling in the presence of GyrB protein, they do participate in GyrB- and ATP-dependent relaxation of supercoiled DNA (33Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 114421-144116Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar); this relaxation activity was inhibited when the CcdB-inactivated truncated proteins were assayed (Fig. 3). The inactive complexes of GyrA64 and GyrA59 with CcdB migrated on native gels at positions intermediate between those of the free proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, complexes of CcdB with the truncated GyrA proteins appear to form spontaneously, since bands on native gels that correspond to these complexes were found in the control samples, which were not denatured with urea. An in vitro experiment with the GyrA 59-kDa protein and CcdB under nonchaotropic conditions confirmed this observation, and the highest yield of complex was obtained after a slow titration of CcdB into a GyrA59solution (Fig. 4). Fractions of the GyrA-CcdB complex reconstitutedin vitro (0.7 m NaCl Hi-Trap heparin column peak) were used to perform GyrB-dependent supe"
https://openalex.org/W1995000176,"NS5B of the hepatitis C virus is an RNA template-dependent RNA polymerase and therefore the key player of the viral replicase complex. Using a highly purified enzyme expressed with recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells, we demonstrate a stimulation of RNA synthesis up to 2 orders of magnitude by high concentrations of GTP but not with ATP, CTP, UTP, GDP, or GMP. Enhancement of RNA synthesis was found with various heteropolymeric RNA templates, with poly(C)-oligo(G)12 but not with poly(A)-oligo(U)12. Several amino acid substitutions in polymerase motifs B, C, and D previously shown to be crucial for RdRp activity were tested for GTP stimulation of RNA synthesis. Most of these mutations, in particular those affecting the GDD motif (motif C) strongly reduced or completely abolished activation by GTP, suggesting that the same NTP-binding site is used for stimulation and RNA synthesis. Since GTP did not affect the overall RNA binding properties or the elongation rate, high concentrations of GTP appear to accelerate a rate-limiting step at the level of initiation of RNA synthesis. Finally, enhancement of RNA synthesis by high GTP concentrations was also found with NS5B of the pestivirus classical swine fever virus, but not with the 3D polymerase of poliovirus. Thus, stimulation of RdRp activity by GTP is evolutionarily conserved between the closely related hepaciviruses and pestiviruses but not between these and the more distantly related picornaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2112914682,"The stimulation of caspases is a critical event in apoptotic cell death. Several kinases critically involved in cell proliferation pathways have been shown to be cleaved by caspase-mediated mechanisms. Thus, the degradation of δ protein kinase C (PKC) and MEKK-1 by caspase-3 generates activated fragments corresponding to their catalytic domains, consistent with the observations that both enzymes are important for apoptosis. In contrast, other kinases reported to have anti-apoptotic properties, such as Raf-1 and Akt, are inactivated by proteolytic degradation by the caspase system. Since the atypical PKCs have been shown to play critical roles in cell survival, in the study reported here we have addressed the potential degradation of these PKCs by the caspase system in UV-irradiated HeLa cells. Herein we show that although ζPKC and λ/ιPKC are both inhibited in UV-treated cells, only ζPKC but not λ/ιPKC is cleaved by a caspase-mediated process. This cleavage generates a fragment that corresponds to its catalytic domain that is enzymatically inactive. The sequence where caspase-3 cleaves ζPKC was mapped, and a mutant resistant to degradation was shown to protect cells from apoptosis more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. The stimulation of caspases is a critical event in apoptotic cell death. Several kinases critically involved in cell proliferation pathways have been shown to be cleaved by caspase-mediated mechanisms. Thus, the degradation of δ protein kinase C (PKC) and MEKK-1 by caspase-3 generates activated fragments corresponding to their catalytic domains, consistent with the observations that both enzymes are important for apoptosis. In contrast, other kinases reported to have anti-apoptotic properties, such as Raf-1 and Akt, are inactivated by proteolytic degradation by the caspase system. Since the atypical PKCs have been shown to play critical roles in cell survival, in the study reported here we have addressed the potential degradation of these PKCs by the caspase system in UV-irradiated HeLa cells. Herein we show that although ζPKC and λ/ιPKC are both inhibited in UV-treated cells, only ζPKC but not λ/ιPKC is cleaved by a caspase-mediated process. This cleavage generates a fragment that corresponds to its catalytic domain that is enzymatically inactive. The sequence where caspase-3 cleaves ζPKC was mapped, and a mutant resistant to degradation was shown to protect cells from apoptosis more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme.

In addition, the aPKCs selectively bind to, and are regulated, by two novel proteins (LIP and Par-4) which seem to be critical components of pathways controlling cell growth and survival. Thus, LIP (for λ/ιPKC-interacting protein) potently induces NF-κB in a λ/ιPKC-dependent manner (14Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Par-4 is a potent inhibitor of the atypical PKC enzymatic activity and, interestingly, was initially identified by differential screening in cells that were undergoing growth arrest and apoptosis (3Diaz-Meco M.T.

Consistently, the ectopic expression of Par-4 in NIH-3T3 cells induces apoptosis in a manner that is dependent on its ability to block the atypical PKCs (2Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S.

Taken together, these results indicate that the aPKCs are potent anti-apoptotic kinases that can be inactivated by pro-apoptotic regulators such as Par-4.The activation of the caspase system is a critical event in apoptosis (40Ashkenazi A.

Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Early work reported that the degradation of δPKC by caspase-3 generates an active fragment corresponding to its catalytic domain (44Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), suggesting that δPKC activity may be important during apoptotic cell death (45Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S.

Consistently, inhibition of δPKC impairs UV-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes (46Denning M.F. Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). MEKK-1 is also cleaved during apoptosis by anoikis (47Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In all three cases, the caspase-mediated degradation of MEKK-1 produced a catalytically active fragment, in keeping with the pro-apoptotic properties of MEKK-1 (47Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 48Deak J.C. Cross J.V. Lewis M. Qian Y. Parrot L.A. Distelhorst C.W.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). PKN is another example of a kinase degraded by the caspase system producing a catalytically active fragment (50Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, other kinases, such as Raf-1 and Akt are inactivated by proteolytic degradation by the caspase system during apoptosis (43Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant because both Raf-1 and Akt are anti-apoptotic kinases (50Takahashi M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Therefore, a model is emerging whereby the activation of caspases in apoptotic cells leads to the cleavage of different kinases with opposite outcomes, depending on whether the given kinase plays a pro- or an anti-apoptotic role. Because the aPKCs control pro-survival signals, in the study reported here we have addressed the potential degradation of the atypical PKCs by the caspase system in HeLa cells exposed to UV irradiation.RESULTSWe initially determined the effect of UV irradiation on the activity and potential cleavage of λ/ιPKC and ζPKC during apoptosis. HeLa cells were UV-irradiated for different times, after which endogenous λ/ιPKC was immunoprecipitated and its activity was determined. Parallel extracts were analyzed by immunoblot. Results of Fig. 1 A demonstrate that short exposures (5–20 min) to UV irradiation provokes a measurable activation of λ/ιPKC activity. However, longer treatments leads to a robust reduction of λ/ιPKC activity to below basal levels, that is detectable at 2 h, and maximal at 4–20 h. Immunoblot analysis reveals that the protein levels of λ/ιPKC remain unchanged at all the time points measured. Identical results were obtained when this experiment was performed in HeLa cells that have been transfected with a Myc-tagged λ/ιPKC construct and in which the activity and levels of the enzyme were determined with an anti-Myc antibody (not shown). Because there are not reliable antibodies selective for the ζPKC isoform, we next transfected HeLa cells with a Myc-tagged version of ζPKC after which cells were UV-irradiated as above. Results of Fig.1 B show that, in contrast to λ/ιPKC, short-term irradiation does not affect ζPKC activity. However, longer exposures to UV light produces a dramatic reduction on ζPKC activity that precedes its proteolytic degradation that produces a fragment of approximately 50 kDa. Because this ζPKC construct was Myc-tagged at the COOH terminus, this fragment must include the catalytic domain. Therefore, the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates contained not only the full-length protein but also the fragments generated by UV irradiation (not shown). The fact that the enzymatic activity is reduced in UV-irradiated cells indicates that the ζPKC 50-kDa fragment generated by UV irradiation is catalytically inactive. TUNEL analysis of parallel cultures indicated that apoptosis becomes detectable at 10 h. At this time point, 12 ± 2% of the cells showed signs of DNA fragmentation. At 20 h, the number of apoptotic cells increased to 30 ± 10%, whereas at 40 h, virtually all cells were apoptotic.In the next series of experiments the involvement of the caspase system in the degradation of ζPKC was determined. Thus, HeLa cells transfected with Myc-tagged ζPKC were UV-irradiated either in the absence or presence of z-VAD, a broad-specific inhibitor of caspases, and the activity and degradation of ζPKC was determined. Results of Fig. 2 A demonstrate that the presence of z-VAD completely abrogated the UV-induced cleavage of ζPKC with little or no effect on its inhibition. Of note, the presence of z-VAD did not affect the changes in activity of λ/ιPKC produced by UV irradiation (Fig. 2 B). Collectively these results indicate that ζPKC is degraded by a caspase-mediated process during UV irradiation but that its inhibition is caspase-independent.Figure 2Effect of z-VAD on the inhibition of the atypical PKC activity by UV irradiation. A, HeLa cells transfected with the COOH-terminal Myc-tagged version of ζPKC were incubated or not with z-VAD prior to UV irradiation. Afterward cell extracts were prepared at different times following UV irradiation and the levels of ζPKC were determined by immunoblot with the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (upper panel). This is a representative experiment of three with very similar results. Parallel extracts were immunoprecipitated with the same antibody, and the activity of ζPKC was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” (lower panel). Results are the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments including the one shown in the upper panel. HeLa cells were incubated or not with z-VAD prior to UV irradiation.

Interestingly, a fragment of identical size to that producedin vivo and most probably corresponding to the catalytic domain of the enzyme was observed when ζPKC but not λ/ιPKC was incubated with extracts from UV-irradiated cells (Fig.3 A). In addition, another fragment of about 20–30 kDa was also detected which most probably corresponds to the regulatory domain of ζPKC (Fig. 3 A). The cleavage of ζPKC is prevented by the incubation with z-VAD or DEVD, but not by YVAD (Fig. 3 B). Because DEVD is relatively specific for caspase-3 whereas YVAD is for caspase-1, these results strongly suggest that ζPKC may be a substrate of caspase-3. This is confirmed in the results of Fig. 3 C demonstrating that recombinant caspase-3 efficiently cleaves ζPKC but not λ/ιPKCin vitro.Figure 3Caspase-mediated breakdown of ζPKC in vitro. 35S-Labeled in vitro translated ζPKC (A–C) or λ/ιPKC (A and C) were incubated with extracts from either control or UV-irradiated cells (A and B), either in the absence (Aand B) or presence of different caspase inhibitors (B), or with recombinant caspase-3 (C). Afterward the reaction was fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography in an InstantImager. Essentially identical results were obtained in another two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The size of the ζPKC fragments generated by the caspase action suggests that the cleavage must occur at the hinge region linking the regulatory and the catalytic domains. In addition, because λ/ιPKC is resistant to caspase-mediated breakdown, the caspase cleavage site(s) should be present in a region of ζPKC with no sequence homology with λ/ιPKC. The hinge domain in the atypical PKCs is, together with the V1 region, where the major differences exist between ζPKC and λ/ιPKC (57Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the alignment of the hinge regions of ζPKC and λ/ιPKC reveals the existence of three potential caspase sites in ζPKC that are absent in λ/ιPKC. These sites are underlined in Fig. 4 and named as 1, 2, and 3. In order to determine which of these potential sites are important for ζPKC breakdown, different ζPKC mutants that abrogate the caspase consensus sequence were constructed, translatedin vitro, and incubated with extracts from UV-irradiated cells. The individual disruption of sites 1, 2, and 3, produced no effect on the degradation of ζPKC (Fig.5). However, although the double 1/2 mutant was also cleaved, the 2/3 and 1/2/3 mutants were completely resistant to degradation (Fig. 5). This indicates that sites 2 and 3 are the targets of the caspase-mediated breakdown of ζPKC. In order to explore the role of sites 2 and 3 in vivo, Myc-tagged ζPKC2/3 mutant (myc-ζPKC2/3) was transfected into HeLa cells, after which they were UV-irradiated for different times and the activity and levels of this ζPKC mutant were determined. Results of Fig. 6 demonstrate that although myc-ζPKC2/3 is completely resistant to degradation, its enzymatic activity is dramatically inhibited by UV irradiation.Figure 4Alignment of the hinge region of ζPKC and λ/ιPKC.

Afterward the reaction was fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography in an InstantImager. Essentially identical results were obtained in another two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Mutation of the caspase sites does not affect the inhibition of ζPKC activity by UV irradiation. Extracts from HeLa cells transfected with a Myc-tagged ζPKC2/3 mutant were prepared at different times following UV irradiation, after which the levels of ζPKC2/3 were determined by immunoblot with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (upper panel). This is a representative experiment of three with very similar results.

This is consistent with previous data from this laboratory and may be due to the interaction of these PKCs with the selective protein inhibitor Par-4 (2Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A previously unreported observation is the degradation of ζPKC mediated by caspase-3. This generates a fragment that is identical to the catalytic domain of ζPKC, that should be permanently active because it lacks the regulatory region which keeps the enzyme blocked through the binding of the catalytic domain to the pseudosubstrate sequence (58Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the data presented in this study (Fig. 1 B), suggest that the catalytic fragment generated by UV irradiation is inactive, since at 20 h its enzymatic activity still is inhibited despite the fact that all the ζPKC has been broken-down to its catalytic fragment. To more firmly demonstrate this possibility, HeLa cells were transfected with a GST-tagged version of the catalytic domain of ζPKC (GST-ζPKCCAT) encompassing residues from site 3 to the end of the protein. Afterward, cells transfected with the catalytic ζPKC were UV irradiated for different times, and the levels and activity of the GST-ζPKCCAT construct were determined. Results of Fig. 7 demonstrate that UV irradiation produces a robust inhibition of the catalytic construct, indicating that some signal is generated by this stress treatment that not only inhibits the full-length protein, as previously reported (2Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 1 B, but also the catalytic fragment that is generated during the UV-irradiation process.Figure 7UV irradiation inhibits the activity of catalytic ζPKC.

About 83 and 90% of the ovalbumin population was in a heat-stable form in day 14 or stage 40 amniotic fluid and day 18 or stage 44 egg yolk, respectively, whereas ovalbumin in newly deposited eggs was in the heat-unstable, native form. Purified preparations of stable ovalbumin from egg white and amniotic fluid showed a less ordered configuration than native ovalbumin, as analyzed by circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry. In addition, mass spectrometric analysis exhibited distinct size microheterogeneity between the stable and native forms of ovalbumin. Immunohisotochemical study revealed that ovalbumin was present in the central nervous system and other embryonic organs. These results indicated that egg white ovalbumin migrates into the developing embryo while changing its higher order structure. Ovalbumin was detected in developing chicken eggs.

These results indicated that egg white ovalbumin migrates into the developing embryo while changing its higher order structure. Major proteins in albumen or egg white of chicken eggs are synthesized in the tubular gland cells of the magnum, from which they are secreted and coat the egg during its passage within the oviduct (1). The most abundant protein in egg white is ovalbumin, occupying about 55% of the total proteins in newly deposited eggs (2Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Whittaker J.R. Tannenbaum S.R. Food Proteins. Avi Publishing Co., Westport, CT1977: 209-266Google Scholar). It consists of three isoforms called A1, A2, and A3, differing in the number of bound phosphate residues (3Egelandsdal B. J. Food Sci. 1980; 49: 570-573Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Ovalbumin does not act as a proteinase inhibitor, although it belongs to the serpin superfamily (4Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The native form of ovalbumin is coagulated easily upon heating, but can be converted artificially into a distinct, heat-stable form called S-ovalbumin by in vitroincubation under alkaline conditions (5Smith D.B. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1964; 17: 261-270Crossref Google Scholar). Considering the fact that S-ovalbumin also occurs in unfertilized eggs during long storage (6Nguyen L.T.H. Smith D.B. CSIRO Food Res. Q. 1984; 44: 44-48Google Scholar), we assume that the conversion of ovalbumin is important for embryonic development. What is the fate of ovalbumin and other egg white proteins in developing embryos? These proteins have been found to move into yolk and then into the embryo via the yolk sac membrane (7Sugimoto Y. Saito A. Kusakabe T. Hori K. Koga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Sugimoto Y. Hanada S. Koga K. Sakaguchi B. Biochim . Biophys . Acta. 1984; 788: 117-123Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, egg white proteins have been shown to be taken up into the amniotic fluid and then absorbed by the embryo (9McIndoe W.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1960; 8: 47-53Google Scholar, 10Romanoff A.L. Romanoff A.L. The Avian Embryo. 10391110Macmillan Co., New York1960: 209-266Google Scholar, 11Baintner K. Feher G. Dev. Biol. 1974; 36: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the precise mode of utilization by the embryo is not yet known, ovalbumin and some egg white proteins may at least partly be absorbed into the embryo without extensive digestion, because albumen proteins such as ovalbumin and ovomucoid have been detected in the embryonic blood system (12Marshall M.E. Deutch H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 185: 155-161Google Scholar). In this study, we confirmed that ovalbumin becomes heat stable during migration from egg white to embryonic organs. Examination by circular dichroism (CD) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; DSC, differential scanning microcalorimetry; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry; native PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IgG, immunoglobulin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. and differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) supported the idea that the heat-stable form of ovalbumin has undergone conformational changes. The present report may be the first to characterize extensively the naturally occurring heat-stable form of ovalbumin. Fertile eggs of the white Leghorn hen were incubated at 38 ± 0.5 °C at 80% relative humidity. The developmental stages during incubation were assigned according to Hamburger and Hamilton (13Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10048) Google Scholar). Hatching occurred on day 21 or at stage 46 (where day 0 denotes stage 1, shortly after oviposition). Egg white and yolk were separately withdrawn as described in a previous report (7Sugimoto Y. Saito A. Kusakabe T. Hori K. Koga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Amniotic fluid was taken carefully with a syringe needle from the amnion after the stage when it began to be apparent; if the fluid was thin, it was concentrated by lyophilization before analysis. Serum was withdrawn from an extra-embryonic blood vessel with a syringe needle, avoiding contamination of other material. Serum specimens were also collected from hatched chicks and adults. All specimens were processed to remove insoluble material (7Sugimoto Y. Saito A. Kusakabe T. Hori K. Koga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Sugimoto Y. Hanada S. Koga K. Sakaguchi B. Biochim . Biophys . Acta. 1984; 788: 117-123Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) before using for further experiments. The stable form of ovalbumin, called S-ovalbumin, was induced according to modification of a previous method (14Huntington J. Patston P. Gettins G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); 1% aqueous solution of native ovalbumin purified from day 0 egg white (see below) was filtered through a 0.22-μm Millex filter (Millipore) and incubated at 55 °C for 3 days in 50 mmCHES buffer, pH 9.2; under these conditions almost all albumin molecules were expected to assume the S form (6Nguyen L.T.H. Smith D.B. CSIRO Food Res. Q. 1984; 44: 44-48Google Scholar, 14Huntington J. Patston P. Gettins G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 1% aqueous solutions of crude or purified ovalbumin were heated at 80, 90, or 97 °C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C; the supernatants and/or precipitates were then subjected to further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the phenol method as described (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE using 12% gels and native PAGE using 8% gels were performed according to the methods of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and Davis (17Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar), respectively, in 25 mmTris-glycine, pH 8.0, with or without SDS. Coagulants formed after heating were dissolved in the SDS buffer prior to electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or subjected to Western blotting with polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), which were reacted with anti-rabbit goat IgG (see below) previously labeled with peroxidase (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Antiserum was raised against purified native ovalbumin from day 0 egg white using adult male rabbits and verified by Ouchterlony's double diffusion test (19Ouchterlony D. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1949; 26: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). IgG against ovalbumin was purified by Protein A (Bio-Rad) column chromatography and then by ovalbumin-agarose affinity chromatography. Ovalbumin was purified by the following three steps: 1) precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate at pH 4.5 followed by solubilization in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4 (this step was repeated three times); 2) column chromatography with CM-Cellulofine C-200 m (Seikagaku Kogyo) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4; ovalbumin fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.4 m made up in the same buffer; when only small amounts of protein were available, CM-Cellulofine column chromatography was replaced by affinity column chromatography using anti-ovalbumin IgG agarose (Pharmacia); 3) gel filtration with a column of SW 3000G (Toso) using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Far-UV CD spectra (180–250 nm) were recorded at 25 °C with a JASCO 720 spectropolarimeter. Samples were at a concentration of 2.0 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity (degree cm2/dmol) employing a mean residue molecular weight of 111, which was based on the molecular weight of 42,747 and 385 amino acid residues. The predicted degree of secondary structure was calculated by the program SELCON (20Sreeraman N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). DSC was carried out with a Microcal calorimeter VP-DSC at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Protein solutions at 1 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were degassed before analysis. This analysis was conducted using a Bruker MALDI-TOF-MS apparatus (REFLEXII) under the conditions specified by the manufacturer, using bovine serum albumin as a calibrant. In brief, 10 pmol/μl aqueous solution of protein was embedded in a light-absorbing “matrix” (2,5-dihydroxylbenzoic acid), coated onto a sample plate (target), dried, and excited by laser light. The absolute intensity (putative ion mass) of desorbed proton was plotted in arbitrary units against molecular weight. Purified ovalbumin solutions at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated with porcine pepsin (Sigma) at 37 °C under appropriate conditions. The amino acid sequence of some of the peptide fragments obtained was analyzed using an Applied Biosystems 491A sequencer. Embryonic organs were dissected out and washed extensively with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with 154 mm saline) at 4 °C. Then these were fixed with Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm thickness at room temperature. Sometimes whole embryos were similarly processed. The sections were deparaffinized, blocked with PBS containing 20% normal goat serum and 1% BSA for 1 h to minimize nonspecific staining, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified anti-ovalbumin rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) suspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA (BSA/PBS). The sections were washed extensively with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with 8 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce). After washing with PBS as above, the specimens were stained by addition of 0.05% diaminobentizine and 0.01% H2O2. The optimum antibody concentration was a dilution of 1:2000. A negative control was performed by using the anti-ovalbumin rabbit IgG preincubated with 100-fold commercial ovalbumin (w/w) as a primary antibody. Western blotting was performed to confirm the ovalbumin distribution in the organs, which were thoroughly washed with PBS and homogenized in 5 volumes of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA before electrophoresis. RNA isolated from embryonic organs (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transblotted to Hybond-N+ (Amersham). The filter was hybridized with32P-labeled ovalbumin cDNA (22Gannon F. O'Hare K. Perrin F. LePennec J.P. Benoist C. Cochet M. Breathnach R. Royal A. Garapin A. Cami B. Chambon P. Nature. 1979; 278: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as a probe. PT-PCR was performed as previously reported (23Kawasaki E.S. Clark S.S. Coyne M.Y. Smith S.D. Champlin R. Witte O.N. McCormick F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5698-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-GCAATTCTAGCCATGGTATACCTGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGATCCTGGCTGAAGAGCTAAACAC-3′ designed from the ovalbumin gene sequence (22Gannon F. O'Hare K. Perrin F. LePennec J.P. Benoist C. Cochet M. Breathnach R. Royal A. Garapin A. Cami B. Chambon P. Nature. 1979; 278: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To detect ovalbumin, the amniotic fluid and the embryonic serum were prepared daily from developing eggs and subjected to SDS-PAGE. It was possible to collect fluid specimens at later stages of development. After day 10 or stage 36, the amniotic fluid showed several protein bands, including a 45-kDa band that was confirmed to possess ovalbumin by Western blotting with affinity-purified anti-ovalbumin IgG (Fig. 1). The immunological signal was strong after day 14 or stage 40. The embryonic serum also exhibited a signal for ovalbumin at the 45-kDa position after day 10 or stage 36 (Fig. 2). Ovalbumin could be hardly detected in the serum specimens from newly hatched chicks (lane H) and young chicks prior to sexual maturation (data not shown), indicating that serum ovalbumin disappears rapidly after hatching (although laying hen serum was found to contain ovalbumin as seen in lane Ad; the basis of this phenomenon will be considered elsewhere).Figure 2SDS-PAGE of proteins in embryonic serum from developing eggs: Coomassie Blue stain (A) and the Western blots with anti-ovalbumin IgG (B). Numerals along abscissa stand for developing age in days after oviposition. Serum was collectable on and after day 10 (stage 36). Hatching occurred on day 21 (stage 46). Additionally, serum specimens from neonates shortly after hatching (lane H) and female adults (lane Ad) were analyzed. For other details, see the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tried to demonstrate that developing eggs contained heat-stable ovalbumin by analyzing specimens before and after heating. We first examined egg white specimens since these were expected to be rich in ovalbumin. Before heating the specimens showed isoform bands A1, A2, and A3 on native PAGE (Fig.3 A); these also showed an ovalbumin signal after Western blotting (Fig. 3 B). After heating at 80 °C for 10 min, little or no band was seen (lane 0 of Fig. 3, C andD), indicating that the egg white specimen on day 0 or stage 1, shortly after oviposition, contained coagulative ovalbumin molecules, which were thus in the native, heat-unstable form. Detailed study indicated that a subtle fraction, up to 2%, of day 0 egg white ovalbumin was heat-stable (data not shown). In contrast, the supernatants on days 3–18 or stages 20–44 gave strong ovalbumin bands (lanes 3–18 of Fig. 3, C andD); thus, these contained noncoagulative material comparable to S-ovalbumin. Banding intensity was the most marked on days 10–12 or stages 36–38. The three ovalbumin isoforms were still present after heating. Moreover, as seen in Fig. 3 (E and F), ovalbumin stable to heating even at 90 °C for 10 min was detected at some stages. We then analyzed the amniotic fluid (day 14, stage 40), the egg yolk (day 18, stage 44), and the embryonic serum (day 19, stage 45). These also gave noncoagulative protein bands in three isoforms in the supernatants after heating at 80 or 90 °C for 10 min (Fig.4). These bands were ascertained to contain ovalbumin by Western blotting analysis (data not shown). Day 11 egg white, day 14 amniotic fluid, and day 19 embryonic serum were each subjected to the purification steps for ovalbumin, in the expectation that the naturally occurring heat-stable form(s) could be isolated. For the egg white and amniotic fluid specimens, after precipitation in 50% ammonium sulfate, DEAE-Cellulofine column chromatography was applied, wherein stable ovalbumin and native ovalbumin were separated from each other on the basis of differential elution in a linear gradient of NaCl (data not shown). Although the peaks were not completely pure, the stable/native ratios could be calculated from the relative peak areas as 3:1 and 5:1 for day 11 egg white and day 14 amniotic fluid, respectively. On the other hand, because the serum specimen contained little protein, after ammonium sulfate precipitation ovalbumin was purified with anti-ovalbumin IgG-agarose in place of DEAE-Cellulofine, whereby it was not possible to separate the two forms to obtain a ratio of stable/native. Each of the heat-stable ovalbumin fractions from egg white and amniotic fluid, as well as the mixture from serum, was subjected to the final purification step by gel filtration through SW 3000G. Upon SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (Fig.5, A and B), all final preparations exhibited a single band. These results showed that the IgG raised for native ovalbumin cross-reacted with stable ovalbumin. The purified ovalbumin preparations are abbreviated as indicated in Table I. In the subsequent experiments, EWS-11 and AMS-14 (the developmentally occurring heat-stable ovalbumin preparations) as well as S-ovalbumin (the heat-stable one artificially induced by heating the native preparation EWN-0 at pH 9.2) were mainly used, although EWN-0 (sometimes together with another native ovalbumin preparation, EWN-11) was also analyzed. No further investigation was carried out with the preparations whose availability was limited.Table IAbbreviations, recoveries, and some molecular properties of purified ovalbumin preparationsSourceNative or stableAbbreviation used in textRecovery1Expressed in the rate per starting material of purification.α-Helix content1Calculated from CD spectra (Fig. 7), expressed in percentage of total ordered structures.β-Sheet content1Calculated from CD spectra (Fig. 7), expressed in percentage of total ordered structures.T m1Due to DSC (see text).M rof highest peak1Due to MALDI-TOF-MS (see text).%%%°CDay 0 egg whiteNativeEWN-048272578.544,570Day 11 egg whiteNativeEWN-11112526——Day 11 egg whiteStableEWS-1135193286.344,490Day 14 amniotic fluidNative—10————Day 14 amniotic fluidStableAMS-1438203386.344,490Day 19 serumMixture—28————Day 0 egg whiteStableS-ovalbumin1Prepared by the heating of EWN-0 at 55 °C for 3 days at pH 9.2.272582.644,570Commercial productNativeNative ovalbumin1Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.291Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.281Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.781Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.—Commercial productStableS-ovalbumin1Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.281Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.281Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.861Cited from Refs. 14 and 32.——, undetermined or unabbreviated.

Molecular data were more or less different between the present and previous native ovalbumin, and between the present and previous S-ovalbumin, probably because of different sources and/or different experimental conditions. EWS-11 was heated at 80, 90, or 97 °C for 10 min, centrifuged, and the supernatants and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6; see theright half). After heating at 80 °C, all material remained in the supernatant (lane 1) and precipitates were scarcely formed, indicating that ovalbumin was stable. Even after heating at 90 or 97 °C, a large part of materials remained in the supernatants (lanes 2 and4, respectively). In these cases, however, precipitates were formed (lanes 3 and 5), indicating that some fractions were unstable. The left halfof Fig. 6 illustrates the results for EWN-0 as a reference; almost all material was recovered in the precipitates upon heating at 80 or 90 °C (lanes 3 and 5, respectively) while no material was seen in the supernatants (lanes 2 and 4), confirming again that EWN-0 was in the native form. AMS-14 gave exactly the same results as those produced by EWS-11 (data not shown). When analyzed for CD spectra, purified preparations of stable and native ovalbumin as well as artificially induced S-ovalbumin from EWN-0 exhibited different patterns (Fig.7). Particularly noticeable was the difference between the heat-stable ovalbumin (EWS-11 or AMS-14) and the native ovalbumin (EWN-0 or EWN-11). S-ovalbumin gave an intermediate curve. The α-helix and β-sheet contents were calculated from the spectra and are summarized in Table I. EWS-11 and AMS-14 had on average 25% less α-helix than EWN-0 and EWN-11. We conclude that the developmentally occurring heat-stable ovalbumin molecules are different in conformation, i.e. less α-helix and a relatively increased share of β-sheet compared with the native counterparts, and even with the artificially induced S-ovalbumin. These conclusions coincided well with our results using DSC (data not shown), which indicated that both EWS-11 and AMS-14 gave a major transition at 86.3 °C, whereas EWN-0 gave a major transition at 78.5 °C (see also Table I for a summary of temperature data). All three preparations gave a shoulder at 82.6 °C. The artificially induced S-ovalbumin gave again an intermediate pattern (with a peak at 82.6 °C and shoulders at 78.5 and 86.3 °C) between native ovalbumin and developmentally occurring heat-stable ovalbumin. MALDI-TOF-MS analyses of ovalbumin preparations revealed about 20 major peaks at the M r of 44,000–45,000 (data not shown). EWS-11 and AMS-14 shared the same curve, whereas EWN-0 exhibited a differential curve. EWS-11 and AMS-14 gave the highest peak at an M r of 44,490, which was not present in EWN-0. EWN-0 had the highest peak at anM r of 44,570, which was present in EWS-11 and AMS-14 but with a decreased height. The gap of 80 between theseM r data might be attributable to the loss of a phosphate residue in the stable ovalbumin. Exactly the same situation was seen at the peaks of 44,250 and 44,330; again, the difference of 80 might be explained similarly. Although the precise relationship between the change of size and heat stability remains to be clarified, the present data clearly indicated that the heat-stable ovalbumin from developing eggs differed from the native conformer in composition of subcomponents. In addition, the induced S-ovalbumin gave a pattern indistinguishable from the native form of ovalbumin. We were unable to analyze directly the N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of the present ovalbumin preparations, probably because they are blocked by an acetylated glycine and an imino acid proline, respectively (24Nisbet A.D. Saundry R.H. Moir A.J.G. Fothergill L.A. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Therefore, to characterize the peptide composition, EWN-0, EWS-11, its supernatant after heating at 80 °C for 10 min, and AMS-14 were each digested with pepsin under conditions appropriate for each preparation and the products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. All showed the same peptide patterns (not shown). A mixture of the fastest and the slowest bands from these preparations gave an amino acid sequence of Ala-Ala-Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-Glu-Phe-Arg-Ala-Asp-His-Pro-Phe-Leu-Phe-X-Ile-Lys-His-Ile-Ala-Thr-Asn. This is a bona fide sequence of ovalbumin, corresponding to residues 351–374 (25Tatsumi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thin sections of developing embryonic organs were examined for immunohistochemical staining using affinity-purified anti-ovalbumin IgG. These experiments could be conducted after day 4 or stage 24, and all specimens until hatching gave positive signals for ovalbumin, although not discriminated for the native and stable forms. Fig.8 illustrates typical results on day 5.5 or stage 28, when the brain system has begun to exhibit extensive organogenesis (13Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10048) Google Scholar). As shown in panel A, immunostain was most intensive in the central nervous system, although mesenchymal tissues, developing kidney, epidermis, and inner masses (probably the contents of alimentary canal, which will be considered again below) were to some extent positive. Inpanel B, signals are seen in the ependymal tissue surrounding the ventricle (V). In panel D, heavy stain was produced in the rhombencephalon (next to another ventricle, V). In panel F, stain was clearly detectable in the developing spinal ganglia (arrowheads). Positive signals were mostly seen in the cytoplasm. There were no positive reactions in controls (panels C, E, and G, corresponding to B, D, and F, respectively), carried out with IgG preincubated with excess amounts of commercial ovalbumin. The organ distribution was also confirmed by Western blotting. Fig.9 illustrates the results for specimens on day 18 or stage 44, when embryogenesis is almost complete. Positive signals for ovalbumin were seen in the extracts of many organs including the head, eye, heart (although the signal was weak), liver (showing rather complex banding patterns), intestine, spinal cord, muscle, dermis, and bone (again the signal was weak). The band intensity for the stomach contents was by far stronger than that for the stomach tissue itself. This is reminiscent of the positive stain in the inner masses on the whole mount thin section presented in Fig.8 A. It is noteworthy that the migration rate of the major band in SDS-PAGE was roughly similar to that of control ovalbumin in all organ extracts including the stomach contents (Fig. 9). The neonate organs were no longer positive for ovalbumin shortly after hatching (data not shown). RNA extracted from the day 7 (stage 31) head and carcass as well as from the day 18 (stage 44) head, muscle, and liver was subjected to the Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR under the conditions specified under “Experimental Procedures.” None of the extracts indicated the presence of ovalbumin sequence (data not shown). Thus, there may be little or no ovalbumin gene expression in the relevant organs or tissues. The present study showed that an ovalbumin-like material accumulates in the amniotic fluid, serum, yolk, and organs including the central nervous system of the chick embryo. It is unlikely to be Hsp47, which is another non-inhibitory serpin functioning as a collagen chaperon and with 41% homology to ovalbumin (26Clarke E.P. Sanwal B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1129: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), since immunological experiments using poly- and monoclonal antibodies to ovalbumin and Hsp47 reveal no cross-reactivity. 2Y. Sugimoto, unpublished data. Thin sections and organ extracts showed positive signals for anti-ovalbumin IgG (present study) and for anti-ovalbumin monoclonal antibodies.2 Together with the partial amino acid sequence data obtained here, we conclude that the material detected in embryo was authentic ovalbumin. Although the chick liver has been reported to be able to express ovalbumin (27Dierich A. Gaub M.-P. LePennec J.-P. Astinotti D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the ovalbumin molecule detected in the present study cannot be the product of de novo synthesis, since no signals for ovalbumin mRNA were seen in the chick liver and other tissues. Thus, the major origin of ovalbumin found in the developing embryo must be egg white. Our preliminary studies also showed that other egg white members such as lysozyme and ovotransferrin were detectable in embryonic organs. This suggests that there may be a direct flow of egg white proteins to the developing embryo. It is likely that ovalbumin is present in most regions of an embryo, exhibiting differences in apparent amounts from organ to organ. A previous in vitro culture of embryo explants with 11–13 somites (28Hassel J. Klein N.W. Dev. Biol. 1971; 26: 3392-3880Google Scholar) has indicated that radiolabeled exogenous ovalbumin can reach the brain and trunk without degradation, although a large part was digested to amino acids. We propose that at least a fraction of ovalbumin molecules is transported intact from egg white to the embryonic organs, including the brain, probably via the amniotic fluid, embryonic serum, and egg yolk, which are all rich in egg white proteins as reported here and in previous articles (7Sugimoto Y. Saito A. Kusakabe T. Hori K. Koga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Sugimoto Y. Hanada S. Koga K. Sakaguchi B. Biochim . Biophys .

Deutch H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 185: 155-161Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the amniotic fluid can come into contact directly with the embryo via an open channel to the head region, where the neural system is formed. 3S. Ohsako, unpublished data. As ovalbumin was detected in the cytoplasm, it is probably incorporated into cells through a specific receptor. Ovalbumin may be digested by chymotrypsin and other proteinases. In particular, the heat-stable preparations obtained in the present study were more susceptible to chymotrypsin and thermolysin than native ovalbumin.2 A previous study (14Huntington J. Patston P. Gettins G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also indicated higher rates of degradation of S-ovalbumin than the native ovalbumin by porcine pancreatic elastase and subtilisin Carlsberg. However, a 45-kDa ovalbumin band could be detected in the stomach contents, indicating that this molecule is rather intact in terms of size. The degradation of ovalbumin in ovo by endogenous proteinases may possibly be repressed by specific inhibitors such as ovoinhibitor and its yolk analog named vitelloinhibitor (7Sugimoto Y. Saito A. Kusakabe T. Hori K. Koga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Sugimoto Y. Kusakabe T. Nagaoka S. Nirasawa T. Tasuguchi K. Fujii M. Aoki T. Koga K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1295: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In fact, our preliminary experiments have indicated that the degradation of ovalbumin by chymotrypsin and trypsin was effectively inhibited in vitroby these inhibitors. As described above, the naturally occurring heat-stable ovalbumin could be separated from the native one by column chromatography. This method made it possible to calculate the stable/total ratios without heating (75% in stage 37 egg white and 83% in stage 40 amniotic fluid). Moreover, a higher value of 90% was obtained for stage 44 egg yolk (details not shown), and fractions of ovalbumin were tolerant to heating even at 97 °C for 10 min. This fact, together with the finding that complex patterns were obtained by CD and DSC analyses for heat-stable ovalbumin, suggests that different forms of stable ovalbumin coexist. This is compatible with the fact that many intermediary types of S-ovalbumin are obtained during artificial induction depending upon pH and temperature conditions (6Nguyen L.T.H. Smith D.B. CSIRO Food Res. Q. 1984; 44: 44-48Google Scholar, 14Huntington J. Patston P. Gettins G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, ovalbumin may participate differently at different stages of development, although details remain to be elucidated. Whether the ovalbumin molecules detected in the developing organs are in a heat-stable form or not is uncertain at present. CD spectroscopy indicated that the heat-stable ovalbumin has undergone conformational changes including a decrease in α-helix content. We suppose that stable ovalbumin may arise naturally from native ovalbumin during development while converting its secondary conformation. However, the direct relationship of the secondary structures to heat stability is unclear, since artificially induced S-ovalbumin exhibited CD and DSC values rather similar to those of native ovalbumin. This was also observed in a previous report (14Huntington J. Patston P. Gettins G.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The current analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS indicated that the formation of stable ovalbumin accompanies a fluctuation in size microheterogeneity, probably including the removal of phosphate residues from some of the subcomponents. Earlier work (30Saito Z. Martin W.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1966; 44: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) also indicated that ovalbumin with decreased phosphorus residues is present in the embryonic serum. Therefore, the size microheterogeneity, which is an intrinsic property of ovalbumin reflecting its highly differential modification by phosphorylation (30Saito Z. Martin W.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1966; 44: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as well by glycosylation (31Koketsu M. Yamamoto T. Tuneja L.R. Hatla H. Kim M. Hen Eggs. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 99-115Google Scholar), may have relevance to the developmental changes in both stability and configuration reported here. Additional evidence about the difference in properties between the native and heat-stable conformers of ovalbumin is provided by our preliminary observations that the heat-stable ovalbumin preparations isolated here were easily converted by themselves to potent inhibitors for chymotrypsin and other proteinases by heating at 80 or 90 °C for 10 min. Although the physiological significance of this finding is unclear, this conversion has never been observed for native ovalbumin in repeated trials using different preparations and under variable heating conditions (although there has been a report describing the conversion of a certain commercially available native ovalbumin preparation to “I-ovalbumin” having inhibitory activity against serine proteinases by heating at 97 °C; see Ref. 32Mellet P. Michels B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30311-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Egg white ovalbumin has also been known to change spontaneously into a heat-stable form during storage of unfertilized eggs at 38 °C (5Smith D.B. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1964; 17: 261-270Crossref Google Scholar,6Nguyen L.T.H. Smith D.B. CSIRO Food Res. Q. 1984; 44: 44-48Google Scholar). This was reproducible in the present study; when newly deposited, unfertilized eggs were kept at 38 °C, proteins stable to heating at 80 °C for 10 min occurred in egg white after 3 days (data not shown). However, the bands appearing in the supernatants of developing eggs after heating at 90 °C for 10 min were never observable in unfertilized eggs allowed to stand at 38 °C for up to 19 days. The conformational alteration taking place in developing eggs may therefore be somewhat different from the spontaneous one seen in unfertilized eggs. We propose that egg white ovalbumin moves into the embryonic organs by changing its form to less ordered structures fitted to transportation. Ovalbumin may not merely be a storage protein serving as an amino acid source but may also have a more dynamic function in developing organic cells. It will be of importance to verify this inference through extensive analyses of ovalbumin and its related proteins. We are very grateful to C. Kawano, R. Kobayashi, and H. Uetsuji for ardent technical assistance; to Y. Hirohata of Sibel Hegner Japan Co. for performing DSC analysis; to Dr. M. R.

We have identified cyclin G as being overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer cells using differential display polymerase chain reaction screening. We demonstrate here that cyclin G is overexpressed in human breast and prostate cancer cells and in cancer cells in situ from tumor specimens. Cyclin G expression was tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle in normal breast cells, peaking at the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle with lower levels in G1. The cell cycle-dependent expression was absent in breast cancer cells. Following DNA damage in normal p53+/+ cells, cyclin G is triggered to cluster in discrete nuclear DNA replication foci that contain replication-associated proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). While p53−/− cells displayed a faint cyclin G nuclear staining pattern, there was no increased expression and no change in distribution of the staining pattern after DNA damage. The specific subcellular localization of cyclin G at DNA replication foci provides an additional link between p53-mediated growth arrest and cell cycle regulation and suggests that cyclin G may act as an effector of p53-mediated events by functional association with replication foci protein(s).

Human cancer development is a multistage process that results from the stepwise acquisition of genetic alterations. These alterations may involve the dysregulation of a variety of normal cellular functions, leading to the initiation and progression of a tumor. Among normal cellular functions, regulatory control of the cell cycle plays an important role in normal cell proliferation, and genetic alterations that affect cell cycle control have been shown to be associated with tumor progression (reviewed in Refs. 1Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 2Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1071-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 3Hartwell L.H.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1071-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In association with a family of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, cyclins maintain the orderly progression of cells through the various phases of the cell cycle. The link between oncogenesis and cyclins has been made with the aberrant expression of two cyclins (cyclin A and D1) in human tumors (2Hunter T. Pines J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cyc G has homology to fission yeast Cig1, B-type cyclins, and human cyclins A and I (13Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6050-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Unlike other cyclin family members, Cyc G lacks a “destruction box” motif that controls the ubiquitin-dependent degradation but contains an epidermal growth factor receptor-like autophosphorylation motif (11Tamura K.

Cyc G is the only known cyclin that is transcriptionally activated by the p53 tumor suppressor gene, suggesting that it may play a role in p53-mediated cell growth control (12Okamoto K. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 13Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol.

Furthermore, despite its high homology with other cyclins, Cyc G has not yet been matched with a cyclin-dependent kinase binding partner, and its biological function remains elusive. However, Cyc G forms a complex with B′ regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A following its induction by p53 (17Okamoto K. Kamibayashi C. Serrano M. Prives C. Mumby M.C. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast to most p53 target genes such asp21/Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1, Bax1, IGF-BP, andGadd45, Cyc G does not seem to exert a tumor-suppressive role but rather, like other cyclins or proto-oncogenes, plays a growth-promoting role (15Smith M.L. Kontny H.U. Bortnick R. Fornace A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Wu L. Liu L. Yee A. Carbonaro-Hall D. Tolo V.T. Hall F. Oncol.

Fornace A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Cyc G overexpression has been observed in human osteosarcoma cells (18Wu L. Liu L. Yee A. Carbonaro-Hall D. Tolo V.T. Hall F. Oncol. Rep. 1994; 1: 705-711PubMed Google Scholar,19Skotzko M. Wu L. Anderson W.F. Gordon E.M. Hall F.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5493-5498PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, we identified the cyc G gene using differential screening (differential display PCR) (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) between human normal and tumor breast cells. Here we report the expression pattern, cellular localization, cell cycle regulation, and Cyc G response to p53 induction in normal and breast cancer cells. We show that aberrant expression of Cyc G may be closely associated with the tumorigenic process. Our demonstration that following DNA damage, Cyc G is triggered to cluster in highly organized nuclear compartments representing DNA replication foci may provide an additional link between p53-mediated growth arrest and cell cycle control. Together, these data suggest that Cyc G may act as an effector in p53-mediated tumor suppression by functional association with replication foci protein(s). The quality of total RNA was tested by Northern blot analysis before reverse transcription. Differential display PCR was performed using the RNAimageTM Kit 1 according to the manufacturer's protocol (GenHunter). The cDNA products were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using H-AP3 5′ primer (5′-AAGCTTTGGTCAG-3′) and H-T11G 3′ primer. The band of interest was isolated, PCR-reamplified using the same primers as above, cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). This partial-length clone was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primed synthesis method and used as a probe to obtain the full-length clone by screening a cDNA library prepared from normal mammary epithelial cells (22Lee S.W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Primary human normal mammary epithelial cells (hNMECs) were established from reduction mammoplasties obtained through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network and designated 14N and 15N, as described (23Emerman J.T. Wilkinson D.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mouse mammary epithelial cells (mNMECs) were derived from 129/Sv (p53+/+) and 129/Sv-Trp53 m/Tyj (p53−/−) mice obtained from Jackson Laboratories. These cells were grown in DFCI-1 medium (D Complete) as described (24Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and were used at early to mid passage, i.e. 5–10 population doublings. Human breast cancer cells (MCF7, T47D, Hs578t, MDAMB435, and MDAMB436) were obtained from ATCC. Growth media for these mammary cancer cells was DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary human normal prostate cells were derived from normal adjacent tumor tissue biopsies received from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network and designated NPrEC-1 and -2. These cultures were grown in Clonetics Prostate Epithelial Media. The human prostate carcinoma cell lines PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 were purchased from the ATCC and maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS. ND1 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Narayan. EJ-p53, EJ-CAT cells, and Saos 2-p53 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) in DMEM, 10% FBS as described previously (26Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To induce the expression of p53, cells were washed three times with PBS, and fresh medium without tetracycline was added. The murine cell lines Vm10, VhD, and 10.1 were a gift from Xiangwei Wu (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS plus hygromycin (50 μg/ml) as described (27Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). hNMECs were synchronized by growth factor deprivation, lovastatin, or nacodazole block. Synchronization by growth factor deprivation has been described previously (28Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cells were arrested at G0 after the removal of growth factors from the growth media, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. At time 0, cells were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of DFCI-1 complete medium with growth factors, and the DNA synthesis rate was estimated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Cells cycle synchronization in G1 was carried out using lovastatin as described (28Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hNMECs were grown in D complete medium supplemented with 15 μm lovastatin for 24 h. Cells were induced to enter the cell cycle by the removal of lovastatin and the addition of 1.5 mm mevalonic acid. Parallel cultures were collected at several time points to analyze mRNA and protein levels or were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed for DNA content using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS and were synchronized by 20 μmlovastatin for 33 h, followed by 2.0 mm mevalonic acid, and were harvested as described above. Nacodazole-induced G2/M-phase block was done as described (29Kiyokawa N. Yan D.-H. Brown M.E. Hung M.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml nacodazole for 24 h and then nacodazole was removed, cultures were washed, and fresh growth medium was added. Cells were harvested and analyzed as described above. For FACS analysis, cells were fixed with 80% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min and washed with PBS. Cells were suspended in RNase (10 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, washed, and stained for DNA content with 5 mg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed with Elite software. Immunohistologic studies were performed on 4-μm frozen sections cut from tissues embedded in OCT. Tissue blocks were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, eastern division. Immunostaining of sections was performed by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) as follows. Tissues were treated to remove endogenous peroxidase activity, blocked with goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated in primary anti-Cyc G antibody (10 μg/ml; UBI) for 2 h. Sections were washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 30 min. Following PBS washes, the sections were incubated with ABC Elite reagent for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. The bound horseradish peroxidase complexes were developed using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma Fastdab) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted with glass coverslips. Cells were plated onto chamber slides (Lab-Tek), and when 50% confluent, they were treated with DNA-damaging agents as described below and then fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Staining was carried out as follows. Cells were blocked with PBST containing 10% heat-inactivated goat serum, 3% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Cyc G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) catalog no. SC-320) or nonspecific rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) was diluted with 0.1% nonfat milk/PBST. Cells were incubated for 1.5 h, rinsed in PBST, and then stained with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Cells were then observed with a Zeiss Axioscope I photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence. Cyc G antibodies (UBI and Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-PCNA (clone PC10; Oncogene) were used for dual labeling. Double immunofluorescence labeling was carried out with two different secondary antibodies specific to each primary antibody, and double exposures were taken. Co-localization between Cyc G (red, rhodamine) and PCNA (green, fluorescein isothiocyanate) proteins was tested on mitomycin C (MMC; 10 μg/ml)-treated hNMEC (15N) cells using two-color immunostaining. Detergent extraction of the cells followed by methanol fixation removed detergent-soluble PCNA and enabled the clear visualization of detergent-insoluble PCNA, the form that is tightly complexed to DNA in replication foci (23Emerman J.T. Wilkinson D.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 50% confluence; MMC was added to cultures at 5 or 10 μg/ml; and cells were harvested after 6, 12, and 24 h of treatment. Actinomycin D was added to cultures at a final concentration of 10 or 20 ng/ml and harvested at 12, 24, and 48 h of treatment. Cells were also exposed to 6 Gy γ-irradiation in a Mark 137I cesium source irradiator and recovered for 12 h. Cells were collected in reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and boiled for 5 min for Western blots or collected in guanidium isothiocyanate buffer for RNA extraction. For Western blot analysis, samples were adjusted for equal protein and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blots were probed with antibodies to Cyc G (UBI), Cdc2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. 054), wild-type p53 (AB-6; Oncogene), and β-actin (clone AC-15; Sigma). Bands were detected using the ECL chemilluminescence detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted, denatured, and electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel (20 μg of total RNA/lane). The gel was transferred to nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridized as follows. Human Cyc G, p21, p53, histone H4, and 36B4 probes were 32P-labeled by using random primed DNA labeling techniques. Blots were exposed on x-ray film after washing. In all cases, films were scanned (HP ScanJet IIcs) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software. Using the differential display PCR technique (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) to survey differentially expressed clones in human mammary normal and tumor cells, we isolated a cDNA fragment, 15-1 clone, with higher abundance in cancer (T47D and MDAMB435) compared with normal cells (14N and 15N). After reamplification and subcloning, 15-1 cDNA fragment was used to confirm the differential display expression patterns on Northern blot. Sequence analysis and comparison of 15-1 clone to those within the GenBankTM data base revealed a 100% sequence match to the 3′-untranslated region of the human cyclin G cDNA (13Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6050-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Bates S. Rowan S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1103-1109PubMed Google Scholar). Using this partial clone as a probe, a normal human mammary cDNA library was screened and a full-length cDNA was isolated. We first examined the expression of Cyc G in human mammary normal and tumor epithelial cell lines. As shown in Fig.1, all human breast cancer cell lines examined had higher levels of Cyc G protein expression, regardless of estrogen receptor status, but a low level of expression was detected in human normal mammary epithelial cells (14N and 15N). In addition, higher levels of Cyc G protein were observed in human prostate tumor cell lines when compared with normal prostate epithelial cells (Fig.1). The distribution of Cyc G protein was determined using immunohistochemistry in a number of human normal and tumor breast tissue specimens to define the relationship between Cyc G expression and breast cancer development. A total of 40 different cases were analyzed, including 10 normal biopsies, and 30 tumor biopsies (10in situ carcinomas, seven infiltrating ductal carcinomas, six infiltrating lobular carcinomas, and seven fibroadenomas). Among the normal biopsies, little or no nuclear or cytoplasmic Cyc G staining was observed either in the epithelial or stromal cells of the ductal units (Fig. 2 A). However, 22 of the 30 tumor samples showed increased Cyc G expression that was specific to nuclei of epithelial cells (Fig. 2, C,E, and G). Positive nuclear staining was observed in seven of the 10 in situ carcinomas, five of six infiltrating ductal carcinomas, four of six infiltrating lobular carcinomas, and six of seven fibroadenomas. With the exception of the fibroadenomas, stromal cells of the tumor biopsies showed no staining. Our findings indicate that Cyc G overexpression is a frequent occurrence in breast cancer. To gain further insight into the possible function(s) of Cyc G, we compared the expression patterns of Cyc G mRNA and protein throughout the cell cycle in normal versus tumor cells (Fig.3, A and B). A normal human breast epithelial cell strain (15N) and a human mammary cancer cell line (MCF7) were synchronized by three different methods: 1) lovastatin (cells arrest at G1); 2) growth factor deprivation (G0; normal cells only); and 3) nacodazole (G2/M). Synchronization of both cell types was monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation, histone H4 expression, and flow cytometry analysis (FACS) (Fig. 3 C). Northern and Western blot analyses of cells harvested at regular intervals revealed a differential expression pattern of Cyc G during cell cycle progression in normal versus tumor cells (Fig. 3). In normal cells (NMECs), Cyc G mRNA and protein levels were low to undetectable during most of G1 phase. As cells entered into S phase, a marked induction of Cyc G was observed, which remained high throughout the S and G2/M phases, correlating with histone H4 expression (Fig. 3 A). A similar pattern of expression was observed with all three synchronization methods in normal cells. However, in a human breast cancer line, MCF7, cell cycle-dependent expression was absent; instead, there was a consistent high level of expression throughout the cell cycle (Fig.3 B). MCF7 cells were synchronized by lovastatin or nacodazole, both of which gave similar patterns of Cyc G expression (Fig. 3 B). Cyc G overexpression in cancer cells may result from an altered cell cycle regulation. cyc Gis a transcriptional target gene of p53 that contains two p53-binding elements in its promotor region (12Okamoto K. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 16Zauberman A. Lupo A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1994; 10: 2361-2366Google Scholar). High basal levels of Cyc G expression in tumor cells lacking functional p53 suggest that altered expression of Cyc G may be independent of p53 dysregulation and may contribute to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. To examine the possibility of an altered response of Cyc G by p53 in some cell types, we have utilized a tetracycline-regulated p53-inducible system in tumor cell lines (Saos2-p53 and EJ-p53) that contain nonfunctional p53 and a high basal level of Cyc G. As shown in Fig.4 A, after tetracycline removal, p53 mRNA was readily detectable (data not shown) as well as p21 mRNA, a p53 transcriptional target gene. After removal of tetracycline in both cell lines, Cyc G levels remained unchanged, although p21 mRNA was induced dramatically after 12 h, indicating p53 transcriptional activity. This level of expression remained consistent and unchanged over time (up to 5 days), suggesting no specific induction of Cyc G expression by p53 in these cell types. However, the expression of Cyc G was dramatically induced following wild-type p53 activation in VhD and Vm10 cells (27Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), which express low basal levels of Cyc G (Fig. 4 B). The VhD and Vm10 are immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines containing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant (Val to Ala mutation at codon 135, tsp53), which express a nonfunctional p53 at 37–39 °C and fully functional p53 at 32 °C. The VhD cells undergo reversible G1 arrest in a p53-dependent manner at 32 °C, while the Vm10 cell line, which constitutively expresses tsp53 and the c-myc oncogene undergoes apoptosis at 32 °C (27Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The expression of p21 in these two tsp53 cell lines was low before the temperature shift and increased with similar kinetics to Cyc G induction. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the activation of Cyc G expression by p53 induction or activation is universal for both growth arrest and apoptotic pathways but only observed in cells containing low basal expression of Cyc G. In order to determine regulation and localization of Cyc G in response to DNA damage, we first examined the expression and localization of Cyc G in mNMECs isolated from p53-deficient mice after treatment with DNA damaging agents. Cells from the mammary glands of p53 null mice as well as cells from wild type mice were treated with actinomycin D (not shown) or MMC. Northern blot analysis showed that Cyc G mRNA expression was induced after treatment with actinomycin D in wild-type cells, while in p53 null cells, Cyc G mRNA was hardly detectable, and no induction was observed after DNA damage treatment (Fig. 5 A,top). We also examined the cells for distribution of Cyc G protein before and after DNA damage with MMC using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5 A, bottom). In wild-type cells, the staining with anti-Cyc G antibodies revealed an amplification of distinct punctate patterns in nuclei following DNA damage treatment, while untreated cells had a lower number of punctate nuclear signals. These MMC-treated wild-type cells also showed strong recruitment of p53 to the nuclei. However, p53 null cells displayed a very faint Cyc G nuclear staining pattern, and there was no increase of signals after DNA damage (Fig. 5 A). We next compared the distribution of Cyc G before and after DNA damage in human normal and tumor mammary epithelial cells (Fig.5 B). When 15N cells (hNMEC) were methanol-fixed and stained for Cyc G, a distinct but low level nuclear signal was detected (Fig.5 B), similar to that seen in p53+/+ mNMEC (Fig.5 A). The staining correlated well with the Western blot analysis, which showed low levels of Cyc G protein in NMECs compared with tumor cell lines (Fig. 1). After exposure to MMC, a dramatic amplification of Cyc G signal was observed, which was localized to the nucleus in a discrete staining pattern, consisting of 6–10 brightly labeled clusters per cell reminiscent of DNA replication foci (Fig.5 B). In human mammary cancer cells, the patterns of Cyc G localization were not as distinct as those seen in normal cells, although the staining was still present in the nucleus (Fig.5 B). We used two tumor mammary cancer cell lines: MCF7, containing wild-type p53, and T47D, containing a nonfunctional mutated p53 gene (30Wosikowski K. Regis J.T. Robey R.W. Alvarez M. Buters J.T. Gudas J.M. Bates S.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1395-1403PubMed Google Scholar). Both lines have higher basal expression levels of Cyc G as compared with hNMEC (Fig.5 B). MCF7 cells displayed amplified nuclear staining signals in response to DNA damage, but T47D cells did not show any induction of Cyc G protein by DNA damage (Fig. 5 B). The distribution of staining for both cell types also appeared predominantly nuclear. The localization observed after DNA damage in normal cells suggests that Cyc G may be recruited to areas of DNA replication and repair, delineated as DNA replication foci, where proteins such as PCNA and several cyclins including cyclin A and D have been shown to colocalize (31Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Given the pattern of Cyc G localization in the nucleus and the potential involvement of Cyc G in DNA replication and repair, we explored the possibility of an association between Cyc G and PCNA, which plays an essential role in nucleic acid metabolism as a component of the replication and repair machinery. Co-localization between Cyc G and PCNA proteins was tested"

In cells exposed to genotoxic agents including etoposide and cytosine arabinoside, MEKK1 is cleaved at Asp874by caspases. The cleaved kinase domain of MEKK1, itself, stimulates caspase activity leading to apoptosis. Kinase-inactive MEKK1 expressed in HEK293 cells effectively blocks genotoxin-induced apoptosis. Treatment of cells with taxol, a microtubule stabilizing agent, did not induce MEKK1 cleavage in cells, and kinase-inactive MEKK1 expression failed to block taxol-induced apoptosis. MEKK1 became activated in HEK293 cells exposed to taxol, but in contrast to etoposide-treatment, taxol failed to increase JNK activity. Taxol treatment of cells, therefore, dissociates MEKK1 activation from the regulation of the JNK pathway. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 blocked MEKK1 and taxol-induced apoptosis but did not block the caspase-dependent cleavage of MEKK1 in response to etoposide. This indicates Bcl2 inhibition of apoptosis is, therefore, downstream of caspase-dependent MEKK1 cleavage. The results define the involvement of MEKK1 in the induction of apoptosis by genotoxins but not microtubule altering drugs.

It is generally believed that the caspase cleavage of specific proteins results in the irreversible commitment of cells to undergo apoptosis (12Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Overexpression of Bcl2 inhibits the activation of caspases and blocks genotoxin and taxol-induced apoptosis (13Allen R.T. Cluck M.W. Agrawal D.K. Cell. Mol.

The anti-apoptotic action of Bcl2 is believed to involve its interaction with Apaf1, the Ced4 homologue that binds to and controls the activation of caspase-9 (18Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J.

Alternatively, Bcl2 interaction with Bax prevents the pro-apoptotic action of Bax by forming Bcl2-Bax dimer (15Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, also referred to as CPP32, cleaves MEKK1 at Asp874, releasing a COOH-terminal 91-kDa fragment that encodes the MEKK1 kinase domain (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of MEKK1 results in the cleavage of MEKK1 generating the 91-kDa kinase fragment. The cleavage of MEKK1 and activation of its kinase activity leads to further activation of caspases. Kinase inactive MEKK1 effectively reduces caspase activation induced by genotoxins (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This suggests that MEKK1 cleavage is involved in the amplification of caspases and thus contributes to apoptosis. Herein, we show that kinase inactive MEKK1 blocks etoposide-induced apoptosis but fails to block microtubule-interfering toxin-induced apoptosis. Treatment with etoposide resulted in cleavage of MEKK1 that was not detected following taxol or vinblastine treatment of cells. Thus, MEKK1 contributes to genotoxin-induced apoptosis, whereas microtubule-interfering toxins induce apoptosis independent of MEKK1 cleavage. Our findings illustrate the existence of two different signaling pathways, one responsive to DNA damage and the other to microtubule toxins that differentially involve caspase-dependent MEKK1 cleavage. 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-c), etoposide, taxol, and vinblastine were purchased from Sigma. Ara-c was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, whereas etoposide, taxol, and vinblastine were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Anti-MEKK1 antiserum (c-22) was purchased from Santa Cruz, and anti-poly(A) ribose polymerase (PARP) antiserum was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products) and containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology) (RPMI-c). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products) and containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Jurkat cells were incubated with 10 μm Ara-c, 10 μm etoposide, 10 μm taxol, or 1 μm vinblastine. HEK293 cells were incubated with 100 μm etoposide or 10 μm taxol. Lower concentrations showed reduced apoptosis in a dose-response curve (data not shown). The cells were lysed as described previously (29Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmEGTA, and 10 μm digitonin for 10 min at 37 °C. Lysates (120 μg) were incubated with 5 μm DEVE-AMC (Bachem) in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Jurkat cells (1–2 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and a dilution of 1:50 Annexin V-Flos solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Four hundred μl of incubation buffer was then added, and the cells were sorted on a flow cytometer using 488-nm excitation and a 515-nm band-pass filter for fluorescence detection and a filter >560 nm for propidium iodide detection. Apoptotic cells were defined as green fluorescent positive and propidium iodide negative. HEK293 cells were stained with acridine orange (100 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined from cells containing normal DNA staining compared with cells with condensed DNA. MEKK1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (500 μg) with antibodies raised against specific sequences of MEKK1 (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were used in anin vitro kinase assay with recombinant kinase, inactive SEK1 (SEK1 K-M), as described previously (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after which the gel was fixed in methanol. The extent of MEKK1 autophosphorylation and SEK1 K-M phosphorylation was determined on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Devices). JNK activity was measured by a solid-phase kinase assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun1–79 (GST-Jun) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads to affinity purify JNK from cell lysates as described previously (23Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the phosphorylation of GST-Jun was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Devices). In other studies, similar results were obtained by immunoprecipitation of JNK from cell lysate as with GST-Jun beads. HEK293 cells were transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3 containing the open reading frame of Bcl2. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 days, G418 (1.5 mg/ml) was added to the cells, and clones were isolated and analyzed for Bcl2 overexpression. Positive clones overexpressing Bcl2, detected by Western blotting, relative to cells transfected with vector alone were isolated. Transient transfection of pcDNA3 containing the open reading frame of MEKK1 was performed using LipofectAMINE. In HEK293 cells, the genotoxin etoposide, but not the microtubule toxin taxol, induced the cleavage of the 196-kDa MEKK1 protein at concentrations that maximize the apoptotic response indicated by the loss of full-length MEKK1 (Fig.1 A). The cleavage fragments of endogenous MEKK1 were not detected consistent with the other cleaved proteins in HEK293 cells (21Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Indeed, total 196-kDa MEKK1 protein levels actually increased in response to taxol over the same 48-h time course where etoposide treatment caused a loss of MEKK1 protein. Differences in MEKK1 protein levels was not because of differences in general protein amounts because protein levels of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP1), that is not cleaved in response to apoptotic stimuli (21Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), remained similar in HEK293 cells following treatment with taxol or etoposide. Caspase activation and apoptotic response by taxol, however, was similar in magnitude to that for etoposide (Fig. 1 B). A second microtubule-disrupting agent, vinblastine, also failed to induce cleavage of full-length MEKK1 in HEK293 cells (data not shown) but induced caspase activity and an apoptotic response similar to taxol and etoposide (Fig. 1 B). The difference between DNA-damaging drugs and microtubule toxins inducing MEKK1 cleavage was also observed in Jurkat cells. The DNA-damaging drugs Ara-c and etoposide induce MEKK1 cleavage, shown by loss of the 196-kDa enzyme (Fig.2 A), activation of caspases, and apoptosis (Fig. 2 B); however, Arc-c was less effective at inducing caspase activity and apoptosis as compared with etoposide. We have demonstrated previously that MEKK1 cleavage is caspase-dependent (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In contrast, taxol and vinblastine treatment of Jurkat cells resulted in an initial increase in MEKK1 expression similar to that observed with HEK293 cells. Over time, MEKK1 protein levels in response to taxol diminished to that or somewhat lower levels from that of control cells. This contrasts to HEK293 cells where MEKK1 protein remained elevated following exposure of cells to taxol. Taxol and vinblastine stimulated caspase activity and induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 B) similar to that observed in HEK293 cells. These findings demonstrate a difference in the cleavage and loss of the 196-kDa MEKK1 enzyme during the apoptotic response of two cell types to DNA damage or microtubule poisoning. Although MEKK1 is not significantly proteolyzed in response to taxol or vinblastine, other known caspase substrates were cleaved in response to these drugs. PARP is a well characterized caspase substrate that is cleaved early in the apoptotic response (24Gu Y. Sarnecki C. Aldape R.A. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18715-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Both the genotoxins (Ara-c and etoposide) and microtubule toxins (taxol and vinblastine) induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 2 A) corresponding to increased caspase activity and apoptosis (Fig. 2 B) in Jurkat cells. Similar results were found in HEK293 cells (data not shown). The findings indicated that, in contrast to PARP, the degradation of MEKK1 is differentially regulated by DNA damage versus microtubule poisoning. We have demonstrated that HEK293 cells that express a kinase-inactive mutant of MEKK1 have a significantly reduced apoptotic response to genotoxins such as etoposide (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Treatment of HEK293 cells expressing the kinase-inactive inhibitory mutant of MEKK1 with microtubule toxins gave an apoptotic response similar to control HEK293 cells, measured by acridine orange (Fig. 3 A) or propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, etoposide-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) in the HEK293 cells expressing kinase-inactive MEKK1 relative to control cells (Fig. 3). Morphological analysis substantiates the differences in apoptotic potential of cells expressing kinase-inactive MEKK1 (Fig.3 C). In control cells, transfected with vector alone, treatment with etoposide, taxol, or vinblastine caused membrane blebbing and cell rounding. In cells expressing the mutant kinase-inactive MEKK1 protein, the morphological changes induced by etoposide but not taxol or vinblastine were inhibited. This finding demonstrates that kinase-inactive MEKK1 inhibits morphological changes associated with apoptosis induced by etoposide but not taxol or vinblastine. The morphological findings are consistent with the biochemical results that MEKK1 cleavage does not significantly contribute to microtubule toxin-induced apoptosis. MEKK1 has been shown to regulate JNK activity in a variety of cell types (25Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 26Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Exposure of HEK293 cells to taxol-activated MEKK1 (Fig.4 A), as measured by MEKK1 autophosphorylation and MEKK1 catalyzed phosphorylation of recombinant SEK1 (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A.

Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Etoposide activates MEKK1 to an extent similar to that of taxol (Fig. 4 A). However, taxol treatment of HEK293 cells did not significantly activate JNK (Fig.4 B); etoposide in the same experiment activated JNK. Jurkat cells gave a similar result where etoposide and taxol activated MEKK1 (data not shown), but only etoposide significantly activated JNK (Fig.4 B). In human breast carcinoma epidermal T47D cells and mouse embryonic stem cells that we have similarly characterized, taxol activates the JNK pathway but to a significantly lower magnitude than other stress stimulants including DNA damaging drugs, irradiation, and microtubule-disrupting drugs such as nocodazole (data not shown). Thus, taxol stabilization of microtubules appears to significantly dissociate the activation of MEKK1 from the JNK pathway. An indicator of microtubule toxin treatment is the phosphorylation of Bcl2 (30Haldar S. Basu A. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 229-233PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kroning R. Lichtenstein A. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar, 33Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) because of either interference with microtubule structure or blockage of cells in the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle. In HEK293 cells, taxol and vinblastine but not etoposide stimulated the phosphorylation of Bcl2 as characterized by the shift in mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the phosphorylated Bcl2 species (Fig. 5 A). Expression of the mutant kinase-inactive MEKK1, which suppressed etoposide but not taxol-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3), had no effect on taxol or vinblastine-stimulated Bcl2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). In addition to Bcl2 phosphorylation, taxol also activates Cdc2 kinase activity that has been proposed to be involved in taxol-induced apoptosis (34Shen S.C. Huang T.S. Jee S.H. Kuo M.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the kinase-inactive MEKK1 failed to inhibit taxol-induced Cdc2 kinase activity as assessed by Cdc2 phosphorylation of histone (data not shown). Thus MEKK1 is not upstream of either Cdc2 kinase or Bcl2 phosphorylation. Stable overexpression of Bcl2 in HEK293 cells effectively inhibited apoptosis and caspase activation in response to taxol (Fig. 5,B and C). Bcl2 overexpression also inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis (not shown). Interestingly, Bcl2 overexpression also inhibited apoptosis induced by overexpression of full-length MEKK1 or the 91-kDa MEKK1 kinase fragment (Fig.5 D). The increased caspase activity observed with MEKK1 expression was also inhibited by Bcl2 overexpression (Fig.5 E). The findings demonstrate that Bcl2 inhibits MEKK1-dependent and independent apoptosis in HEK293 cells. Surprisingly, in Bcl2 overexpressing HEK293 cells, exposure to etoposide induced the cleavage and loss of endogenous MEKK1. In contrast, the cleavage of Cbl or PARP, both caspase substrates, was inhibited by Bcl2 overexpression (21Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Gu Y. Sarnecki C. Aldape R.A. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18715-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). The cleavage of MEKK1 was dependent on caspases in control and Bcl2 overexpressing cells because p35, the baculovirus inhibitor of caspases (35Gong M. Guarino L.A. Virology. 1994; 204: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), blocked MEKK1 cleavage. These finding suggest that Bcl2 blocks MEKK1-induced apoptosis and that Bcl2 functions downstream of MEKK1 in the pathway leading to MEKK1-dependent apoptosis. Because of their different mechanisms of action, genotoxins and microtubule-interfering toxins are used in combination therapies for the treatment of several different cancers (1Reed J.C. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1998; 4 Suppl. 1: S8-S14PubMed Google Scholar, 9Staunton M.J. Gaffney E.F. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1998; 122: 310-319PubMed Google Scholar, 11Correa P. Miller M.J. Br. Med. Bull. 1998; 54: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both genotoxins and microtubule toxins generally induce death of cells by apoptosis (8Lokich J. Anderson N. Moore C. Bern M. Coco F. Sonneborn H. Dow E. Strong D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 664-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Based on the markedly different mechanisms of action, the pro-apoptotic pathways regulated by genotoxins and microtubule toxins to initiate apoptosis are predicted to be different. Our findings demonstrate that both types of chemotherapeutic drugs (22Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) activate MEKK1. Strikingly, only genotoxins like etoposide, and not the microtubule toxins taxol or vinblastine, significantly induce the cleavage of MEKK1 even though treatment of cells with each drug activates the kinase activity of 196-kDa MEKK1 (data not shown). Thus, genotoxins and microtubule drugs selectively and differentially regulate the cleavage of specific caspase substrates. These results define the differential regulation of caspase-dependent cleavage of proteins during the apoptotic response to clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs. A likely explanation for this observation is that either MEKK1 or the caspase that cleaves MEKK1 is differentially localized in the cell with etoposide versustaxol treatment. The caspase that cleaves MEKK1 in response to etoposide treatment is unable to cleave MEKK1 in taxol-treated cells even though other proteins including Cbl and PARP are cleaved. Several reports suggest that taxol-induced apoptosis is because of JNK activation. In OVCA 420 cells, expression of MEKK1 kinase inactive mutant effectively blocked JNK activity and blocked taxol-induced apoptosis (36Lee L.-F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 37Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4928-4936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 38Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, both Jurkat and HEK293 cells activate MEKK1 activity following taxol treatment but failed to activate JNK. In addition, expression of the kinase inactive MEKK1 in HEK293 cells failed to block taxol-induced apoptosis. Murine embryonic stem cells activate JNK following treatment with the microtubule toxin nocodazole. This response is absent in embryonic stem cells lacking MEKK1; however, the cells still undergo apoptosis (38Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus JNK activation in response to taxol is not required to induce apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl2 did not block the caspase-dependent cleavage of MEKK1. In contrast, cleavage of Cbl and PARP was inhibited. Western blotting of caspase-3 in Bcl2 overexpressing cells indicates that caspase 3 is activated determined by the loss of the inactive procaspase form of caspase 3 following etoposide treatment. Caspase-9 activation, however, was blocked by overexpression of Bcl2. 2S. Gibson, C. Widmann, and G. L. Johnson, unpublished observation. Taken together, the data show that cleavage of MEKK1 possibly by caspase 3 in the presence of Bcl2 overexpression does not induce apoptosis. Thus, the ability of Bcl2 overexpression to block MEKK1-induced apoptosis, and amplification of caspase activity implies that caspases activated in response to MEKK1 activation and subsequent cleavage are functionally downstream of Bcl2. Our results show that altered regulation of Bcl2, Cdc2 kinase activity, or related regulatory proteins in response to microtubule toxins effectively bypasses the role of MEKK1 in amplifying caspase activation. The different apoptotic signaling pathways for etoposide and taxol probably contribute to their greater effectiveness in chemotherapy in combination than either alone. The importance of these findings is that we have identified for the first time the differential involvement of a pro-apoptotic kinase, activated 91-kDa MEKK1, in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Thus, we have defined a kinase whose regulation influences the action of specific classes of chemotherapeutic drugs. This implies that it will be possible to define pro- and anti-apoptotic components of the cell death pathway, such as MEKK1, that selectively regulate the apoptotic potential of specific drugs. In the future, it may be possible to alter the activity of such kinases to enhance the apoptotic potential of tumor cells. Such advances in apoptotic signal transduction therapy will allow chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy to have significantly greater efficacy in ablating human tumors."

The two flanking genes were acbA(dTDP-d-glucose synthase) and acbC, encoding a protein with significant similarity to 3-dehydroquinate synthases (AroB proteins). The acbC gene was overexpressed heterologously in Streptomyces lividans 66, and the product was shown to be a C7-cyclitol synthase using sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate, but not ido-heptulose 7-phosphate, as its substrate. The cyclization product, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone ((2S,3S,4S,5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanon-2,3,4,5-tetrol), is a precursor of the valienamine moiety of acarbose. A possible five-step reaction mechanism is proposed for the cyclization reaction catalyzed by AcbC based on the recent analysis of the three-dimensional structure of a eukaryotic 3-dehydroquinate synthase domain (Carpenter, E. P., Hawkins, A. R., Frost, J. W., and Brown, K. A. (1998) Nature 394, 299–302).

The α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose (part of the amylostatin complex) (Fig. 1), produced by strains of the genera Actinoplanes and Streptomyces, is a member of an unusual group of bacterial (mainly actinomycete) secondary metabolites, all of which inhibit various α-glucosidases, especially in the intestine (1Truscheit E.

Acarbose is produced industrially using developed strains of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110. It is used in the treatment of diabetes patients, enabling them to better utilize starch- or sucrose-containing diets by slowing down the intestinal release of α-d-glucose. The acarbose-like natural products contain, as a unifying structural feature, a pseudodisaccharide based on the C7-cyclitol valienamine bound via an imino bridge to a hexose derivative, which in acarbose is 4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose (cf. Fig. 1). Biosynthetically, these compounds resemble aminoglycoside antibiotics (3Piepersberg W. Distler J. Rehm H.-J. Reed G. Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. 2nd Ed.

Also, the C7-aminocyclitol units are considered to be similar to other C7N units, a common structural motif more frequently observed in bacterial secondary metabolites (5Floss H.G. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 433-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). From the labeling patterns of variously 13C-labeled d-glucoses, fed to cultures of validamycin-producing Streptomyces sp. or to acarbose-producing Actinoplanes sp., it was suggested that the valienamine moiety is derived from a C7-sugar precursor formed in reactions of the pentose phosphate cycle (6Toyokuni T. Jin W.-Z. Rinehart Jr., K.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3481-3483Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar,7Degwert U. van Hülst R. Pape H. Herrold R.E. Beale J.M. Keller P.J. Lee J.P. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The genetics and biochemistry of acarbose biosynthesis have not yet been studied in the producing strains. Only speculations are available on the possible enzymatic mechanism(s) by which the C7-cyclitol unit could be formed. However, the 6-deoxyhexoses are frequent building units or side chains in many actinomycete secondary metabolites and are mostly synthesized via a dTDP-hexose pathway (3Piepersberg W. Distler J.

Piepersberg W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 90: 185-190Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the highly conserved gene sequences of the dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase to probe for related genes in the acarbose producerActinoplanes sp. 50/110. In this way, a gene cluster was isolated that contains several genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of this natural product. Besides genes for dTDP-6-deoxyhexose formation, such as acbA(dTDP-d-glucose synthase) and acbB (encoding dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase), a third gene,acbC, was found that encodes an AroB-like protein (dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) 1The abbreviations used are: DHQS, dehydroquinate synthase; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate.). The acbCgene was expressed heterologously in Streptomyces lividans, and employing the same reaction conditions as used in in vitro studies on DHQS proteins, its product was shown to be a C7-cyclitol synthase using sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate, but not ido-heptulose 7-phosphate, as a substrate.

Open table in a new tab Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Gibco (Eggenstein, Germany) and used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA manipulations of E. coli were done as described by Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); transformations ofE. coli were carried out by the method of Hanahan (10Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8190) Google Scholar). The size fractionation of restriction endonuclease-cleaved chromosomal DNA was done on 12-ml 20% sucrose gradients by centrifugation at 74,200 × g for 15 h at 20 °C. Fractions containing DNA fragments of the expected size were pooled and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Protoplast preparation and plasmid transformation techniques for S. lividans were performed according to published procedures (9Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M.

J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2802-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Southern hybridization, the genomic DNA was immobilized on a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). Hybridization was performed at 65–68 °C overnight using nick-translated [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-labeled DNA fragments as shown in Fig. 2. Stringency washes were done with 2 to 0.1× SSC at 65 °C. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer-Sciex API-3 or a Kratos Profile mass spectrometer, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph with a 5971A mass selective detector. Proton NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AF 300 NMR spectrometer with a MacNMR 5.5 PCI as the instrument controller and data processor, and 13C NMR spectra on a Bruker AC 400 NMR spectrometer. An ISF-4-V culture shaker (Adolf Kuhner AG, Birsfelden, Switzerland) was used for the fermentation of the acarbose producer. Radioactive samples were counted in Bio-Safe II biodegradable scintillation mixture (Research Products International Corp.) in a Beckman LS 1801 scintillation counter. Two different strategies were used to identify the acarbose biosynthesis gene cluster in the genome ofActinoplanes sp. 1) The strD and strEgenes from Streptomyces griseus (8Stockmann M. Piepersberg W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 90: 185-190Crossref Google Scholar), encoding dTDP-d-glucose synthase and dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, respectively, were used as heterologous probes to identify the equivalent gene(s) in the genomic DNA ofActinoplanes sp. by means of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. For this purpose, a 0.70-kbEcoRI/BglII fragment, containing most of thestrD gene (16Distler J. Ebert A. Mansouri K. Pissowotzki K. Stockmann M. Piepersberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8041-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and a 0.76-kb KpnI fragment, containing most of the strE gene (17Pissowotzki K. Mansouri K. Piepersberg W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), radioactively labeled as above, were used. 2) Part of the putative dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, belonging to the acarbose biosynthesis gene cluster in the genome of Actinoplanes sp., was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as template and primers AS2 (5′-GCCGCCGA(A/G)TCCCATGT(G/C)GAC-3′) and AS5 (5′-CCCGTAGTTGTTGGAGCAGCGGGT-3′). Amplification was performed in a Biometra Personal Cycler using 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco). The reaction mixtures (100-μl volume) contained 200 ng of chromosomal DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mmdNTPs (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), incubation buffer, and 5% dimethylformamide. The following conditions were used for the reaction. The enzyme was added after an initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 25 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) and 72 °C for 5 min (ramping rate of 1 °C/s). The PCR product was cloned into pUC18HincII, resulting in pAS1. The amplified 300-base pair DNA fragment was used as a homologous radioactive probe to identify the corresponding gene in the genome of Actinoplanes sp. by means of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Various overlapping restriction fragments from the 10.7-kb SstI and 12.4-kb BglII DNA fragment inserts in pAS5 and pAS6, respectively, were subcloned into pUC18 and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using an AutoRead sequencing kit and an A.L.F DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). The entire sequences of both strands were determined from double-stranded plasmid DNAs prepared by the alkaline lysis method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A double-stranded nested deletion kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to construct unidirectional deletions in DNA fragments in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA sequences were analyzed using DNA-Strider 1.2 (19Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) and BrujeneII sequence analysis software. Homology searches were performed against the EBI, GenBankTM, and SWISSPROT data libraries using BLAST (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zheng Zhang J.Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and FASTA 1.4x2 (21Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar) software. The putative C7-cyclitol synthase gene (acbC) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as template and primers AS-C1 (5′-AGGGAAGCTCATATGAGTGGTGTCGAG-3′) and AS-C2 (5′-GGTATCGCGCCAAGAATTCCTGGTGGACTG-3′). Primer AS-C1 was designed for the introduction of an NdeI site in place of the natural start codon and for the ability to create a start codon fusion ofacbC into the promoter/ribosome-binding site cassette of expression vector pIJ6021. Primer AS-C2 was designed for the introduction of an EcoRI site 117 base pairs downstream of the acbC stop codon for the ligation of the acbCDNA fragment into pIJ6021 NdeI/EcoRI. PCR was performed as described above, and the following conditions were used for the reaction: an initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C and then 25 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s) and 72 °C for 5 min (ramping rate of 1 °C/s). The PCR product was cloned into pUC18 HincII, resulting in pAS8/5.1. The insert was reisolated from this plasmid by digestion with NdeI/EcoRI and ligated into pIJ6021 NdeI/EcoRI. The resulting derivative (pAS8/7) was transformed into S. lividans 1326. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in ice-cold buffer A (20 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm NAD+, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), and suspended in 2 ml of the same buffer. AcbC production was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Protein-containing extracts were lysed by boiling in sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 11% polyacrylamide. Cells of S. lividans 1326/pAS8/7 were disrupted by sonication in buffer A, and the resulting cell-free extract was clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The extract was dialyzed against 2.5 liters of buffer A for 12 h at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the extract was determined using a protein microassay kit (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. The AcbC extract could be stored for 3 months at −20 °C without major loss of activity. Heat inactivation was carried out at 95 °C for 5 min. The enzyme activity was measured by a nonradioactive TLC assay. The enzyme assay (100-μl volume) was performed at 30 °C for 2 h in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 μg of protein (AcbC extract), 8 mm sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate orido-heptulose 7-phosphate, 0.04 mmCoCl2, and 2 mm NaF. After incubation, 25-μl samples were chromatographed on silica thin-layer sheets (butanol/ethanol/water, 9:7:4), and the substrate and AcbC reaction product were detected as blue spots with a cer-and molybdate-containing reagent (24Drepper A. Pietzmann R. Pape H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The preparative formation of the AcbC-generated product was carried out according to one of two alternative methods. (i) The conversion of 35 mg of sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate (corresponding to 21 mm in the assay) catalyzed by AcbC was carried out in a total volume of 5 ml containing 15 mg of protein (AcbC-containing extract of S. lividans 1326/pAS8/7). The conditions for the assay were as described above. For removal of proteins, the 5-ml extract of the preparative AcbC assay was applied first to Centricon 50 tubes (Amicon, Witten, Germany), followed by a second ultrafiltration through Centricon 10 tubes in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of the filtrate (3.6 ml) was applied to an anion-exchange column (12.5 × 2.5-cm bed size, Dowex 1-X8, 200–400 mesh, Cl− form; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The remaining 1.4 ml of filtrate was stored at −20 °C for further examinations. The column was washed with 75 ml H2O, and the flow-through fraction was collected in 3.5-ml fractions. The AcbC reaction product was detected by the TLC assay described above, and the corresponding fractions were pooled and concentrated by freeze-drying. For the ESI-MS analysis, a sample was further purified by isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography on a Lichrospher RP-select B column with H2O/acetonitrile (98.5:1.5) containing 25 mm ammonium acetate. (ii) Incubation ofsedo-heptulose 7-phosphate with the cell-free extract was conducted with 5 mm substrate, 2 mm NaF, 0.05 mm CoCl2, 1 mm NAD+, and 50 μl of cell-free extract, in a final incubation volume of 100 μl of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and then lyophilized to dryness. To the residue was added 300 μl of MeOH, and the mixture was agitated in a Vortex mixer and allowed to stand for 30 min before centrifugation to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography (50 ml, elution with MeOH) to give the cyclization product (99%). The product of the AcbC reaction had the same R F value (R F = 0.53) in the above TLC system as an authentic sample of 2-epi-5-epi-[6-2H2]valiolone ((2S,3S,4S,5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-[6- 2S. Lee, T.

Trimethylsilyl derivative: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,T ret = 11.01 min (same as trimethylsilyl-2-epi-5-epi-valiolone; different from trimethylsilyl-2-epi-valiolone (T ret = 11.06 min)); fragment ions:m/z 276 and 480 (M + 3 trimethylsilyl) (2-epi-5-epi-[6-2H2]valiolone,m/z 278 and 482). d-sedo-[1-13C]Heptulose 7-phosphate (82.5% 13C) was prepared froml-[3-13C]serine (containing a trace ofl-[3-14C]serine to guide the isolation of products) and d-ribose 5-phosphate as described (41Lee S.-S. Kirschning A. Müller M. Way C. Floss H.G. J. Mol. Catal. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). This material (21.25 mg) was incubated with S. lividans1326/pAS8/7 extract in five 1-ml reaction mixtures to give, after Sephadex LH-20 purification, 12 mg of 2-epi-5-epi-[7-13C]valiolone characterized by 1H NMR and showing the expected strongly enhanced 13C NMR signal for C-7. A 10-mg sample of this was fed to two 60-ml resting cell cultures of Actinoplanes sp. strain SN223/29, and acarbose (6 mg) was isolated and purified following previously described procedures (25Lee S. Sauerbrei B. Niggemann J. Egelkrout E. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 13C NMR and ESI-MS analysis of the resulting acarbose showed 2% incorporation of the labeled precursor with 13C enrichment specifically at C-7. d-sedo-[7-14C,7-3H]Heptulose 7-phosphate was prepared from d-[6-14C]- andd-[6-3H]glucose as described (41Lee S.-S. Kirschning A. Müller M. Way C. Floss H.G. J. Mol. Catal. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). A sample of this material (75 nCi, 3H/14C = 5.5) was incubated with S. lividans 1326/pAS8/7 cell-free extract under the assay conditions described above. Purification of the resulting 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone by preparative TLC as described above gave a product of3H/14C = 3.7. To isolate the putative biosynthetic gene cluster for acarbose from the genomic DNA of Actinoplanes sp. 50/110, we chose the widely used strategy to screen the DNA for 6-deoxyhexose-specific genes, which has been described earlier (8Stockmann M. Piepersberg W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 90: 185-190Crossref Google Scholar). For this purpose, restriction digests of the genomic DNA ofActinoplanes sp. were hybridized with DNA probes taken from the strD and strE genes of S. griseus. The strE probe hybridized weakly but specifically with only one band in all cases, e.g. ∼2.2-kb BamHI, 13-kb BglII, and 11-kb SstI fragments (data not shown). The strD probe did not give a signal at all. Therefore, first a PCR approach was used to clone an ∼300-base pair segment of the gene homologous to strE (pAS1; see “Materials and Methods”). This fragment was used to hybridize against genomic DNA of Actinoplanes sp. variously restricted with single endonucleases and combinations thereof. The result was that hybridization was found only in a single genomic region that was identical to that detected with the strE probe (data not shown). The 300-base pair insert of pAS1 was also used as a specific probe to screen size-fractionated genomic DNA libraries of 2–3-kbBamHI, 10–12-kb SstI, and 12–15-kbBglII fragments, cloned in vectors pUC18 or pBluescript II KS(−), for hybridizing plasmids. In each library, hybridizing plasmids were found that contained overlapping genomic DNA segments; they are called pAS2, pAS5, and pAS6 (Fig. 2;cf. Table I). Sequence analysis of the 2.2-kb BamHI DNA fragment inserted into pAS2 revealed the presence of the full-length reading frame of a dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase-encoding gene, calledacbB, and two incomplete additional reading frames, each oriented in opposite direction relative to acbB, which were named acbA and acbC (cf. Fig. 2). The sequences of the acbA and acbC genes were completed by subcloning and sequencing overlapping segments from pAS5 and pAS6 and were found to encode a member of the family of dTDP-d-glucose synthases and a protein related to the AroB family of proteins (3-dehydroquinate synthases) of bacteria, respectively. Protein sequence comparisons revealed that the AcbA protein is more related to the RfbA proteins of enterobacteria (57.8% identity in a 218-amino acid overlap to E. coli RfbA) than to the StrD protein of S. griseus (37.0% identity in a 208-amino acid overlap). In contrast, the neighboring acbB gene encodes a protein clearly more related to the streptomycete homolog StrE (57.9% identity in a 318-amino acid overlap) than to the enterobacterial counterpart RfbB (37.0% identity in a 343-amino acid overlap toE. coli RfbB). This explains why the strD gene did not give a hybridization signal. The deduced sequence of the AcbC protein is only distantly similar to the AroB proteins, which among themselves are more strongly conserved (Fig.3). AcbC shows the highest degree of similarity to the AroB protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis(26.8% identity in a 340-amino acid overlap), which in turn shows significantly higher similarity to the AroB proteins of other bacteria,e.g. E. coli (40.6% identity in a 345-amino acid overlap), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (50.1% identity in a 353-amino acid overlap), and Bacillus subtilis(36.7% identity in a 341-amino acid overlap). However, the eukaryotic DHQS proteins are more distant, e.g. the DHQS domain of the multifunctional AROM protein of Emericella (formerlyAspergillus) nidulans shows only 26.8% identity (in a 340-amino acid overlap) to AroB of M. tuberculosis and a very similar sequence divergence (26.7% identity in a 315-amino acid overlap) to AcbC. However, the DHQS proteins all have strictly conserved amino acid residues in those positions shown to be involved in catalysis and substrate binding, whereas this is the case only for part of those in AcbC (Ref. 26Carpenter E.P. Hawkins A.R. Frost J.W. Brown K.A. Nature. 1998; 394: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar; cf. Fig. 3). This suggested that AcbC and AroB do not have identical functions, but that they catalyze similar reactions. The possible involvement of AcbC in the cyclization of the precursor of the C7-cyclitol moiety of acarbose led us to test the hypothesis that this could be formed from a C7-keto sugar phosphate, such as sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate (6Toyokuni T. Jin W.-Z. Rinehart Jr., K.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3481-3483Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Degwert U. van Hülst R. Pape H. Herrold R.E. Beale J.M. Keller P.J. Lee J.P. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, when the conversion of sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate was tested in crude extracts of Actinoplanes sp., using reaction conditions suitable for the AroB-catalyzed reaction, no formation of cyclitols could be detected. We then expressed the AcbC protein heterologously in both E. coli and S. lividans 1326. Overexpression in E. coli under control of the T7 promoter was achieved only in the form of insoluble proteins (data not shown). However, induction of expression by thiostrepton inS. lividans 1326/pAS8/7 under control of thetipAp promoter yielded large quantities of soluble protein (Fig. 4). When the crude extracts from induced cells of S. lividans 1326/pAS8/7 were incubated withsedo-heptulose 7-phosphate in the test system developed for the AroB-catalyzed reaction, a rapid conversion of the substrate occurred. sedo-Heptulose 7-phosphate was converted to a substance migrating much faster in the analytical TLC system employed, indicating loss of the phosphate group (data not shown). Co-chromatography with sedo-heptulose, valiolone, and valienone revealed that none of these comigrated with the reaction product. The diastereomeric substrate ido-heptulose 7-phosphate (41Lee S.-S. Kirschning A. Müller M. Way C. Floss H.G. J. Mol. Catal. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar) was not converted under the same conditions. Also, induced extracts from S. lividans 1326/pIJ6021 (control) or heat-inactivated extract (5 min at 95 °C) from S. lividans 1326/pAS8/7 did not cyclize sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate, thereby proving the specificity of the AcbC protein for catalyzing the observed reaction. The initial preparative synthesis and partial purification of the AcbC product yielded a substance, the first NMR and mass spectrometry analyses of which were consistent"

New substituted cyclopropane probes were used with very fast ring-opening rate constants and other desirable attributes, such as the ability to discriminate between radical and cationic intermediates. Oxidation of these substrates by a reconstituted sMMO system resulted in no rearranged products, allowing an upper limit of 150 fs to be placed on the lifetime of a putative radical species. This limit strongly suggests that there is no such substrate radical intermediate. The two enantiomers of trans-1-methyl-2-phenyl-cyclopropane were prepared, and the regioselectivity of their oxidation to the corresponding cyclopropylmethanol and cyclopropylphenol products was determined. The results are consistent with selective orientation of the two enantiomeric substrates in the hydrophobic cavity at the active site of sMMO, specific models for which were examined by molecular modeling.

This property has allowed the use of radical clock substrate probes to derive mechanistic information about the hydroxylation step in the enzyme mechanism. Radical clocks were first described in 1980 (16Griller D. Ingold K.U. Acc. Chem. Res. 1980; 13: 317-323Crossref Scopus (907) Google Scholar) and calibrated (17Newcomb M.

Specifically, these substrates can reveal whether radical intermediates are formed during a reaction and, if so, can establish their lifetime and the rate constant for radical rebound. Fig. 1 depicts the oxidation of a radical clock substrate probe, which uses the ring opening of a cyclopropylcarbinyl radical. If hydrogen atom abstraction from the probe occurs, the resulting radical can either rebound to form the unrearranged alcohol or undergo ring opening before rebound to afford the rearranged alcohol. If the ring opening rate is known (17Newcomb M. Tetrahedron. 1993; 49: 1151-1176Crossref Scopus (607) Google Scholar), the rebound rate, k oxidation, can be calculated according to Equation 2. koxidation=kring opening(unrearranged alcohol/rearranged alcohol)Equation 2 The hypothesis that substrate radical intermediates form in the sMMO system has been tested by a variety of techniques. Nitroxyl spin traps detected radical species produced during the oxidation of methane, methanol, and acetonitrile (22Deighton N. Podmore I.D. Symons M.C.R. Wilkins P.C. Dalton H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1991; 91: 1086-1088Crossref Google Scholar). The respective⋅CH3, ⋅CH2OH, and⋅CH2CN radicals apparently were able to diffuse out of the protein and react with the spin traps. The products were not quantitated, however, so it is difficult to gauge the importance of these species in the bulk mechanism. Early radical clock results employing sMMO from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b suggested both radical and cationic intermediates (23Ruzicka F. Huang D.-S. Donnelly M.I. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Later radical clock studies revealed no radical rearrangement for the M. capsulatus (Bath) system and very little for the enzyme fromM. trichosporium OB3b (19Choi S.-Y. Eaton P.E. Hollenberg P.F.

Hydroxylations of chiral tritiated alkanes proceeded with ∼30% inversion of stereochemistry, an amount corresponding to putative radical lifetimes (<100 fs) too short to be attributed to formation of a discrete radical intermediate (25Priestley N.D.

The possibility exists that substrate-dependent reactivity might invalidate the conclusions of research based on diagnostic substrate probes. In recent work, 3Valentine, A. M., Stahl, S. S., and Lippard, S. J. (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc., in press. we obtained evidence that an intermediate other than Q, the active high valent diiron species that effects methane hydroxylation (1Liu K.E.

Dalton Trans. 1997; 21: 3925-3931Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is competent to oxidize olefins. These results demonstrated that substrate can indeed influence the reaction pathway. Conversely, it is also possible that the protein, through steric constraints or other interactions, might alter the reactivity of the probe from that observed free in solution. If ring opening were impeded, the clocks would “run slow” in the enzyme active site. These concerns (24Liu K.E. Johnson C.C. Newcomb M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 939-947Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have been addressed by using probes that do not dramatically change shape on rearrangement. The best examples of such behavior are the round trip probes (19Choi S.-Y. Eaton P.E. Hollenberg P.F. Liu K.E. Lippard S.J. Newcomb M. Putt D.A. Upadhyaya S.P. Xiong Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6547-6555Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A radical formed by H atom abstraction from the methyl group of methylcubane, for example, ends up on the same carbon atom, so there is no need for substrate translocation in the active site before rebound. The oxidation of methylcubane by sMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) yielded no rearranged products (19Choi S.-Y. Eaton P.E. Hollenberg P.F. Liu K.E. Lippard S.J. Newcomb M. Putt D.A. Upadhyaya S.P. Xiong Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6547-6555Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The results of the radical clock substrate probe studies have thus far been in agreement with those using chiral tritiated alkanes (25Priestley N.D. Floss H.G. Froland W.A. Lipscomb J.D.

Nevertheless, we were interested in trying recently developed hypersensitive radical clock substrate probes (TableI), which have ring opening rates in excess of 1011/s. Such values allow detection of rebound reactions occurring with rate constants up to 1013/s, assuming a detection limit of 1% of ring-opened versustotal product. This rate constant is at the limit for a barrier-less decomposition of a transition state (26Valentine A.M. Wilkinson B. Liu K.E. Komar-Panicucci S. Priestley N.D. Williams P.G. Morimoto H. Floss H.G. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1818-1827Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Probe1 (24Liu K.E. Johnson C.C. Newcomb M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 939-947Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) can be prepared in pure (R,R) and (S,S) form. Probe2 is constrained to require minimal conformational change upon ring opening (28Martin-Esker A.A. Johnson C.C. Horner J.H. Newcomb M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 9174-9181Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Probes3 and4 are substituted at the para position on the phenyl ring, eliminating the presence of “uninformative” phenol products (species 1b). These substitutions also increase the ring-opening rate constant. Probe 5 discriminates between radical and carbocationic intermediates (Fig.2 and Ref. 18Newcomb M. Le Tadic-Biadatti M.-H.

Rate constants for rearrangements of the putative radical intermediates were reported for the cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals derived from probes1(36Newcomb M. Johnson C.C. Manek M.B. Varick T.R. J. Am.

Open table in a new tab Typically, 15 nmol of MMOH, 15 nmol of MMOB, and 5.25 nmol of MMOR were combined in a 20-ml glass scintillation vial. Probes 1–4 were added as undiluted liquids, usually as 1-μl aliquots. Probe 5 was added as 2 ml of a saturated solution in 25 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7). The solution was incubated for 2 min at 45 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of 0.1 m ethanol-free NADH was added to initiate the reaction and to bring the total volume to 5 ml, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 45 °C for 15 min with gentle agitation. The mixture was extracted with methylene chloride (5 × 4 ml), and the solution was spun in an analytical centrifuge for 10 min after each extraction. The combined extracts (20 ml) were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated to ∼100 μl by using a rotary evaporator. A 10-μl aliquot of a 10 mm solution of an internal standard, methyl benzoate or ethyl benzoate, was added. The products were analyzed by parallel gas chromatography and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry methods on 50 m HP-1 methyl silicone columns. A Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 5971A mass spectrometer was used. Standard curves were generated by analyzing a range of concentrations of each substrate and product referenced to the same internal standard added to the reaction mixture. To determine whether products were consumed during the reaction or lost during workup, reaction solutions were spiked with small known amounts of these species, and the resulting product mixtures were analyzed for their presence. No such loss or consumption was observed. To test for possible enzyme inhibition by probe 5, the reconstituted protein system was incubated with NADH and this probe for 5 min before addition of a second substrate. In some cases, probe5 was removed by transferring the solution after preincubation to Centriplus 100 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon) and repeatedly concentrating and diluting it with 25 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7). MMOB, MMOR, NADH, and free probe 5 were removed by this procedure. The concentration of the resulting hydroxylase solution was determined and the absence of NADH was established by UV/visible spectroscopy. Removal of the other proteins was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The system was reconstituted with MMOB and MMOR, substrate, and NADH, and oxidation of a second probe was attempted as described above for radical clock probe substrates or by standard methods when propylene or nitrobenzene was used (24Liu K.E. Johnson C.C. Newcomb M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 939-947Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The oxidation products derived from the radical clock substrate probes are shown in TableIII. Typically, <10% of the substrate was oxidized, and >85% of added material was recovered as products or unreacted probe. None of the products was consumed during the course of the reaction. In no case was a rearranged or ring-opened product detected. Less conversion was observed for probes 3 and4 than for the unfluorinated analog probe 1, probably because of their lower solubility. Only primary alcohol products were observed for these substrates.Table IIIProducts from oxidation of radical clock substrate probes by sMMOProbeRelative product yields3See Table I.Average conversion%11a:1b:1c6.41.1:1:022a:2b:2c:2d10.50.48:0.12:1:033a:3b3.81:044a:4b2.51:05a See Table I. Open table in a new tab In previous work reporting hydroxylation of racemic probe 1, there was a slight preference for forming the primary alcohol over the phenol (24Liu K.E. Johnson C.C. Newcomb M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 939-947Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this preference might reflect the conformation of the substrate molecule, such that one enantiomer might afford predominantly phenol and the other the primary alcohol. A comparison of the hydroxylation products of (S,S)- and (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-methylcyclopropane (TableIV) reveals that, when (R,R)-1 was used as substrate, the primary alcohol was formed preferentially. When the (S,S) enantiomer was used, the phenol was predominantly formed. This result supports the hypothesis that each enantiomer has a favored orientation within the hydrophobic cavity at the MMOH active site.Table IVProducts from oxidation of racemic trans-1-phenyl-2-methylcyclopropane and of each enantiomer Open table in a new tab To understand these stereochemical preferences, a model of the enzyme active site was generated by using the 1.7-Å resolution MMOH x-ray crystallographic coordinates (38Rosenzweig A.C. Lippard S.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 229-236Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers were docked into the active site, positioning either the methyl or phenyl group near the iron atoms and extending the remainder of the molecule into the adjacent hydrophobic cavity 1 (6Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nordlund P. Nature. 1993; 366: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). When the para-carbon atom of the phenyl ring for either substrate was positioned near the iron atoms, steric interactions were minimized by directing the methylcyclopropyl group out toward the neighboring hydrophobic cavity, cavity 2, in the vicinity of a mobile leucine residue, Leu-110 (Fig.3, A and B, and Ref. 39Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Attempts to position the phenyl ring near this leucine residue were unfavorable and did not orient the methyl group of the substrate near coordination sites on the diiron center previously identified as those most likely to generate activated oxygen species (40Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. ACS Symposium Series. 1998; 692: 334-347Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Instead, the phenyl group was more readily accommodated when positioned toward helices E and F, which help form the canyon walls (6Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nordlund P. Nature. 1993; 366: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) of MMOH. When the substrate was so oriented, the methyl group of the (R,R) enantiomer was positioned directly over the diiron center (Fig. 3 C), whereas the methyl group of the (S,S) enantiomer (Fig. 3 D) was directed away from it. If the substrate does indeed bind in these two alternative modes, this model explains the more favorable oxidation of the methyl compared with the phenyl substituent observed for the (R,R) probe. The internal packing differences for the (S,S) substrate are less disparate, however, and might reflect protein side chain movements induced by MMOB binding, not observed in the structure of oxidized MMOH alone. Attempts to oxidize probe 5 failed to yield any product alcohol, a result that suggested that this molecule might be a mechanism-based inhibitor. Probe 5 did inhibit the ability of the sMMO system to oxidize probe 1, the largest of the substrates used, and this inhibition could be reversed by removal of the probe. Propylene and nitrobenzene oxidation were not affected by the presence of probe 5, however. Thus, probe 5does not covalently modify the protein but may be difficult to dislodge from the series of hydrophobic cavities leading to the enzyme active site cavity, which define a proposed pathway for substrate access (6Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nordlund P. Nature. 1993; 366: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar,38Rosenzweig A.C. Lippard S.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 229-236Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. ACS Symposium Series. 1998; 692: 334-347Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Several such cavities have been identified in the MMOH structure, and the path taken by a given substrate may depend on its steric requirements. The fact that activity toward small substrates is unaffected suggests that probe 5 cannot access the enzyme active site, explaining the observed lack of activity for this probe. Probe 5 did not fit well when modeled into the enzyme active site (Fig. 4). Attempts to bring either the methyl or phenyl group near the iron center resulted in steric clashes between the t-butoxy group and protein side chains. The orientation shown, with the t-butoxy group pointing toward the iron center, was the most favorable but still would require significant protein side chain movements. Detection of any rearranged products would have provided evidence for the intermediacy of a substrate radical. In the absence of such products, Equation 2 can be used to calculate the lower limit on the rate constant such a process would require to occur without ring opening. Assuming a 10% detection limit for rearranged versus unrearranged product in the oxidation of probe 4, the fastest probe tested, the corresponding rebound rate would be >7 × 1012/s, and the lifetime of the putative radical would be at most 150 fs. These results are completely consistent with our findings for sMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) with radical clock substrate probes (24Liu K.E. Johnson C.C. Newcomb M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 939-947Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and chiral-tritiated alkanes (26Valentine A.M. Wilkinson B. Liu K.E. Komar-Panicucci S. Priestley N.D. Williams P.G. Morimoto H. Floss H.G. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1818-1827Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the apparent lifetimes appear to be slightly different for M. trichosporium (OB3b) sMMO, as revealed by the chiral ethane and butane oxidations (25Priestley N.D. Floss H.G.

Johnson C.C. Newcomb M. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 939-947Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). None of the values determined for either enzyme, however, is consistent with formation of a discrete substrate radical. Thus the present results strongly reinforce our previous conclusions that a radical rebound mechanism does not occur for sMMO and that a nonsynchronous, concerted process better explains the experimental data (18Newcomb M.

Many possible mechanisms for the catalytic cycle in MMOH have been compiled in review and opinion articles regarding sMMO (2Wallar B.J. Lipscomb J.D. Chem.

The oxidation step typically involves reaction of an electrophilic intermediate Q, postulated to be a bis(μ-oxo)diiron(IV) (46Shu L. Nesheim J.C. Kauffmann K. Münck E. Lipscomb J.D. Que Jr., L. Science. 1997; 275: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) or related species, with the hydrocarbon substrate. Some agreement has been reached that freely diffusing substrate radicals are not a hallmark of sMMO oxidation chemistry, although some workers still draw a discrete radical intermediate (R) (47Deeth R.J. Dalton H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 302-306Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48Lipscomb J.D. Que L.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 331-336Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). How best to explain the available mechanistic information remains a contested topic. Recently, a set of commentaries appeared that speculated on the hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism (49Nordlander E. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 300-301Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Some common questions that emerged are the following: What is the structure of Q? Is Q the active species? Is the oxygen transferred to substrate bridging the iron atoms (50Shteinman A.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 325-330Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or terminal (11Siegbahn P.E.M.

Chem. 1998; 3: 307-313Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar)? Some favor a ferryl species for Q as the active intermediate (47Deeth R.J. Dalton H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 302-306Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with concerted addition of the C–H bond across the Fe(IV)=O unit and some component of Fe–C bonding. Radical traps are claimed to be able to intercept the C–OH bond as it forms in the transition state. The presence of terminal Fe=O bonds in Q remains a viable possibility, although it is not supported by extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (46Shu L. Nesheim J.C. Kauffmann K. Münck E. Lipscomb J.D. Que Jr., L. Science. 1997; 275: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and modeling chemistry (35Lee D. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12153-12154Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Perhaps Q is in dynamic equilibrium with such a species, as we have previously suggested (3Valentine A.M. Lippard S.J. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1997; 21: 3925-3931Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The lack of quantitation in the radical trap experiments has already been noted. In recent work (52Collman J.P. Chien A.S. Eberspacher T.A. Brauman J.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 425-426Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), inhibition of cyclohexane oxidation by H2, D2, and CH4provided evidence for an agostic interaction of these molecules involving a porphyrin Fe(IV)=O unit. Both steady state 7A. M. Valentine and S. J. Lippard, unpublished results. and single turnover 8S. S. Stahl, and S. J. Lippard, unpublished results. sMMO oxidations are unaffected by the presence of H2, as would be expected if such an interaction were taking place. Other workers (50Shteinman A.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 325-330Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) prefer a “bridge mechanism,” or oxidation by a bis(μ-oxo)diiron(IV) active species. Such an intermediate structure has been combined with the above oxidation mechanism in an extended Hückel theoretical analysis of the oxidation of methane by a ferryl species (53Yoshizawa K. Shiota Y. Yamabe T. Organometallics. 1998; 17: 2825-2831Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When applied to sMMO (31Yoshizawa K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 318-324Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), drawn for the general substrate R–H in Fig. 5, upper pathway, methane undergoes a C3v distortion and coordinates to the iron atom of a bis(μ-oxo)diiron(IV) active species. The resulting five-coordinate carbon could undergo pseudorotation, which was one of the explanations offered to account for the chiral ethane results (26Valentine A.M. Wilkinson B. Liu K.E. Komar-Panicucci S. Priestley N.D. Williams P.G. Morimoto H. Floss H.G. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1818-1827Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This process would invert the chiral ethane molecule without forming a discrete radical. A hydrogen shift to the bridging oxygen atom followed by a methyl shift would yield the product complex (29Willems J.-P. Valentine A.M. Gurbiel R. Lippard S.J. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9410-9416Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Still other investigators bring to the debate a combination of computational and structural insights (11Siegbahn P.E.M. Crabtree R.H. Nordlund P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 314-317Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 51Siegbahn P.E.M. Crabtree R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3103-3113Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). According to density functional theory, the active intermediate is an Fe(III)–O–Fe(IV)–O⋅ species, which reacts by hydrogen atom abstraction to afford a caged radical. Rapid formation of an Fe(V)–C bond ensues. The very short lifetime limit determined in the radical clock and chiral ethane experiments would correspond to the period between hydrogen atom abstraction and iron–carbon bond formation. These translational motions could not take place in the <150-fs limit set by our current results, however. The authors postulate that the Fe–C bond could be very weak and that the alkyl could still be intercepted by spin traps, but again the time scales seem incommensurate. Still others (48Lipscomb J.D. Que L.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 331-336Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) support an oxo-bridged Q structure, which generates an intermediate having radical character, perhaps according to one of the mechanisms described above, but without forming discrete free radicals. The current proposals for the structure of the oxidizing intermediate thus fall into three classes: a bis(μ-oxo)diiron(IV), a diferryl, and a Fe(III)–O–Fe(IV)–O⋅ species. Iron–carbon bonds are usually invoked, either before or after C–H bond cleavage, despite the fact that there is so far no experimental evidence to support them. The reaction itself must proceed by some version of a nonsynchronous concerted pathway to allow partial inversion of chiral ethane without generating free substrate radicals. One such mechanism depicting oxidation by Q is given in the middle pathway of Fig. 5. This mechanism is similar to that proposed elsewhere, except that the active species drawn was a diferryl rather than a bridged structure (26Valentine A.M. Wilkinson B. Liu K.E. Komar-Panicucci S. Priestley N.D. Williams P.G. Morimoto H. Floss H.G. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1818-1827Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this model, reaction of substrate with the active species affords hydroxide and alkoxide, which are protonated to release the products. In Fig. 5, bottom, is a mechanism that invokes participation of the nearby cysteine sulfhydryl group. Its involvement has been proposed previously (42Feig A.L. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 759-805Crossref Scopus (978) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, hydrogen atom transfer from the cysteine to Q affords a mixed valent, hydroxo-bridged species. This species would have to be very short-lived, because no such compound has been detected in rapid freeze quench Mössbauer time course studies without substrate or with methane. In a concerted reaction, the cysteine radical and iron center would cleave the C–H bond in a nonsynchronous fashion, during which time some radical character in the substrate might develop without formation of a discrete substrate radical species. Alternatively, if either bridging (or terminal) oxygen atom were able to attack the substrate, hydroxylation would occur on one face or the other of the RCH3 molecule, accounting for the partial inversion of the chiral ethane probe. Results from oxidations of hypersensitive radical clock substrate probes continue to refute the notion that a discrete substrate radical species forms in sMMO oxidations. For probe 1, which can be prepared in enantiomerically pure form, the predominant oxidation product depends on the enantiomer used, providing evidence that the substrate assumes a preferred binding mode in the enzyme active site. Although probe 5 is not oxidized by sMMO, it inhibits oxidation of probe 1 but not propylene or nitrobenzene. This inhibition is reversed after removal of probe 5, suggesting that it sterically blocks access to the active site for the large substrate probe 1. Several recent mechanistic proposals incorporate aspects of a nonsynchronous, concerted mechanism and attempt to reconcile all the existing spectroscopic and mechanistic data regarding sMMO. Additional mechanistic, experimental, and theoretical work is clearly warranted."

(1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 2192–2198). In this study we isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding human PS-PLA1, which showed 80% homology with rat PS-PLA1 at the amino acid level. In addition to an mRNA encoding a 456-amino acid product (PS-PLA1), an mRNA with four extra bases inserted at the boundary of the exon–intron junction was detected in human tissues and various human cell lines. This mRNA is most probably produced via an alternative use of the 5′-splicing site (two consensus sequences for RNA splicing occur at the boundary of the exon–intron junction) and encodes a 376-amino acid product (PS-PLA1ΔC) that lacks two-thirds of the C-terminal domain of PS-PLA1. Unlike PS-PLA1, PS-PLA1ΔC hydrolyzed exclusively lyso-PS but not PS appreciably. Any other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidic acid (PA), and their lyso derivatives were not hydrolyzed at all. These data demonstrated that PS-PLA1ΔC exhibits lyso-PS-specific lysophospholipase activity and that the C-terminal domain of PS-PLA1 is responsible for recognizing diacylphospholipids. In addition, human PS-PLA 1 gene was mapped to chromosome 3q13.13–13.2 and was unexpectedly identical to the nmdgene, which is highly expressed in nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines but poorly expressed in metastatic cell lines (van Groningen, J. J., Bloemers, H. P., and Swart, G. W. (1995) Cancer Res. 55, 6237–6243). Phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PS-PLA1), which acts specifically on phosphatidylserine (PS) and 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) to hydrolyze fatty acids at the sn-1 position of these phospholipids, was first identified in rat platelets (Sato, T., Aoki, J., Nagai, Y., Dohmae, N., Takio, K., Doi, T., Arai, H., and Inoue, K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS is predominantly located on the inner leaflet of plasma membranes in various types of cells (8Bitbol M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6783-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) but appears on the outer leaflet after stimulation by various factors such as cytokines (9Ravanat C.

Gaffet P. Rendu F. Bienvenue A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2337-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Surface-exposed PS has also been shown to act as a signal for the removal of damaged or aged cells by the reticuloendothelial system and is observed in cells undergoing apoptosis (14Connor J. Pak C.C. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2399-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fadok V.A. Laszlo D.J. Noble P.W. Weinstein L. Riches D.W. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4274-4285PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the exposure of PS on the cell surface must be tightly regulated. Another serine-containing phospholipid, lyso-PS, is implicated to act as a lipid mediator under pathophysiological conditions (16Bruni A. Monastra G. Bellini F. Toffano G. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 282: 165-179PubMed Google Scholar). For example, lyso-PS is demonstrated to interact with local mast cells (17Bruni A. Bigon E. Battistella A. Boarato E. Mietto L. Toffano G. Agents Actions. 1984; 14: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), producing specific and stereoselective activation (18Horigome K. Tamori Y.N. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It also induces transient increases in cytosolic free Ca2+([Ca2+]i) in ovarian and breast cancer cells (19Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and lyso-PS; 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS with unsaturated fatty acids especially inhibits mitogen-induced T cell activation (20Bellini F. Bruni A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lyso-PS is present in human serum, the aqueous humor and the lachrymal gland fluid of the eye (21Liliom K. Guan Z. Tseng J.L. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G. Watsky M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1065-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely to be produced from PS by phospholipase A1 or A2, but the precise mechanisms of lyso-PS production and elimination in vivo remain to be clarified. We previously demonstrated that a serine phospholipid-specific phospholipase A1/lysophospholipase is secreted from rat platelets when they are activated (22Horigome K. Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Very recently we purified this enzyme from rat platelets and cloned its cDNA (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although this novel phospholipase, named PS-PLA1, has a similar structure to members of the lipase family such as hepatic, pancreatic, and lipoprotein lipases, PS-PLA1 does not hydrolyze triacylglycerol but specifically acts on PS or 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS to hydrolyze fatty acids at the sn-1 position of these phospholipids (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, PS-PLA1 mediates two types of reactions, producing 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS from PS and eliminating 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS. It is secreted from cells and has an affinity for heparin, like other members of the lipase family (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is likely that PS-PLA1 is involved in regulating PS/lyso-PS-dependent reactions under physiological conditions. Indeed, PS-PLA1 can hydrolyze PS in rat platelets when the cell is activated (23Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The physiological function of PS-PLA1, however, is still unknown and requires further investigation. As a part of our continuing study of the physiological role of PS-PLA1, we have isolated the cDNA for human PS-PLA1. In the course of the study, we detected an alternative splicing form of human PS-PLA1 and identified it as a lyso-PS-specific lysophospholipase. With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we amplified cDNA using a human liver λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as a template, and the following primers, based on the EST clone: 5′-CACGAGGATTTCCAGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGTACATGTTTCTATTG-3′. The resulting 1.7-kb PCR fragment was used as a DNA probe to screen the human liver λgt11 cDNA library as described previously (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One positive clone was identified, and its insert cDNA was subcloned into the pBluescript II SK phagemid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer) and an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Human and rat genomic DNAs (12 μg each) were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (50 units each) for 12 h then run on a 0.8% SeaKem Gold Agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The DNA was then transferred under capillary pressure to a Hybond-N nylon hybridization transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relevant DNA probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 4 h in a rapid-hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was rinsed in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) at room temperature for 5 min, then washed twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 40 min. The blot was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 12 h. Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Total RNA from human platelets (10 μg/lane) was separated by 1% agarose–formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Hybond-N. Hybridization with the human PS-PLA1 probe and washing were carried out as described for the Southern blot analysis. The blots were rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (CLONTECH) as an internal standard. Total RNA (1 μg) obtained from various human tissues and cell lines was used as a template in a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. A Ready-To-Go T-Primed First-Strand Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to synthesize the first-strand cDNA. DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using 3 μl of the first-strand reaction product as a template and the following set of primers: 5′-ACAAGGACACCAACATCGAGGTTACCTTCC-3′ (nucleotide positions 1055–1084 of the cDNA encoding human PS-PLA1) and 5′-CAGTCACACTTGCTTGTAAGTTCACTGG-3′ (nucleotide positions 1312–1339). The RT-PCR products (285 or 289 bp) were digested with BsrGI for 4 h at 60 °C then subjected to 4% NuSieve 3:1 Agarose (FMC BioProducts) gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments encoding the normal and truncated forms of human PS-PLA1 were amplified by PCR using two synthetic oligonucleotides. The 5′ oligonucleotide, 5′-CAGCGGATCCATGCCCCCAGGTCCCTGGGA-3′, contained theBamHI site in addition to the human PS-PLA1sequence, whereas the 3′ oligonucleotide, 5′-AAAAAAGCTTGCAGGGAGATGTGTCCTGCCCAGG-3′, contained the HindIII site and a complementary human PS-PLA1 sequence. The amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pFASTBAC1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate donor plasmids. Recombinant viruses were then prepared using the BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting recombinant baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 cells. Four days after infection, the culture supernatant of the infected cells was collected, and PS-PLA1 activity was determined as described below. Lysophospholipase activity of PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC was measured as described previously (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-oleoyl-2-lyso-PS, 1-oleoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine, 1-oleoyl-2-lysophosphatidic acid, and 1-oleoyl-2-lysophosphatidylethanolamine (40 μm each) containing a 14C-labeled fatty acid at the sn-1 position were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with aliquots of various fractions of heparin fast protein column chromatography in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 0.4 mmCaCl2. Dioleoyl-PS containing a 14C-labeled fatty acid at the sn-1 position was prepared as described previously (23Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PS (40 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with aliquots of various fractions of heparin fast protein column chromatography in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 4 mm CaCl2. The fatty acid liberated was extracted by the modified Dole's method, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counter. The culture supernatant of Sf9 cells or human plasma was loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin (1 ml) affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been preequilibrated with 100 mm NaCl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed thoroughly with this buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–1.1 m). The PS-PLA1 activity in each fraction was determined as described above. PCR was performed using human genomic DNA as a template and the primers 5′-GAGAAACAAGGACACCAACATCGAGGTTACC-3′ and 5′-CATTGTAGGGTGGCATGGGCTATGATTCC-3′, based on the sequence around the insertion. The DNA sequence of the resulting 3.5-kb fragment was determined by direct sequencing using the above oligonucleotides as sequence primers. We used the direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization method to determine the human chromosomal location of thePS-PLA 1 gene. We prepared R-banded chromosomes and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization as described previously (25Takahashi E. Hori T. O'Connell P. Leppert M. White R. Hum. Genet. 1990; 86: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte culture was synchronized by thymidine blockade, with 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporated during the late replication stage to allow differential replication staining after removing excessive thymidine. R-band staining was performed by exposing chromosome slides to UV light after staining with Hoechst 33258. The chromosome slides were hardened at 65 °C for 2 h, then denatured at 70 °C in 70% formamide in 2 × SSC and dehydrated in a 70, 85, 100% ethanol series at 4 °C. The 1.75-kb human cDNA fragment inserted into pBluescript II SK was used as a probe. The cDNA fragments were labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled DNA fragment was ethanol-precipitated with salmon sperm DNA and Escherichia coli tRNA, then denatured at 75 °C for 10 min in 100% formamide. The denatured probe was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization solution to produce a final concentration of 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Twenty μl of this mixture containing 250 ng of labeled DNA was placed onto the denatured slide, covered with Parafilm, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The slides were washed in 50% formamide in 2× SSC at 37 °C, then in 2× SSC, and finally in 1× SSC (for 20 min each time) at room temperature. After rinsing in 4× SSC, they were incubated under a coverslip with goat anti-biotin antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:500 in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4× SSC, then with 4× SSC (for 5 min each time). The slides were then stained with fluorescein-anti-goat IgG (Nordic Immunology) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with 4× SSC, then 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, and again with 4× SSC (for 10 min each time) on a shaker, the slides were rinsed with 2× SSC and stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide. Excitation at a wavelength of 450–490 nm (Nikon filter set B-2A) and near 365 nm (UV-2A) was then measured. Kodak Ektachrome ASA100 films were used for microphotography. Southern blot analysis showed the existence of a single gene copy in humans and rats (data not shown). We used the BLASTN program to search the protein data base for sequences similar to that of rat PS-PLA1 and found two human EST sequences with homology to rat PS-PLA1 on the GenBank™ DNA data base (GenBank™ accession numbers T96213 (5′ region) and T96131 (3′ region)). We prepared one set of PCR primers corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region and the 3′-untranslated region based on the DNA sequences of these EST clones. Because the EST clones were derived from a human fetal liver and spleen cDNA library, we performed PCR using human liver cDNA as a template. We then used the resulting 1.7-kb DNA fragment to screen a human liver cDNA library, and one positive clone was isolated. DNA sequence analysis revealed that this clone has a sequence highly homologous with that of rat PS-PLA1, covering the whole region corresponding to the open reading frame (Fig.1 a). This cDNA clone contained a 1368-bp open reading frame that encoded 456 amino acids, starting with an initiation codon (ATG) at nucleotide 32 (numbered as 1) and ending with a stop codon (TAG) at position 1369–1371. This open reading frame was flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of 31 and 359 bp, respectively, with a polyadenylation signal 19 bp before the poly(A)+ tail. Comparison of this open reading frame with rat PS-PLA1 revealed extensive homology at both the nucleotide (82.1%) and amino acid (80.0%) levels. Ser-142, Asp-166, and His-236, which may make up a catalytic triad in rat PS-PLA1 (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), are conserved between the rat and human enzymes. The amino acid sequences around these three amino acids were also highly conserved between the two species. A putative lid, which is composed of 22 or 23 amino acid residues in most of the other lipases and suggested to be involved in both substrate recognition and surface activation, is composed of 12 residues, as for the rat enzyme. When the coding region of PS-PLA1 mRNA from various human tissues and cell lines was amplified using RT-PCR and analyzed by DNA sequencing, an aberrant mRNA was frequently detected in addition to PS-PLA1 mRNA. These clones, designated PS-PLA1ΔC, had four additional bases (GTAC) inserted at nucleotide position 1122 of PS-PLA1, and the other nucleotide sequence of this clone was identical to that of PS-PLA1. As the insertion of these four bases caused a frameshift (Fig. 1 b), PS-PLA1ΔC loses about 80 amino acid residues that are present in C terminus of PS-PLA1, but the amino acids forming a catalytic triad including Ser-142, Asp-166, and His-236 are all preserved, suggesting that PS-PLA1ΔC is catalytically active (Fig.1 c). We analyzed the structure of the gene and nucleotide sequences around the insertion point, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The four extra bases, GTAC, inserted in the PS-PLA1ΔC cDNA were found at the beginning of the intron (Fig.2 a). Two separate consensus sequences for RNA splicing (gt(a/g)agt) (Fig. 2 b) can be found at this exon-intron boundary. It is likely from this information that mRNA for PS-PLA1 is produced when the first consensus site (gtacgt) is used, and mRNA for PS-PLA1ΔC is produced when the second (gtaagt) is used (Fig. 2 c). Thus, we concluded that PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC arise from alternative use of the 5′-splicing donor sites (GT). To determine whether the products encoded by the two mRNAs have PS- or lyso-PS-hydrolyzing activity, recombinant PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC were produced using a baculovirus system and examined for activities. As shown in Fig.3 a, we detected appreciable lyso-PS-hydrolyzing activity in the supernatant of Sf9 cells infected with either PS-PLA1 or PS-PLA1ΔC recombinant viruses. This shows that both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC are secreted from these cells and possess enzymatic activity to hydrolyze lyso-PS. By contrast, no PS-hydrolyzing activity was observed in the supernatant of cells infected with the PS-PLA1ΔC recombinant virus (Fig. 3 a). We also examined the substrate specificity using lyso-PS, 1-oleoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine, 1-oleoyl-2-lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and 1-oleoyl-2-lysophosphatidic acid. As shown in Fig. 3 b, both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC hydrolyzed lyso-PS, but neither produced appreciable hydrolysis of other lysophospholipids. Thus, PS-PLA1 hydrolyzes both PS and lyso-PS, but PS-PLA1ΔC exhibits lyso-PS-specific lysophospholipase activity. We have previously demonstrated that rat PS-PLA1 possesses a heparin binding site, because this enzyme absorbed to a heparin-Sepharose column (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We found that both human PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC were also absorbed to the column and eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl. The elution profile of PS-PLA1ΔC on heparin-Sepharose column chromatography was almost identical to that of PS-PLA1(Fig. 3 c), indicating that the heparin binding site of PS-PLA1 is located in N-terminal region of this enzyme. First we used Northern blot analysis to examine the expression of PS-PLA1 mRNA (PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC) using the cDNA corresponding to the coding region as a probe (Fig.4). Transcripts of 1.9-kb messages were seen in most of the tissues examined, with the highest expression in the liver and prostate gland. PS-PLA1 mRNAs were not detected in leukocytes or platelets (Fig. 4). Because PS-PLA1 was first identified in rat platelets, we analyzed the expression of PS-PLA1 in human platelets by RT-PCR analysis and an assay for PS-PLA1 activity. No appreciable PS-PLA1 activity or transcripts were detected in human platelets (data not shown). The PS-PLA1 transcript present in human tissues was detected as a single band on Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). To determine the relative amounts of PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC mRNAs in human tissues, RT-PCR analysis was performed using total RNAs derived from various human tissues. Because the insertion of the four extra bases generates a new restriction enzyme site, BsrGI (TGTACA) (Figs. 1 and 2), we quantified the frequency of the two mRNAs by digesting the RT-PCR products with BsrGI, as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 5, both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC transcripts were detected in various human tissues, including skeletal muscle, kidney, small intestine, spleen, and testis. The amount of PS-PLA1ΔC in these tissues was about 10 to 20% that of the PS-PLA1 level (Fig. 5). We also examined the expression of PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC in several human cell lines. mRNAs for both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC were detected in human fibroblast, keratinocyte, melanoma, HepG2, and HeLa cells. Thus, human tissues and cell lines express both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC, although the relative amount of PS-PLA1ΔC is lower than that of PS-PLA1. The location of thePS-PLA 1 gene on the human chromosome was assigned by direct R-banding fluorescence in situhybridization using a human cDNA fragment as a probe. ThePS-PLA 1 gene was localized to human chromosome 3q13.13–13.2 (Fig. 6). So far it has been reported that the various phospholipases for which the cDNA structure is already known, cytosolic PLA2 (26Fujimori Y. Kudo I. Fujita K. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), guinea pig pancreatic phospholipase (29Hjorth A. Carriere F. Cudrey C. Woldike H. Boel E. Lawson D.M. Ferrato F. Cambillau C. Dodson G.G. Thim L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4702-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), phospholipase B (30Saito K. Sugatani J. Okumura T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar),Campylobacter coli PLA2 (31Grant K.A. Belandia I.U. Dekker N. Richardson P.T. Park S.F. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PS-PLA1 (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), show both PLA and lysophospholipase activity. Among these phospholipases, hepatic lipase (32Gillett M.P. Vieira E.M. Dimenstein R. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), guinea pig phospholipase (33Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), phospholipase B, and PS-PLA1 exhibited both PLA1 and lysophospholipase activity. Saito et al. (30Saito K. Sugatani J. Okumura T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that the PLA1 and PLA2activities of Penicillium notatum phospholipase B are lost completely by limited proteolysis, whereas its lysophospholipase activity remains unchanged (30Saito K. Sugatani J. Okumura T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although the protein structures required for each activity have not been characterized yet. Separating lyso-PS-specific lysophospholipase activity from PS-phospholipase A1 is the first example of determining a protein structure required for lysophospholipase and PLA1 activity. The lipases (lipoprotein and pancreatic lipase) are reported to be composed of two domains (the N-terminal and C-terminal domains) (34Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar,35van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS-PLA1 is also predicted to possess the similar two domains (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but in PS-PLA1ΔC, two-thirds of the C-terminal domain is lost (Fig. 1). From our results (Fig. 3,b and c), we conclude that the N terminus of PS-PLA1, which is conserved between PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC (Fig. 1 c), carries a structure that recognizes the serine residues of serine phospholipids (PS and lyso-PS) and is responsible for heparin binding. We showed in this study that PS-PLA1ΔC fails to hydrolyze PS. In addition, our preliminary experiment shows that when we incorporated lyso-PS as a substrate of PS-PLA1ΔC into PC liposomes, its enzymatic activity was effectively inhibited (data not shown). This indicates that PS-PLA1ΔC may not be able to recognize the lipid surface of PS micelles and that the C terminus of PS-PLA1, which is missing in PS-PLA1ΔC, plays an important role in recognizing diacyl-PS in the lipid bilayers. Several studies have in fact suggested an important role of the C terminus of lipases in recognizing lipid surfaces (36Hide W.A. Chan L. Li W.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.J. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1994; 24: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, as PS-PLA1does not show any amino acid homology with other lipases in the C-terminal domain (30Saito K. Sugatani J. Okumura T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is also possible that this domain of PS-PLA1 has another specialized function(s). It is generally known that a lid is involved in the interfacial activation (38Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25470-25474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or substrate recognition (39Dugi K.A. Dichek H.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lid of PS-PLA1 is composed of 12 amino acid residues (Fig. 1), whereas those of many lipases are composed of 22 or 23 residues. This short lid may not play a role in the interfacial activation, because it was demonstrated that pancreatic lipase loses the ability to surface activation when its lid, composed of 23 amino acids, was shortened by site-directed mutagenesis (38Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25470-25474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather this short lid may be involved in substrate recognition. In fact, both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC possess the same lid structure. We first purified PS-PLA1 from rat platelets. In this study, we showed that PS-PLA1 is expressed in various human tissues. However, human platelets, leukocytes (Fig. 4), and red blood cells do not express PS-PLA1 appreciably. We could not detect PS-PLA1 activity in platelets from rabbits, cattle, or pigs. Thus, PS-PLA1 is expressed in platelets in a species-specific manner. It is not yet known whether the alternative form (PS-PLA1ΔC) exists in species other than humans, although the nucleotide sequence of the ratPS-PLA 1 gene around the exon-intron boundary is identical to that of the human PS-PLA 1 gene (Fig. 2 a). Thus, we expect that the alternative form will be present in the rat and in other species. The physiological significance of PS-PLA1 is not yet known. The chromosomal location of the human PS-PLA 1 gene does not suggest a possible link to human disease. It is noteworthy, however, that the nucleotide sequence of human PS-PLA1 is identical to that of thenmd gene product (40van Groningen J.J. Egmond M.R. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This gene is predominantly expressed in nonmetastatic human melanoma cell lines, with a lower expression level in metastatic cell lines (40van Groningen J.J. Egmond M.R. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Any molecular link between PS and the metastasis of tumor cells is totally unknown at present, but identifying PS-PLA1 as the nmd gene product suggests that serine phospholipids (PS or lyso-PS) are involved in the metastatic process of tumor cells. Calderon et al. (4Calderon C. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Sotomayor E.M. Lopez D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 945-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported that some cancer cells secrete PS, and it impairs macrophage cytotoxicity by inhibiting the production of nitric oxide from macrophages. Thus they speculated that cancer cells escape from macrophage recognition by secreting PS. PS-PLA1 may hydrolyze such PS and increase the activity of macrophages in self-defense against tumor cells. PS-PLA1 mediates three types of reaction to eliminate PS and 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS and to produce 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS. PS-PLA1ΔC, by contrast, has only an ability to eliminate 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS. Once 2-acyl-1-lysophospholipids are produced by the PLA1 reaction, the fatty acid at the sn-2 position readily migrates to the sn-1 position, which results in production of 1-acyl-2-lysophospholipids (41Pluckthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PS-PLA1ΔC might eliminate such 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS in vivo, or it might eliminate 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS, which is produced by the PLA2 reaction. Because serine phospholipids are suggested to be involved in various pathophysiological conditions (16Bruni A. Monastra G. Bellini F. Toffano G. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 282: 165-179PubMed Google Scholar), both PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC might be key enzymes that regulate the production and elimination of serine phospholipids. Further study is required to clarify the physiological functions of PS-PLA1 and PS-PLA1ΔC. We thank Dr. Kenta Nakai for helpful discussion on alternative splicing of human PS-PLA1."
https://openalex.org/W2031007165,"Metastability of the native form of proteins has been recognized as a mechanism of biological regulation. The energy-loaded structure of the fusion protein of influenza virus and the strained native structure of serpins (serine protease inhibitors) are typical examples. To understand the structural basis and functional role of the native metastability of inhibitory serpins, we characterized stabilizing mutations of α1-antitrypsin in a region presumably involved in complex formation with a target protease. We found various unfavorable interactions such as overpacking of side chains, polar-nonpolar interactions, and cavities as the structural basis of the native metastability. For several stabilizing mutations, there was a concomitant decrease in the inhibitory activity. Remarkably, some substitutions at Lys-335 increased the stability over 6 kcal mol−1 with simultaneous loss of activity over 30% toward porcine pancreatic elastase. Considering the location and energetic cost of Lys-335, we propose that this lysine plays a pivotal role in conformational switch during complex formation. Our current results are quite contradictory to those of previously reported hydrophobic core mutations, which increased the stability up to 9 kcal mol−1 without any significant loss of activity. It appears that the local strain of inhibitory serpins is critical for the inhibitory activity.

Instead, the rate of loop insertion is thought to be critical for inhibitory function. The inhibition process of serpins can be described as a suicide substrate mechanism (17Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), in which serpins, upon binding with proteases, partition between cleaved serpins and stable serpin-enzyme complexes in a ratio represented by the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI, number of moles of inhibitors required to completely inhibit 1 mol of a target protease). The SI values of most inhibitory serpins are close to one for cognate target proteases. Retardation of the loop insertion, however, would alter the partitioning between the inhibitory and substrate pathways in such a way that the SI value would increase since the SI value is defined by 1 + k substrate/k inhibition(17Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Engh R.A. Huber R. Bode W. Schulze A.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the energy loaded in the strained native structure of serpins is utilized for the facile loop insertion.To understand the structural basis of the loaded energy in the native structure, we have been characterizing stabilizing amino acid substitutions of α1AT, a prototype inhibitory serpin. We previously reported that decrease in the size of side chains at the hydrophobic core of α1AT (Fig. 1, blue) confers increased stability (24Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). That was quite unusual, as a decrease in size inside the hydrophobic core usually yields a cavity that causes loss of stability (25Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). We proposed that side chain locking in the native α1AT prohibits rearrangement of the side chains for maximal packing (24Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Such structural defects are likely to be the basis of the native strain in the inhibitory serpins. If the energy loaded in the strained native structure of serpins is utilized for the inhibitory function, mutations that decrease the loaded energy should also decrease the activity. In the present study, we tested this concept of the native strain. We searched for mutations that increased the stability and simultaneously affected the inhibitory activity. We characterized stabilizing amino acid substitutions of α1AT in a region that is presumably involved in the conformational change for the insertion of the reactive center loop during the inhibitory complex formation: strands 3 and 5 of A sheet (s3A and s5A), helix F (hF), and the connecting loop (Fig. 1,purple). Characterization of the mutant proteins and structural examination of the mutation sites revealed various unusual interactions as the structural basis of the native metastability. Functional analyses provide direct evidence that the energy loaded in the native inhibitory serpins is utilized for the biological activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMolecular Properties of Mutant α1ATWe found various stabilizing single amino acid substitutions at over 10 sites in the target region (Fig.1). The conformational stability of representative mutant α1AT was measured by equilibrium unfolding in the presence of urea in which changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity were monitored. The changes in free energy of stabilization (ΔΔG) of the mutant proteins are summarized in Table I. For many of the sites, additional substitutions were made by introducing alanine, among which stabilizing mutations were further characterized (Table I). One remarkable result is that K335A and K335G mutations showed a profound effect on stability (Fig. 2 A), shifting the midpoint of the unfolding transition from 1.8m to 3.9 m and 4.0 m urea, respectively, which resulted in the increase of stability over 6 kcal mol−1. This is the biggest increase in stability of α1AT by a single amino acid substitution studied so far. The effect of the mutations in α1AT on the inhibitory activity was examined by determining the SI values against a target protease. The SI values of K335A and K335G α1AT, which showed dramatic increase in stability (Fig. 2 A), were increased substantially (Fig. 2 B). The SI value of K168A, which showed little increase in stability (Fig. 2 B), was also increased (Fig. 2 B). The changes in SI value were due to the alteration of the partitioning between the inhibitory and substrate pathways. When the mutational effects on the formation of protease-inhibitor complex were analyzed on SDS-polycrylamide gel, the ratios of cleaved proteins over complexes were increased by K335A and K335G mutations compared with wild-type α1AT (Fig.3), indicating that there was a shift in partitioning toward substrate pathway in mutant proteins. The effects of other stabilizing mutations on inhibitory activity were determined and the results are summarized in Table I.Table ICharacteristics of mutant α1AT in the loop-insertion regionMutations1One-letter codes for amino acids were used.

The activity change was plotted as the function of stability increase for each mutant protein (Fig. 4), and the mutations were grouped into three classes according to their properties (Table I). For group I mutations (top group in Table I), there seems to be a correlation between the increase in conformational stability and the loss in inhibitory activity (Fig. 4, circles; Fig. 1,yellow beads). Remarkably, the substitutions at Lys-335, K335A and K335G, increased the stability over 6 kcal mol−1 with concomitant losses of activity over 30% toward porcine pancreatic elastase. These results suggest that the loaded energy is related to the inhibitory function at Lys-335, and possibly at other sites. For the group II substitutions (middle group in TableI), K168A, K168I, or I169V barely increased the conformational stability but affected inhibitory activity substantially (Fig. 4,triangles; Fig. 1, orange beads). It seems, however, that for these mutations the loss of activity is not due to an increase in conformational stability of the native formper se but to a decrease in the stability of the serpin-protease complex. Such mutations can be obtained in our initial screening for thermostable variants, because the screening is based on enhanced kinetic stability against aggregation (26Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the mechanism of heat-induced aggregation of α1AT is loop-sheet polymerization in which the reactive center loop of one molecule is inserted into A sheet of another (30Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). For the group III mutations (bottom group in Table I), K163T, G164V, or A183V, the activity of α1AT was less affected than expected from the increase in stability (Fig. 4, green squares; Fig. 1, green beads). Unlike group I mutations, which decreased the size of side chains, G164V and A183V increased the size of side chains. The hydrophobic core mutation reported previously, Multi-7, did not show any significant activity change even with a stability increase up to 9 kcal mol−1(28Lee K.N. Im H. Kang S.W. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is also included in the plot for comparison, and the relationship between stability increase and activity change is also indicated (Fig. 4, blue square; dashed line).Figure 4The relation between stability increase and activity loss of the mutant α1AT obtained in this study. Activity loss against porcine pancreatic elastase by each mutation was calculated as: 1 − relative activity of the mutant protein toward porcine pancreatic elastase. ○, mutations with a tendency to correlate stability increase and activity loss (Table I, top group); ▵, mutations exhibiting a significant activity loss without much increase in stability (Table I, middle group); ■, mutations showing less activity loss than expected from the stability increase (Table I, bottom group).

Chem. 1998; 273: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is also shown for comparison. The correlation curve was drawn only with the first group mutations (dotted line; the correlation coefficient is 0.93), and the relationship between stability increase and activity change by Multi-7 is also drawn (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structural Basis of MetastabilityIn the crystal structure of the native α1AT (12Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the stabilizing mutation sites are composed of many unusual interactions, which appear to be the basis of the metastability. These interactions are likely to be mobilized during the complex formation with a target protease. From the mutational analysis, the following modes were revealed as structural basis of the native metastability of α1AT.Overpacking of Side ChainsLys-335 interacts with hydrophobic residues, Ile-169 and Leu-172 (Fig.5 A). The Nζ atom of Lys-335 side chain may be paired with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile-188 (2.87 Å) and Oγ atom of Thr-165 (3.72 Å), but the aliphatic part of Lys-335 is squeezed in hydrophobic interactions provided by Ile-169 (3.45 Å) and Leu-172 (3.24 Å). It appears that K335G or K335A mutation relieved such strain by decreasing the size of the side chain. Remarkably, many stabilizing substitutions such as T165S, I169V, L172V, and L172A are the ones occurring at the residues interacting with Lys-335 (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the substitution pattern showed size reduction as a common theme. Leu-172 is unusually close to Lys-335 (3.24 Å). L172V as well as L172A, which increased the stability even more (Table I), might have eliminated such an overpacking of the side chains. Stabilizing mutations such as F189I and F189V also showed the size reduction pattern. Size reduction to alanine at 189, however, resulted in the loss of stability. We previously reported that decrease in the size of side chains at the hydrophobic core of α1AT (Fig. 1, blue) confers increased stability (24Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Structural determination of α1AT variants carrying stabilizing substitutions at the hydrophobic core revealed better packing at the mutation sites (12Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct.

The substitution pattern observed in the present study (Table I) revealed that size reduction in the present target region (Fig. 1, purple) also increases the stability of the molecule. It appears that overpacking of the side chains is one mechanism of the native strain of α1AT.Figure 5A ribbon diagram of α1AT showing structural difference in the target region between the native (A) (12Ryu S.-E.

The central β-sheet, A sheet, is shown at left, and the helix F (hF) and the following loop are shown on the right side. The side chains of representative polar residues are coloredyellow.

This figure was prepared using QUANTA program (Molecular Simulation Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Polar-Nonpolar InteractionsThe present studies revealed various polar-nonpolar interactions as an additional mode of destabilization in the target region. The side chain of Lys-335 is not only squeezed but also surrounded by hydrophobic residues. It is unusual to find charged residues in the hydrophobic environment. Studies on other mutant proteins revealed that the energetic cost of burying a charge in a hydrophobic environment is estimated be 3–9 kcal mol−1 (32Dao-pin S. Anderson D.E. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Mathews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11521-11529Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mutations at Lys-335 of α1AT increased the stabilizing energy by 3–7 kcal mol−1 (TableI). Phe-189 is on a surface pocket (Fig. 5 A), interacting unfavorably with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly-164 (2.89 Å). Thr-165 appears to stabilize the end of helix F and the following turn by providing hydrogen bonding to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Val-161 and backbone nitrogen of Ile-169. The Cγ2 atom of Thr-165, however, has close interactions with the polar atoms of the backbone, while the hydroxyl group of Thr-165 is close to the Cε atom of Lys-335 (3.47 Å). T165S might have relieved such strain while maintaining the H-bond networks with backbone atoms of Val-161 and Ile-169. As expected, substitution of Thr-165 by alanine decreased stability. Leu-172 also has an unfavorable interaction with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asn-186 on s3A (2.97 Å). Lys-331 is on a surface pocket, interacting with Val-333 and Val-173. K331M increased the stability (Table I) possibly by providing more favorable interactions with the surrounding residues. It is likely that these unfavorable polar-nonpolar interactions are another basis of the native metastability of α1AT.CavitiesStructural examination of the target region also revealed the existence of surface cavities. Two of the substitutions identified in the present study, A183V and G164V, do not fit the common theme of size reduction for stabilization of the native α1AT. In both cases, size increase rather than size reduction caused the stability increase. In the native structure (12Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the region near Gly-164 and Ala-183 is not well packed, leaving an empty patch on the surface (Fig. 6). The surface cavity near Gly-164 is surrounded by the side chain atoms of Phe-189 and Lys-335. Likewise, the side chain of Ala-183 does not show much interaction with other side chains. Surrounding hydrophobic residues such as Phe-147, Ile-157, Val-185, and Leu-172 are at least 5 Å apart. Cavities are very likely to be the source of energetic cost in conformational stability (33Kocher J.-P. Prevost M. Wodak S.J. Lee B. Structure. 1996; 4: 1517-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The stabilizing substitutions, G164V and A183V, appear to provide better packing by filling the nearby cavities.Figure 6A space-filling model of native α1AT showing the surface cavity near Gly-164. The left panel is the view from the left side of the molecule shown in Fig. 1, and the right panel is the view from the right side.

The crystal structure of the serpin-protease complex is not available yet. However, it has been proposed that accompanying the structural transition to the relaxed complex form, the reactive center loop is at least halfway (up to P9 position, the 9th residue amino-terminal to the scissile peptide bond) inserted into A sheet (34Wilczynska M.

Second, shadowing and scanning transmission electron microscopy suggest that a monomolecular layer of involucrin is overlayered on the cytoplasmic side by other CE structural proteins (16Jarnik M. Simon M.N. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1051-1060PubMed Google Scholar). Third, extant models of CE structure based on biochemical characterization and protein sequencing indicate that involucrin becomes cross-linked to several cell peripheral proteins including desmoplakin, envoplakin, keratin intermediate filaments, as well as other CE proteins including members of the small proline-rich family, cystatin α and loricrin (6Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Fourth, recent data have shown that involucrin is a major target for the covalent attachment of ceramide lipids from the exterior surface of the CE, which could only occur if involucrin was deposited in the intimate vicinity of the keratinocyte membrane at an early time (19Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human involucrin contains 150 glutamine and 45 lysine residues (20Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1988; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and it appears that mammalian involucrins have undergone extensive expansion of various glutamine-rich repeating motifs during evolution perhaps to increase the sites suitable or available for TGase-mediated cross-linking (21Tseng H. Green H. Cell. 1988; 54: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, sequencing studies of this laboratory have shown that only a limited number of these residues are used for cross-linking in vivo (17Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas involucrin appears to be a good substrate for TGases in in vitro reactions (11Simon M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Etoh Y. Simon M. Green H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), extant data have provided no information on which of these enzyme(s) are responsible for cross-linking in vivo. TGases are Ca2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze an acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of protein-bound glutamine and the ε-amino group of lysine residues. Of the seven known human TGases, four (TGases 1, 2, 3, and X) are expressed in terminally differentiating epithelia such as the epidermis (23Kim H.-C. Idler W.W. Kim I.-G. Han J.-H. Chung S.-I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but to date only limited data are available on their substrate specificities and relative contributions in CE assembly. Of these, the TGase 2 enzyme is thought to play only a minor role, and the properties of the newly discovered TGase Xenzyme await characterization. The TGase 1 and 3 enzymes are essential for the cooperative cross-linking of such substrates as loricrin (25Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), trichohyalin (26Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N Andreoli J.A. Idler W.W. Candi E. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23297-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The TGase 3 enzyme is soluble and requires proteolytic activation before it can function (29Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.-C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TGase 1 enzyme was first discovered in keratinocytes and is usually anchored to membranes by way of acylN-myristoyl and S-myristoyl orS-palmitoyl adducts near the amino terminus of the protein (30Chakravarty R.

However, virtually all studies with the TGase 1 enzyme to date have involved assays with poorly defined keratinocyte particulate fractions (8Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1979; 11: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 9Watt F.M. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Simon M. Green H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26242-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used synthetic lipid vesicles (SLV) of composition similar to those of eukaryote plasma membranes in order to explore how membranes affect TGase reaction and residue specificity. First, we show that only the TGase 1 enzyme can associate with SLV. Second, we show that of several proven CE structural proteins available to us, only involucrin associates with SLV and in a Ca2+-dependent manner. When both TGase 1 and involucrin are attached to membranes, there is remarkable specificity of glutamine residue usage for cross-linking. These data have important implications for CE assembly and ichthyosiform diseases caused by enzyme or substrate abnormalities. Recombinant full-length human TGase 1 and TGase 3 enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells by the BaculoGold system using the pVL1392 plasmid vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) as described previously (33Candi E. Melino G. Lahm A. Ceci R. Rossi A. Kim I.G. Ciani B. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13693-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TGase 1 was recovered in the particulate fraction after sonication in lysis buffer (33Candi E. Melino G. Lahm A. Ceci R. Rossi A. Kim I.G. Ciani B. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13693-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In some experiments this crude particulate fraction was used as the source of enzyme activity in amounts standardized to incorporate 0.7 pmol/min of [14C]putrescine into succinylated casein. In most experiments, it was solubilized from membranes by sonication in lysis buffer with 4% Triton X-100 or in some cases with 1 m NH2OH-HCl (32Steinert P.M. Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26242-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TGase 3 was recovered in the cytosolic fraction after lysis by sonication. These solutions were clarified by centrifugation and the enzymes subsequently purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on MonoQ Sepharose as before (33Candi E. Melino G. Lahm A. Ceci R. Rossi A. Kim I.G. Ciani B. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13693-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Active fractions were brought to 1 mNa2SO4 and rechromatographed on a 1-ml Resource Phe hydrophobic interaction column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a gradient from 1 m Na2SO4, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) to 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) in 30 min at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The TGase 1 and 3 enzymes were >98% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and could be stably stored as a suspension in 1.5 mNa2SO4 for some weeks at 4 °C. Amounts were determined by amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis. TGase 3 was activated with 0.1 units/100 μg dispase for 15 min at 23 °C and purified from the protease on a MonoQ column as above. A full-length cDNA clone of human involucrin was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from human chromosomal DNA. Polymerase chain reaction primers used were (+)-GTAGCTTCTCATATGTCCCAGCAAC and (−)-CCCTTGTATGAGACGATCTGAG. These were designed to create an NdeI restriction site to be compatible with the pET expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid using the TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing. Following subcloning into the pET11a vector and transfection into the BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen), protein expression was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cell mass was pelleted and lysed by freeze-thawing. Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation, and involucrin protein was enriched by heat precipitation as described (22Etoh Y. Simon M. Green H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was purified to >97% (by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and gradient elution with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. By circular dichroism, it possessed an estimated α-helix content of 68%. As this is similar to native involucrin isolated from keratinocytes (12Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the recombinant protein had assumed its native configuration. Mixtures of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylserine (PS), and other lipids where indicated (all from Sigma) were made in chloroform/methanol (95:5). In all cases, the mixtures contained 30% cholesterol. When the amounts of PS or other individual components were varied, phosphatidylcholine was added to make the mixture to 100%. Mixtures were made in 0.5 ml and contained 10 μmol of total lipids. The solvent was flushed away under a stream of N2, dried further under high vacuum for 4 h, and then resuspended by vortexing in 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 mm sucrose. The mixture was sonicated on ice five times each for 1 min using a Branson 250 sonifier with micro probe tip, and allowed to stand at 23 °C to facilitate assembly of SLV. After 1 h the SLV were diluted with 0.5 ml of the above buffer without sucrose, and 200-μl aliquots were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman Airfuge using the A-10 rotor. The top 175 μl was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in another 150 μl of sucrose-free buffer. The final stock concentration was 11 μmol/ml. Liver TGase 2 enzyme was obtained from Sigma. The recombinant human CE proteins loricrin (25Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), SPR1 (27Candi E. Tarcsa E. Idler W.W. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7226-7237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and SPR2 (28Tarcsa E. Candi E. Kartasova T. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23297-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as described previously. Succinylated casein was a generous gift of Dr. Soo-Youl Kim. All binding assays were done at 23 °C in a final volume of 200 μl by mixing SLV with protein amounts empirically found to exceed at least 2-fold the binding capacities of the SLV as follows: for TGase 1, 20 μg (0.2 nmol) were mixed with 0.1 μmol of SLV lipids; for involucrin, 1.2 nmol were mixed with 1 μmol of SLV lipids; for all other proteins, 50 μg were used with 1 μmol of SLV lipids. In all cases, the buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmNaN3, and other additives where noted. Some mixtures also contained 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA. After mixing, the samples were centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g, and the protein content from 50 μl of supernatant was determined by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis. Data were usually not corrected for loss of SLV lipids, as in control experiments, cumulated losses were <4% as assayed by [14C]phosphatidylcholine tracer, and thus neglected from the calculations. The Ca2+ concentrations in the micromolar range were set by buffering free Ca2+ with chelators. The desired Ca2+/chelator ratios were calculated by the WinMaxC 1.7 computer program (34Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Nuccitelli R. Methods in Cell Biology: A Practical Guide to the Study of Ca2+ in Living Cells. 40. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-327Google Scholar) and were made by adding the required amounts of 1m CaCl2 to 0.2 m stock solutions of the following chelators at pH 8.0. Final chelator concentrations in the samples were 10 mm in all cases. Sodium citrate was the chelator for the 20–500 μm Ca2+ range, sodium nitrilotriacetate for the 1–20 μmCa2+ range, and sodium 1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′′,N′-tetraacetate for the 0.1–1 μm Ca2+ range. The actual concentration values were not significantly different from the theoretical calculations (p > 0.2, n = 5) in the 2–100 μm range as assayed by arsenazo III dye spectrophotometry (35Thomas M.V. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 115-123Google Scholar). Three sets of experiments were performed to determine reactive Gln residues in involucrin by TGase 1 and labeling with [14C]putrescine as follows: TGase 1 bound to SLV (2 μmol of lipid) containing 15% PS; the TGase 1 enzyme present in crude Sf9 cell particulate fractions; or solubilized TGase 1 in reaction buffer. In each case, the amount of TGase 1 activity was standardized to 0.7 pmol/min using succinylated casein and [14C]putrescine, as described previously (36Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and corresponded to about 0.9 pmol. This was set far below saturating amounts on SLV in order to ensure that all enzyme was bound to the SLV. All reactions were done in 250 μl and contained 1.2 nmol of involucrin, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mmputrescine with 100 nCi of [14C]putrescine (NEN Life Science Products, 110 Ci/mmol). After 4 h incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm and 100 μl 20% SDS and vortexed. This mixture was precipitated and washed three times with acetone/triethylamine/acetic acid (90:5:5) (37Konigsberg W.H. Henderson L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 254-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to remove the SDS and the lipids. After repeated washings with acetone, the pellet was redissolved in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and digested for 16 h at 37 °C with 2% (by weight) of modified trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). Aliquots of 20 μg were resolved on a 250 × 4.6 mm Beckman Ultrasphere C18 HPLC column. Separated peaks were analyzed for radioactivity, and peaks containing activity were attached to a solid support for sequencing as before (38Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). As the peptide number 40 eluted by 50% acetonitrile (see Fig. 9) was too long for direct sequencing, it was subjected to limited proteolysis by dispase and was sequenced from four peptides isolated by HPLC chromatography as above. The Gln residues reacted by putrescine by TGase 1 were identified by standard protein sequencing analyses. The PTH-derivative of the γ-glutamylputrescine eluted as a novel peak at 13.55 min in the HPLC separation step of the Porton Instruments LF 3000 protein sequencer. This was confirmed by measurement of the [14C]putrescine label. This always corresponded to those cycles where a Gln residue was also present. Values were measured at 37 °C using 0.9 pmol of TGase 1, 20 mm putrescine with 100 nCi of [14C]putrescine, 5 mm CaCl2, SLV containing a total of 2 μmol total lipid, five concentrations of substrate proteins (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 μm for SLV-bound TGase 1 with involucrin or 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μm for solubilized TGase 1 and soluble substrates) as described (25Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The calculated K M values pertain to the protein substrates; V max andk cat data are those for putrescine incorporation. The molar mass of succinylated casein was taken to be 25 kDa. The reaction rates were quantified by measuring the incorporated radioactivity as before (35Thomas M.V. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 115-123Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were obtained as before (35Thomas M.V. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 115-123Google Scholar) using the curve-fitting and regression analysis with Sigmaplot 4.0 software. All data points represent the mean of three measurements, each performed in triplicate. The size of SLV (>85% below 100 nm, as determined by size-exclusion on Sepharose CL-4B chromatography) was not significantly altered during the binding and labeling reactions. The present experiments were designed to explore the properties and function of the TGase 1 enzyme on a lipid surface using SLV that mimic the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells. In preliminary experiments we made the serendipitous discovery that of several known CE substrates, involucrin also binds efficiently to such membranes under the conditions typically used for TGase assays. This observation has important implications for CE assembly, and the details are examined systematically in this paper. By using SLV formulations initially taken from established methods for assaying protein kinase C activation (39Moisor M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805PubMed Google Scholar) that mimic the cytoplasmic surface of plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells, we found that involucrin was readily adsorbed to the SLV. By using saturating amounts of involucrin (0.6 nmol of protein/μmol of lipid) and 1 mmCa2+ (typical for TGase assays), the soluble involucrin content of the inter-SLV buffer was measured after pelleting of the SLV by ultracentrifugation. Increasing the PS content of SLV from 0 to 30% in 1% increments increased binding of involucrin sigmoidally between 4 and 15 mol % PS (Fig. 1 A) and could be fitted with r = 0.93 to a log (y/100 − y) = 3.82 log [PS%] −0.904 Hill's equation, where y is the ratio of SLV-bound involucrin to the maximal binding. With increasing concentrations of involucrin, SLV containing 15–30% PS could be saturated by 0.43 ± 0.02 nmol of involucrin/μmol of lipid. This corresponds to about one involucrin molecule/500 nm2 of surface (40McLaughin S. Whitaker M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 396: 189-204Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since an involucrin molecule is 46 × 1.5 nm (70 nm2 (12Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this means that a remarkably high value of about 15% of the SLV surface can be decorated by involucrin. The adsorption of involucrin to the SLV was specific to PS since substitutions by phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylinositol did not enhance binding (Fig. 1 B). We also examined whether a variety of other known CE substrate proteins could bind to SLV. The recombinant proteins available to us included loricrin and the small proline-rich proteins 1 and 2. None of these became attached to SLV of any composition tested (Fig.2). Similarly, succinylated casein, a commonly used artificial substrate for amine incorporation by TGases, did not associate with SLV. Next, we determined the optimal free Ca2+concentration required for binding of saturating amounts of involucrin to SLV containing 15 mol % PS (0.6 nmol/μmol lipid) (Fig.3). Maximal binding occurred with >20 μm Ca2+, and half-maximal binding was estimated at 4.2 ± 0.7 μm, but binding was first detected at 1 μm. This Ca2+-induced binding was completely reversible by excess of the chelators EGTA or EDTA. Magnesium and monovalent ions did not support binding of involucrin to SLV (not shown). We have shown previously that the recombinant TGase 1 enzyme expressed in the baculovirus system is constitutively N-myristoylated andS-myristoylated or S-palmitoylated on its amino-terminal 10-kDa portion and can be found mostly in the particulate fraction of the insect cell homogenates (33Candi E.

As for the native enzyme expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, the recombinant TGase 1 can be solubilized from the membranes by extraction with the detergent Triton X-100, and the lipid adducts on the enzyme are retained. Alternatively, the TGase 1 may be solubilized by use of 1m NH2OH-HCl which hydrolyzes theS-acyl adducts off the enzyme (32Steinert P.M. Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26242-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When purified from the NH2OH-HCl method, no TGase 1 enzyme bound to the SLV, as indicated by amino acid analysis of pelleted SLV mixtures and TGase assays of the resulting supernatants (data not shown). However, when the TGase 1 enzyme purified from Triton X-100 extracts was mixed to SLV, they spontaneously reassociated, as indicated by the disappearance of detectable enzyme activity from the supernatants of pelleted SLV mixtures. Using SLV composed of 15% PS, the saturating amount was ≈0.9 nmol of TGase 1/μmol of lipid (Fig.4). The binding of recombinant TGase 1 protein to SLV was not influenced by Ca2+ ions or EGTA or to SLV prepared with varying formulations of ingredients including anionic (20% PS), neutral (only phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol), or cationic (5% stearylamine) lipids (data not shown). Thus the e"

(1997)Biochemistry 36, 6157–6163); however, the results also indicated that the minimum requirement for conversion of FR-β to the functional equivalent of FR-α should include amino acid substitution(s) downstream of residue 92 in addition to mutation of L49A. To pinpoint those residues, chimeric FR-βL49A/FR-α constructs including progressively shorter segments of FR-α downstream of position 92 as well as selected point mutants were studied. Simultaneous substitution of Leu-49, Phe-104, and Gly-166 in FR-β with the corresponding FR-α residues Ala, Val, and Glu, respectively, reconstituted the ligand binding characteristics of FR-α. The results also exclude a role for other residues in FR-α in determining its functional divergence.

The proteins have either two (FR-β, FR-γ) or three (FR-α) sites of N-glycosylation which cumulatively contribute to their proper protein folding and intracellular trafficking but are not required for folate binding (31Shen F.

FR-α and FR-β are attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (26Lacey S.W. Sanders J.M. Rotherburg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. J. Clin.

Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1898-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and murine (42Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) sources have opposite stereospecificities for the reduced coenzyme forms of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3H4folate) (Fig.1) and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHOH4folate). In contrast to FR-α, FR-β preferentially binds to the unphysiologic (6R)-diastereoisomers of these compounds relative to their physiologic (6S)-diastereoisomers. FR-β also exhibits a significantly lower affinity relative to FR-α for the (6S)-diastereoisomer of 5-CH3H4folate, the major circulating form of the vitamin. In addition, FR-β has a lower affinity for a variety of antifolate compounds compared with FR-α (41Wang X. Shen F. Freisheim J.H. Gentry L.E. Ratnam M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1898-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).The tissue specificity of FR isoforms and their elevation in malignant tissues may be an important factor in selective targeting of malignant cells via FR-mediated uptake of novel antifolates and folate conjugates. It is therefore of significance to understand the structural basis for the functional difference between the membrane anchored FR isoforms. We have previously demonstrated a relatively unambiguous approach to identify peptide segments or specific amino acid residues that could account for the functional differences between FR-α and FR-β (43Shen F. Zheng X. Wang J. Ratnam M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The approach takes advantage of the fact that FR-α and FR-β are structurally homologous, and therefore chimeric constructs of the two proteins may be expected to result in functional proteins that could be characterized; by systematic construction of a series of such chimeras in which progressively shorter peptides of one protein are substituted in the other protein, residues that are significant for a specific functional difference may be mapped while simultaneously excluding a role for other residues. In this manner we have previously demonstrated that the functional divergence of FR-β from FR-α is due to Leu49 in FR-β (43Shen F. Zheng X. Wang J. Ratnam M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); substitution of Ala49 in FR-α with Leu conferred the ligand binding characteristics of FR-β. However, conversion of FR-β to the functional equivalent of FR-α could only be accomplished when, in addition to the reciprocal mutation of L49A, the sequence downstream of residue 92 in FR-α was substituted in FR-β. Thus, the functional divergence of FR-α from FR-β could possibly be accounted for by one or more residues downstream of position 92 in addition to Ala49. The purpose of this study is to identify those residues in FR-α.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine the role of individual amino acids of FR-α responsible for its functional variance from FR-β, the general strategy adopted in this study was to examine the effect of substituting peptides or amino acids of FR-α at corresponding locations in FR-β. The basic premise of this approach is that one or a combination of a few amino acids in FR-α are solely responsible for its functional divergence and that they will similarly influence the function of FR-β when substituted in it. For the results of such studies to be most meaningful, it is also important that the mutations not interfere with protein folding and cell surface expression of a functional receptor. Indeed it may be seen in the following sections that all of the FR-β mutants were functional and showed expression levels comparable to that of the wild-type protein. The focus of the functional analysis of the mutant proteins was to test for increase in affinity for (6S)-5-CH3H4folate and absence of stereospecificity for (6R)-5-CH3H4folate, both distinguishing characteristics of FR-α. It was previously demonstrated (43Shen F. Zheng X. Wang J. Ratnam M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that substitution of Ala49 in FR-α with Leu, the corresponding residue in FR-β, conferred FR-β-like characteristics. Conversion of FR-β to the functional equivalent of FR-α by substituting the sequence downstream of position 92 of FR-α was only possible if Leu49 was simultaneously mutated to Ala. Therefore in the following studies, all of the sequence substitutions and mutations were made downstream of position 92 in FR-βL49A.Functional Mapping of FR-α Peptides Downstream of Position 92cDNA constructs were made to encode chimeric proteins in which portions of the carboxyl terminus downstream of amino acid 92 in the FR-βL49A mutant were replaced by the corresponding peptides from FR-α. The initial chimeric proteins generated were FR-β1–139/α140–232(L49A) and FR-β1–92/α93–139/β140–236(L49A) (Fig. 2). The mutants were transiently expressed in human 293 fibroblasts. Membrane preparations from the transfected cells were tested for their relative affinities for the (6S)- and (6R)-diastereoisomers of 5-CH3H4folate (Fig. 2). Both chimeric proteins showed approximately 10-fold greater affinity for (6S)-5-CH3H4folate than either the wild-type FR-β or FR-βL49A; however, the values were approximately 4-fold lower than that of wild-type FR-α. These results appeared to suggest that amino acid residues from both segments of FR-α, i.e. peptides 93–139 and 140–232, would be required to completely confer FR-α-like ligand binding characteristics to FR-βL49A.Figure 2Characterization of chimeric and mutant forms of FR for mapping functional residues in peptide 93–139.

From multiple determinations of IC50 values, percent error was <25.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Role of Divergent Amino Acids in Peptide 93–139 of FR-αTo further map the functionally relevant amino acid(s) within peptide 93–139, additional chimeric constructs in which shorter segments of FR-α were incorporated into the FR-βL49A mutant were designed (Fig. 2) to produce: FR-β1–92/α93–125/β126–236(L49A) and FR-β1–92/α93–115/β116–236(L49A). These two constructs showed functional characteristics similar to FR-β1–92/α93–139/β140–236(L49A). Furthermore, chimeras in which peptides 126–232 and 116–232 of FR-α were substituted in FR-βL49A (Fig. 2) behaved similar to FR-β1–139/α140–232(L49A). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the peptide sequence 116–139 in FR-α has little significance in the differential ligand specificities of the FR isoforms and that peptide 93–115 must contain functionally significant residues.Among the 23 residues in peptide 93–115, only four, at positions 96, 104, 106, and 115, are unconserved in FR-α. As noted previously, the two known murine FR isoforms type 1 and type 2 correspond to the human FR-α and FR-β, respectively, in terms of their ligand binding characteristics. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of peptides 93–115 of FRs from both human and murine (52Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sources (Fig.3) indicates that amino acid residues at positions 96 and 106 are conserved in the murine FR isoforms. Furthermore, the amino acid at position 115 is the same (glutamic acid) in both human FR-β and murine FR-1. Therefore if one assumes the presence of analogous structure-function relationships among human and murine FRs, it would appear that the likely candidates contributing to functional differences between FR-α and FR-β do not occur at positions 96, 106, and 115. Indeed, when these amino acids in FR-β1–92/α93–115/β116–236(L49A) were individually changed back to the corresponding residues of FR-β, it was apparent that the amino acids at positions 96, 106, and 115 were inconsequential to the functional differences between FR-α and FR-β (Fig. 2); mutation of the amino acid at position 104, however, reverted the characteristics of the chimera to those of FR-βL49A. Furthermore, the double mutant, FR-βL49A,F104V, showed approximately 10-fold higher affinity for (6S)-5-CH3H4folate compared with FR-β (Fig. 2). These results clearly indicate that valine at position 104 in FR-α contributes partially to its distinct ligand binding properties.Figure 3Alignment of amino acid sequences of human (26Lacey S.W.

To identify those residue(s), chimeras were first constructed in which FR-α peptide sequences 140–155 or 156–232 were substituted in the double mutant, FR-βL49A,F104V (Fig.4). FR-β1–139/α140–155/β156–236(L49A,F104V) showed properties similar to those of FR-βL49A,F104V(Fig. 4). FR-β1–155/α156–232(L49A,F104V), on the other hand, exhibited ligand binding specificity similar to FR-α (Fig. 4) thus mapping the relevant amino acid(s) to the sequence downstream of position 155. Since the carboxyl-terminal peptide downstream of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification site (Ser209) in FR-α is absent in the mature protein (34Yan W. Ratnam M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14594-14600Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), further mapping was restricted to peptide 156–208. Within this peptide only seven residues are unconserved between FR-α and FR-β. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of human and murine (52Brigle K.E. Westin E.H. Houghton M.T. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) FR isoforms (Fig. 5) shows that only three amino acids (positions 166, 167, and 191) are conserved between human FR-α and murine FR-1 and between human FR-β and murine FR-2. It was therefore undertaken to test the significance of those residues in contributing to functional differences between FR-α and FR-β. Mutation of Leu167 or Ser191 in FR-βL49A,F104V to Ile and Pro, respectively, the corresponding residues in FR-α, did not significantly alter the properties of the protein (Fig. 4). However, when Gly166was substituted with Glu, the corresponding residue in FR-α, the ligand binding characteristics of FR-α were fully reconstituted in FR-βL49A,F104V. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that alanine at position 49, valine at position 104, and glutamic acid at position 166 act synergistically to produce the distinguishing ligand binding characteristics of FR-α compared with FR-β.Figure 4Characterization of chimeric and mutant forms of FR for mapping functional residues downstream of position 139.The horizontal bars represent the complete or partial polypeptide sequence of FR-α (open bars) or FR-β (hatched bars).

Okada T. Hamazume Y. Mega T. Ikenama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of the two proteins has been reported (46Monaco H.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The conserved amino acids include the 16 cysteine residues in FR and 6 tryptophan residues. The nine pairs of cysteine residues in cRBP form disulfide bridges to maintain its structural fold (54Hamazume Y. Mega T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional structure of cRBP, the conserved tryptophan residues at positions 61, 91, 117, 131, 135, and 168 and tyrosine 82 stack into a hydrophobic pocket for binding the aromatic ring of the ligand (46Monaco H.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between FR and cRBP implies structural similarity between these two protein families. We have built a homology model of the folate-binding domain of FR-α (Fig. 6) based on the crystal structure of cRBP (46Monaco H.L.

In the model, residues 104 and 166 are 13.9 Å apart and are respectively located inside and at the entrance of a cleft that corresponds to the ligand-binding pocket in cRBP.

https://openalex.org/W2130213654,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play an important role in nephrogenesis. The biologic effect and mechanism of action of these proteins in the adult kidney has not yet been studied. We investigated the effect of BMP2, a member of these growth and differentiation factors, on mitogenic signal transduction pathways induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in glomerular mesangial cells. PDGF is a growth and survival factor for these cells in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of mesangial cells with increasing concentrations of BMP2 inhibited PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner with maximum inhibition at 250 ng/ml. Immune complex tyrosine kinase assay of PDGF receptor beta immunoprecipitates from lysates of mesangial cells treated with PDGF showed no inhibitory effect of BMP2 on PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. This indicates that the inhibition of DNA synthesis is likely due to postreceptor events. However, BMP2 significantly inhibited PDGF-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity that phosphorylates the Elk-1 transcription factor, a component of the ternary complex factor. Using a fusion protein-based reporter assay, we also show that BMP2 blocks PDGF-induced Elk-1-mediated transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BMP2 inhibits PDGF-induced transcription of c-fos gene, a natural target of Elk-1 that normally forms a ternary complex that activates the serum response element of the c-fos gene. These data provide the first evidence that in mesangial cells, BMP2 signaling cross-talks with MAPK-based transcriptional events to inhibit PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. One target for this inhibition is the early response gene c-fos."
https://openalex.org/W1975450380,"Guanylyl cyclase activating protein (GCAP)-1 regulates photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase, RetGC, in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. It contains four Ca2+-binding motifs, EF-hands, three of which are capable of binding Ca2+. GCAP-1 activates RetGC in low Ca2+ and inhibits it in high Ca2+. In this study we used deletion and substitution analysis to identify regions of GCAP-1 sequence that are specifically required for inhibition and activation. A COOH-terminal sequence within Met157 to Arg182 is required for activation but not for inhibition of RetGC. We localized one essential stretch to 5 residues from Arg178 to Arg182. Another sequence essential for activation is within the N-terminal residues Trp21 to Thr27. The region between EF-hands 1 and 3 of GCAP-1 also contains elements needed for activation of RetGC. Finally, we found that inhibition of RetGC requires the first 9 amino-terminal residues of GCAP-1, but none of the residues from Gln33 to the COOH-terminal Gly205 are specifically required for inhibition. The ability of GCAP-1 mutants to regulate RetGC was tested on total guanylyl cyclase activity present in rod outer segments. In addition, the key mutants were also shown to produce similar effects on recombinant bovine outer segment cyclases GC1 and GC2."

However, an additional conserved RTX acylation site can be identified in ACT at lysine 860 (Lys860), and this residue becomes palmitoylated when recombinant ACT (r-Ec-ACT) is produced together with CyaC in Escherichia coli K12. We have eliminated this additional acylation site by replacing Lys860 of ACT with arginine, leucine, and cysteine residues. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and microcapillary high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric analyses of mutant proteins confirmed that the two sites are acylated independently in vivo and that mutations of Lys860 did not affect the quantitative acylation of Lys983 by palmitoyl (C16:0) and palmitoleil (cis Δ9 C16:1) fatty-acyl groups. Nevertheless, even the most conservative substitution of lysine 860 by an arginine residue caused a 10-fold decrease of toxin activity. This resulted from a 5-fold reduction of cell association capacity and a further 2-fold reduction in cell penetration efficiency of the membrane-bound K860R toxin.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 134: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of ACT to penetrate into target cell membranes and to intoxicate cells depends on a posttranslational activation by the accessory protein, CyaC (20Šebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was first established for theEscherichia coli α-hemolysin (HlyA) that the activation of RTX toxins consists in amide linked fatty-acylation (22Issartel J.-P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Nature. 1991; 351: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and Hackettet al. (23Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have demonstrated by mass spectrometric analysis that native ACT produced by Bordetella (Bp-ACT) is mono-acylated by a palmitoyl residue at the ε-amino group of lysine 983. In contrast, the HlyA from E. coli was found to be acylated at two lysines, both in vitro and in vivo (24Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stanley P. Packman L.C. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, two highly conserved RTX acylation sites (25Stanley P. Packman L.C. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), corresponding to lysine 983 (Lys983) and lysine 860 (Lys860) are also found in ACT, and for an unknown reason, the CyaC-activated recombinant ACT produced in E. coli(r-Ec-ACT) is palmitoylated also at Lys860, in addition to acylation of Lys983 (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When compared with the native mono-acylated Bp-ACT, the doubly acylated r-Ec-ACT exhibits about four times lower specific hemolytic activity on sheep erythrocytes (20Šebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and about 10 times lower specific channel-forming activity in artificial planar lipid bilayers (10Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, however, the characteristics of the channels formed by both proteins are identical, and both proteins have identical capacity to insert into the target membranes and to deliver the invasive AC domain into cells (5Betsou F. Šebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Šebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to membrane insertion and AC translocation into cells, the channel-forming activity of ACT exhibits a cooperative concentration dependence curve, indicative of an oligomerization step involved in ACT channel formation (5Betsou F. Šebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On this basis, a hypothesis was formulated that the acylation of Lys860 might interfere selectively with the oligomerization of ACT within target membranes (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the capacity of ACT to induce protective immune response against Bordetella infection in mice also depends on the CyaC-mediated acylation, and the doubly acylated r-Ec-ACT exhibits significantly lower protective antigenicity than the mono-acylated Bp-ACT (5Betsou F. Šebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These differences in immunological properties of native and recombinant ACT also indicate that acylation at Lys860 may alter the conformation of the toxin. We hypothesized that preventing acylation at Lys860 by substitution of the lysine 860 residue might result in production of native-like and fully active recombinant ACT in E. coli. In this report we demonstrate, however, that lysine 860 is by itself important for toxin action. TheE. coli K12 strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used throughout this work for DNA manipulation and for expression of ACT. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml of ampicillin. pT7CACT1 is a construct derived from pCACT3 (5Betsou F. Šebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing enhanced production of recombinant CyaC-activated ACT in E. coli (r-Ec-ACT) under control of the IPTG-induciblelacZ p promoter. To construct pT7CACT1, first thecyaC open reading frame was amplified by PCR, using purpose-designed primers (5′-GCGCGCGCCATATGCTTCCGTCCGCCCAAG and 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTTAGGCGGTGCCCCGCGGTCG, respectively). The PCR product was fused to the translational enhancement and initiation signals of gene 10 from phage T7 by cloning into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pT7-7 (27Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). Absence of undesired mutations was verified by sequencing, and the XbaI fragment containing the gene together with the expression signals was inserted into a blunted HindIII site of pDLACT1 (5Betsou F. Šebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to substitute the cyaC allele in pCACT3, thereby placing it under lacZ p control and yielding pT7CACT1. The substitutions of the codon for Lys860 were introduced into the cyaAgene by PCR mutagenesis using three pairs of PCR primers, consisting of one common forward primer 5′-GTGGTCCTCGACGTCGCCGCC and one mutation-specific backward primer. These were 5′-TGTGGTGAATTCAGATCTGCCCGTTTTCGTGCG for the K860R substitution, 5′-TGTGGTGAATTCGCTCAGGCCTGTTTTCGTGCG for the K860L substitution, and 5′-TGTGGTGAATTCGCTGCAGCCCGTTTTCGTGCG, for the K860C substitution, respectively. Using the proofreading Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and appropriate primer pairs, 144-base pair fragments of thecyaA gene with the incorporated mutations were PCR-amplified, purified on agarose gels, and cloned asClaI-EcoRI fragments into appropriately digested pT7CACT1. The presence of the desired substitutions and the absence of any unrelated mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the cloned PCR product. In a second step, the complete mutant cyaAalleles were assembled by addition of a 2617-base pair EcoRI fragment encoding the COOH-terminal part of ACT, downstream to the mutagenized residue 860. Plasmids for expression of the truncated mutant ACT were obtained by replacement of the XhoI-ScaI fragments of the respective mutant pT7CACT1 derivatives by theKpnI-ScaI fragment of pACTΔC1322 (36Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Šebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This resulted in insertion of a TAA stop codon at the XhoI site, leading to production of truncated ACT proteins (ACTΔ) with a COOH-terminal Asp1008 residue. The nonacylated variants of the intact and mutant proteins were expressed from plasmids from which the cyaC gene was deleted as an NdeI-BamHI fragment. The wild-type ACT and the different mutant derivatives were produced in the presence, or in the absence of the activating protein CyaC, using the E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) bearing the appropriate plasmid derived from pT7CACT1. Exponential 500-ml cultures were induced with IPTG (1 mm), and the extracts of insoluble cell debris after sonication were prepared in 8m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, as described previously (20Šebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (28Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Šebo P. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13598-13602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the final step, the proteins were eluted with 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored frozen. Alternatively, the truncated proteins were purified directly from urea extracts by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-agarose, as described previously (20Šebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the K860C mutant 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added into all extraction and purification solutions to avoid cysteine oxidation. SDS-PAGE analysis and determination of protein concentration were performed according to standard protocols (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The whole cell extracts of the respective clones expressing the truncated proteins were prepared from exponentially growing cultures induced by IPTG (1 mm) for 3 h. Total protein samples (20 μg) were analyzed by large format two-dimensional (IEF/SDS-PAGE) gel electrophoresis (30O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Investigator system (Oxford Glycosystems).

In the second dimension, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide slab gels (22 × 22 cm). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Upon initial experiments with purified proteins, the use of whole cell extracts for two-dimensional electrophoresis was preferred, in order to avoid prolonged incubation of ACT in 8 m urea solutions during purification. This was because products of urea decomposition may cause secondary covalent modifications, such as carbamylation, leading to uncontrolled changes of the proteins isoelectric points. Moreover, the whole cell extract samples gave better reproducibility of resolution and protein positioning in two-dimensional electrophoresis of the differently acylated ACTΔ protein forms. ACTΔ constituted generally about 5–10% total cell proteins in the sample and could be unambiguously identified on the gels by their characteristic size and by comparison with samples devoid of the ACTΔ-derived material. Moreover, the spots corresponding to the invariant cell proteins could be conveniently used as internal positioning standards for definition of charge/migration differences and relative positioning of the acylated ACTΔ proteins. The location and identity of the acyl modifications were analyzed by liquid chromatography/MS/MS and MALDI-TOF MS techniques essentially as described previously (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tryptic and Asp-N fragments of the analyzed proteins were generated according to standard protocols and separated on 50-μm inner diameter × 12-cm capillary column packed with Magic 5 μm 200 Å C18 material (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA), at a flow rate of 150 nl·min−1, with a 0–100% acetonitrile gradient (1% acetic acid) over 40 min. Peptide analysis by microcapillary HPLC coupled to a Finnigan TSQ 7000 electrospray tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer was performed as described in detail elsewhere (31Wang H. Hackett M. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 205-212Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Lim K.B. Lawrence R.F. Howald W.N. Taylor J.A. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Hackett M. Anal.

Positive ion MALDI mass spectra were measured on a PerSeptive Voyager DE linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a gridless delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 20 kV, and guide wire voltage was set to 0.02%. For delayed extraction, an 8% kV potential difference between the probe and the extraction lens was applied with a time delay of 20 ns after each laser pulse. Samples in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (premix sample preparation technique) (33Beavis R.C. Chaudhary T. Chait B. Org. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 27: 156-158Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar) were irradiated by 337-nm photons. Typically 20–50 shots were summed into a single mass spectrum. Spectra were calibrated externally using the average [M + H]+ ion of a peptide standard (insulin, Aldrich). Identities of the C16:0 and C16:1 cis ΔD9 fatty-acyl groups were confirmed by capillary gas chromatography/MS with electron impact ionization after a one-step extraction and derivatization procedure (34Lepage G. Roy C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 114-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylate cyclase activities were measured as described previously in the presence of 1 μm calmodulin (35Glaser P. Ladant D. Sezer O. Pichot F. Ullmann A. Danchin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). One unit of AC activity corresponds to 1 μmol of cAMP formed per min at 30 °C, pH 8.0. Cell-invasive AC was determined as the amount of AC that becomes protected against externally added trypsin upon internalization into erythrocytes in 30 min of incubation (11Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the hemolytic activity was measured as the hemoglobin released upon incubation of washed sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108/ml) with the toxins for 270 min, respectively (11Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocyte binding of the toxins was determined as described in detail previously (36Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Šebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast to the essential acylation of lysine 983, the additional CyaC-mediated acylation of lysine 860, occurring in E. coli K12 host background, is not required for ACT activity and interferes with the hemolytic (channel-forming) activity of r-Ec-ACT (20Šebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was important to determine whether this aberrant acylation can be prevented by substitutions of lysine 860 and whether the activities of the mutant mono-acylated toxins produced by E. coli would resemble those of the mono-acylated wild-type ACT fromBordetella (Bp-ACT). Therefore, the lysine 860 was replaced with arginine, leucine, and/or cysteine residues by PCR mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were produced in an E. coli K12 strain (XL1) in the presence, or in the absence, of CyaC. The acylation status of the obtained mutants was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE) by the method of O'Farrell (30O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach was already successfully used for the analysis of HlyC-dependent acylation of HlyA (24Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It allows to detect fatty-acylation of the respective lysines as loss of one or two positive charges, leading to shifts in the isoelectric point of the toxin. Indeed, nonacylated ACT, bi-acylated ACT, and mono-acylated K860R mutant ACT could be resolved by this technique, although less well than reported previously for HlyA (data not shown). Despite use of 18-cm-long high-resolution IEF tube gels, with a pH gradient set from pH 4 to 6, quantitative and reproducible resolution of proACT from the mono- and bi-acylated ACT forms was difficult to achieve. This could be expected, because the size of the ACT protein is almost twice the size of HlyaA (177 versus 110 kDa), and the theoretical isoelectric points of the three ACT forms under denaturing conditions differ only by 0.01 pH unit (4.27, 4.26, and 4.25 for the non-, mono-, and bi-acylated ACT, respectively). To circumvent this problem, the 70-kDa-long, acidic repeats were deleted from the r-Ec-ACT and its mutant variants. The resulting ACTΔ proteins, with a carboxyl-terminal aspartate residue at position 1008, had theoretical isoelectric points of 5.41, 5.35, and 5.29 in the non-, mono-, and bi-acylated forms, respectively. These proteins could be well resolved by the two-dimensional electrophoresis, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. The proACTΔ protein, produced in the absence of CyaC, migrated as a single spot at a position of the nonacylated form, while the ACTΔ, produced in the presence of CyaC, resolved in two spots corresponding to the major, bi-acylated form (about 80% total) and a mono-acylated form (about 20% total) of ACTΔ, respectively (Fig. 1). When the proACTΔ and ACTΔ proteins were mixed in a roughly equimolar ratio, two major spots of the bi-acylated and nonacylated forms were resolved with the minor spot of the mono-acylated ACTΔ protein positioned between them. This observation was in good agreement with the semiquantitative estimations from mass spectrometric analysis of CyaC-activated intact r-Ec-ACT (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), where about 60% r-Ec-ACT was estimated to be bi-acylated and the rest was mono-acylated. These results demonstrate that removal of the repeat portion downstream to residue 1008 did not have any effect on the efficiency of the CyaC-mediated acylation of the Lys983 and Lys860 residues of ACT. Therefore, the two-dimensional electrophoresis of the COOH-terminally truncated proteins could be used as a suitable assay for acylation of the Lys860 mutants of ACT. It is noteworthy, however, that in some gels trailing of a small portion (<10%) of the ACTΔ-derived material was observed and yielded two very minor satellite spots, corresponding to one more and/or one less positive charge than the major protein species in the sample, respectively. It was not determined whether occurrence of these minor spots was due to handling of samples or whether it was due to intrinsic microheterogeneity of the ACTΔ proteins in the preparations and could be observed due to high resolving power of the applied separation technique. When the K860R mutant forms of ACTΔ were produced in the absence (proACTΔ-K860R) and in the presence (ACTΔ-K860R) of CyaC, each migrated as a single major spot in two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 1). When the two proteins were mixed, they resolved quantitatively in two distinct spots separated by a distance corresponding to a single charge difference. Because the K860R substitution does not alter the net charge of the nonacylated protein, this result is consistent with the conclusion that the substitution of lysine 860 by an arginine prevented the acylation at residue 860 and that quantitative acylation of Lys983 of the mutant protein still occurred in presence of CyaC. Indeed, as expected due to equal charges, the proACTΔ-K860R and proACTΔ proteins produced in the absence of CyaC co-migrated as a single spot, while ACTΔ-K860R produced in the presence of CyaC resolved quantitatively also from the nonacylated proACTΔ (Fig. 1). Furthermore, ACTΔ-K860R, if acylated on Lys983, is expected to bear one positive charge more than bi-acylated ACTΔ. Indeed, when ACTΔ and ACTΔ-K860R were mixed, they resolved in two spots, with the ACTΔ-K860R mutant migrating at the position of the mono-acylated form of ACTΔ. Finally, when ACTΔ-K860R protein was mixed with proACTΔ and ACTΔ, it migrated at the position of mono-acylated form of ACTΔ, in between the nonacylated proACTΔ and the bi-acylated form of ACTΔ (Fig. 1). This demonstrated that the K860R mutant was still quantitatively mono-acylated by CyaC, most likely on Lys983. The same acylation pattern was found also with the K860L mutant (Fig.1). The ACTΔ-K860L protein expressed in the presence of CyaC migrated at the same position as the bi-acylated ACTΔ. This is consistent with its mono-acylation on lysine 983, because the replacement of lysine 860 by leucine removes one positive charge, as does the acylation of lysine 860. Indeed, the nonacylated proACTΔ-K860L and proACTΔ resolved as two spots differing by one charge, as did proACTΔ-K860L and ACTΔ-K860L. In contrast, the ACTΔ-K860L produced in the presence of CyaC and the nonacylated proACTΔ resolved as two spots at a distance corresponding to a difference of two charges. Consistently, the ACTΔ-K860R resolved as a third spot between ACTΔ-K860L and proACTΔ. These results clearly indicate that also the ACTΔ-K860L mutant was quantitatively acylated on lysine 983. It was important to prove that the acylation of the ACT-K860R mutant was indeed located on lysine 983 and that identical fatty-acyl residues were used for modification of the wild-type and mutant proteins. For this, the same approach was used as that originally applied for determination of the chemical nature and location of the fatty-acyl modification of ACT fromBordetella (23Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tryptic and Asp-N proteolytic fragments of the full-length r-Ec-ACT and of the truncated ACTΔ forms of both the wild-type and the K860R proteins, respectively, were analyzed for acylation by MALDI-TOF MS and/or microcapillary HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, as described previously (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Šebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Representative mass spectra are shown in Fig. 2, and the results of the MS analysis of the various proteins are summarized in TableI. These results fully confirm the acylation patterns observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As expected, no acylation was detected on the proACT and proACTΔ proteins produced in the absence of CyaC, while acylation was found on both the Lys983 and Lys860 residues of the r-Ec-ACT and ACTΔ proteins produced in presence of CyaC. More importantly, no acylation of the arginine residue Arg860 of the ACT-K860R and ACTΔ-K860R mutants could be detected, and the acyl residues in this mutant proteins were entirely located on the Lys983 residue. Finally, both wild-type and K860R mutant proteins were acylated by palmitoyl (C16:0) and palmitoleil (cis Δ9 C16:1) fatty-acyl groups. No evidence of myristoylation was observed at either lysine in any of the proteins, quite unlike our previously reported results (26Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk C.S. Ullmann A.

Open table in a new tab The sum of this data demonstrates that the CyaC-mediated acylation of truncated ACTΔ protein in E. coli is identical to that of the full-length ACT protein. The results show further that two-dimensional electrophoresis of whole cell samples containing the ACTΔ protein can be used as a straightforward and reliable assay for the acylating activity of CyaC in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the substitution of the lysine 860 by arginine did not have any effect on CyaC-mediated acylation of Lys983 and that acylation of Lys860 and Lys983 residues of ACT occurs independently in vivo. This is similar to the previously observed independent acylation at the two sites of HlyA, where only about 20–30 flanking residues around each acylated lysine were required for productive modification to take place both in vitro and in vivo (24Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stanley P. Packman L.C. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For comparison of the biological activities, the mutant proteins and intact r-Ec-ACT were purified close to homogeneity, as shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, all substitutions, even the most conservative K860R replacement, caused a strong decrease in toxin activities, reducing to about 10% the cell-invasive AC activity of the K860R mutant and to about 5% those of the K860L and K860C mutants, as shown in Table II. The difference between the activities of the K860R mutant and those of K860L and K860C mutants was small, but reproducible. This suggests that presence of a positively charged amino acid at position 860 is important for toxin function, albeit even an arginine residue could not functionally replace the lysine 860.Table IIBiological activities of the ACT mutantsProtein2All proteins were produced in an E. coliK12 strain (XL-1 Blue) and purified close to homogeneity.Substitution2Point substitutions were introduced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis.Cell binding2Target cell binding, cell-invasive AC, and hemolytic activities were determined as described previously (11, 36) at 2 units of ACT/ml of washed sheep red blood cells (5 × 108cells/ml).

Open table in a new tab The mutant proteins were defective in both the target cell association and in membrane translocation of the bound toxin, as shown further in Table II. Tight cell association was reduced to 23% for the K860R mutant and to 15% for the other two mutants, as compared with intact r-Ec-ACT. Moreover, while under given conditions about 60% cell-bound r-Ec-ACT had the AC domain translocated into cells and had the AC domain protected against externally added trypsin, only 30% bound K860R and 17% K860L and K860C ACT, respectively, was translocated under identical conditions. Hence, the translocation efficiency of K860R ACT was half, and that of both K860L and K860C was about 28%, of the translocation efficiency of the intact r-Ec-ACT, respectively. These data suggested that lysine 860 plays an important role in both the membrane insertion of ACT and translocation of its AC domain into cells. The acylation of Lys860 affects selectively the hemolytic (channel-forming) activity of the toxin, which exhibits different calcium requirements as the invasive AC activity (37Hewlett E.L. Gray L.

It was, therefore, important to compare the calcium and concentration dependencies of the K860R mutant with those of intact r-Ec-ACT. No substantial difference of the two proteins in function of free calcium concentration could, however, be observed when the amount of the K860R protein in the comparative assays was raised seven times in respect to intact ACT, in order to measure both toxin activities in a similar readout range (Fig.4). It appears, therefore, that the K860R mutant toxin still exhibits similar calcium requirements for action as the intact ACT. This indicates that the K860R substitution did not affect the toxin structure in a gross way, causing generalized misfolding of the protein. Such effect of a conservative substitution appears unlikely. Moreover, in contrast to what would be expected for a misfolded protein, no difficulties with mutant toxin production and/or reduced stability during purification were observed (Fig. 3), indicating that the sensitivity of the mutant ACT to the endogenous proteases ofE. coli was not increased and the yields of intact and mutant toxins were also very similar (data not shown). The residual activity of the K860R mutant reaching up to 10% that of intact ACT also suggests that the mutation caused a specific defect of membrane interaction efficiency of ACT. The results reported here suggest that the lysine 860 (Lys860) residue is by itself an important functional residue involved in membrane insertion and translocation of ACT, regardless of its acylation status. It is intriguing that even a conservative substitution of Lys860 by an arginine residue caused a strong decrease in all toxin activities, while modification of Lys860 in E. coli by a bulky and highly hydrophobic palmitoyl residue causes only a selective reduction of the channel-forming activity of r-Ec-ACT and does not affect the membrane insertion and AC delivery capacities of the toxin (5Betsou F.

It is constitutively expressed in macrophages of the marginal zone of the spleen and in lymph nodes and is up-regulated in other tissues during systemic bacterial infections. In this study, we show that ectopic expression of MARCO in cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary, HeLa, NIH3T3, and 293 induces dramatic cell shape changes. Typically these changes include formation of large lamellipodia-like structures and of long dendritic processes. The morphological changes are accompanied by disassembly of actin stress fibers and often also by complete loss of focal adhesions. The MARCO-induced changes are dependent on cell adhesion and are inhibited, but not completely abolished, when the cells are plated on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Similarly, a dominant-negative mutant of the Rho family GTPase Rac1 partially inhibited the morphogenic effects of MARCO in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whereas a dominant-negative form of a related protein, Cdc42, did not. Expression studies with a variety of truncated MARCO forms indicated that the proximal segment of the cysteine-rich domain V is important for the morphoregulatory activity. The results indicate that expression of MARCO has a direct effect in generating the phenotype of activated macrophages necessary for the trapping and removal of pathogens and other foreign substances.

Resting macrophages are fusiform or stellate in shape, whereas activated macrophages have extensive pseudopodia as well as short microvilli and lamellipodia (1Fawcett D. Raviola E. Fawcett D. Bloom W. A Textbook of Histology. 12th Ed. Chapman & Hall, New York, London1994: 150-155Google Scholar). The protrusions are apparently important for phagocytosis, as they extend around the pathogens prior to their engulfment. MARCO 1The abbreviations used are: MARCO, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; MSR, macrophage scavenger receptor; FCS, fetal calf serum; ECM, extracellular matrix; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate, M-419, M-436, M-441, recombinant MARCO receptor variants containing 419, 436, and 441 residues, respectively, from the N-terminal end. is a macrophage receptor (3Elomaa O.

This has implied a direct role for MARCO in the removal of pathogens. This assumption is supported by studies showing that COS, CHO, and fibroblast cells, which normally do not bind bacteria, acquire binding activity for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria following transfection and expression of MARCO (3Elomaa O.

Furthermore, it has been shown that during systemic bacterial infections, expression of MARCO is induced in macrophages located in other tissues, such as liver and lung (4van der Laan L.J.W.

Together, these data strongly indicate a role for MARCO in the host defense against microorganisms. MARCO is structurally related to the macrophage class A scavenger receptors (MSR-A) (5Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 6Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, despite structural similarities, the pattern of expression is different as MSR-A receptors are constitutively expressed by macrophages in all tissues. All these receptors are homotrimeric proteins with a short cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular part. The extracellular portion of MSR-A has both a triple helical coiled coil and collagenous structures, whereas MARCO contains only a long collagenous triple helix. Additionally, both MARCO and MSR-AI have a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain composed of about 100 amino acid residues, whereas MSR-AII lacks this domain completely (3Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C.

MSR-A has been shown to bind a wide variety of ligands, such as modified low density lipoprotein and bacterial surface components (8Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M.

Studies with MSR-A knock-out mice have shown that this receptor contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions and plays a role in host defense against pathogens (12Haworth R. Platt N. Keshav S. Hughes D. Darley E. Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Kodama T. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki H. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding activities of MSR-A shown in vitro have physiological significance. In addition, MSR-A has been implicated in macrophage adhesion (14Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In our studies on MARCO function we observed that expression of this protein in many different cell lines resulted in dramatic cell shape changes. Typically, these changes include formation of large lamellipodia-like structures, as well as of extensive plasma membrane processes. By expressing various truncated forms of MARCO, we show that a segment in the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain is crucial for this activity. The MARCO-induced morphological changes are accompanied by rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, they are inhibited, but not completely abolished, when CHO cells are plated on fibronectin-coated surface or when MARCO is co-expressed with a dominant-negative form of the small GTPase Rac1. The morphoregulatory activity of MARCO may contribute to efficient removal of pathogens from the blood and lymph fluids. Cytochalasin D, butanedione monoxime, streptavidin-agarose, p-phenylenediamine, vitronectin, and fibronectin were obtained from Sigma. Laminin-1 was a kind gift from J. Engel (Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland). Rat anti-mouse MARCO monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by L. van der Laan and G. Kraal (Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Mouse anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (clone 349) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and mouse anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies were obtained from Dako. Rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Sulfo-NHS-biotin was from Pierce, and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. Plasmid pEA1 encoding a full-length cDNA for the human asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 subunit and rabbit antiserum against a purified human asialoglycoprotein receptor were kind gifts from M. Spiess (Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland). The expression plasmids pEXV-Myc Cdc42N17 and pEXV-Myc Rac1V12N17 were generously provided by A. Hall (University College, London, UK). All MARCO expression constructs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). DNA manipulations were carried out using established molecular biological methods. Truncated forms M-419, M-436, and M-441 of murine MARCO were created from the full-length cDNA (3Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) by replacing the region encoding the C-terminal part of MARCO by fragments encoding a stop codon after the codon for serine 419, valine 436, or glutamate 441, respectively. Version M-419 is a truncated form completely lacking the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (domain V), whereas versions M-436 and M-441 also contain short segments of this domain. Constructs “Bst” and “Eco” encode proteins with large internal deletions. The version Bst lacks the last 40 Gly-X-Y triplets of the 270-residue long collagenous domain, whereas Eco encodes a form, whose extracellular domain is composed of the first four residues of the spacer domain, the last 22 triplets of the collagenous domain, and an intact domain V. The construct “Del 422–433” encodes a version of MARCO that lacks the first 12 residues of domain V (residues 422–433). The various constructs are summarized in a schematic form in Fig. 4. The cDNA encoding the full-length human asialoglycoprotein receptor was removed from the pEA1 vector and inserted in the pcDNA3 vector. Cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate method. 20 μg of DNA was used per 100-mm dish. In co-transfections, 10 μg + 10 μg of the expression plasmids was used. Precipitates were incubated on cells overnight, and cells were seeded on glass coverslips 24 h after transfection. In some experiments, transfected cells were taken into suspension 24 h after transfection and were incubated in suspension for 12–16 h before plating on glass coverslips. Suspension culture plates were prepared by coating 100-mm culture dishes with a layer of 1% agarose sterilized by boiling for 30 min. The agarose layer was allowed to harden, and the dishes were equilibrated by two overnight incubations with 10 ml of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, 10% FCS. When examining cell morphology 5 min after plating, cells grown in suspension were plated directly from the suspension culture onto coverslips. Alternatively, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, before plating on coverslips. Cells were plated either on uncoated coverslips or on coverslips coated with FCS, fibronectin, laminin-1, or vitronectin. When coating with FCS, a 10% solution was incubated on coverslips for 30 min at room temperature. Under these conditions, vitronectin is the primary extracellular matrix (ECM) component adsorbed to the glass (15Schneider G. Burridge K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When coating with purified ECM components, a 40 μg/ml solution was incubated on coverslips overnight at 4 °C. Before plating cells, coverslips were further incubated in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Two sparse 100-mm dishes of CHO cells were transfected per each construct. Cells were pooled to one dish 24 h after transfection, and they reached about 50% confluency 40 h post-transfection. At this time point, monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, once with ice-cold Hepes-buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mmMgCl2 and then cooled in this buffer for 10 min in an ice-water bath. Cell-surface proteins were labeled by incubating cells with sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in Hepes buffer, 3 ml/plate) for 30 min in an ice-water bath with gentle intermittent agitation. Monolayers were then washed twice with ice-cold Hepes buffer containing 100 mm glycine and further incubated in the same solution for 15 min in an ice-water bath. Cells were lysed by adding 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide), and proteins were solubilized by incubating the plates on ice for 30 min with constant agitation. Lysed cells were then scraped with a cell scraper, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and further incubated on ice for 30 min with mixing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C). Cleared lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (40 μl of beads) for 5–6 h on ice with constant mixing. The streptavidin-agarose was pelleted and washed four times with the RIPA buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer for 10 min with intermittent agitation. A second round of streptavidin precipitation was carried out in some experiments. However, subsequent Western blotting with an anti-MARCO antibody demonstrated that practically no MARCO protein precipitated at this time, indicating that the first precipitation was quantitative. Therefore, the second precipitation was not carried out in every experiment. Western blotting was carried out using established procedures. The rat monoclonal antibody 1.18, which recognizes an epitope within the cytoplasmic domain of MARCO (16van der Laan L.J.W. Döpp E.A. Haworth R. Pikkarainen T. Kangas M. Elomaa O. Dijkstra C.D. Gordon S. Tryggvason K. Kraal G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar), was used to probe the different forms of MARCO. The filters were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, before probing with an anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. After rinsing twice in PBS, free aldehyde groups were quenched by incubating cells in PBS containing 50 mmNH4Cl for 10 min. Thereafter, cells were incubated in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (blocking solution). All antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution. When staining for MARCO, cells were incubated either with rat monoclonal antibody 1.18 or 7.21 (10 μg/ml) for 1–2 h. The epitope of the anti-MARCO antibody 7.21 is located in domain V (16van der Laan L.J.W. Döpp E.A. Haworth R. Pikkarainen T. Kangas M. Elomaa O. Dijkstra C.D. Gordon S. Tryggvason K. Kraal G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar). After rinsing several times in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-rat IgG. Cells were rinsed again several times in PBS, and coverslips were mounted by inverting them into PBS containing 50% glycerol and 1 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine. For filamentous actin staining, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was added to the secondary antibody solution. For double labeling for MARCO and paxillin, cells were fixed and permeabilized as above and then incubated for 2 h with mouse monoclonal antibody against paxillin (1 μg/ml). After several washes in PBS, cells were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (5 μg/ml) for 30 min, rinsed again in PBS, and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin for 20 min (5 μg/ml). After this, cells were fixed again in the paraformaldehyde solution and stained for MARCO as described above. An interesting change in cell shape was noticed when cells not normally expressing MARCO were transfected with a plasmid encoding the full-length protein. When cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips in complete medium and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy about 40 h after transfection, MARCO-expressing cells often had processes with lengths several times the size of the cell body. Cell lines studied included CHO, HeLa, NIH3T3, and 293 cells. There was some variation in the morphological effects of MARCO between the cell lines so that the processes were longest in 293 cells and that the other cell lines mentioned above often also had large lamellipodia-type structures (from which the long processes extended). Examples of MARCO-expressing CHO and HeLa cells are shown in Fig. 1(A, C, and D) and also in Figs. 6 and 7. In contrast, COS7 cells responded quite differently to MARCO transfection. In these cells, MARCO expression led to formation of short pine needle-like protrusions (not shown).Figure 6Effects of MARCO expression on focal adhesion assembly. CHO (A and B) and HeLa cells (C and D) transiently expressing MARCO were double-stained for MARCO (A and C) and endogenous paxillin (B and D). A and Band C and D, respectively, represent the same field. Cells were examined 40 h post-transfection, after growing them for 16 h on glass coverslips. Focal adhesions do not follow cell margins in the MARCO-expressing cells. Note that CHO cells (B) not expressing MARCO have distinct paxillin-positive focal adhesions (arrows). It is not shown here, but often there are no focal adhesions in those MARCO-expressing cells that have very long extensions, or, as shown in B, if there are focal adhesions, they are not necessary well formed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Dominant-negative Rac1 inhibits the MARCO-induced process formation in CHO cells. CHO cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding MARCO together with either an empty expression vector, an expression vector encoding a Myc-tagged dominant-negative form of Cdc42, Cdc42N17, or with an expression vector encoding a Myc-tagged dominant-negative form of Rac1, Rac1V12N17. A–D, cells were seeded on glass coverslips 24 h post-transfection and were fixed and stained for MARCO and filamentous actin 36 h after transfection. The photos represent the following transfections: MARCO + empty vector (A), MARCO + Cdc42N17 (B), and MARCO + Rac1V12N17 (C and D). The dominant-negative Rac1 significantly inhibits the MARCO-induced process formation. E and F, cells were grown on tissue culture plates and were analyzed 40 h post-transfection.E, cell-surface level of MARCO was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 5. The lanes represent the following transfections: MARCO + Rac1V12N17 (lane 1), MARCO + Cdc42N17 (lane 2), and MARCO + empty vector (lane 3). F, total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of the GTPase mutants using an anti-Myc antibody. Results from two different transfection experiments are shown. The lanes represent the following transfections: MARCO + Rac1V12N17 (lanes 1 and 4), MARCO + Cdc42N17 (lanes 2 and 5), and MARCO + empty vector (lanes 3 and 6). The results shown in E and F demonstrate that different cotransfectants express similar levels of MARCO on the cell surface (E) and that both of the GTPase mutants are expressed at high levels (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Process formation was not dependent on the transfection method, since a similar effect was observed when MARCO-expressing DNA was introduced either by calcium-phosphate method or by retroviral infection (not shown). To test if the process formation was due to overexpression of a membrane protein, we expressed the H1 subunit of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor which is, similar to MARCO, a type II membrane protein. Expression of this protein did not induce any morphological changes (not shown), demonstrating that cell shape changes are not simply a consequence of expression of a cell membrane protein. In further studies, it turned out that MARCO-expressing cells could be identified in cell populations simply by staining for actin filaments (Fig. 1 B). Compared with untransfected cells, MARCO-expressing cells stained only weakly by the filamentous actin-staining rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Furthermore, filamentous actin appeared to be organized differently in these two populations of cells. Examination of cells by a higher magnification revealed that untransfected cells had an organized actin cytoskeleton with numerous long stress fibers (Fig.2). In contrast, the MARCO-expressing cells almost completely lacked stress fibers. Instead, there were fine actin filaments extending from the cell periphery into the processes, although the phalloidin staining was very weak in these processes (not shown). The processes were frequently heavily branched, and examination of the branching pattern revealed that these processes were “protrusive filopodia” instead of trailing tails, being left behind by migratory cells. In order to study the early phases of the process formation, we focused on transiently transfected CHO cells, since these cells did not aggregate when held overnight in suspension. Cells were taken into suspension 24 h after transfection and were then plated 12–16 h later on FCS-coated coverslips. When cells were fixed 5 min after plating, all of them were round, and the MARCO-expressing ones were morphologically indistinguishable from untransfected cells (not shown). However, when cells were fixed 30 min after plating, untransfected cells were still fairly round, but most of the MARCO-expressing cells were already well spread (Fig.3 A). In addition, there were lamellipodia-like protrusions extending from the periphery of some of the MARCO-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B). Examination of cells 1 h after plating revealed that most of the MARCO-expressing cells had protrusions (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, many of the cells sent out thin dendritic processes. After a few hours the processes could be several times longer than the cell body (3 h after plating in Fig. 3 D). It is of interest to note that the cell spreading is fairly symmetrical and that forming lamellipodia appear to extend randomly in different directions. However, soon thereafter MARCO-expressing cells acquired polarity so that the long processes extended only from one pole of the cell. The MARCO-induced morphological effects were efficiently inhibited when cells were plated on FCS-coated coverslips for 45 min in the presence of 2 μm cytochalasin D (not shown), demonstrating the crucial role of actin polymerization in this process (at a 2-h time point cytochalasin D was found to have a toxic effect). On the other hand, 10 mm butanedione monoxime, a known myosin inhibitor, did not have significant effects during the initial cell spreading, whereas it markedly inhibited the process formation (not shown). In this experiment, cells were assayed 45 min and 2 h after plating on FCS-coated coverslips. In order to identify specific regions of the MARCO polypeptide required for the morphological effects, different truncated forms of MARCO were expressed in CHO cells (Fig.4). First, we tested truncations M-436 and M-441, which almost completely lacked the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain V and contained, respectively, only the first 16 and 21 residues of this domain. Both forms effectively promoted the morphological change, demonstrating that most of the domain V is not needed for this activity. We next produced a version of MARCO that lacks the C-terminal half of the collagenous domain (version Bst, lacking residues 299–419), and the morphological change of cells was observed upon expression of this protein, too. Since this indicated that the C-terminal part of the collagenous domain is not needed for the morphological effects, we next tested a form of MARCO, whose extracellular part is composed of the first 4 residues of the spacer domain, the last 65 residues of the collagenous domain, and an intact domain V (version Eco). Somewhat surprisingly, this variant also promoted process formation, albeit not as efficiently as the other truncated forms. Taken together, the only region of the extracellular domain that is common for all these effective truncated versions is a segment of domain V before its first cysteine residue (residues 420–436). Therefore, we predicted that expression of the form M-419, which does not contain any segments of domain V, would not result in the change of the cell shape. Indeed, this was the case, indicating that the segment of domain V encompassing its first 15–20 residues is important for this activity. We tried to confirm this result by expressing a version of MARCO in which only this region is deleted (version Del 422–433). However, this protein did not appear on the cell surface (see below) but was apparently retained in the secretory pathway. Since the truncation M-419 did not promote any morphological changes, we wanted to ensure that it was still expressed on the cell surface. In order to examine this, cells were biotinylated with a membrane-impermeable reagent sulfo-NHS-biotin, after which biotinylated proteins were precipitated by streptavidin-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody recognizing the cytoplasmic domain of the MARCO protein. This experiment demonstrated that the form M-419 and the full-length MARCO were expressed at equal levels on the cell surface (not shown) and that some of the morphologically active truncations, such as M-436, are not as abundantly expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, along with the results obtained in the transfection studies with a plasmid encoding the H1 subunit of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor (see above), these results indicate that the morphological change is not a nonspecific effect, due only to overexpression of a cell-surface protein. In accordance with this conclusion, we have observed that cells change their morphology also when expression of MARCO is driven from a weak promoter, the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (not shown). To confirm that only cell-surface proteins were labeled by sulfo-NHS-biotin, we wanted to verify that paxillin, a component of focal adhesions at the inner site of the plasma membrane, was not precipitated by streptavidin-agarose. This was the case, even though an anti-paxillin antibody gave a strong signal with the total cell lysate (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, one of the MARCO truncations, Del 422–433, was not precipitated by streptavidin-agarose, although it was abundant in the total cell lysate. Thus, the absence of these two proteins, the MARCO form Del 422–433 and paxillin, in the streptavidin precipitates indicates that sulfo-NHS-biotin did not leak into cells during the course of the experiment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the MARCO-induced morphological change is not a nonspecific effect due to overexpression of a cell-surface protein and that the region of domain V before its first cysteine residue is important for this activity of MARCO. The observation that actin filaments were rearranged in the MARCO-expressing cells (Fig. 2) raised the question whether these cells still have intact focal adhesions. To examine this, transiently transfected CHO"
https://openalex.org/W1997662097,"In previous work (Weisburg, J. H., Curcio, M., Caron, P. C., Raghi, G., Mechetner, E. B., Roepe, P. D., and Scheinberg, D. A. (1996) J. Exp. Med. 183, 2699–2704), we showed that multidrug resistance (MDR) cells created by continuous selection with the vinca alkaloid vincristine (HL60 RV+) or by retroviral infection (K562/human MDR 1 cells) exhibited significant resistance to complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC). This resistance was due to the presence of overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-GP). In this paper, we probe the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon. We test whether the significant elevated intracellular pH (pHi) that accompanies P-GP overexpression is sufficient to confer resistance to CMC and whether this resistance is related to effects on complement function in the cell membrane. Control HL60 cells not expressing P-GP, but comparably elevated in cytosolic pHi by two independent methods (CO2“conditioning” or isotonic Cl− substitution), are tested for CMC using two different antibody-antigen systems (human IgG and murine IgM; protein and carbohydrate) and two complement sources (rabbit and human). Elevation of pHi by either of these methods or by expression of P-GP confers resistance to CMC. Resistance is not observed when the alkalinization mediated by reverse Cl−/HCO3− exchange upon Cl− substitution is blocked by treatment with dihydro-4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. Continuous photometric monitoring of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), to assess changes in pHi or efflux of the probe through MAC pores, in single cells or cell populations, respectively, verifies changes in pHi upon CO2 conditioning and Cl−substitution and release of BCECF upon formation of MAC pores. Antibody binding and internalization kinetics are similar in both the parental and resistant cell lines as measured by radioimmunoassay, but flow cytometric data showed that net complement deposition in the cell membrane is both delayed and reduced in magnitude in the MDR cells and in the cells with increased pHi. This interpretation is supported by comparison of BCECF release data for the different cells. Dual isotopic labeling of key complement components shows no significant change in molecular stoichiometry of the MACs formed at different pHi. The results are relevant to understanding clinical implications of MDR, the physiology of P-GP, and the biochemistry of the complement cascade and further suggest that the “drug pump” model of P-GP action cannot account for all of its effects. In previous work (Weisburg, J. H., Curcio, M., Caron, P. C., Raghi, G., Mechetner, E. B., Roepe, P. D., and Scheinberg, D. A. (1996) J. Exp.

Continuous photometric monitoring of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), to assess changes in pHi or efflux of the probe through MAC pores, in single cells or cell populations, respectively, verifies changes in pHi upon CO2 conditioning and Cl−substitution and release of BCECF upon formation of MAC pores. Antibody binding and internalization kinetics are similar in both the parental and resistant cell lines as measured by radioimmunoassay, but flow cytometric data showed that net complement deposition in the cell membrane is both delayed and reduced in magnitude in the MDR cells and in the cells with increased pHi. This interpretation is supported by comparison of BCECF release data for the different cells. Dual isotopic labeling of key complement components shows no significant change in molecular stoichiometry of the MACs formed at different pHi. The results are relevant to understanding clinical implications of MDR, the physiology of P-GP, and the biochemistry of the complement cascade and further suggest that the “drug pump” model of P-GP action cannot account for all of its effects. A tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) 1The abbreviations used are: MDR, multidrug resistance; pHi, intracellular pH; CMC, complement-mediated cytotoxicity; P-GP, P-glycoprotein; MAC, membrane attack complex; V m, membrane potential; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; H2DIDS, dihydro-4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2,2′-disulfonate. phenotype is frequently (but not always) due to the overexpression of themdr1 gene product, a 170–180-kDa glycoprotein known as P-glycoprotein (P-GP) or human MDR 1 protein (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). A careful distinction should be made between the MDR phenotype(s) observed in cells exposed to or selected with various chemotherapeutic drugs versusthe phenotype mediated solely by P-GP overexpression (2Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Roepe P.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). One hypothesis proposed to explain the contribution of P-GP to MDR is the “drug pump” model, in which P-GP hydrolyzes ATP to actively efflux a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and epipodophyllotoxins out of the cell against a concentration gradient (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 3Reutz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this model accounts for some of the properties of MDR cells, it fails to explain resistance to complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) observed in some MDR cells (4Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghi G. Mechetner E.B. Roepe P.D. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and other phenomena (reviewed in Ref. 5Roepe P.D. Wei L.-Y. Hoffman M.M. Fritz F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Many investigators working to improve cancer therapy have proposed that immunologic approaches to killing cancer cells (such as CMC) might circumvent chemotherapeutic drug resistance. One of the assumptions of an immunological approach to the treatment of cancer is that cells that are resistant to cytotoxic drugs (e.g. MDR tumor cells) should not be cross-resistant to immunotherapy, since the mechanisms of cytotoxicity are so widely different. Because complement mediates cytotoxicity via mechanisms directed to the outside surface of the cell, the protective functions of P-GP overexpression in MDR tumor cells should not be expected to be relevant to conferring resistance to CMC; i.e., antibody molecule juxtapositioning following binding to specific antigen initiates the complement cascade, culminating in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). When MACs are inserted into the plasma membrane of the cell, nonspecific pores as large as 100 Å in diameter are formed, causing cell lysis (6Tschopp J. Engel A. Podack E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1922-1928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously, however, that a MDR HL60 variant (HL60 RV+), selected on vincristine that also overexpresses P-GP is resistant to CMC relative to the parental HL60 myeloid leukemia cells. Differences in killing were independent of antibody isotype (either IgG and IgM) and target antigen. Resistance to CMC was also observed in K562 cells overexpressing P-GP via retroviral infection and not preselected with chemotherapeutic drugs. The immunological resistance in both MDR cell lines was reversed by the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the F(ab′)2 fragments of the P-GP-inactivating monoclonal antibody UIC2. These data are consistent with P-GP overexpression mediating resistance to CMC. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of this resistance phenomenon is important, because frequently invoked models for how P-GP contributes to MDR (e.g. the “drug pump” models) do not provide a framework for explaining P-GP-mediated resistance to CMC. MDR cells typically have elevated intracellular pH (pHi) and decreased plasma membrane potential (V m) (7Keizer A.G. Joenje H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Thiebaut F. Currier S.J. Waitaker J. Haugland R.P. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Willingham M.C. J. Histochem.

Cytol. 1997; 171: 121-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this is apparently due to P-GP overexpression and not exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs (2Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Roepe P.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hence, another model for P-GP's action (frequently referred to as the altered partitioning model) suggests that alterations in pHi and/or V m that accompany the overexpression of P-GP indirectly affect partitioning of chemotherapeutic drugs, but P-GP does not directly pump them (5Roepe P.D. Wei L.-Y. Hoffman M.M. Fritz F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Roepe P.D.

This model may offer a more reasonable framework for addressing resistance to CMC in MDR cells. Higgins, Sepulveda, and colleagues (13Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 14Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Valverde M.A. Mintenig G.M. Sepulveda F.V.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have suggested that P-GP may translocate Cl− directly or indirectly. Cytosolic Cl− concentration and Cl− plasma membrane permeability are generally important in maintaining pHi andV m for eukaryotic cells. Altered Cl−permeability and altered pHi in MDR cells may indeed be connected in some fashion, since recent Cl− substitution experiments revealed unusual and extensive pHi changes in human MDR 1 transfectants (16Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11153-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overexpression of P-GP inhibits Cl− and HCO3−-dependent pHihomeostasis, and this is apparently due to specific inhibition of (or competition against) Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchange (anion exchange (10Luz J.G. Wei L.-Y. Basu S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11153-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Roepe P.D. Weisburg J.H. Luz J.G. Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11008-11015Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). HL60 cells are known to possess Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity (18Restrepo D. Kozody D.J. Spinelli L.J. Knouf P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 489-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), so P-GP expression in these cells would be expected to perturb pHi. Thus, in this study we examined complement resistance in the HL60/RV+ system and its relationship to pHiperturbations. Two independent approaches (Cl−/gluconate exchange and CO2 conditioning) were used to alkalinize control HL60 cells not expressing P-GP. Intracellular alkalization of HL60 cells conferred CMC resistance similar to that measured for the RV+ cells expressing P-GP. Resistance did not develop when intracellular alkalinization upon Cl−/gluconate exchange was prevented via inhibition of the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger due to the addition of dihydro-4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (H2DIDS). Furthermore, the pHi changes did not appear to change antibody binding and modulation kinetics but did appear to have effects on complement membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition. The final step of the complement cascade is formation of MACs, which are large pores in the plasma membrane of the cell that destroy osmotic balance and lead to cell lysis. MACs consist of five interacting proteins (C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9) that, when sequentially activated upon antibody binding to the target cell, expose hydrophobic residues and insert into the membrane. Association of these five proteins within the membrane leads to formation of nonspecific trans-membraneous channels (19Müller-Eberhard H.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 20Esser A.F. Chapman D. Biological Membranes. 4. Academic Press, Inc., London1982: 277-325Google Scholar). “Sublytic” dilute concentrations of complement proteins may form precursors of the full MAC (e.g.“partial MACs”) that are more specific with regard to transport properties and perhaps even voltage-regulated (21Ramm L.E. Whitlow M.B. Mayer M.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1143-1146PubMed Google Scholar). The pore diameter of the completely assembled MAC is variable and is essentially determined by the number of C9 molecules that contribute to pore formation. MAC stoichiometry is described as (C5b,C6,C7,C8)1C9n, where n = 9–18. We measured the formation of functional pores with different characteristics by continuous monitoring of fluorescence methods (9Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12555-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and determined the molecular stoichiometry of MAC structure by purification of MAC complexes harboring radiolabeled subunits. The data suggest that increased pHi reduces the rate of formation of functional “full MACs” (i.e.(C5b-C8)1(C9)n > 9 complexes) in the cell membrane of target cells. The results have important consequences for better understanding the role of P-GP overexpression and chemotherapeutic drug exposure in tumor resistance phenomena. They also define an important biochemical parameter for efficient manipulation of immune mediated killing and the study of the terminal complement cascade. 2′,7′-Bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) and nigericin were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); H2DIDS was purchased from Sigma; and baby rabbit complement was purchased from Pel Freez (Brown Deer, WI). All were used without additional purification. Cell-Tak was from Becton Dickenson and was used as described by the manufacturer. Human complement (plasma) was obtained from normal donors. HL60 cells (acute myeloid leukemia, CD15+, and CD33+) were maintained at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. HL60/RV+ (a P-GP-overexpressing MDR HL60 variant selected by continuous exposure to vincristine) was the generous gift of Dr. Melvin Center (Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS) and was provided by Dr. Ellin Berman (Memorial Hospital). RV+ cells were grown in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and in the presence of 120 mm (0.1 mg/ml) vincristine (Lilly) to maintain the MDR phenotype. These cells were cultured without vincristine for one passage prior to experiments. This practice did not reduce MDR or the level of P-GP expression. The humanized monoclonal antibody M195 was prepared as described (22Scheinberg D.A. Tanimoto M. McKenzie S. Strife A. Old L.J. Clarkson B.D. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 440-445PubMed Google Scholar,23Caron P.C. Co M.S. Bull M.K. Avdalovic N.M. Queen C. Scheinberg D.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6761-6767PubMed Google Scholar), and M31, a murine anti-CD15 antibody, was established at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 2D. A. Scheinberg and M. Tanimoto, unpublished results. Rabbit anti-human anti-C5b-9 antibody was purchased form Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). As described previously (10Luz J.G. Wei L.-Y. Basu S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11153-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Wei L.-Y. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1642-C1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have constructed a single cell photometry apparatus using a Nikon diaphot epifluorescence microscope and a Photon Technology alpha-scan fluorometer. For BCECF experiments, a 510-nm dichroic and 530-nm bandpass filter was positioned beneath the stage, and the excitation monochromator was flipped between 439 and 490 nm by the computer (see Ref. 24Wei L.-Y. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1642-C1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein for additional detail). Cells (1.0 × 106) were washed and resuspended in 200 μl of a solution consisting of 50 μl RPMI 1640 and 150 μl sterile filtered HBSS (118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 24.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm glucose). The cells were incubated with 5 μm BCECF-AM for 20 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Next, the cells were adhered to glass coverslips (Corning Glassworks, 18 mm2/0.11-mm thick) using Cell Tak (Becton Dickenson) and incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and in the continued presence of BCECF-AM. Coverslips were then mounted in a home-built perfusion chamber (10Luz J.G. Wei L.-Y. Basu S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and continuously perfused at a constant rate (approximately 5 ml/min) with HBSS buffer equilibrated with 5% CO2 and to 37 °C. Uniform BCECF staining was verified visually and by monitoring the intensity of 490 nm excitation (535 emission) and was found to be similar between the cell lines. Excitation was limited to the time of data collection to limit photobleaching. HBSS was continuously purged with 5% CO2, and a fine jet of 5% CO2 was directed over the mounted coverslip to maintain buffer pH, which was monitored with a microelectrode. Calibration of intracellular BCECF was by the K+/nigericin titration approach (25Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar), but in single cell mode (10Luz J.G. Wei L.-Y. Basu S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11153-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Wei L.-Y. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1642-C1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), wherein HBSS harboring nigericin was continuously flowed over the cells. Steady state pHi was calculated using the best fit to the calibration data (described in detail in Ref.2Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Roepe P.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To elevate pHi of the control HL60 cells, which do not express measurable P-GP (8Thiebaut F. Currier S.J. Waitaker J. Haugland R.P. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Willingham M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), two approaches were used. First, HL60 cells underwent elevation of pHi by manipulation of external CO2 as described (2Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Roepe P.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown at 5% CO2 in normal RPMI 1640; shifted to a 10% CO2atmosphere, which causes rapid acidification of the medium; and then grown in this atmosphere for 2–7 days. The “acid-conditioned” cells were then placed back in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in the presence of fresh pre-equilibrated (to 5% CO2) medium for 1 or 2 h. As described (Ref. 2Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Roepe P.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; see “Results”) this results in an “overshoot” of pHi, since alkalinizing mechanisms induced by growth at 10% CO2are still functioning (at least for several hours) in the reduced CO2 environment. Detailed analysis of the conditioning method is presented in Ref. 2Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Roepe P.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. Alternatively, pHi was elevated by Cl−substitution as described (10Luz J.G. Wei L.-Y. Basu S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11153-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Wei L.-Y. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1642-C1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a 10-min perfusion, normal HBSS perfusate was rapidly replaced with Cl−-free HBSS (gluconate isotonically replacing Cl−). Control experiments (not shown) showed that excess glutamate tended to inhibit the complement cascade (see Ref. 26Asshar S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1984; 36: 223-244PubMed Google Scholar), so gluconate was preferred in isotonic Cl− substitution. Long term Cl−substitution experiments performed essentially as described (16Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11153-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) verified that HL60 cells remained at an alkaline pHi under these perfusion conditions during the duration of a typical complement cytotoxicity assay (about 30 min; see “Results”). To examine whether anion exchange was responsible for the alkalization of the cells under these Cl− substitution conditions, H2DIDS, a well known anion exchange inhibitor, was added to the cells at various concentrations (250 μm to 1 mm) after loading with BCECF. The cells were incubated with the H2DIDS for 20 min at 37 °C, and isotonic Cl−/gluconate exchange was performed as above in the presence of CO2/HCO3− to examine any inhibition of Cl−/HCO3− exchange (see “Results”). Complement-mediated cytotoxicity assays were conducted essentially as described by Weisburg et al. (4Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghi G. Mechetner E.B. Roepe P.D. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) except that cells were washed to remove all medium and resuspended in HBSS pre-equilibrated to 37 °C and pH 7.30 (by perfusion with 5% CO2). The cells were allowed to equilibrate in HBSS containing 5% fetal calf serum for 10 min and then plated for the cytotoxicity measurements (4Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghi G. Mechetner E.B. Roepe P.D. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the Cl−-free HBSS experiments, the cells were pretreated with HBSS as above, washed with Cl-free HBSS to remove Cl−, and then resuspended in Cl−-free HBSS at 37 °C, pH 7.30, with 5% fetal calf serum. Antibody and complement dilutions were made in either HBSS or Cl−-free HBSS as appropriate. To examine if Cl−/HCO3−exchanger function was involved in any resistance to complement when the cells were suspended in Cl−-free HBSS, cells were treated with H2DIDS prior to the CMC assay. HL60 cells were washed free of medium, resuspended in HBSS plus H2DIDS (concentrations ranged from 250 μm to 1 mm), and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were washed with Cl−-free HBSS and then plated for cytotoxicity with an amount of antibody and complement known from previous experiments to yield approximately 50% killing (see “Results”). Proteins were iodinated using the Cloramine T method and purified by size exclusion chromatography (27Tanimoto M. Scheinberg D.A. Cardon-Cardo C. Huie D. Clarkson B.D. Old L.J. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar). HL60 and RV+ cells were washed and resuspended to a concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml. 125I-HuM195 was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. At 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 h, a 200-μl aliquot of cells was removed and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of stripping buffer (50 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.8), allowed to incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm in a Sorvall GLC 2B centrifuge. Counts/min in the supernatant fluid (containing cell surface Ig eluted by acid wash) and the cell pellet (containing internalized Ig) were then quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (Packard). 1.0 × 107 HL60 or RV+ cells were washed with RPMI medium. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 800 μl of a 1:10 dilution of M31 antibody and 800 μl of a 1:3 dilution of human serum. In control tubes, medium was added instead of the human serum. The cells plus antibody and serum were incubated at 37 °C. At 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min of incubation, a 160-μl aliquot was removed, and 2 ml of stripping buffer (see above) was added. This was done to prevent the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse fluoroscein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody) from reacting nonspecifically with the IgM (murine M31 antibody) bound to the cell surface. The cells were incubated with stripping buffer for 10 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 750 × g and 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde and allowed to incubate on ice for 15 min in order to fix the MACs. The paraformaldehyde was removed by washing three times with PBS, and an anti-MAC (C5b-9) antibody was then added to the cells. This antibody binds to the neoepitope of C9 that forms during polymerization, but it does not react with free C9. Anti-C5b-9 antibody was incubated with the cells for 30 min on ice, unbound antibody was then removed by washing the cells with PBS, and goat anti-mouse-IgG-fluoroscein isothiocyanate was added and allowed to bind to primary antibody for 45 min on ice and in the dark. The cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed on an EPICS-Profile II flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Cell viability of the samples collected at 30 min was determined by trypan blue exclusion. In some experiments, pHi was first altered by CO2pulse. 1.0 × 107 HL60 cells were CO2-pulsed for 2 h before examining the kinetics of MAC formation and were washed in pre-equilibrated RPMI medium at 5% CO2. The cells were diluted in M31 antibody and human complement and allowed to incubate at 37 °C as above. As a control, cells were diluted in antibody and medium without complement but otherwise subjected to similar treatment. At 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after the addition of antibody and complement, a 160-μl aliquot was removed from the reaction tube and evaluated as described above. Proteins were iodinated using the chloramine-T method and purified by size exclusion chromatography (27Tanimoto M. Scheinberg D.A. Cardon-Cardo C. Huie D. Clarkson B.D. Old L.J. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar). C9 was labeled with 125I; C7 was labeled with 131I. We modified the protocol previously published by Ware and colleagues (28Ware C.F. Wetsel R.A. Kolb W.P. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 5.0 × 108 HL60 cells were washed three times with HBSS, pH 7.30, to remove all growth media. Next, the cells were resuspended in HBSS plus 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. For Cl−-free conditions, the HL60 cells were then washed two times with Cl−-free HBSS (equimolar gluconate substituted for Cl−) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to allow the pHi of the cells to stabilize. After this incubation period, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a 1:13 dilution of M31 monoclonal antibody and a 1:3 dilution of human serum as a complement source. A tracer amount of131I-C7 (9.50 × 108 cpm, specific activity = 2.80 × 104 cpm/ng) and125I-C9 (8.50 × 108 cpm, specific activity = 3.20 × 104 cpm/ng) was also added. The cells, antibody, complement, and radiolabeled complement components were incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. After this incubation, cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Relaxation buffer (2.5 m KCl, 1 m MgCl2, 1m NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) plus 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin to a final concentration of 100,000 units/ml was added to the cells.

The function of PSI-H was characterized in Arabidopsis plants transformed with apsaH cDNA in sense orientation. Cosuppressed plants containing less than 3% PSI-H are smaller than wild type when grown on sterile media but are similar to wild type under optimal conditions. PSI complexes lacking PSI-H contain 50% PSI-L, whereas other PSI subunits accumulate in wild type amounts. PSI devoid of PSI-H has only 61% NADP+ photoreduction activity compared with wild type and is highly unstable in the presence of urea as determined from flash-induced absorbance changes at 834 nm. Our data show that PSI-H is required for stable accumulation of PSI and efficient electron transfer in the complex. The plants lacking PSI-H compensate for the less efficient PSI with a 15% increase in the P700/chlorophyll ratio, and this compensation is sufficient to prevent overreduction of the plastoquinone pool as evidenced by normal photochemical quenching of fluorescence. Nonphotochemical quenching is approximately 60% of the wild type value, suggesting that the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is decreased in the absence of PSI-H.

Photosystem I (PSI) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LHC, light harvesting complex; Chl, chlorophyll.1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LHC, light harvesting complex; Chl, chlorophyll. is a pigment-protein complex that mediates the light-driven electron transport across the thylakoid membrane from the soluble electron donor, plastocyanin, to the soluble electron acceptor, ferredoxin. PSI from plants contains 13 different subunits of which three are only found in plants, namely PSI-G, PSI-H, and PSI-N. The remaining 10 subunits are shared between cyanobacteria and plants. In addition to the 13 subunits of PSI in a narrow sense, plants contain light harvesting complex I (LHCI), which is composed of four different polypeptides, Lhca1–4, that are specifically associated with PSI (1Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar,2Scheller H.V. Naver H. Møller B.L. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 842-851Crossref Google Scholar). The PSI-A/B heterodimer coordinates the reaction center P700 (a chlorophyll (Chl) a dimer) and the electron acceptors A0 (Chl a), A1 (phylloquinone), and FX (a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster). The terminal electron acceptors FA and FB are [4Fe-4S] clusters bound to the stromal PSI-C subunit (3Høj P.B. Svendsen I. Scheller H.V. Møller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12676-12684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).The 10 common subunits are highly conserved from cyanobacteria to plants apart from the presence of extended N- termini of PSI-D, -E, -F, and - L from plants. The role of specific subunits in PSI has mostly been investigated by gene knock-out studies in cyanobacteria and algae. However, despite the sequence similarities, PSI subunits of cyanobacteria and plants show important functional differences. For example, the plant-specific N terminus of PSI-F plays a role in supporting plastocyanin-mediated donation of electrons to P700+ (5Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joilot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In cyanobacterial PSI, this electron transfer mostly follows a simple second order reaction, whereas a stable plastocyanin-PSI complex is formed in plants before electron transfer (6Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PSI-L is essential for formation of PSI trimers in cyanobacteria (7Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but plant PSI complexes are not assembled in trimers, and the function of PSI-L in plants is thus far unsolved. Finally, the N-terminal extension of the PSI-D subunit is important for the stable binding of PSI-C (8Naver H. Scott M.P. Andersen B. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 19-26Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PSI-C is anchored to the PSI-A/B heterodimer directly through a domain of eight amino acid residues (9Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H.

Treatment with chaotropic agents selectively dissociates the extrinsic subunits PSI-C, -D, and -E, but a much harsher and more prolonged treatment is required to dissociate these subunits from plant PSI compared with cyanobacterial PSI.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 268-272Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The role of the three plant-specific subunits is less understood than the role of the 10 common subunits. PSI-N is a luminal protein, and very recent data have shown a function of this subunit in the interaction with plastocyanin (14Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; (in press): 17Google Scholar). The PSI-H protein is membrane intrinsic and has a molecular mass of about 10 kDa. PSI-H can be cross-linked with PSI-D, PSI-I, and PSI-L, and the three membrane intrinsic subunits are positioned peripherally in the model of the plant PSI complex with PSI-L and -I located on the outside (15Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The properties of PSI-H combined with the relatively high stability of plant PSI have led us to suggest that the role of the N terminus of PSI-D in stability is mediated through an interaction with the PSI-H subunit (8Naver H. Scott M.P. Andersen B. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 19-26Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because light-harvesting chlorophylla/b-binding proteins are only present in plants and not in cyanobacteria, an alternative suggestion for the function of PSI-H has been an involvement in the interaction with LHCI (17Scheller H.V. Møller B.L. Physiol. Plant. 1990; 78: 484-494Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the topological studies indicate that such a function is less likely because PSI-H appears not to be in close contact with any LHCI protein (16Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).To investigate the role of PSI-H we transformed Arabidopsisplants with a psaH cDNA in sense orientation under the control of a constitutive promoter. Cosuppressed transformants with undetectable levels of PSI-H were obtained. The down-regulated plants were analyzed with several methods both at the biochemical and leaf level. We conclude that PSI-H is essential for efficient electron flow in the PSI complex. Furthermore, PSI-H is required for interaction with PSI-L, stabilization of FX, and the overall stability of the PSI complex.DISCUSSIONThe cosuppression strategy in Arabidopsis was successful and yielded plants without detectable PSI-H. This results has enabled us to investigate the function of the PSI-H subunitin vivo as well as in vitro. Although the approach was successful, the frequency of substantial down-regulation in the transformed plants was low, and no plants lacking PSI-H were obtained in the T1 generation. It has previously been reported that down-regulation of LHCII in an antisense approach was not observed, although the mRNA level was reduced to extremely low levels (28Flachmann R. Kühlbrandt W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, down-regulation of the PSI-N subunit was very efficient in a similar cosuppression and antisense approach (14Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; (in press): 17Google Scholar), and the successful down-regulation of the LHCI subunit Lhca4 by an antisense approach was recently reported (29Zhang H. Goodman H.M. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Possibly, the difficulty in obtaining down-regulation of PSI-H is related to the presence of two expressed copies of psaH inArabidopsis. In contrast, PSI-N is expressed from a single gene. Gene knock-out by homologous recombination is an excellent way of studying the role of PSI subunits in cyanobacteria. However, in plants this technique is not yet straightforward. The present results show that PSI subunits can be efficiently down-regulated in plants by cosuppression. Thus, this approach can be very useful in dissecting the role of individual components of PSI.During growth on sterile medium, plants without PSI-H showed pronounced stunting of growth and yellowing of leaves (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, however, no difference in visual appearance of the plants was seen when pants were grown in soil. Only plants grown in soil were used for biochemical and physiological studies.Forward Electron Transport Is Decreased in Plants Lacking PSI-HSteady state electron transport is clearly decreased in PSI lacking PSI-H. The decrease does not appear to be due to heterogeneity of PSI in the absence of PSI-H because there is no difference at low ferredoxin concentration. The interaction between ferredoxin and PSI is kinetically complex (12Diaz-Quintana A. Leibl W. Bottin H. Setif P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3429-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Setif P.Q.Y. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ferredoxin forms a complex with PSI in both the reduced and oxidized form. Intracomplex electron transfer is heterogeneous and takes place with several different time constants. At ferredoxin concentrations below the dissociation constant for the PSI-ferredoxin complex, the limiting factor for electron transfer is the second order rate constant. Thus, this rate constant appears to be unaltered in PSI lacking PSI-H. At higher ferredoxin concentration, intracomplex electron transfer may become limiting, and the lower rate in the absence of PSI-H suggests that intracomplex electron transfer is affected. This may be due to different rate constants of transfer or to different relative contributions of the different time constants. The situation in PSI lacking PSI-H may resemble the situation in cyanobacterial PSI where the rate of ferredoxin reduction is much lower than in plant PSI, at least in a large fraction of complexes (30Setif P.Q.Y. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In principle, the difference at high ferredoxin concentration could also be due to another limiting step in electron transfer. However, we find this unlikely. Forward electron transfer from P700 to FA/FB is very fast compared with the rates of NADP+ reduction, and the interaction between plastocyanin and PSI appears to be largely governed by PSI-F and PSI-N. Nevertheless, further detailed investigations of different steps of electron transport will be necessary to determine the precise mechanism by which PSI-H affects electron transport. A likely explanation is that lack of PSI-H perturbs the binding of PSI-D and PSI-C, causing a less productive binding of ferredoxin.Plants Lacking PSI-H Accumulate More PSIThe plants devoid of PSI-H have compensated by synthesizing more PSI as evidenced by the 15% lower Chl/P700 ratio. This compensation is sufficient under optimal conditions, where lack of PSI-H had little impact on plant growth. The lower efficiency of PSI might be expected to lead to overreduction of the electron transport components connecting PSI and PSII. However, again the compensation seems sufficient because no significant increase in qP was observed. Furthermore, the size of the functional PSI antenna is identical in plants with and without PSI-H, at least in state 1 (25Naver H. Haldrup A. Gilpin M. Scheller H.V. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998: 631-634Google Scholar). Plants lacking PSI-H show less nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence, which may indicate a smaller transthylakoidal proton gradient. A smaller proton gradient could result from less overall electron transport. However, because the plants do not exhibit differences in growth, we do not think that this is likely. Alternatively, the less efficient reduction of ferredoxin may lead to altered redox levels in the stroma with a resulting decrease in cyclic electron transport and therefore a decrease in proton pumping. Finally, it may be imagined that lack of PSI-H lead to altered permeability of the membrane for protons.The lower scope for PSI activity and the lower nonphotochemical quenching in the absence of PSI-H may have little significance under optimal and constant growth conditions. However, under photoinhibitory conditions it may be predicted that plants lacking PSI-H would suffer more severely from overreduction of plastoquinone. Other stress condition such as low light intensity or conditions where the demand for ATP is increased may also be expected to lead to more severely affected plants.PSI-H Stabilizes PSIA substantial decrease in stability of PSI was observed in thylakoids from plants without PSI-H. The relative instability resembles the situation in cyanobacteria, where urea has a much faster and stronger effect on PSI than in plants. We have hypothesized that PSI-H interacts with the N-terminal extension of PSI-D which is important for the high stability of plant PSI (8Naver H. Scott M.P. Andersen B. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 19-26Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The lower stability of the PSI complex lacking PSI-H is therefore in good agreement with the hypothesis. Future experiments with in vitro reconstitution in the presence or absence of PSI-H should allow us to test the hypothesis further and investigate the interaction of PSI-H with PSI-D and other subunits in detail. The instability of FX and earlier acceptors was a surprising result because PSI-H is unlikely to be directly involved in coordinating electron acceptors. Possibly, lack of PSI-H leads to a general instability of the PSI complex in the presence of urea and a progressive disintegration of the entire complex. Although the instability of PSI was easily observed in the in vitro experiments, no severe disintegration of the PSI complex appears to take place during normal growth because all electron acceptors were functional in the thylakoids lacking PSI-H. However, the partial lack of PSI-L suggests a lower stability of the complex also under in vivo conditions. Possibly, more severe disintegration of PSI could occur under certain stress conditions, e.g. heat stress. Because PSI-L content is decreased, it can be speculated whether the role of PSI-H in electron transport is mediated through PSI-L. We find this unlikely because PSI-L is relatively far removed from the site of interaction of the soluble electron transfer proteins (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, experiments with plants lacking only PSI-L will be required to address this issue.ConclusionIn summary, PSI-H has been shown to be not important for LHCI interaction with PSI (25Naver H. Haldrup A. Gilpin M. Scheller H.V. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998: 631-634Google Scholar) but to be essential for efficient electron transfer of PSI and for stability of the PSI complex. The cyanobacterial PSI complex is dissociated eight times faster in the monomeric than in the trimeric form as shown by urea treatment of monomers and trimers (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Luneberg J. Fromme P. Jekow P. Schlodder E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plant PSI is a monomer that is more stable upon urea treatment than the trimeric cyanobacterial PSI (8Naver H. Scott M.P. Andersen B. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 19-26Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The peripheral antenna in cyanobacteria consists of extrinsic phycobiliproteins. In contrast, plants have adopted a different antenna consisting of membrane intrinsic Chl a/b-binding proteins, i.e. LHCI and LHCII. It can be speculated that the trimeric structure of PSI was abandoned as LHCI became associated with PSI in plants, and this resulted in a need for stabilizing the now monomeric PSI complex. PSI-H may have evolved simultaneously, fulfilling the role as a stabilizing factor. Photosystem I (PSI) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LHC, light harvesting complex; Chl, chlorophyll.1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LHC, light harvesting complex; Chl, chlorophyll. is a pigment-protein complex that mediates the light-driven electron transport across the thylakoid membrane from the soluble electron donor, plastocyanin, to the soluble electron acceptor, ferredoxin.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, down-regulation of the PSI-N subunit was very efficient in a similar cosuppression and antisense approach (14Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; (in press): 17Google Scholar), and the successful down-regulation of the LHCI subunit Lhca4 by an antisense approach was recently reported (29Zhang H. Goodman H.M. Jansson S.

Thus, this approach can be very useful in dissecting the role of individual components of PSI.During growth on sterile medium, plants without PSI-H showed pronounced stunting of growth and yellowing of leaves (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, however, no difference in visual appearance of the plants was seen when pants were grown in soil. Only plants grown in soil were used for biochemical and physiological studies.Forward Electron Transport Is Decreased in Plants Lacking PSI-HSteady state electron transport is clearly decreased in PSI lacking PSI-H. The decrease does not appear to be due to heterogeneity of PSI in the absence of PSI-H because there is no difference at low ferredoxin concentration. The interaction between ferredoxin and PSI is kinetically complex (12Diaz-Quintana A. Leibl W. Bottin H. Setif P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3429-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Setif P.Q.Y. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9059-9070Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ferredoxin forms a complex with PSI in both the reduced and oxidized form. Intracomplex electron transfer is heterogeneous and takes place with several different time constants. At ferredoxin concentrations below the dissociation constant for the PSI-ferredoxin complex, the limiting factor for electron transfer is the second order rate constant. Thus, this rate constant appears to be unaltered in PSI lacking PSI-H. At higher ferredoxin concentration, intracomplex electron transfer may become limiting, and the lower rate in the absence of PSI-H suggests that intracomplex electron transfer is affected. This may be due to different rate constants of transfer or to different relative contributions of"
https://openalex.org/W2029308107,"It has recently been shown that macrophage proliferation occurs during the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and that oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) stimulates macrophage growth. Possible mechanisms for this include the interaction of oxidized LDL with integral plasma membrane proteins coupled to signaling pathways, the release of growth factors and autocrine activation of growth factor receptors, or the potentiation of mitogenic signal transduction by a component of oxidized LDL after internalization. The present study was undertaken to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the growth-stimulating effect of oxidized LDL in macrophages. Only extensively oxidized LDL caused significant growth stimulation, whereas mildly oxidized LDL, native LDL, and acetyl LDL were ineffective. LDL that had been methylated before oxidation (to block lysine derivatization by oxidation products and thereby prevent the formation of a scavenger receptor ligand) did not promote growth, even though extensive lipid peroxidation had occurred. The growth stimulation could not be attributed to lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) because incubation of oxidized LDL with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin resulted in a 97% decrease in lyso-PC content but only a 20% decrease in mitogenic activity. Similarly, treatment of acetyl LDL with phospholipase A2 converted more than 90% of the initial content of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lyso-PC, but the phospholipase A2-treated acetyl LDL was nearly 10-fold less potent than oxidized LDL at stimulating growth. Platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists partly inhibited growth stimulation by oxidized LDL, but platelet-activating factor itself did not induce growth. Digestion of oxidized LDL with phospholipase A2 resulted in the hydrolysis of PC and oxidized PC but did not attenuate growth induction. Native LDL, treated with autoxidized arachidonic acid under conditions that caused extensive modification of lysine residues by lipid peroxidation products but did not result in oxidation of LDL lipids, was equal to oxidized LDL in potency at stimulating macrophage growth. Albumin modified by arachidonic acid peroxidation products also stimulated growth, demonstrating that LDL lipids are not essential for this effect. These findings suggest that oxidatively modified apolipoprotein B is the main growth-stimulating component of oxidized LDL, but that oxidized phospholipids may play a secondary role."
https://openalex.org/W1980579448,"Guanylate cyclase regulator protein (GCAP)-2 is a Ca2+-binding protein that regulates photoreceptor outer segment membrane guanylate cyclase (RetGC) in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. GCAP-2 activates RetGC at free Ca2+ concentrations below 100 nm, characteristic of light-adapted photoreceptors, and inhibits RetGC when free Ca2+ concentrations are above the 500 nmlevel, characteristic of dark-adapted photoreceptors. We have mapped functional domains in GCAP-2 by using deletion mutants and chimeric proteins in which parts of GCAP-2 were substituted with corresponding fragments of other closely related recoverin-like proteins that do not regulate RetGC. We find that in addition to the EF-hand Ca2+-binding centers there are three regions that contain GCAP-2-specific sequences essential for regulation of RetGC. 1) The region between Phe78 and Asp113 determines whether GCAP-2 activates outer segment RetGC in low or high Ca2+ concentrations. Substitution of this domain with the corresponding region from neurocalcin causes a paradoxical behavior of the chimeric proteins. They activate RetGC only at high and not at low Ca2+ concentrations. 2) The amino acid sequence of GCAP-2 between Lys29 and Phe48 that includes the EF-hand-related motif EF-1 is essential both for activation of RetGC at low Ca2+ and inhibition at high Ca2+concentrations. Most of the remaining N-terminal region can be substituted with recoverin or neurocalcin sequences without loss of GCAP-2 function. 3) Region Val171–Asn189, adjacent to the C-terminal EF-4 contributes to activation of RetGC, but it is not essential for the ability of Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 to inhibit RetGC. Other regions of the molecule can be substituted with the corresponding fragments from neurocalcin or recoverin, or even partially deleted without preventing GCAP-2 from regulating RetGC. Substitution of these three domains in GCAP-2 with corresponding neurocalcin sequences also affects activation of individual recombinant RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 expressed in HEK293 cells.

Ca2+ enters outer segments (OS) of vertebrate photoreceptors through cGMP-gated Na+/Ca2+channels in the plasma membranes. These channels are open in the dark, but light closes them by stimulating cGMP hydrolysis. Channel closure lowers the intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations in rods from 700 nm to near 30 nm (1Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Cornwall M.C. Fain G.L. J. Gen.

GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 each have four EF-hand-like domains including three functional EF-hands that bind Ca2+ ions.

Despite their functional and structural homology, GCAP-2 and GCAP-1 appear to be different in several aspects. 1) The only significant sequence homology between GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 is within their EF-hands. 2) A naturally occurring point mutation Y99C in GCAP-1 that was linked to human cone degeneration (18Payne A.M. Downes S.M. Bessant D.A.R. Taylor R. Holder G.E. Warren M.J. Bird A.C. Bhattachraya S.S. Hum. Mol.

Goraczniak R.M. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 178: 251-259Google Scholar) reported that GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 may interact with two different sites on RetGC. The goal of this study was to define major regulatory domain(s) of GCAP-2 using its deletion and chimera mutants. We find that in addition to the previously characterized EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains, there are three regions in GCAP-2 that cannot be deleted or substituted without loss of function. One of these regions determines that the Ca2+-free form of GCAP-2 activates, and the Ca2+-bound form inhibits RetGC activity in photoreceptor membranes. Chimera DNAs were constructed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and “splicing by overlap extension.” DNA fragments with chimeric termini were first amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), appropriate cDNAs (neurocalcin-δ cDNA was a gift from D. Ladant) as templates and PCR primers based on the sequences of GCAP-2, neurocalcin, or recoverin cDNAs. The fragments were purified from agarose gel using QIAEX II resin (QIAGEN) and spliced together by a second round of PCR according to the splicing by overlap extension technique (24Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 217-250Google Scholar). The resulting DNA fragments were ligated into theNcoI/BamHI sites of the pET11d vector (Novagen). DNA sequence of the resulting constructs were verified by an automated DNA sequences using the ABI Prism system (Perkin-Elmer). Deletion mutants were constructed by a similar approach except the second round of PCR was only used to splice fragments of DNA in order to introduce the internal deletions. Wild type and deletion mutants of bovine GCAP-2 and GCAP-2/neurocalcin chimeric proteins were expressed in E. coli from pET11d vector (Novagen) according to the procedures described previously in full detail (22Olshevskaya E.V.

All chimeras were predominantly in myristoylated form except for the chimeras XX and XXI. Washed bovine outer segment membranes depleted of endogenous activator and containing both RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 were prepared, reconstituted with recombinant GCAPs, and assayed as described previously (6Dizhoor A.M.

Experiments were conducted under infrared light using two 15 W safety lights equipped with Kodak number 11 infrared filters at a distance of 50 cm and Excalibur dual high performance GEN II+ tube (PVS-5c) goggles. A typical reaction mixture contained 5 μm GCAP-2 or its chimera constructs in 25 μl of 50 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 60 mmKCl, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Ca/EGTA buffer, 10 μm each of dipyridamole and zaprinast, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 4 mm cGMP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, 0.1 μCi of [3H]cGMP, and washed bovine outer segment membranes (3.5 μg of rhodopsin). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 12 min at 30 °C, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, chilled on ice, centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and analyzed by TLC on polyethylenimine cellulose plastic-backed plates with fluorescent background (Merck). After development in 0.2 m LiCl, cGMP spots were visualized under UV illumination, cut, eluted with 1 ml of 2m LiCl, shaken with 10 ml of an Ecolume scintillation mixture (ICN) and both 3H and 32P radioactivity were counted. [3H]cGMP was used as an internal standard to ensure the absence of cGMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase. In all experiments time course of reaction was linear in time and less than 10% of GTP substrate was converted into cGMP. Basal activity of RetGC in different preparations of washed OS membranes typically varied between 2.5 and 5 nmol of cGMP/min/mg of rhodopsin. In the absence of protein activators the difference between RetGC basal activity measured at 6 nm and 1 μm free Ca2+did not exceed 20%. Data that are shown in every figure pertain to a single experiment using one preparation of washed OS membranes, they are representative of two or three similar independent experiments.

However, most of the sequence identity between GCAPs derives from their EF-hands and there is almost no sequence identity in their N and C termini (Fig.1 A). GCAPs belong to a distinct group of recoverin-like Ca2+-binding proteins (29) that are distantly related to calmodulin. Recoverin-like proteins have four helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding domains, EF-hands, usually named EF-1 through EF-4. Amino acids that form Ca2+-binding loops are shown in boxes in Fig.1 A. Unlike calmodulin, the EF-hand loop sequence in EF-1 in all of the currently characterized recoverin-like proteins is disrupted and cannot function as a Ca2+-binding center. Like other recoverin-like proteins, GCAPs also have a signal for the N-terminal fatty acylation (13Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J. Zhao X.

The sequence identity between neurocalcin and GCAP-2 is almost as high as between GCAP-2 and GCAP-1. Recoverin is nearly 28%, and neurocalcin is nearly 39% identical to bovine GCAP-2. Yet unlike GCAPs neither neurocalcin (Fig. 1 B) nor recoverin (as indicated in the inset to Fig. 6 A, and in the accompanying article, Ref. 36Krylov D.M. Niemi G.A. Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10833-10839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) can regulate RetGC activity. To define the regions of GCAP-2 containing specific structures that are essential for its ability to regulate RetGC, we produced and characterized deletion mutants of GCAP-2 as well as chimeric proteins in which various regions of GCAP-2 were substituted by the corresponding fragments of neurocalcin or recoverin (Fig.2). In order to study the effects of mutations in GCAP-2 and GCAP-1, we used both native RetGC-containing OS membranes and recombinant RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 expressed in HEK293 cells for the following reasons. 1) OS membranes are more likely to retain any additional unidentified components(s) that might be potentially significant for RetGC regulation in photoreceptors. 2) Relative contribution of RetGC-1 or RetGC-2 to the overall cGMP synthesis in photoreceptors membranes remains unknown. 3) It is impossible to exclude a potential existence of any additional RetGC homologs that can be present in photoreceptors. 4) Activity of recombinant RetGCs is 10–100-fold lower than RetGC activity in OS membranes. Therefore we consider OS membranes as a closer in vitro approximation to the physiological conditions in order for studying RetGC regulation by GCAPs. 5) However, even with all mentioned limitations for using recombinant cyclases for studying GCAP-2 mutants, the recombinant RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 demonstrate their basic ability to interact with GCAPs and therefore must reflect at least some of the regulatory properties of the native enzymes present in photoreceptors. Hence, we also demonstrate that the key GCAP-2 mutations affecting native RetGC activity in OS also affect individual recombinant RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 expressed in HEK293 cells. For other known EF-hand proteins, such as calmodulin, it is their Ca2+-loaded form that regulates an effector protein (29). In contrast, the apo-form of GCAP-2 and GCAP-1 activates RetGC, and the Ca2+-loaded form inhibits RetGC (16Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Apparently, exposure of regulatory domains in GCAPs is regulated by Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand domains (16Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mutations in EF-hands that hamper Ca2+ binding can lock GCAP-2 into its activator conformation thus preventing the Ca2+-dependent transition into the inhibitory conformation (16Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The greatest homology between GCAPs and neurocalcin is within the central part of the molecule that contains all three functional EF-hands: EF-2, -3, and -4 (Fig. 1 A). We refer to that region as the “Ca2+-binding core region.” We examined the ability of that region of neurocalcin to substitute for the corresponding region of GCAP-2 by constructing and analyzing the chimeric proteins shown in Fig. 2 (I-III). Surprisingly, these chimeras do not activate RetGC at low Ca2+concentrations. Instead, they activate RetGC only when free Ca2+ concentrations exceed 200 nm(Fig. 3, A and B). Unlike wild type GCAP-2 which is Ca2+-sensitiveactivator of RetGC, these chimerical proteins are Ca2+-dependent activators of RetGC. It should be noted that chimeras I-III are unable to activate RetGC at low Ca2+ not because they are simply denatured, or cannot bind Ca2+. Fig. 3 shows that they are able to activate RetGC, but that their Ca2+ sensitivity has been reversed (Fig. 3, A and B). Data for construct II are not shown, but they are similar to the results with chimeras I and III. These results imply that the Ca2+-binding core region of GCAP-2 is not only responsible for binding Ca2+, but also determines the direction of the switch between the “inhibitor” and “activator” conformations of GCAP-2. The neurocalcin structure responsible for this paradoxical effect appears to be the region between EF-2 and EF-3. In order to verify this, we substituted the neurocalcin sequence between EF-2 and EF-3 in chimera III with the corresponding fragment Phe78–Asp113 from GCAP-2 (numbers are given according to the GCAP-2 sequence). The resulting mosaic (chimera IV) demonstrates Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC typical for GCAP-2 (Fig. 3 B). The same GCAP-2-specific fragment, Phe78–Asp113, when it is inserted into constructs I and II creates mosaic chimera protein constructs V and VI in which the length of neurocalcin-specific fragments is extended toward the EF-4 (Fig. 2 A). Unlike chimeras I-III, chimeras V and VI demonstrate normal regulation of RetGC by Ca2+ (Fig.3A). We therefore conclude that the direction of the Ca2+-regulated switch between activator and inhibitor conformations in GCAP-2 is determined by the GCAP-2-specific amino acid sequence(s) located between Phe78 and Asp113. Interestingly, in a related protein, recoverin, this region appears to act as a swivel or a “hinge” between two halves of the molecule (33Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that in GCAP-2 it may also form a similar structure between regulatory domains and thus may determine the directions of intramolecular rearrangements caused by Ca2+binding. However, the three-dimensional structures of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound GCAP-2 will be needed to confirm this possibility. Other regions of the GCAP-2 Ca2+-binding core structure can be substituted with the corresponding fragments of neurocalcin (Fig.3 , chimera V and VI), or partially deleted (chimera VII, Fig. 3 C) and this does not cause complete loss of function or reverse Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC regulation. This shows that except for the presence of functional EF-hands, no essential GCAP-2-specific functions are exclusively determined by the GCAP-2 amino acid sequence located between Glu56 and Asp77 or between Arg114 and Phe170. The region Arg114–Phe170 includes a part of the EF-3 and EF-4 Ca2+-binding domains. Also, the distance between EF-3 and EF-4 in GCAP-2 is longer than in other recoverin-like proteins, including GCAP-1 (Fig. 1 A). Nevertheless, the difference in distance between EF-3 and EF-4 does not seem to be a critical characteristic of the GCAP-2 molecule as a RetGC regulator. An 8-amino ac"

In direct contrast to PU.1 −/−mice that die in utero and lack monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells, Spi-B −/− mice are viable and exhibit a severe B cell proliferation defect. Since PU.1 is expressed at wild type levels in Spi-B −/− B cells, the mutant mice provide genetic evidence that SPI-B and PU.1 have at least some non-redundant roles in B lymphocytes. To begin to understand the molecular basis for these defects, we delineated functional domains of SPI-B for comparison to those of PU.1. By using a heterologous co-transfection system, we identified two independent transactivation domains in the N terminus of SPI-B. Interestingly, only one of these domains (amino acids 31–61), a proline/serine/threonine-rich region, unique among Ets proteins, is necessary for transactivation of the immunoglobulin λ light chain enhancer. This transactivation motif is in marked contrast to PU.1, which contains acidic and glutamine-rich domains. In addition, we describe a functional PU.1 site within the c-FES promoter which SPI-B fails to bind efficiently and transactivate. Finally, we show that SPI-B interacts with the PU.1 cofactors Pip, TBP, c-Jun and with lower affinity to nuclear factor interleukin-6β and retinoblastoma. Taken together, these data suggest that SPI-B binds DNA with a different affinity for certain sites than PU.1 and harbors different transactivation domains. We conclude that SPI-B may activate unique target genes in B lymphocytes and interact with unique, although currently unidentified, cofactors.

Hematopoiesis represents the coordinated development of all blood cell lineages (granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets), which arise from a self-renewing, pluripotent stem cell. This complex developmental process is guided by interactions between extracellular signals, cell-surface receptors, cell-cell interactions, and the regulation of gene expression by transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1025-4039Crossref Google Scholar and 2Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Transcription factors play a crucial role in hematopoiesis due to their ability to regulate gene expression controlling the eventual differentiation and development of distinct cell types. One family of transcription factors thought to play a pivotal role in hematopoiesis is the Ets DNA-binding proteins. This family of transcription factors consists of approximately 30 different proteins that bear a high degree of similarity to the founding member, Ets-1. Ets proteins are monomeric transcription factors that bind to the purine-rich element of GGA(A/T) through their Ets domain (3Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 4Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J.

Based upon differences within the Ets and other domains, Ets proteins can be divided into a series of subfamilies consisting of the Ets-1, PU.1, Elf-1, Fli-1, and GABPα groups. The PU.1 subgroup consists of PU.1/SPI-1 and SPI-B and represents the most divergent members of the Ets family due to many differences in the Ets domain (40% similarity to Ets-1). In contrast to other Ets proteins, both PU.1 and SPI-B can bind the non-canonical DNA sequence GCAGAA (7Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to having a distinct DNA binding domain compared with other Ets family members, PU.1 possesses several protein motifs unique among Ets proteins (Fig. 1). PU.1 has a C-terminal Ets domain that is involved in both DNA binding as well as protein-protein interactions involving AP-1 family members (8Basuyaux J.P. Ferreira E. Stehelin D. Buttice G. J. Biol.

Immediately adjacent to the Ets domain is a proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PEST) region, which is involved in protein-protein interactions with the lymphoid-specific co-activator Pip/IRF4/NF-EM5 and other IRF proteins (13Eisenbeis C.F.

Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). At the N terminus of PU.1 resides a series of three independent transcriptional activation domains, including two acidic subdomains and one glutamine-rich domain (19Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to activating transcription, the N terminus of the protein has been shown to interact with Rb and TBP (20Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast to PU.1, very little is known about the functional domains of SPI-B (Fig. 1). The two proteins are 60% similar overall, with the N terminus of SPI-B being highly diverged from PU.1 (20% similarity) but presumed to contain the transcriptional activation domain. The SPI-B Ets domain is 90% similar to that of PU.1, whereas the PEST region exhibits 70% similarity (21Ray D. Bosselut R. Ghysdael J. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Mol. Cell.

SPI-B binds to the same DNA elements as PU.1 in vitro and interacts with Pip to transactivate a target site in the λ enhancer (21Ray D. Bosselut R. Ghysdael J. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A.

Furthermore, SPI-B has been shown to bind Rb via its N terminus which requires a single threonine residue (Thr-56) whose phosphorylation by ERK1 abolishes this interaction (24Mao C. Ray-Gallet D. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 863-873PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been determined if SPI-B can also bind to other PU.1 interacting proteins such as c-Jun, TBP, NF-IL6β, or other Ets proteins. The highly related PU.1 and SPI-B proteins share overlapping patterns of expression. PU.1 is expressed in granulocytes, monocytes, immature erythroid cells, mast cells, megakaryocytes, B cells, and early in T cells (21Ray D. Bosselut R. Ghysdael J. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A.

Muthususamy N. Garrett-Sinha L. Baunuch D. Tenen D.G. Simon M.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7118-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) due to decreased signaling through the B cell receptor and inappropriate apoptosis. 2L. Garrett-Sinha, G. Su, S. Rao, Z. Hao, M. Clark, and M. C. Simon, submitted for publication. 2L. Garrett-Sinha, G. Su, S. Rao, Z. Hao, M. Clark, and M. C. Simon, submitted for publication. One interesting issue raised by the Spi-B −/− mice is that PU.1 is obviously unable to complement this defect since it is present at wild type levels (43Su G.H. Chen H. Muthususamy N. Garrett-Sinha L. Baunuch D. Tenen D.G. Simon M.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7118-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The genetic evidence that SPI-B and PU.1 are not completely redundant implies that they (i) regulate different target genes and/or (ii) bind different cofactors. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we attempt to elucidate differences between SPI-B and PU.1 which may alter their transcriptional activity. These studies reveal that SPI-B contains two N-terminal activation domains which are highly divergent from PU.1. In addition, the affinity of SPI-B for certain DNA sites appears to be different from PU.1, affecting the ability of SPI-B to transactivate the c-FES promoter, a known PU.1 target gene. Finally, SPI-B is shown to interact with Pip as well as other proteins in a manner similar to PU.1, suggesting that these interactions are critical for the proper function of the PU.1/SPI-B Ets subfamily but that interactions with other cofactors may contribute to differences in their ability to activate target genes. A tetrameric λ2–4 enhancer element (referred to as the λB site) (13Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) was subcloned immediately upstream of a TK (2Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) promoter in the pTKGH plasmid (Nichols Institute) to form the reporter construct B4TKGH. The 450-base pair promoter element from the human c-FES gene (44Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the promoterless pφGH vector (Nichols Institute) to form the reporter construct c-FES GH. The pGAL4GH (45Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reporter and the Pip-CMV vector (23Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.M. Chen H.M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have been previously described. The human SPI-B (21Ray D. Bosselut R. Ghysdael J. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and murine PU.1 (25Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) cDNAs have also been previously reported. Of note, the human SPI-B is 95% similar to the murine form, with only conservative differences in the Ets domain. All plasmids for cDNA expression in mammalian cells used the CMV promoter-based pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Constructs were generated by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Deletion mutants are named based upon the amino acids that are missing from the protein. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged cDNAs were generated by cloning PCR-generated fragments into the previously described vector pcDNA3-HA (18Brass A.L. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C.F. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). SPI-B/PU.1 Ets and PU.1/SPI-B Ets containXhoI and HindIII linkers between domains which insert two in-frame codons (LG and KL, respectively). ΔPEST (aa 107–165), Δ31–62, Δ31–106, Δ64–106, ΔEts (aa 166–257), and Δ257–262 contain an internal XhoI site within the deleted region. GAL4 fusion proteins were constructed by inserting PCR-generated fragments of SPI-B into the pGAL4 vector (45Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that contains the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 protein (aa 1–147) followed by a multiple cloning site and in-frame stop codons. Point mutations were introduced by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (46Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The mutations are named by the normal amino acid, position, and the new amino acid. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol. For co-transfection experiments, 2 μg of reporter plasmid and 2 μg of a β-galactosidase expressing plasmid (pMSVβgal) were used. Transfections using the B4TKGH and c-FES GH reporters utilized 20 μg of expression plasmid; 8 μg of expression plasmid were used for the transfections with the GAL4GH reporter. 48 h after transfections, supernatants were collected for human growth hormone assay using a commercially available radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute). Transfection efficiencies were measured by β-galactosidase activity in cell extracts as described previously (47Parmacek M.S. Ip H.S. Jung F. Shen T. Martin J.F. Vora A.J. Olson E.N. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1870-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with Lipofectin and 20 μg of expression plasmid. Nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection using the method of Andrews and Faller (48Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). [35S[Methionine incorporated IVT proteins were generated using a commercially available TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min and contained equimolar amounts of IVT protein or 10 μg of nuclear extracts, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 75 mm KCl, 4% Ficoll, 12.5 mg/ml poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 × 105 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% (19:1) acrylamide:bisacrylamide (Bio-Rad), 0.5× TBE gel at 200 V for 4.5 h, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The following double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were used (top strand): λB, 5′ CTAGCGAGAAATAAAAGGAAGTGAAACCAAGT 3′; GAL4, 5′ GAGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAG 3′; c-FES, 5′ CGGAATCAGGAACTGGCCGGGG 3′. The GST fusion proteins were created by inserting the entire coding sequence of SPI-B or PU.1 into the pGEX vector multiple cloning site (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DH5α cultures expressing the fusion proteins were grown to saturation, diluted 1:10 in Luria broth, grown for 1 h at 30 °C, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were then pelleted, washed once with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and sonicated on ice with 3–15-s bursts. Cell debris was then pelleted, and the fusion proteins were bound to pre-swelled glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were then washed 3 times with NETN. [35S[Methionine-incorporated IVTs were pre-cleared for 1 h with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of fusion protein as judged by Coomassie staining were incubated with equal counts of IVT proteins for 1 h at 4 °C in NETN buffer. Beads were then washed 5 times with NETN, boiled in loading dye, fractionated by 10% (37.5:1) acrylamide:bisacrylamide (National Diagnostics) SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. 3T3 cells were transfected with 24 μg of expression plasmids coding for HA epitope-tagged versions of each construct (18Brass A.L. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C.F. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and protein extracts were made 24 h post-transfection. Extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using standard techniques and probed with an anti-HA antibody (Babco). To identify regions of the SPI-B protein that could function as independent transactivation domains, portions of the SPI-B cDNA were fused in frame to the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and tested for their ability to transactivate five linked copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding site upstream of a minimal TK promoter and the human growth hormone cDNA (pGAL4GH) when co-transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, the PEST region of SPI-B exhibited no transactivation potential (GAL4/PEST), but the N-terminal 108 amino acids (aa, GAL4-(1–108)) potently activated the expression of the pGAL4GH reporter. C-terminal deletions within this region revealed that even the very N-terminal 30 aa (GAL4-(1–31)) could function as an independent transcriptional activator. N-terminal truncations of this region showed that aa 31–108 could also function as a transcriptional activator (data not shown), but aa 63–108 (GAL4-(63–108)) were unable to activate transcription. The small stretch of aa contained in the GAL4-(31–61) was able to transactivate the reporter, thereby localizing two independent transactivation domains of SPI-B to aa 1–31 and aa 31–61. To delineate further the domain contained between aa 31–61 (which conferred transcriptional activity at the λB site, see below), a series of smaller fusion proteins were generated. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, GAL4-(31–51) and GAL4-(41–61) still functioned as transcriptional activators, and in fact only 10 aa (GAL4-(41–51)) retained some transactivation potential even though the flanking aa (GAL4-(31–41) and GAL4-(52–62)) did not. However, due to the strong potential exhibited by GAL4-(41–61) over GAL4-(41–51), it appears that the full transcriptional activation domain resides between aa 41 and 61. To ensure that all constructs were stably expressed and capable of binding to the GAL4 DNA element, nuclear extracts were prepared from COS cells transfected with all constructs shown in Fig. 2 Aand assayed for their ability to bind DNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA lanes 2–14, Fig.2 B). Based upon the GAL4 fusion protein analyses, it appears that SPI-B contains two independent transcriptional activation domains. The N-terminal domain (aa 1–31) has a calculated pI of 3.8, making it an acidic domain, similar to a motif found in PU.1 (19Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and other Ets proteins (49Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 65-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, aa 41–61 most resemble a proline-,serine-, and Threonine (PST)-rich domain since they comprise almost 40% of the amino acids in this region, although it also has some acidic characteristics. PST activation domains have also been identified in GATA factors (45Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as well as the homeodomain protein Pax6 (50Tang H.K. Singh S. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7210-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, computer based alignment of the PST activation domain of SPI-B yielded no similarity with PU.1 or any other Ets family member (data not shown). It has previously been demonstrated that PU.1 or SPI-B in conjunction with the lymphoid-specific co-activator Pip (13Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) effectively transactivates a DNA element from the λ2–4 enhancer (5′ AAAAGGAAGTGAAACC 3′), termed the λB site, which is required for maximal activity of the enhancer (23Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.M. Chen H.M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Full-length PU.1, SPI-B, and N-terminal deletions of SPI-B were tested for their ability to transactivate a tetramer of the λB site upstream of a minimal TK promoter driving growth hormone expression (pB4TKGH). As shown in Fig.3 A, both PU.1 and SPI-B, in combination with Pip, efficiently transactivated (15–20-fold over the empty mammalian expression vector pCDNA3) pB4TKGH. Deletion of the entire N terminus of the protein, leaving only a PEST and Ets domain (Δ2–106), produced a construct that did not transactivate pB4TKGH. Deletion of the first 30 aa of SPI-B (Δ2–30) yielded a construct with almost wild type levels of transactivation, but subsequent deletion of the first 61 aa (Δ2–62) resulted in a construct with no transactivation potential (Fig. 3 A). This implies that only aa 31–61 are required for transactivation at the λ enhancer. To define further the λB transactivation domain, small deletions were generated in the N terminus of SPI-B. Deletion of aa 31–62 (Δ31–62) or 31–107 (Δ31–107) sharply reduced transactivation, whereas deletions adjacent to aa 31–62 (Δ64–107) only modestly affected transactivation potential. These data demonstrate that aa 31–62 of SPI-B function as the primary transcriptional activation domain at the λ enhancer. The residual activity observed in Δ31–62 and Δ31–107 is most likely due to the N-ter"
https://openalex.org/W1995272366,"Transmembrane segment 5 of the Glut1 glucose transporter has been proposed to form an amphipathic transmembrane helix that lines the substrate translocation pathway (Mueckler, M., Caruso, C., Baldwin, S. A., Panico, M., Blench, I., Morris, H. R., Allard, W. J., Lienhard, G. E., and Lodish, H. F. (1985) Science 229, 941–945). This hypothesis was tested using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in conjunction with the membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific reagent,p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). A series of 21 mutants was created from a fully functional, cysteine-less, parental Glut1 molecule by changing each residue within putative transmembrane segment 5 to cysteine. Each mutant was then expressed inXenopus oocytes and its steady-state protein level, 2-deoxyglucose uptake activity, and sensitivity to pCMBS were measured. All 21 mutants exhibited measurable transport activity, although several of the mutants exhibited reduced activity due to a corresponding reduction in steady-state protein. Six of the amino acid side chains within transmembrane segment 5 were clearly accessible to pCMBS in the external medium, as determined by inhibition of transport activity, and a 7th residue showed inhibition that lacked statistical significance because of the extremely low transport activity of the corresponding mutant. All 7 of these residues were clustered along one face of a putative α-helix, proximal to the exoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. These results comprise the first experimental evidence for the existence of an amphipathic transmembrane α-helix in a glucose transporter molecule and strongly suggest that transmembrane segment 5 of Glut1 forms part of the sugar permeation pathway. Transmembrane segment 5 of the Glut1 glucose transporter has been proposed to form an amphipathic transmembrane helix that lines the substrate translocation pathway (Mueckler, M., Caruso, C., Baldwin, S.

These results comprise the first experimental evidence for the existence of an amphipathic transmembrane α-helix in a glucose transporter molecule and strongly suggest that transmembrane segment 5 of Glut1 forms part of the sugar permeation pathway. Facilitative transport of glucose into mammalian cells is mediated by members of the Glut family of membrane glycoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 3Pessin J.E. Bell G.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Glut1, the prototype member of this family, may be the most extensively studied of all mammalian membrane transporters. Kinetic studies on human red blood cell Glut1 are mostly compatible with a simple alternating conformation mechanism for sugar transport (4Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. 11. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 597-634Google Scholar), although anomalies have been observed that appear to contradict this hypothesis (5Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The human Glut1 polypeptide exhibits a molecular mass of 54,117 and contains a single N-linked oligosaccharide (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence obtained by translation of the cDNA sequence suggested the presence of 12 transmembrane segments (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), and this prediction has been experimentally verified using glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis (7Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five of the 12 putative transmembrane segments (segments 3, 5, 7, 8, and 11) are capable of forming amphipathic α-helices, which led to the hypothesis that these amphipathic helices cluster together in the membrane to form the walls of a water-filled pathway through which glucose traverses the fatty acyl core of the lipid bilayer (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). It was further suggested that hydroxyl- and amide-containing amino acid side chains within these helices form the glucose binding pocket within Glut1 via the formation of hydrogen bonds with sugar hydroxyl groups. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with this model for the structure of Glut1. First, glutamine-161 within helix 5 (8Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glutamine-282 within helix 7 (9Hashiramoto M. Kadowaki T. Clark A.E. Muraoka A. Momomura K. Sakura H. Tobe K. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Holman G.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) both appear to participate in forming the exofacial substrate binding site. Second, valine-165, which lies near the center of helix 5 one helical turn distant from glutamine-161, is accessible to aqueous sulfhydryl reagents and appears to be near the exofacial substrate binding site based on mutagenesis and inhibitor studies (10Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Third, tryptophan-412 within helix 11 is essential for transport activity (11Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, hydrogen exchange studies indicate that 30% of peptide hydrogen atoms are freely exposed to water in purified reconstituted Glut1, consistent with the existence of a water-accessible permeation pathway (12Jung E.K. Chin J.J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9155-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in conjunction with a sulfhydryl-specific chemical reagent to more directly address the role of transmembrane segment 5 in forming the Glut1 sugar permeation pathway. Our results suggest that transmembrane segment 5 is an amphipathic α-helix with a polar water-accessible face that lines the exofacial portion of the sugar permeation pathway.

Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described in detail previously. Stage 5Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 ng of wild-type or mutant Glut1 mRNA. Two days after injection, groups of ∼20 oocytes were incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of pCMBS in Barth's saline at 22 °C. The 100× concentrated reagent stock was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control oocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of vehicle alone. After a 15 min incubation period, the oocytes were washed 4 times in Barth's saline and then used for the determination of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C). We previously constructed a mutant human Glut1 cDNA encoding a cysteine-less (C-less) Glut1 polypeptide in which all 6 native cysteine residues were changed to either serine or glycine residues (10Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The C-less transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes exhibits transport activity nearly indistinguishable from wild-type Glut1. We used C-less Glut1 cDNA to construct cysteine-scanning mutants for transmembrane segment 5, which is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix that lines the sugar permeation pathway (6Mueckler M.

Each of the 21 residues within transmembrane segment 5 was individually changed to a cysteine residue using oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, producing a series of 21 mutant Glut1 molecules, each containing only a single cysteine residue (see TableI).Table ICysteine scanning mutagenesis of helix 5ResidueAmino Acid ChangeCodon Change156Leu → CysCTG → TGC157Gly → CysGGC → TGC158Thr → CysACC → TGC159Leu → CysCTG → TGC160His → CysCAC → TGC161Glu → CysCAG → TGC162Leu → CysCTG → TGC163Gly → CysGGC → TGC164Ile → CysATC → TGC165Val → CysGTC → TGC166Val → CysGTC → TGC167Gly → CysGGC → TGC168Ile → CysATC → TGC169Leu → CysCTC → TGC170Ile → CysATC → TGC171Ala → CysGCC → TGC172Glu → CysCAG → TGT173Val → CysCTG → TGT174Phe → CysTTC → TGC175Gly → CysGGC → TGC176Leu → CysCTG → TGCcDNA encoding cysteine-less human Glut1 was subjected to oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis creating a series of 21 mutant cDNAs in which each of the 21 residues within putative transmembrane helix 5 was individually changed to cysteine.

Mutant mRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes and the expression and function of the corresponding mutant transporters were evaluated by immunoblotting oocyte membrane fractions and by conducting 2-deoxyglucose uptake assays. As demonstrated previously (13Hresko R.C. Murata H. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32110-32119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the immunoblots revealed the presence of two glycosylated forms of Glut1 in oocyte membranes, a faster-migrating, core-glycosylated, high mannose form, and a slower migrating, fully processed, complexN-glycosylated form (see Fig.1). Roughly half of the cysteine-scanning mutants were expressed in oocyte membranes at levels similar to the parental C-less construct, whereas the other half were expressed at lower levels. V166C, V167C, and A171C were expressed at particularly low levels relative to the parental C-less transporter. Transport activity was detectable for all 21 mutants as determined by uptake of [3H]2-deoxyglucose (Fig.2). Consistent with our previously published results (8Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cysteine substitution at glutamine-161 greatly reduced transport activity, even when normalized to the amount of steady-state protein. This residue has been shown to be involved in exofacial substrate binding and in a conformational change during transporter cycling (8Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine substitutions at valine-166, glycine-167, alanine-171, and glutamine-172 also significantly inhibited transport activity, most likely because of the reduced steady-state levels of the mutant proteins relative to the parental C-less transporter (see Fig. 1). All of the other mutants exhibited transport activities that were at least 50% of the activity of the parental C-less transporter. Cysteine substitution at leucine-164 enhanced transport activity by ∼46%, perhaps because of the increased steady-state level of the mature glycosylated form of this mutant relative to that of the parental C-less construct (see Fig. 1). We previously demonstrated that only the fully glycosylated form of Glut1 is present in the plasma membrane (13Hresko R.C. Murata H. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32110-32119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which transmembrane residues are accessible to the external aqueous solvent and therefore may comprise part of the sugar permeation pathway, transport activity was measured for each of the 21 mutants after incubation in the presence of the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl-specific reagent, pCMBS, and compared with the activities measured in the presence of vehicle alone (see Fig.3). The activity of 7 cysteine-scanning mutants was inhibited by at least 40% after incubation with pCMBS, indicating that the corresponding 7 cysteine-substituted amino acid side chains reacted with the pCMBS and therefore must be accessible from the external aqueous solvent. Interestingly, none of the 5 side chains predicted to lie closest to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane appeared to be accessible to the external reagent. Note that the reduction in relative transport activity after pCMBS treatment did not reach statistical significance for the glutamine-161 mutant because of the extremely low absolute transport activity for this particular mutant (see Fig. 2). However, we have previously demonstrated an important role for glutamine-161 in transport activity consistent with this residue being exposed to the sugar permeation pathway (8Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Helical wheel analysis of the results of the pCMBS inhibition experiments revealed that the 7 residues accessible to pCMBS from the external aqueous solvent are clustered together on one face of a putative α-helix formed by transmembrane segment 5 (see Fig.4). Interestingly, this helical face encompasses glutamine-161 and valine-165, both of which were hypothesized to be exposed within the aqueous sugar permeation pathway based on two separate series of experiments (8Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The opposite face of helix 5, which is presumably in contact with the fatty acyl core of the lipid bilayer, is composed primarily of highly hydrophobic amino acid side chains. These data comprise the first experimental evidence for the existence of an amphipathic transmembrane helix in a glucose transporter and also support our original hypothesis that transmembrane segment 5 comprises part of the sugar permeation pathway (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Our results with Glut1 are reminiscent of those reported for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis experiments conducted on theEscherichia coli lac permease (reviewed in Ref. 16Kaback H.R. Wu J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the glucose-6-P antiporter (17Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), both of which belong to the same 12 transmembrane helix superfamily of membrane transporters as Glut1. Helix 7 of the glucose-6-P antiporter and several helices within the lac permease have been shown to possess solvent-accessible faces that appear to line a portion of their respective substrate permeation pathways. Our results extend these findings to a mammalian facilitative transporter, and the results when taken together imply that a similar structural paradigm may exist for cotransporters, antiporters, and facilitative transporters in organisms ranging from E. colito the human. Yan and Maloney (17Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that residues within helix 7 of the glucose-6-P antiporter that are accessible to the external solvent are clustered along the water-accessible face proximal to the exoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, and that the 6 residues along the water-accessible face most proximal to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane are not accessible from the external solvent. Our results with helix 5 of Glut1 are completely consistent with these findings, in that none of the 5 residues predicted to lie closest to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane displayed sensitivity to pCMBS in the external solvent. These results are consistent with a simple alternating conformation or carrier model for the mechanism of transport whereby the outer binding site is largely inaccessible to cytoplasmic substrate and the inner binding site is largely inaccessible to substrate in the external medium. At least in the case of the glucose-6-P antiporter, there also appears to exist a central transmembrane region that is alternately accessible from either aqueous domain as the transporter moves between its two basic configurations. As pointed out by Yan and Maloney (17Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), this general model for membrane transport was proposed decades ago based purely on kinetic analyses, and it is only now that molecular biological approaches are providing more direct experimental support for this fundamental hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995006983,"In plants, Ser is biosynthesized by two different pathways: a photorespiratory pathway via Gly and a plastidic pathway via the phosphorylated metabolites from 3-phosphoglycerate. In contrast to the better characterization of the photorespiratory pathway at a molecular level, the molecular regulation and significance of the plastidic pathway are not yet well understood.

This work completes the molecular cloning and characterization of the three genes involved in the plastidic pathway of Ser biosynthesis in higher plants. Multiple pathways are responsible for Ser biosynthesis in plant cells. The oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle constitutes the principal biochemical pathway in photorespiration. Gly and Ser are intermediates in the photorespiratory metabolism of glycolate to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) 1The abbreviations used are: 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; GDC, glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT, 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase; PSP, 3-phosphoserine phosphatase; GFP, green fluorescence protein.in leaves (Fig. 1) (1Bryan J.K. Miflin B.J. Lea P.J. The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise. 16. Academic Press, New York1988: 175-176Google Scholar). Ser biosynthesis via this pathway has received much attention and is well documented (2Walker J.L. Oliver D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 626-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex (GDC) (3Srinivasan R. Oliver D.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) (4Turner S.R. Hellens R. Ireland R. Ellis N. Rawsthorne S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are responsible for the photorespiratory conversion of Gly to Ser in plant mitochondria. Servaites and Orgen (5Servaites J.C. Orgen W.L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1977; 60: 461-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that 50% of the initial Ser synthesis remained after chemical inhibition of the photorespiratory pathway, suggesting that a second pathway is activated for Ser formation. In the phosphorylated pathway, an alternative pathway of Ser biosynthesis that takes place in the plastids, Ser is synthesized from 3-PGA via a series of reactions catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), 3- phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT), and 3-phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) (Fig. 1). This pathway is proposed to be important in supplying Ser to non-photosynthetic tissues (6Reynolds P.H. Blevins D.G. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1986; 81: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar) and fast proliferating tissues (7Stolz M. Dörnemann D. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1994; 49: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in the dark (8Saito K. Takagi Y. Ho C.-L. Takahashi H. Noji M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Yamazaki M. Saito K. Plant J. 1998; 16: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) when the photorespiratory rate is low. A non-phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis via glycerate and hydroxypyruvate (11Keys A.J. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E The Biochemistry of Plants. 5. Academic Press, New York1980: 359-374Google Scholar) was also proposed to take place in plant tissues in the dark. In animals, however, this pathway is assumed to be involved in Ser catabolism (12Snell K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 241-243Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This could also be the case in plant cells because glycerate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes glycerate to hydroxypyruvate, was found to be tissue-specific and strongly expressed in light-grown leaves (13Greenler J.M. Becker W.M. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 94: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Actually, it is unknown to what extent glycerate can be converted to Ser in plant cells. The molecular studies on the phosphorylated Ser biosynthetic pathway in plastids started with the cDNA cloning of spinach PSAT (8Saito K. Takagi Y. Ho C.-L. Takahashi H. Noji M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first molecular cloning and characterization of ArabidopsisPGDH (9Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Yamazaki M. Saito K. Plant J. 1998; 16: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PSAT (10Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the first two enzymes in this pathway, have recently been carried out in our laboratory. BothArabidopsis PGDH and PSAT are plastidic proteins, and their catalytic activities are not sensitive to Ser inhibition. The genes encoding Arabidopsis PGDH and PSAT have a common feature in their mRNA expression patterns, in which they demonstrated root-preferential expression (9Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Yamazaki M. Saito K. Plant J. 1998; 16: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the phosphorylated pathway in plastids is regulated at the mRNA expression level, so as to ensure Ser formation in non-photosynthetic tissues, in which photorespiratory Ser biosynthesis is suppressed. To confirm this hypothesis, it is necessary to isolate the cDNA and gene encoding PSP, the terminal enzyme in the plastidic pathway, and to examine its biochemical properties and mRNA expression pattern. In this study, we describe the successful molecular cloning and characterization of PSP, the enzyme that is responsible for the dephosphorylation of 3-phosphoserine to Ser in the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis. Together with our previous work onArabidopsis PGDH and PSAT, the first molecular cloning and characterization of the entire plastidic pathway of Ser biosynthesis in the plant kingdom were completed. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia seeds were germinated and grown on germination medium (14Valvekens R.D. Van Montagu M. Van Lijsebettens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) agar plates under 16/8-h light and dark cycles at 22 °C for 3 weeks. For the dark-treated seedlings that were used for Northern analyses, 2-week-old seedlings were wrapped in aluminum foil and subsequently grown for another 1 week before RNA extraction was carried out. cDNA cloning of PSP was carried out by functional complementation of E. coli SK472 (CGSC 6102) (λ − , relA1, spoT1, thi-1. zji-202::Tn10, serB22), which was obtained from theE. coli Genetic Stock Center (Department of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Approximately 1 × 105cells were transformed with plasmid DNA recovered from the λYESA. thaliana cDNA expression library (15Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) by both heat shock and the electroporation transformation method (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), plated on M9 minimal medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 week. To isolate a longer cDNA clone, FPSP4, the cDNA clone that was isolated by functional complementation of E. coli serB −mutant SK472, was used as probe to screen 5 × 105amplified plaques. Hybridization of the membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out at 65 °C in 5× SSPE (0.9m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.7), and 5 mm EDTA), 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 25 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed at maximum stringency in 1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice with final washing conducted at 65 °C in 0.1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS for 10 min and were then exposed to Fuji x-ray film. Genomic cloning of PSP was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers 5′-CTCCAGTCGACATGGAAGCATTAACTACTT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTATAGAGGCTTTTAGTCCAAT-3′. Autosequencing was conducted by dideoxy chain termination methods with Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Shimadzu Model DSQ1000 DNA sequencer. Genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves of 3-week-old seedlings as described (16Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-23Crossref Scopus (6378) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the leaves and roots of 3-week-old seedlings by a modified guanidine HCl method as described (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA blots were probed with 32P-labeled probe synthesized from the cDNA clones CPSP-1 and CPGDH-5 (10Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and CPSAT-5 (9Ho C.-L. Noji M. Saito M. Yamazaki M. Saito K. Plant J. 1998; 16: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mRNA expression levels of GDC and SHMT,32P-labeled probes synthesized from cDNA inserts ofArabidopsis expressed sequence tag clones 200K16T7 and 111M16T7, respectively, were used. To verify equivalent loading of RNA on blots, membranes were probed with a 32P-labeled rice rDNA (pRR217) (18Takaiwa F. Oono K. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1985; 4: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing conditions were the same as those described above. Relative values of mRNA transcripts were calculated based on the hybridization intensities of specific signals on the blots quantified by a Fuji BAS-2000 image analyzer. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping was carried out with 30 recombinant inbred lines (19Lister C. Dean C. Plant J. 1993; 4: 745-750Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing were carried out as described above, except the final washing condition was reduced to 0.5× SSPE and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C. The map distances were kindly calculated by Dr. M. Anderson (NottinghamArabidopsis Stock Center) based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles generated by HhaI. We followed a general method of DNA engineering according to Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primers AB5 (5′-CAGTTCCATGGAAGCATTAACTACTCAAGG-3′) and AB6 (5′-CGCGGATCCTATAGAGGCTTTTAGTCCAAT-3′) were used to create aNcoI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the open reading frame of PSP. The engineered DNA fragments were inserted into the appropriate sites of pET3d (Novagen), in which the cDNA was placed under a strong φ10 promoter in both sense and antisense orientations. The plasmids were then introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, in which the gene for lysogenic T7 RNA polymerase, under the lacUV5 promoter, is induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. PSP activity was determined by measuring the phosphate release from 3-phosphoserine at 30 °C in a volume of 0.5 ml of reaction mixture containing 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm 3-phosphoserine, 3 mm MgCl2, and 20 μl of extract to start the reaction (20Larsson C. Albertsson E. Physiol. Plant. 1979; 45: 7-10Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rate was linear for at least 15 min. After 10 min, 0.25 ml of 15% trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. Free phosphate was determined (21Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and corrections were made for zero time blank “rates.” Blanks without enzyme were also run. One unit of enzyme is the amount that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min under the stated condition. To verify the subcellular localization of PSP in plant cells, primers 5′-CTCCAGTCGACATGGAAGCATTAACTACTT-3′ and 5′-CCTGGCCATGGCTCGTGAGGCTGCACAGAA-3′ were used to amplify a 180-base pair fragment of the 5′-end of PSP for subcloning into plasmid CaMV35S-sGFP(S65T)-NOS3′ (22Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) with a cauliflower mosaic virus35S-labeled promoter at its 5′-end, GFP as reporter protein, and nopaline synthetase terminator as transcription terminator. The plasmid construct 35SΩ-TP-sGFP(S65T) (22Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), carrying transit peptide sequence obtained from the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit polypeptide of Arabidopsis (23Krebbers E. Seurinck J. Herdies L. Cashmore A.R. Timko M.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. These plasmids were used for subsequent particle gun bombardment. Particle gun bombardment was carried out using the Helios Gene-Gun system (Bio-Rad) following the standard protocol provided by the supplier. Individual leaves were viewed with a fluorescent microscope (BX50-FLA, Olympus) using a Chroma dual band filter, FITC, and TRITC (Olympus). Photographs were taken using Fujichrome ISO 100 film. DNA subcloning and sequencing, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein quantitation were carried out as described (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid recovery of DNA from the λYESA. thaliana cDNA expression library was carried out as described (15Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The E. coli serB −mutant strain SK472 is deficient in PSP activity and is unable to grow on M9 minimal medium plates without Ser supplementation. Complemented cells that were ampicillin-resistant were obtained at a frequency of 50 from 1 × 105 cells transformed with a total of 16 μg of plasmid DNA recovered from the λYES ArabidopsiscDNA expression library (15Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The cDNA clone obtained (FPSP4) was ∼1 kilobase pairs in length, and it starts immediately from the ATG translation codon. To obtain a longer cDNA clone, 4.5 × 105 phage plaques produced from an Arabidopsis whole plant cDNA library were screened with the cDNA clone (FPSP4) isolated by functional complementation, and only two positive clones were isolated. Of the two positive clones selected for further studies, CPSP-1, which contains the largest cDNA insert (1.1 kilobase pairs), was subcloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that it is 82 base pairs longer than FPSP4, containing an open reading frame of 885 nucleotides that encodes 295 amino acid residues. The poly(A) tail is absent from the cDNA clone. The deduced amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis PSP is aligned with PSP sequences from other organisms in Fig.2 A. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2 B) indicates that Arabidopsis PSP is closely related to human PSP (24Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Rider M.H. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingan E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis PSP, containing two of the most conserved regions of PSP (DXDST and GDGXXD), has high similarity to amino acid sequences of PSP from other organisms (Fig. 2 A). It differs from the rest mainly due to its N-terminal region. The genomic clone GPSP covering the coding region of PSP was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification and has been fully sequenced. Analysis of genomic and cDNA sequences revealed the presence of six short introns, splitting the open reading frame into seven exons. The Southern blot results (Fig. 3) demonstrate a single major fragment being hybridized upon digestion with BamHI, BglII, EcoRI,SacI, and XbaI. Two bands were observed upon digestion with EcoRV due to the presence of restriction sites for this endonuclease in the genomic structure. The results suggested that Arabidopsis PSP is a single-copy gene, and it was mapped to chromosome 1, between the markers g3786 and g3829. The recombinant fusion protein CPSP-GFP, containing the 60 amino acids at the N terminus of CPSP-1 fused to jellyfish GFP, could be detected in intact tissues after delivering the constructs into Arabidopsisleaves by particle gun bombardment. The observed signals in the construct containing the predicted transit peptide of PSP fromArabidopsis (Fig.4 b) were similar to those exhibited by the transit peptide of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit polypeptide of Arabidopsis (23Krebbers E. Seurinck J. Herdies L. Cashmore A.R. Timko M.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 a), which was already known to be sufficient for translocation to chloroplasts (22Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the plastidic proteins was distinct from the signals observed in the cytosol and nucleus of the empty vector, sGFP(S65T), without a transit peptide (25Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These results confirmed that the N-terminal sequence ofArabidopsis PSP is sufficient for the translocation of a passenger protein into chloroplasts. Thus,Arabidopsis PSP is a plastidic protein. Recombinant PSP was overproduced in E. coli BL21 cells using a pET3d vector system. The recombinant protein was visualized on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel as a 37-kDa protein (Fig.5), exhibiting a PSP activity of 3.0 ± 0.6 units/mg of protein. Double-reciprocal plots of the initial rate data demonstrated aK m value of 3.5 mm for 3-phosphoserine. Enzyme activity was reduced rather than completely inhibited in the presence of Ser. Approximately 60% inhibition of PSP activity by 10 mm Ser was observed. Gly did not reduce or inhibit the PSP activity. The mRNA expression level of PSP was examined in leaf and root tissues of both light-grown and dark-treated plants. Northern analyses were also carried out with two other enzymes, PGDH and PSAT, in the plastidic pathway and with two enzymes, H-protein (a subunit of GDC) and SHMT, in the photorespiratory pathway for comparison with PSP expression. The highest level of PSP mRNA expression was observed in light-grown root tissues (Fig.6 C). It is ∼1.5-fold higher than the mRNA expression in light-grown leaf tissues. Lower mRNA expression levels were detected in the dark-grown leaf and root tissues. The level in dark-grown roots was still higher than in dark-grown shoots. These trends of expression were also similar for PGDH (Fig. 6 A) and PSAT (Fig. 6 B); in contrast, the mRNAs of H-protein (Fig. 6 D) and SHMT (Fig.6 E) accumulated almost absolutely in the light-grown leaves. In this study, the first molecular cloning of PSP from the plant kingdom was successfully achieved from Arabidopsis by functional complementation of E. coli serB mutant SK472. In the deduced amino acid sequence, two highly conserved motifs containing aspartate residues are found in PSP: DXDST and GDGXXD. Both these domains have high similarity to the consensus phosphorylation site of ATPases of the Na+/K+-ATPase family, suggesting that there may be functional homology between PSP and ATPases (26Collet J.-F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Replacement of the first aspartate of the DXDST motif by asparagine or glutamate resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme, suggesting that the first aspartate of this motif is the phosphorylated residue in human PSP (26Collet J.-F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). PSP belongs to a new phosphotransferase family with an amino-terminal DXDX(T/V) motif that serves as an intermediate phosphoryl acceptor (26Collet J.-F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis PSP is a single-copy gene located at chromosome 1, ∼2.2 centimorgans below marker g3786 and 0.1 centimorgan above the gene for PGDH, which catalyzes the first step of the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis. The actual significance of their proximity to the regulation of Ser biosynthesis remains a question that needs further investigation. The K m value for PSP in the chloroplast extract of spinach was reported to be 1.1 mm for 3-phosphoserine, and the activity was Mg2+-dependent at optimum pH 7 (20Larsson C. Albertsson E. Physiol. Plant. 1979; 45: 7-10Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis recombinant PSP exhibited a higherK m value of 3.2 mm for 3-phosphoserine. In E. coli, PSP was inhibited by Ser (27Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4219-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition is of neither the competitive nor the non-competitive type with respect to Ser. The equilibrium positions of PSAT and PGDH will favor 3-PGA when PSP is inhibited, thereby ensuring that the pathway as a whole is effectively controlled. The phosphorylated pathway is controlled primarily by the demand for Ser rather than the supply of the precursor, 3-PGA (27Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4219-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 60% of Arabidopsis PSP activity is inhibited at 10 mm Ser. This finding is consistent with the report of Larsson and Albertsson (20Larsson C. Albertsson E. Physiol. Plant. 1979; 45: 7-10Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that the spinach PSP activity was reduced rather than eliminated completely at high Ser concentration. Analysis of the control of mammalian Ser biosynthesis also revealed product inhibition of PSP activity, the final step of the pathway (28Fell D.A. Snell K. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In bacteria and animals, Ser is mainly synthesized via the phosphorylated pathway (29Ichihara A. Greenberg D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 3-PGA that was derived from glycolysis or from the oxidative or reductive pentose phosphate pathway. The situation is much more complicated in photosynthetic plant tissues since Ser biosynthesis can proceed via the photorespiratory pathway (30Tolbert N.E. Davies D.D. The Biochemistry of Plants. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 488-525Google Scholar). There are two pools of Ser biosynthesized de novo in photosynthetic cells (Fig. 1): one in the mitochondria, where Ser is synthesized via the photorespiratory pathway, and the other in the chloroplasts, where the phosphorylated pathway is present. Larsson and Albertsson (20Larsson C. Albertsson E. Physiol. Plant. 1979; 45: 7-10Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggested a chloroplast localization of plant PSP based on their physiological investigation. In the present study, particle gun bombardment experiments using the recombinant protein CPSP-GFP confirmed that Arabidopsis PSP is a plastidic protein, indicating there is a pathway of Ser formation in the chloroplasts/plastids. Ser production in the mitochondria, catalyzed by the series of reactions of GDC and SHMT, is conceived to be the major source of Ser supply in light-grown plants. However, the significant gene expression level of Ser-biosynthesizing enzymes in the phosphorylated pathway in the leaf tissues of light-grown plants (Fig. 6, A-C) indicates the coexistence of a source of Ser in the chloroplasts. It is not surprising since 3-PGA, the precursor of this pathway, is generated in a large amount in chloroplasts via the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate during photosynthesis. The preferential mRNA expression pattern of PSP is consistent with that of PGDH and PSAT, the initial two enzymes in the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis. These three genes were preferentially expressed in the root tissues of light-grown plants (Fig. 6,A-C). 3-PGA generated through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway may serve as the precursor of Ser biosynthesis in the plastids of root tissues (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis is also proposed to be an important Ser supply in the dark when the photorespiratory rate is low. The above assumption is supported by the fact that both GDC and SHMT were hardly detected in both leaf and root tissues of the dark-treated seedling (Fig. 6, D and E). Moreover, the amount of PGDH and PSP mRNAs detected in the root tissues was significantly higher than in the leaf tissues from dark-treated plants, revealing a root-preferential expression of these genes, irrespective of their light dependence. The high expression level of PGDH, PSAT, and PSP in the root tissues of light-grown plants could be due to the high demand of Ser or the availability of 3-PGA during photosynthesis. High enzyme activities of PSAT in fast proliferating tissues, e.g. root meristems and apical tissues, etc., where there is a high Ser requirement was reported (6Reynolds P.H. Blevins D.G. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1986; 81: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the highest expression level of these genes in the root tissues of light-grown plants is needed for high demand of Ser, suggesting that these genes are light-regulated. In conclusion, there are two Ser biosynthesis pathways in plants: one is mitochondrially located and related to photorespiration, and the other takes place in the plastids. In root tissues, the plastidic pathway most probably is the major route of Ser biosynthesis, whereas in leaf tissues, where there are two Ser biosynthetic pathways, the plastidic pathway may become the main supply of Ser in non-photosynthetic tissues or in the dark.

https://openalex.org/W2114748339,"For the Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis, chemotaxis to the attractant asparagine is mediated by the chemoreceptor McpB. In this study, we show that rapid net demethylation of B. subtilis McpB results in the immediate production of methanol, presumably due to the action of CheB. We also show that net demethylation of McpB occurs upon both additionand removal of asparagine. After each demethylation event, McpB is remethylated to nearly prestimulus levels. Both remethylation events are attributable to CheR usingS-adenosylmethionine as a substrate. Therefore, no methyl transfer to an intermediate carrier need be postulated to occur during chemotaxis in B. subtilis as was previously suggested. Furthermore, we show that the remethylation of asparagine-bound McpB requires the response regulator, CheY-P, suggesting that CheY-P acts in a feedback mechanism to facilitate adaptation to positive stimuli during chemotaxis in B. subtilis. This hypothesis is supported by two observations: a cheRBCD mutant is capable of transient excitation and subsequent oscillations that bring the flagellar rotational bias below the prestimulus value in the tethered cell assay, and the cheRBCD mutant is capable of swarming in a Tryptone swarm plate.

Chemotaxis is the process by which bacteria sense their chemical environment and migrate toward more favorable conditions. InBacillus subtilis, chemotaxis toward the attractant asparagine has been shown to be mediated by the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein McpB (1Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When asparagine is added to membranes containing McpB in vitro, the rate of autophosphorylation of the CheA autokinase increases (2Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated form of CheA transfers a phosphoryl group to CheY to produce CheY-P (2Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W.

Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8412-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The B. subtilis chemotactic machinery also includes CheW, CheC, CheD, and CheV. CheW and CheV are thought to couple CheA activity to the MCPs (8Hanlon D.W. Márquez-Magaña L.M. Carpenter P.B. Chamberlin M.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol.

CheD is required to produce a normal prestimulus bias, normal methylation, and azetidine-2-COOH-induced activation of CheA in vivo (12Rosario M.M.L. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W.

The chemotaxis system in Escherichia coli has been well characterized and has served as a paradigm for our studies (for reviews, see Refs. 14Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol.

The E. coli system includes homologs of the MCPs, CheA, CheB, CheR, CheW, and CheY. The E. coli system also includes CheZ, which facilitates dephosphorylation of CheY-P (18Hess J.F. Oosawa K.

Indeed, in E. coli repellent stimulation is thought to increase CheA activity (18Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I.

A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Regulation of methylation during chemotaxis has been shown to be more complex in B. subtilis than in E. coli. Both addition and removal of all amino acid attractants result in methanol production (28Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Feinberg S.L. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as was previously shown to be the case for aspartate (29Thoelke M.S. Kirby J.R. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5585-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and alanine (30Wong L.S. Johnson M.S. Sandberg L.B. Taylor B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4342-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methanol formation during chemotaxis in E. coli, however, increases in response to repellent stimuli and decreases in response to attractant stimuli (31Toews M.L. Goy M.F. Springer M.S. Adler J.

Chem. 1984; 259: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, inB. subtilis it has been hypothesized that an acceptor may receive methyl groups from the MCPs during a period of increased turnover due to attractant addition (29Thoelke M.S. Kirby J.R. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5585-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Thoelke M.S. Bedale W.A. Nettleton D.O. Ordal G.W. J. Biol.

Nettleton D.O. Sopata C.S. Thoelke M.S. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 223-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, CheC and CheD affect receptor methylation and behavior in B. subtilis(12Rosario M.M.L. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Rosario M.M.L. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas no homologs to these proteins exist in E. coli. In this study, we have tested the methyl transfer hypothesis inB. subtilis by examining asparagine-induced methylation changes on McpB. Our results demonstrate that no methyl group transfer need be postulated to occur during chemotaxis to asparagine in B. subtilis. The observed methanol production in response to addition and removal of asparagine (28Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Feinberg S.L. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is due to two independent demethylation events on McpB catalyzed by CheB-P. After each demethylation event, McpB is remethylated by CheR using AdoMet as a substrate. We also show that remethylation of asparagine-bound McpB requires the response regulator CheY-P, suggesting that a feedback mechanism may exist to bring about adaptation to positive stimuli. This hypothesis is supported by behavioral data showing transient excitation and subsequent oscillation in a cheRBCD mutant, which lacks all proteins previously thought to be involved in adaptation during chemotaxis in B. subtilis.

Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 958-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.8-kb BglII-XbaI fragment containingmcpB was subcloned from pDW12 (1Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pBluescript (SK−) at the BamHI-XbaI sites to create pUNK101. Subsequently, a 2.8-kb SmaI-XbaI fragment containing mcpB from pUNK101 was subcloned into theSmaI-XbaI sites of pHL007, which is a derivative of the amyE integration plasmid, pAC7 (40Weinrauch Y. Msadek T. Kunst F. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5685-5693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and contains a kanamycin resistance marker. 3H. Lu and G. W. Ordal, unpublished data. The resulting plasmid (pUNK200) carries mcpB under the control of its natural promoter. Four mcphomologs (mcpB, tlpA, mcpA, andtlpB) identified by Hanlon and Ordal (1Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are located at 279° on the B. subtilis chromosome. A plasmid was constructed such that the 5′-end of mcpB (about 300 bp) and 3′-end of tlpB (about 100 bp) were separated by acat cassette to create pMR134. Plasmid pMR134 was linearized and crossed onto the chromosome of the B. subtilis wild-type strain (OI1085). CmR transformants were selected, thereby creating strain OI3180, which has the four mcp homologs deleted. 4M. M. L. Rosario and G. W. Ordal, unpublished data. Integration of mcpB into the amyE locus of OI3180 was achieved using linearized pUNK200 to create strain OI3184. KanR transformants were selected, and potentialamyE integrants were screened by the starch hydrolysis test. Colonies grown on tryptose blood agar base with 0.2% starch were flooded with Mordant's solution: 0.33% I2, 0.67% KI in H2O. Integrants, negative for starch hydrolysis, do not form clear zones around the colonies (41Smibert R.M. Krieg N.R. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Wood W.A. Krieg N.R. Methods for General and Molecular Bacteriology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1994: 603-654Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from OI3280 (mcpC4::erm; 42) was then used to transform OI3184 cells, and erythromycin-resistant transformants were selected to generate strain OI3290. OI3290 cells (CmRKanREmRAmy−) were shown to express only one band that cross-reacts with anti-McpB antibody, 5Kirby, J. R., Niewold, T. B., and Ordal, G. W., submitted for publication. and it produces only one methylatable protein that migrates to the expected position in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, based on themcpB1::cat phenotype observed by Hanlon and Ordal (1Hanlon D.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain OI3294 was constructed in a manner similar to strain OI3290. A strain deleted for cheY (OI2057; 43) was transformed with chromosomal DNA from strain OI3180 to generate strain OI3289 (CmR). This strain was then transformed with linearized pUNK200, selected for KanR, and screened for integration at the amyE locus by the starch hydrolysis assay to create strain OI3292. OI3292 cells (CmRKanRAmy−) were then transformed with chromosomal DNA from strain OI3280 (mcpC4::erm; 42). EmR transformants were selected, and the resulting strain (OI3294) was tested to verify that it produces only one methylated protein at the position to which McpB is expected to migrate, as described above. A plasmid was designed to delete the adjacent B. subtilis genes, cheCand cheD. A partially digested 1.8-kbPstI-EcoRI fragment containing cheDand the 5′-end of sigD (pMR116)4 was cloned into the PstI-EcoRI sites of pUC18, thereby creating plasmid pAIN500. The 1.8-kb fragment carried anEcoRI site, introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, that is internal to cheD and approximately 8 codons from the normal stop codon. A 1.2-kb PstI-EcoRI fragment from pMR105, containing the 5′-end of cheC and a catcassette (12Rosario M.M.L. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was cloned into PstI-EcoRI sites of pAIN500 utilizing the EcoRI site internal tocheD. The resulting plasmid (pAIN501) contained acat cassette flanked by the 5′-end of cheC and the 3′-end of cheD. Chromosomal DNA from strain PS29 (44Slack F.J. Serror P. Joyce E. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was used to transform acheB mutant (OI2715) (50Ordal G.W. Villani D.P. Gibson K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 156-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to spectinomycin resistance at a locus immediately upstream of the fla/che operon to create strain OI3349. Linearized pAIN501 was used to transform OI3349 cells. CmRSpcR colonies were selected, and the resulting strain was called OI3375 (cheBCD). The generalized transducing phage PBS1 was grown on OI3375 cells, and the resulting lysate was used to transduce a cheR3::cat strain (OI2680) (45Kirsch M.L. Zuberi A.R. Henner D. Peters P.D. Yazdi M.A. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25350-25356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (46Ordal G.W. Nettleton D.O. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1088-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultingcheRBCD mutant was designated strain OI3377 (SpcRCmR). OI3377 SpcRtransductants were then back-crossed into strain OI1085 to confirm linkage between the spectinomycin marker and the catcassette located in the fla/che operon. In an independent assay, the cotransduction frequency between the SpcR marker and the fla/che operon was determined to be 94%. In vivo pulse label methylations were performed as described by Ullah and Ordal (39Ullah A.H.J. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 958-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following changes: cells were grown to 180 Klett units (red filter) in LB, washed three times in CB with 250 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and resuspended at an A 600 = 1.0 in the appropriate volume of either CB or protoplast buffer with chloramphenicol. The suspension was then incubated at 37 °C with moderate shaking (120 rpm). Methylation was initiated by addition of 50 μCi/ml [3H]methionine (0.6 μm). At the appropriate times, 1.0-ml samples were removed from flasks and frozen in a dry ice/acetone bath. Samples were then thawed and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was either assayed for volatile labeled product ([3H]methanol) or discarded, and the protoplast membranes were resuspended in 100 μl of 4× SDS solubilizer. The samples were then boiled for 7 min and electrophoresed at 15 V/cm on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, pH 8.8 (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). The gels were then treated for fluorography as described previously (48Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar). For in vivosteady-state methylation reactions, cells were treated as above except that methylation was initiated with 50 μCi/ml of 10 μm[3H]methionine. At the indicated times, 1.0-ml aliquots were frozen in dry ice/acetone baths. For assays requiring the removal of attractant, whole cells were washed by filtration using 0.45-μm-pore cellulose-acetate filters. The cells were resuspended in CB at volumes equal to those before filtration and frozen in dry ice/acetone at the times indicated. After thawing at 4 °C, an equal volume of 2× protoplast buffer with 5 mg/ml lysozyme was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting protoplasts were then centrifuged and treated as described above. Volatile radiolabeled product was detected using a continuous flow assay based on the method described by Kehry et al. (32Kehry M.R. Doak T.G. Dahlquist F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Thoelkeet al. (33Thoelke M.S. Bedale W.A. Nettleton D.O. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protoplasts were labeled in vivo as described above for 15 min. 1.0-ml aliquots were frozen in dry ice/acetone baths at the times indicated. After thawing at 4 °C, the protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation, and 400-μl aliquots of the supernatants were placed in 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (without lids). The microcentrifuge tubes containing the supernatants were then placed in scintillation vials containing 2 ml of Liquiscint mixture (National Diagnostics), allowed to equilibrate for 24 h, and counted. An assay based on that described by Kehry et al. (32Kehry M.R. Doak T.G. Dahlquist F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been described previously (33Thoelke M.S. Bedale W.A. Nettleton D.O. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were methylated as described above. Labeled cells were loaded onto a 0.45-μm-pore cellulose-acetate filter and had CB pumped past them at a constant rate of 15 ml/min. The buffer contained excess methionine (10 μm). When the buffer reservoirs were changed, the cells experienced addition and removal of the effector. The effluent was fractionated and assayed for volatile labeled product ([3H]methanol). A 400-μl aliquot of each fraction was placed in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (without a lid), and the microcentrifuge tubes were then placed in scintillation vials containing 2 ml of scintillation fluid, allowed to equilibrate for 24 h, and counted in a Beckman LS1701 scintillation counter. The3H-labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography (48Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar), and the entire region containing [3H]McpB was quantified in units of absorbance with a PDI 420oe scanning densitometer with 42 μm resolution, using Quantity One® software. The strain to be analyzed was grown from a single colony without shaking in 1.0 ml of Tryptone broth. After overnight growth, the culture was pelleted and resuspended in 250 μl of Tryptone broth. The entire suspension was used to inoculate 25 ml of minimal medium, and the culture was grown for 4.5 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm). Fifteen min prior to harvesting, 250 μl of a 5% glycerol/0.5 m sodium lactate solution was added to the culture. The cells were placed in a 300-ml prechilled Waring blender for 10 min at 4 °C. In order to shear the majority of flagella, the cells were blended twice for 15 s, with a 45-s intervening pause to allow cooling. A 250-μl aliquot of the blended cells was then placed on a glass coverslip preincubated with 25 μl of anti-flagellin antibody and incubated at room temperature for 30–45 min. The coverslip was then inverted and placed within a laminar flow chamber to be observed by phase-contrast microscopy in a system similar to those described previously (5Kirsch M.L. Peters P.D. Hanlon D.W. Kirby J.R. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18610-18616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Block S.M. Segall J.E. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 312-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemotaxis buffer with or without attractant was pumped through the laminar flow chamber at a constant rate such that consumption of an attractant did not significantly affect the concentration of the attractant. Rotating cells were videotaped and analyzed by a Hobson Tracker, Bacterial Edition (Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom), which generates text files containing continuous-time rotational data. The data were processed by programs written with Matlab software (The Mathworks, Inc.). For each cell, the continuous-time rotational data was converted to discrete-time data with a step size of 0.1 s. All the data points within a 4-s window were then averaged to generate a data set with a step size of 4 s that contained the probability of CCW rotation (smooth swimming behavior). The data for all cells in the sample population were then pooled and averaged, and the resulting data were smoothed over a five data point window to generate the final graph. Strains were grown overnight on tryptose blood agar base plates with the appropriate drug. A single colony was transferred to a Tryptone semi-solid agar plate (1% Tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 1× Spizizen salts, 5 μg/ml required amino acids, and 0.27% agar) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (38Ordal G.W. Goldman D.J. Science. 1975; 189: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previous experiments indicated that addition of the attractant aspartate to wild-type B. subtilis (OI1085) caused an immediate (within 24 s) loss of labeled methyl groups from the MCPs under pulse-chase conditions (34Thoelke M.S. Parker H.M. Ordal E.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Under the same experimental conditions, methanol production from OI1085 cells in response to aspartate stimulation was observed to reach a maximum after 60 s (34Thoelke M.S. Parker H.M. Ordal E.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Those results, however, were obtained from analysis of separate trials, and direct comparison of those results may not have been reliable. Nevertheless, the apparent delay in methanol production relative to methylation changes on the MCPs supported the hypothesis that methyl groups were transferred to a stable intermediate methyl carrier from which methanol was subsequently released (29Thoelke M.S.

The location of the CooA-binding sites relative to the start sites of transcription suggested that the CooA-dependent promoters are analogous to class II CRP-dependent promoters. In this study, we developed anin vivo CooA reporter system in Escherichia coli and an in vitro transcription assay using RNA polymerases (RNAP) from E. coli and from Rhodobacter sphaeroides to study the transcription properties of CooA and the protein-protein interaction between CooA and RNAP. The ability of CooA to activate CO-dependent transcription in vivoin heterologous backgrounds suggested that CooA is sufficient to direct RNAP to initiate transcription and that no other factors are required. This hypothesis was confirmed in vitro with purified CooA and purified RNAP. Use of a mutant form of E. coli RNAP with α subunits lacking their C-terminal domain (α-CTD) dramatically decreased CooA-dependent transcription of the CooA-regulated R. rubrum promoter PcooF in vitro, which indicates that α-CTD plays an important role in this activation. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that CooA facilitates binding of wild-type RNAP, but not α-CTD-truncated RNAP, to PcooF. This facilitated binding provides evidence for a direct contact between CooA and α-CTD of RNAP during activation of transcription.

The proposed helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif of CooA is highly similar to that of CRP, whereas the effector-binding domain displays lower similarity with CRP. CooA is not abundant in R. rubrum, but overexpression and purification of CooA were achieved in both R. rubrum andE. coli. CooA purified anaerobically from R. rubrum was indistinguishable spectroscopically or in terms of activity from CooA purified aerobically from either R. rubrum or E. coli (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L.

CO directly binds to the heme of the reduced form of CooA, but not to the oxidized form, and this CO binding induces a conformational change in CooA that allows it to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner (8Shelver D.

Oxidized CooA can be readily reduced, acquiring the ability to bind CO, and the mechanism for this reversible redox reaction involves an unusual switch of protein ligands on one side of the heme (8Shelver D.

Because the heme of CooA is 6-coordinate when reduced and when bound by CO, CO binding apparently displaces one of the axial ligands to the heme. It is our working hypothesis that this protein ligand displacement serves as the trigger for the conformational change in the CooA structure upon CO binding (8Shelver D. Reynolds M.F.

E. coli RNAP is composed of α2ββ′ς subunits; the role of ς is to bind −10 and −35 promoter elements. At promoters with A + T-rich sequences upstream of the −35 hexamer, termed “UP elements,” the C-terminal domain of the α subunit (α-CTD) makes specific DNA contacts that enhance transcription initiation (13Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Two regions of the α-CTD (including residues Leu262, Arg265, Asn268, Cys269, Gly296, Lys298, and Ser299) were found to be important for UP element-dependent transcription and DNA binding (14Gaal T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4358-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The α-CTD is an independently folding domain of RNAP that is joined to the N-terminal domain of the α subunit by a flexible linker that allows the α-CTD to occupy different positions at different promoters (10Blatter E.

Science. 1995; 270: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The α-CTD is also known to make specific contacts with a range of activator proteins (16Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3283-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). E. coli CRP controls the transcription of numerous genes involved in carbon source utilization. Upon the binding of its allosteric effector, cAMP, CRP undergoes a conformational change that allows a dimer of CRP to bind to a specific 22-base pair sequence at target promoters (consensus sequence is 5′-AAATGTGATCTAGATCACATTT-3′, in which the most important bases for CRP recognition are in bold) and to activate transcription at those promoters (18Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRP-dependent promoters can be grouped into two classes based on the position of the CRP-binding site relative to the start of transcription as well as on the mechanism for transcription activation (19Ebright R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). At class I promoters, the DNA-binding site for CRP is upstream of that for RNAP and is centered at position −61.5, −71.5, −82.5, or −92.5. At class II CRP-dependent promoters, to which the CooA-dependent promoters are analogous, the binding site for CRP is centered at −41.5, overlapping the −35 region, and the α-CTD binds to DNA upstream of the CRP dimer. Direct interaction between CRP and RNAP plays a pivotal role in transcription activation at both promoter classes (20Busby S. Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Dove S.L. Joung J.K. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In particular, transcription activation at class II promoters requires two distinct contacts between CRP and the α subunit and a third contact between CRP and ς70. One interaction is between activating region 1 (AR1) of the upstream subunit of the CRP dimer and the α-CTD. This interaction increases initial binding of RNAP to the promoter (22Zhou Y. Pendergrast P.S. Bell A. Williams R. Busby S. Ebright R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4549-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, residues 285–288 and 317 of α-CTD have been shown to comprise the surface that interacts with AR1 of CRP at class II promoters (23Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The second contact, between activating region 2 (AR2) of the downstream subunit of CRP and the N-terminal domain of the α subunit, facilitates isomerization of the closed complex to the open complex (24Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G. Heyduk T. Ebright R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The residues in AR1 and AR2 of CRP are not conserved in CooA, which suggests that there might be certain differences in the interactions of CooA and CRP with α. The third activator region (AR3) in CRP, formed by residues 52–58, interacts with ς70 of RNAP (20Busby S. Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the AR3 region in CRP is highly similar to an analogous region in CooA, this region in CooA might serve an AR3-like function. The two CooA-regulated R. rubrum promoters, PcooFand PcooM, contain 2-fold symmetric DNA sequences that serve as CooA-binding sites and are similar to the CRP consensus sequence. This is consistent with the similarity between CooA and CRP in their helix-turn-helix motifs (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3Fox J.D. He Y. Shelver D. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CooA-binding sites lie at the −43.5 and −38.5 positions relative to the transcription start sites in PcooF and PcooM, respectively, overlapping with the −35 region (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3Fox J.D. He Y. Shelver D. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This overlap suggests that both CooA-regulated promoters are analogous to class II CRP-dependent promoters. We chose PcooF for this study because it is the stronger promoter based on the amount of primer extension product and level of coo-encoded proteins synthesized in vivo(1Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although CooA shares some common features with CRP, such as DNA binding properties and effector-induced activation, it displays striking differences from CRP in the effector-binding domain and in regions AR1 and AR2. We were interested to know whether CooA was necessary and sufficient for CO-dependent activation of transcription and whether the mechanism of activation by CooA was similar to that of CRP. In this work, we used in vivo CooA reporter systems andin vitro transcription assays to examine the properties of CooA in transcription activation. Because of the particular questions we wished to address, we performed the bulk of the work with RNAP fromE. coli, so that any differences between CooA and the CRP detected would reflect properties of CooA. The nature of transcription activation by CooA was investigated through the study of the interaction between CooA and RNAP and, in particular, the interaction between CooA and the α-CTD. CooA was overexpressed from a vector, pYHA1, created as follows. A 1.9-kilobasePvuI-BamHI fragment containing Ptac-cooA-rrnBT1T2, was isolated from pKK223-3 (8Shelver D. Reynolds M.F. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), digested with PvuI, mung bean nuclease, and BamHI, and cloned into theEcoRV and BamHI sites of pACYC184. A plasmid containing a PcooF-lacZ fusion, pYHF4, was constructed by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-amplifiedEcoRI-HindIII fragment, extending from positions −250 to +70 of PcooF, into plasmid pMSB1 (25Rao L. Ross W. Appleman J.A. Gaal T. Leirmo S. Schlax P.J. Record M.T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1421-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which created pMSBPcooF. The reporter region was recombined from plasmid pMSBPcooF into λ phage RS468 (26Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene. 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) in strain DH5α containing pYHA1. Lysogens were screened by the blue color of plaques on Luria broth (LB) + X-gal plates incubated anaerobically in the presence of CO. The promoter region of integrated PcooF-lacZfusion in the chromosome was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified EcoRI-HindIII fragments from positions −250 to +70, −90 to +70, and −60 to +70 of PcooFwere cloned into pRLG770, which contains transcription terminatorrrnBT1T2 downstream of the multicloning site (27Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), to yield plasmids pYHF1, pYHF2, and pYHF3, respectively. The supercoiled plasmids used as DNA templates for these assays were purified with the Midi Kit from Qiagen. The RNAPs used in these experiments were Eς70 purified from E. coli or a Rhodobacter sphaeroides RNAP preparation enriched for the Eς70 homolog (28Karls R. Donohue T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7629-7638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard multiple-round transcription assays (13Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) were modified as described below to accommodate the requirement of CooA for an anoxic environment to bind CO (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The sealed tubes containing 25-μl reactions (0.2 nm supercoiled plasmid, 3.5 nm RNAP, 40 nm CooA dimer, and a buffer (30 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 mm ATP, 200 mm CTP, 200 mm GTP)) were degassed and filled with argon in the head space. After the addition of dithionite to 1.7 mm to scavenge any free oxygen, CO was added, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. This step served to activate CooA and allow the activated CooA to interact with the promoter and RNAP to form a predicted 21-nucleotide transcript by incorporating ATP, GTP, and CTP. The reactions were then exposed to air, and 10 mm UTP and 5 μCi of [32P]UTP (DuPont) were added to extend the mRNA at room temperature for 20 min. Reactions were terminated and electrophoresed as described (29Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 550-568Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The signal intensities of transcripts were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. A DNA fragment containing the PcooF sequence from position −90 to +70 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with an unlabeled bottom strand primer and a top strand primer labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The amplified fragment was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by an Elutip Minicolumn (Schleicher & Schuell). The labeled fragment was incubated with CooA, or RNAP, or both in the presence of CO and under the stringent anoxic conditions described previously (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that 40 nm pure CooA and 3.5 nm RNAP were used in a 20-μl binding reaction. The reactions were treated with 2 units/ml RQ RNase-free DNase I (Promega) for 30 s. DNase I cleavage products were separated on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide-urea gel. Neither heparin nor any nucleotides were added into the reactions. Strains with a PcooF-lacZ reporter were grown aerobically in LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol for 12 h to reach stationary phase. In stoppered test tubes, 20-μl cultures were diluted into 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with 20 mm glucose and the same antibiotics. The air in the head space was replaced by argon and 2% CO, and the cultures were grown anaerobically to an A 600 of approximately 0.45. β-Galactosidase activity was determined according to Miller (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). N-terminal His-tagged wild-type and mutant α subunits were overexpressed from plasmid pHTT7f1-NHα (31Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or derivatives constructed by gene replacement of the EcoRI-BamHI fragment with fragments encoding the desired alanine substitutions (14Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Purification of α subunits by Ni2+ affinity chromatography was performed as described in Tang et al. (31Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Preparation of inclusion bodies of β, β′, and ς70 from strains XL1-Blue (pMKSe2), BL21 DE3 (pT7β′), and BL21 DE3 (pLHN12 α), respectively, and reconstitution of RNAP were carried out as described (31Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CooA was purified from an overproducing strain of R. rubrum (UQ459) by the method of Shelver et al. (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CooA has been shown to be necessary for the CO-dependent expression of the two coo operons of R. rubrum (1Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and purified CooA binds DNA in a CO-dependent manner (7Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CooA is both necessary and sufficient for sensing and activating transcription in response to CO, but they are not conclusive. We therefore examined the requirement for CooA in two heterologous systems. We chose R. sphaeroides because it is related to R. rubrum, yet does not appear to have thecoo system, as judged by the absence of CO dehydrogenase activity and a failure to hybridize to probes of the coogenes (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this organism, a pRK404-based plasmid carryingcooFSCTJ with its normal promoter failed to produce detectable CO dehydrogenase activity (the product of cooS) in response to CO. However, when cooA was added to the plasmid in its normal position at the 3′ end of the cooFSCTJoperon, exposure of the R. sphaeroides strain carrying this plasmid to CO produced easily detectable CO dehydrogenase activity (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We then examined CO- and CooA-dependent transcription inE. coli, an organism that is less related to R. rubrum and also lacks any evidence of a coo system. For this test, a reporter system was constructed that contained a PcooF-lacZ fusion in the chromosome and a plasmid overexpressing CooA. In this system, we detected a substantial increase of β-galactosidase activity upon CO induction (200 Miller units in the presence of CO and 1.6 units in its absence), suggesting that CooA is sufficient for activating the transcription of PcooF inE. coli. Similar results with CooA reporters in E. coli have recently been reported by others (9Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results establish that CooA is necessary for the transcriptional response to CO and that it is able to associate productively in vivo with RNAPs from both E. coli and R. sphaeroides. The above results indicate that CooA is necessary, but only in vitro analysis can establish whether it is sufficient for CO-dependent transcriptional activation or whether additional factors are required for this activation. The ability of CooA to activate PcooF was studied by monitoring RNA synthesis in a purified system containing only DNA, RNAP, CooA, nucleotide triphosphates, and the proper buffer. To investigate the nature of CooA-mediated activation at the PcooFpromoter, we modified the standard in vitro transcription assay, because CooA is only able to bind CO when reduced. The modified assay, detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” was kept anoxic in the presence of CO to support activation by CooA until the formation of a 21-nucleotide transcript from PcooF. At this point, the reaction was exposed to air and extended aerobically for technical convenience. When the reactions were maintained strictly anoxically throughout the entire experiment, a quantitatively similar result was obtained, indicating that the in vitro transcription assay conditions we employed were sufficient for maximal CooA activity (data not shown). The in vitro transcription assays were performed with a supercoiled DNA template (pYHF1) containing the PcooF and extending −250 base pairs upstream and +70 base pairs downstream of transcription start site. The reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of CO. As shown in lanes 2 and4 of Fig. 1, CO-dependent transcripts were detected using RNAP from bothR. sphaeroides and E. coli. The observed size of the transcript from PcooF correlated well with the predicted size of 240 nucleotides. In the absence of CO, no transcripts from PcooF were seen, whereas transcription of the control (RNA-1) was not affected by CO (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and3). These results demonstrate that CooA is sufficient for CO-dependent transcriptional activation and that no other factors are required. The results with the Eς70 fromE. coli indicate that PcooF can be recognized by ς70 when activated by CooA. Because the α-CTD makes specific DNA contacts at some promoters and specific protein contacts with a number of transcription activators including the CooA homolog CRP (13Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 20Busby S. Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we wished to test whether there were similar contacts between α-CTD and either CooA or PcooF. We first examined whether the C-terminal domain of the RNAP α subunit is required for transcription activation of PcooF by CooA. To address this question, we assayed the ability of a reconstituted Eς70 containing a truncation of the C-terminal domain of α to direct transcription from CooA-dependent promoter PcooF in vitro. Use of E. coli RNAP with the α-CTD truncation resulted in a dramatic reduction of transcription from PcooF (Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6). The enzyme activities of wild-type and mutant RNAPs were similar as demonstrated by transcription from the RNA-1 promoter. With a longer exposure of the x-ray film, we were able to detect a low level of a CO-dependent transcript from PcooF using RNAP with α-235 (data not shown). Because the α-CTD is known to make contacts with activators and UP elements, the ineffectiveness of the α-CTD-truncated RNAP for PcooF transcription suggests that the α truncation disrupts the binding of α to CooA, to a UP element, or to both. To analyze potential protein-protein interaction between CooA and RNAP and to specifically address interactions between α-CTD and CooA, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments using wild-type RNAP or the α-CTD-truncated RNAP in the presence or absence of CooA. As shown in Fig.2, lanes 2–4, CooA alone protected PcooF on the top strand from positions −55 to −31 relative to the start site of transcription, in agreement with our previous observations (2He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither the wild-type nor the α-CTD-truncated RNAPs alone protected PcooF from DNase I (lanes 5 and 7). This result indicates that RNAP does not form a stable complex at PcooF in the absence of CooA. When both CooA and wild-type RNAP were incubated together with the DNA fragment, the protected region extended from the CooA-binding site in both directions, upstream to −68 and downstream to at least −1 (lanes 8 and 9). A similar result was obtained when R. sphaeroides RNAP was used, indicating that the RNAPs from these two different organisms function similarly in interacting with CooA at PcooF (lanes 10–12). In contrast to the results obtained with the wild-type RNAP, the α-CTD-truncatedE. coli RNAP showed no evidence of forming a stable complex even in the presence of CooA (lane 6). This suggests that CooA activates transcription by enhancing the initial and stable binding of RNAP to PcooF through direct protein-protein contact with the α-CTD. As noted above, the presence of CooA and wild-type RNAP, but not the α-CTD-truncated variants, caused DNase I protection to extend upstream and downstream of that region protected by CooA alone. The region upstream of the CooA-binding site is A + T-rich (Fig.3) relative to most of the R. rubrum genome, reminiscent of the A + T-richness of UP elements inE. coli promoters that contact the α-CTD to increase transcription (13Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 38). To test whether α interacts with this region in a sequence-specific manner, we created PcooF constructs differing only in the extent of that region. PcooF sequences from positions −90 to +70 and −60 to +70 were cloned into the transcription assay vector pRLG770, resulting in the constructs pYHF2 and pYHF3, respectively. These plasmids were tested for CooA-dependent in vitro transcription activity with wild-type RNAP. The level of transcripts from those constructs was quantitatively compared with that of the construct pYHF1 containing the PcooF sequences from −250 to +70. As shown in Fig.4, these three templates yielded similar amounts of CooA-dependent transcripts, indicating that the specific sequences upstream of position −60 in PcooF do not contribute significantly to promoter activity. This also suggests that the upstream A + T-rich sequence of PcooF does not act as a UP element. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some portion of the protection upstream of the CooA-binding site is due to a conformational change in CooA induced by the presence of RNAP, the interaction of α-CTD with DNA upstream of CooA is consistent with the sequence-nonspecific interactions between DNA and α-CTD observed at class II CRP-dependent promoters (23Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Figure 4In vitro transcription analysis of PcooF deletions. The transcription reactions were performed in the same manner as described in Fig. 1. All of the reactions contained wild-type RNAP from E. coli, CooA, and CO.

Lane 1, pYHF3 containing PcooF sequences from −60 to +70; lane 2, pYHF2 containing PcooF sequences from −90 to +70;lane 3, pYHF1 containing PcooF sequences from −250 to +70. The positions of transcripts initiated at the PcooF and the RNA-1 promoter are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We wished to determine whether CooA made similar contacts with the α-CTD as seen with its homolog, CRP, and also to test whether the extended DNase I protection upstream of CooA reflected the direct contact of α-CTD with DNA. To address these questions, we measured CooA-activated transcription using a CooA reporter system containing a PcooF-lacZ fusion integrated into the E. coli chromosome, a plasmid expressing CooA, and a library of plasmids encoding single alanine substitutions throughout the entire α-CTD (23Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The effects of the α-CTD mutants in this screen were small and somewhat variable (data not shown), but they did identify a few potential mutants that were then assayed for their effects on CooA-dependent transcription in vitro. We tested reconstituted RNAPs in vitro containing single alanine substitutions for Thr285, Val287, Glu288, and Arg317 (the patch on α that interacts with CRP at class II CRP-dependent promoters (23Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)), Arg265 (the residue most important for interaction of α with DNA (14Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)), and a few additional mutants suggested by the in vivo screen, including Val306, Leu307, and Ser313. The results of the in vitro transcription analysis with a subset of the variant RNAPs are shown in Fig.5. The activity of each RNAP preparation was normalized to the transcription from the RNA-1 promoter. The R265A, L307A, and V287A RNAPs were defective in CooA-dependent transcription of PcooF, providing 13, 34, and 37% of wild-type RNAP activity, respectively (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 3, and 7). Because R265A (14Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and L307A 2S. Bales, M. Burgess, S. Aiyar, and R. L. Gourse, unpublished data. affected UP element-dependent transcription and RNAP extended the DNase I protection upstream of the CooA-binding site, this strongly suggested that α-CTD makes contacts with DNA upstream of CooA and that these contacts are important for CooA-meditated transcription activation. V287A was also defective in CooA-dependent transcription, although the other α-CTD variants important for class II CRP-dependent transcription (T285A, E288A, and R317A) had little or no effect. These results suggest that the CooA contact site in the α-CTD of RNAP shares some determinants of, but is not identical to, the site for CRP contact at class II-type promoters. RNAPs containing α mutants V306A and S313A, which were also suggested by the in vivo screen, were not defective in CooA-dependent transcription in vitro (data not shown). Many transcription activators directly contact the α subunit of RNAP (16Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3283-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined that CooA is sufficient for directing RNAP to initiate transcription of PcooF and that CooA-activated transcription of PcooF requires the C-terminal domain of the RNAP α subunit. Consistent with these observations, CooA facilitates the binding of wild-type RNAP to PcooF but not that of α-CTD-truncated RNAP. These observations suggest that direct protein-protein contact between CooA and the α-CTD of RNAP plays an essential role in transcription activation of PcooF. We suspect that the α-CTD/CooA interaction plays a role similar to that between AR1 of CRP and α-CTD at class II CRP-dependent promoters. In class II CRP-dependent promoters, α-CTD makes nonspecific contacts with the DNA segment immediately upstream of the CRP site (16Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that wild-type RNAP, but not RNAP with the α-CTD truncation, extends DNase I protection upstream of that protected by CooA alone. Furthermore, we determined that α R265A and L307A, which decrease UP element-dependent transcription, also affect PcooF activity. Because the specific DNA sequence upstream of the CooA-binding site is not critical for PcooF activity, we propose that α-CTD makes nonspecific contacts with the DNA immediately upstream of the CooA site and that this protein-DNA interaction is important for CooA-activated transcription of PcooF. Val287 is also important for CooA-activated transcription, although the other tested α residues that contact CRP at class II promoters are not critical for CooA-dependent transcription of PcooF. Therefore, a different set of side chains, but probably the same region of α-CTD, might be important for activation by CRP and CooA. This hypothesis is consistent with the low similarity between CRP and CooA in activating region 1 (22Zhou Y. Pendergrast P.S. Bell A. Williams R. Busby S. Ebright R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4549-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the DNase I footprinting analysis, RNAP does not completely protect the DNA downstream of PcooF +1, even in the presence of CooA and in the absence of heparin (Fig. 2). In addition, the majority of the CooA-RNAP-PcooF complexes detected in gel-shift assays are heparin-sensitive (data not shown). This partial downstream protection and the heparin sensitivity suggest that the detected ternary complex (CooA-RNAP-PcooF) may be a mixed population of closed and open complexes.

Because basal level transcription of PcooF in the absence of active CooA is not detectable, it is formally possible that the deletion of α-CTD affects basal level transcription of PcooFand not its activation by CooA.

https://openalex.org/W2068173500,"We report on the molecular cloning of a novel human cDNA by its interaction with the splicing factor SRp30c in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This cDNA is predominantly expressed in muscle and encodes a protein that is present in the nucleoplasm and concentrated in nucleoli. It was therefore termed Nop30 (nucleolar protein of 30 kDa). We have also identified a related cDNA with a different carboxyl terminus. Sequencing of the NOP gene demonstrated that both cDNAs are generated by alternative 5' splice site usage from a single gene that consists of four exons, spans at least 1800 nucleotides, and is located on chromosome 16q21-q23. The alternative 5' splice site usage introduces a frameshift creating two different carboxyl termini. The carboxyl terminus of Nop30 is rich in serines and arginines and has been found to target the protein into the nucleus, whereas its isoform is characterized by proline/glutamic acid dipeptides in its carboxyl terminus and is predominantly found in the cytosol. Interaction studies in yeast, in vitro protein interaction assays, and co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that Nop30 multimerizes and binds to the RS domain of SRp30c but not to other splicing factors tested. Overexpression of Nop30 changes alternative exon usage in preprotachykinin and SRp20 reporter genes, suggesting that Nop30 influences alternative splice site selection in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1994731124,"Biglycan and decorin have been overexpressed in eukaryotic cells and two major glycoforms isolated under native conditions: a proteoglycan substituted with glycosaminoglycan chains; and a core protein form secreted devoid of glycosaminoglycans (Hocking, A. M., Strugnell, R. A., Ramamurthy, P., and McQuillan, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19571–19577; Ramamurthy, P., Hocking, A. M., and McQuillan, D. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19578–19584). Far-UV CD spectroscopy of decorin and biglycan proteoglycans indicates that, although they are predominantly β-sheet, biglycan has a significantly higher content of α-helical structure. Decorin proteoglycan and core protein are very similar, whereas the biglycan core protein exhibits closer similarity to the decorin glycoforms than to the biglycan proteoglycan form. However, enzymatic removal of the chondroitin sulfate chains from biglycan proteoglycan does not induce a shift to the core protein structure, suggesting that the final form is influenced by polysaccharide addition only during biosynthesis. Fluorescence emission spectroscopy demonstrated that the single tryptophan residue, which is at a conserved position at the C-terminal domain of both biglycan and decorin, is found in similar microenvironments. This indicates that in this specific domain the different glycoforms do exhibit apparent conservation of structure. Exposure of decorin and biglycan to 10m urea resulted in an increase in fluorescent intensity, which indicates that the emission from tryptophan in the native state is quenched. Comparison of urea-induced protein unfolding curves provide further evidence that decorin and biglycan assume different structures in solution. Decorin proteoglycan and core protein unfold in a manner similar to a classic two-state model, in which there is a steep transition to an unfolded state between 1 and 2 murea. The biglycan core protein also shows a similar steep transition. However, biglycan proteoglycan shows a broad unfolding transition between 1 and 6 m urea, probably indicating the presence of stable unfolding intermediates. Biglycan and decorin have been overexpressed in eukaryotic cells and two major glycoforms isolated under native conditions: a proteoglycan substituted with glycosaminoglycan chains; and a core protein form secreted devoid of glycosaminoglycans (Hocking, A.

Decorin and biglycan are small proteoglycans comprising chemically similar core proteins substituted at the N-terminal end with one or two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains, respectively. Despite the presumed structural similarity between biglycan and decorin (1Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), they have distinct patterns of temporal and spatial expression suggesting different functions. They are members of a family of glycoproteins grouped together on the basis of their presence in the extracellular matrix, and by virtue of a leucine-rich motif that dominates the core protein (for review, see Ref. 2Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Most of the members of this family exist in tissues as proteoglycans and have been labeled the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SLRP, small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CD, circular dichroism.1The abbreviations used are: SLRP, small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CD, circular dichroism. (3Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar).The protein core of decorin (Fig. 1 a) and biglycan (Fig.1 b) can be divided into distinct domains, based on amino acid sequence and specific post-translational modifications: a signal sequence that targets the nascent polypeptide to the secretory route; a shortpropeptide of highly charged amino acids that undergoes differential tissue- and cell- specific cleavage; an N-terminalglycosaminoglycan attachment region containing one (decorin) or two (biglycan) Ser-Gly dipeptide consensus sequences; a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that represents more than two thirds of the core protein and that is flanked by highly conserved disulfide-bonded cysteine clusters; and a short C-terminal domain. The core protein of decorin has three consensus sites for N-linked oligosaccharides; two of these sites are conserved in biglycan.The post-translational modifications of decorin and biglycan are complex and variable, wherein differentially glycosylated forms of these molecules have been isolated from tissues and cells. Decorin core protein devoid of a glycosaminoglycan chain has been isolated (4Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct.

J. 1988; 254: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although it is yet to be demonstrated whether this is due to post-secretory cleavage of the glycosaminoglycan attachment domain, or synthesis and secretion of core protein that bypasses the glycosaminoglycan synthetic machinery. There is evidence that members of the SLRP family may be “part time” proteoglycans. Overexpression of decorin and biglycan yields significant amounts of secreted core protein devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains (6Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1987; 198: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined by Kobe and Deisenhofer (11Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), which is usually present in tandem array and has been described in an increasing number of proteins, giving rise to a LRR superfamily. It is likely that the conserved residues of each LRR motif define the secondary structure, while the intervening residues determine specificity of interaction with ligands. In 1993, Kobe and Deisenhofer solved the crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitor (12Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), a LRR protein that consists of 15 repeats. This remains the only report of the detailed structure of a LRR protein and may provide a prototype for all LRR proteins. Each LRR consists of a β-strand parallel to an α-helix forming a hairpin structure, which is aligned parallel to a common axis resulting in a non-globular horseshoe-shaped protein. Binding of the ligand to the concave face (i.e. β-strands) results in a conformational change of the entire structure and increases the available surface area for binding.The LRR domain of the SLRP family members is unique within the superfamily in that it is flanked by cysteine clusters; at the N-terminal end of the LRR domain there are four similarly spaced cysteine residues in a 20-amino acid stretch that are involved in disulfide bonds; and at the C-terminal end there are two cysteine residues also believed to form an intrachain disulfide bond. The 24-amino acid LRR consensus for members of the SLRP family isX-X-(I/V/L)-X-X-X-X-(F/P/L)-X-X-(L/P)-X-X-L-X-X-(L/I)-X-L-X-X-N-X-(I/L), where X is any amino acid, and in the case where more than one amino acid is noted, the first occurs most often (2Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).Attempts have been made to predict the structure of decorin (and related molecules) based on the crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitor. Computer modeling, constrained by parameters established by the structure of ribonuclease inhibitor, have suggested that the decorin core protein forms an arch-shaped protein with the glycosaminoglycan chain and N-linked oligosaccharides situated on the same side of the molecule (1Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). High magnification rotary shadowing electron micrographs of scleral decorin reveal a similarly “horseshoe-shaped” molecule (13Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8795-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) consistent with the computer modeling prediction. However, the ribonuclease inhibitor is composed entirely of LRRs, whereas the N and C termini of SLRPs have extended non-LRR-containing domains. The inhibitor lacks cysteine clusters flanking the LRR domain, which, through intramolecular disulfide bond formation (14Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), might provide points of stabilization at either end of the LRR domain. The length of the decorin repeat motif is 24 residues, which is shorter than for ribonuclease inhibitor and may result in a restricted β-sheet. However, Kajava has recently modeled the LRR superfamily (15Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and has predicted that structures with horseshoe curvature are feasible for proteins with shorter leucine-rich repeats, although the different subfamilies may differ significantly in tertiary structure. It is also possible that the extensive glycosylation of SLRPs may influence the folding of the LRR domain.In the current study, our data indicate that recombinant human decorin and biglycan have different secondary structures in solution and marked differences in conformational stability, as assessed by circular dichroism and fluorescent spectroscopy. Furthermore, we provide evidence that both the conformation and stability of these molecules is variably influenced by whether they are synthesized with or without a glycosaminoglycan chain, whereas removal of polysaccharides after secretion has no appreciable influence on conformation or stability.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecombinant biglycan and decorin were expressed in the vaccinia/T7 bacteriophage system (6Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Hocking A.M. Strugnell R.A. Ramamurthy P. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19571-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both biglycan and decorin were synthesized as two glycoforms: a proteoglycan form, and a core protein form that was secreted devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains.Circular Dichroism SpectroscopyFar-UV CD spectra were measured for native recombinant biglycan and decorin glycoforms (Fig.2). Biglycan proteoglycan had spectra with minima at 220 nm (Fig. 2 a, solid circles); the CD spectra of decorin proteoglycan was different, with a minima at 218 nm and a broader curve (Fig.2 c, solid circles). Several deconvolution computer programs were used to facilitate an objective comparative analysis of the CD spectra, including SELCON (18Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), VARSELEC (19Toumadje A. Alcorn S.W. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), CCA (21Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and Contin (22Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) using file conversion software (SOFTSECTM: File Conversion for Windows, obtained from Softwood Co.). The estimated contribution of different structural motifs (i.e. β-sheet, β-turn, α-helix, random coil) varied between different deconvolution programs (data not shown), but it was nevertheless consistently determined that biglycan and decorin assumed different structures in solution. For instance, the method of Sreerama and Woody (18Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) predicted that the secondary structure of biglycan to be 30% α-helix, 14% β-sheet, 15% β-turn, and 46% random coil, whereas decorin comprised 8% α-helix, 44% β-sheet, 14% β-turn, and 33% random coil.Figure 2Far-UV CD spectra of biglycan proteoglycan (a), biglycan core protein (b), decorin proteoglycan (c), and decorin core protein (d), in phosphate buffer (●) and after equilibration in 10 m urea (○). The vertical dashed line is in an identical position in all panels and is provided to assist in curve comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)After equilibration of recombinant biglycan and decorin in 10m urea for 16 h, samples were analyzed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2, open circles). The CD spectra for both biglycan (Fig. 2 a, open circles) and decorin (Fig. 2 c, open circles) in 10 m urea reflected a loss of CD signal typical of an absence of secondary structure.CD spectroscopy was also used to examine the secondary structure of the core protein glycoforms of biglycan and decorin (Fig. 2). The CD spectra for the biglycan core protein in phosphate buffer had a minima at 215 nm (Fig. 2 b, solid circles), with a significantly broader curve than seen for the proteoglycan form (Fig. 2 a). Computer deconvolution analysis predicted that the secondary structure of biglycan core protein was significantly different to the proteoglycan form (13% α-helix, 36% β-sheet, 19% β-turn, and 37% random coil; Ref. 18Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Thus, the biglycan core protein, synthesized devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains, had a secondary structure that is different to the proteoglycan form. The effect of chondroitin sulfate chain addition on the secondary structure of biglycan and decorin core proteins was assessed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (to remove the glycosaminoglycan chains). There was no detectable difference between the spectra generated from undigested and digested proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycan chains, at 10-fold higher concentration than in samples analyzed in Fig. 2, did not contribute to the CD spectra (data not shown). Therefore, removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains from secreted proteoglycan does not significantly influence secondary structure.Comparison of the CD spectra of decorin core protein (Fig.2 d, solid circles) with the spectra of decorin proteoglycan (Fig. 2 b, solid circles) showed essentially identical curves with the minima of both glycoforms at 218 nm. The CD scans clearly show that decorin and biglycan have distinct secondary structures. Furthermore, biglycan synthesized and secreted devoid of chondroitin sulfate chains assumes a different structure to biglycan substituted with chondroitin sulfate. However, removal of the bulk of the chondroitin sulfate mass from biglycan after purification had no measurable influence on the structure. Biglycan appears to have more α-helical content in its secondary structure relative to biglycan core and decorin glycoforms, which are primarily β-sheet in structure. Decorin, on the other hand, appears to form the same structure in solution irrespective of substitution with chondroitin sulfate.Fluorescence SpectroscopyThe mature core protein of biglycan and decorin both have a single tryptophan residue situated between the two conserved cysteine residues at the C-terminal end of the core protein (Fig. 3 a). Peptide sequencing of bovine biglycan has shown that these cysteines form an intramolecular disulfide bond (14Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence in this region reveals that biglycan and decorin share 65% amino acid identity. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to analyze the environment of this tryptophan in native and denatured biglycan and decorin. The fluorescent intensity for all four glycoforms increased in the presence of 10 m urea (Fig. 3, b–e,closed circles) relative to the intensity in phosphate buffer (Fig. 3, b–e, solid circles). These data indicate that the emission from the tryptophan in the native glycoforms is quenched. Biglycan proteoglycan in PBS had a maximum emission wavelength of 342 nm (Fig. 2 b,open circles), and after denaturation the peak emission wavelength was shifted to 352 nm (Fig. 2 b,closed circles). The maximum emission wavelength of decorin proteoglycan in PBS was 345 nm (Fig. 2 d,solid circles); in 10 m urea, the emission wavelength shifted to 354 nm (Fig. 2 d,open circles). These results suggest that the tryptophan in native biglycan and decorin is partially buried; in denatured biglycan and decorin, the tryptophan is exposed to a polar environment.Figure 3Fluorescence emission spectra of recombinant glycoforms. a, amino acid sequence spanning the C-terminal disulfide-bonded cysteine domain of decorin (upper sequence) and biglycan (lower sequence). Conserved residues are indicated byvertical lines, and the conserved tryptophan (W) is boxed. Fluorescence emission spectra are shown for biglycan proteoglycan (b), biglycan core protein (c), decorin proteoglycan (d), and decorin core protein (e), in phosphate buffer (●) and after equilibration in 10 m urea (○). The vertical dashed line is in an identical position in all panels and is provided to assist in curve comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The magnitude of the peak emission wavelength shift for the native and denatured core protein forms of biglycan (Fig. 3 c) was similar to that observed for the proteoglycan form (Fig.3 b). The intrinsic fluorescence spectra for biglycan core protein revealed that the native protein had an emission maxima at 341 nm (Fig. 3 c, solid circles), which shifted to 353 nm for the denatured protein (Fig. 3 d,open circles). Therefore, it appears that the tryptophan is in a similar environment in both glycoforms of biglycan. The spectra for native decorin core protein had a peak emission wavelength maxima of 350 nm (Fig. 3 e, solid circles). The maxima for the fluorescence spectra of decorin core protein in 10 m urea was 355 nm (Fig. 3 e,open circles). The peak emission wavelength for decorin is different between core protein (350 nm) and proteoglycan (345 nm), which indicates that the microenvironment of the tryptophan in these two glycoforms may be different. The decorin core protein (Fig. 3 e) is more solvent-exposed in the native state relative to the decorin proteoglycan (Fig. 3 d). However, taken together, these subtle differences suggest that the C-terminal domain is structured similarly among all four glycoforms.Urea Denaturation CurvesTo further characterize structural differences between biglycan and decorin, the conformational stability was investigated. Urea denaturation curves were determined for each glycoform of biglycan and decorin. The CD spectra (shown in Fig. 2) revealed the maximal CD signal difference between native and denatured proteoglycan was at 220 nm, and this wavelength was used to monitor changes in the CD signal as unfolding occurred. The denaturation curves generated for the proteoglycan forms of biglycan and decorin are complex (Fig. 4), but highly reproducible, and were not amenable to curve fitting algorithms. The denaturation curve for biglycan proteoglycan indicates the protein is very susceptible to urea denaturation based on the limited pretransition baseline from 0–0.5 m urea (Fig.4 a). However, the transition from the folded to unfolded state occurs gradually from 1 to 6 m urea, and it is not clear where the post-transition baseline begins. The unfolding of biglycan proteoglycan probably proceeds through stable intermediates, reflecting sequential disruption of domains. Unfolding of decorin proteoglycan follows a simpler, possibly two-state, mechanism (Fig.4 c), with a pretransition baseline from 0 to 1.0m urea, a sharp transition between 1.0 and 2.0m urea, and an apparent post-transition baseline with increasing urea concentration.Figure 4Urea-induced unfolding of biglycan proteoglycan (a), biglycan core protein (b), decorin proteoglycan (c), and decorin core protein (d). Glycoproteins (10 μm) were equilibrated overnight in increasing concentrations of urea, and unfolding monitored by far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The urea-induced unfolding of the core protein glycoforms of biglycan and decorin was also examined. Biglycan core protein (Fig.4 b) had a pretransition between 0 and 1.5 murea, a sharp transition between 1.5 and 2.5 m, followed by a slowly increasing post-transition above 3.5 m urea. The denaturation curve for decorin core protein was similar to both the biglycan core protein and the decorin proteoglycan glycoforms, with a pretransition region at 0–1.0 m, a transition from 1.0 to 2.0 m urea, and a similar post-transitional baseline at higher urea concentrations (Fig. 4 d).Reversibility of UnfoldingReversibility of unfolding is an important parameter when defining conformational stability. All four glycoforms were equilibrated in 10 m urea and then diluted to a urea concentration of 1.0 m urea, at a final concentration of 10 μm. This preparation was compared with glycoforms (10 μm) that had been equilibrated directly in 1 or 10 m urea. The effect on secondary structure was examined by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Fig.5). All of the refolding profiles (Fig.5, triangles) demonstrate that none of the glycoforms were able to refold to their original conformation after exposure to 10m. The biglycan proteoglycan in PBS (Fig. 2 a,solid circles) and 1.0 m urea (Fig.5 a, solid circles) had similar CD profiles, with a minima of 215 nm. After exposure to 10 murea and subsequent dilution to 1 m urea, the minima shifted to 213 nm and the curve was significantly broader (Fig.5 a, triangles). Decorin proteoglycan equilibrated in 1 m urea overnight had a similar spectra to native proteoglycan (Fig. 5 c, closed circles). When the urea concentration was diluted back to 1m urea, the secondary structure was reproducibly different to the CD spectra of the native proteoglycan, exhibiting a minima at 214 nm and a significantly broader curve (Fig. 5 c,triangles). The biglycan core protein in PBS and in 1m urea (Fig. 5 b, squares) had a minima ∼218 nm, which was shifted to 209 nm in the refolded spectra (Fig. 5 b, triangles). The spectra for decorin core protein in 1 m urea (Fig. 5 d,circles) had a minima at 216 nm, and the refolded protein (Fig. 4 d, triangles) had a spectra with a minima at 214 nm. These spectra clearly demonstrate these refolded glycoforms do not appear to assume the same secondary structure as in the native state, under the conditions used. Indeed, it is possible that the refolded form has a molten globule-like structure that may regain a secondary structure but does not resemble the native folded protein (23Ptitsyn O.B. Curr. Opin.

Far-UV CD spectra of glycoprotein (10 μm) equilibrated overnight in 1 m urea (●) or 10 m urea (×), and 10 m urea for 6 h, then diluted into 1 m urea and allowed to equilibrate for 12 h (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, comparison of the biophysical properties of biglycan and decorin indicates that these small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans have different overall secondary structures, as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. However, fluorescence spectroscopy indicates that the conserved tryptophan in the C-terminal disulfide-bonded domain is in a similar environment for both biglycan and decorin. A qualitative analysis of conformational stability revealed the possibility of multiple transitions during urea-induced unfolding of biglycan proteoglycan; in contrast, biglycan core protein and the decorin glycoforms appear to follow a two-state unfolding mechanism. Glycosylation also had differential effects on the structure and stability of biglycan, but not decorin. The core protein form of biglycan is more stable than the proteoglycan, and they appear to assume different structures in solution. This is in contrast to the decorin core protein, which assumes a similar conformation independent of substitution with a glycosaminoglycan chain.A recent study by Font et al. (24Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed that fibromodulin, a member of the SLRP family, exhibited a CD spectra consistent with a predominantly β-sheet structure (minima at ∼210 nm). Furthermore, brief exposure to 6 m urea and heat (60 °C) did not irreversibly disrupt the secondary structure. This is in contrast to the present study, in which extended exposure to 10 m urea alone has serious consequences on the conformation of the core protein. Furthermore, thermal denaturation of biglycan or decorin (up to 60 °C) is not reversible (data not shown). This further illustrates that, despite the similarity of SLRP members at the amino acid level, and presumed evolutionary relatedness, there appears to be significant divergence in secondary structure and conformational stability. Functionally, this is likely to be critical to the differential biological activities and distribution of SLRP molecules (2Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).Glycosaminoglycans are long extended polymers of repeating disaccharide units. It is not unreasonable to speculate that these large polysaccharides can influence the structural conformation or stability of a protein. In this study, the chondroitin sulfate chains of biglycan may have a critical role in stabilizing the secondary structure of the protein during biosynthesis. Significant differences in the CD spectra of the native biglycan proteoglycan and core protein provide evidence that the presence of glycosaminoglycan chains can alter structure. It is unclear how the glycosaminoglycan affects the secondary structure, but it should be noted that this is not a general role in proteoglycans, as the gly"

The operon, which consisted of six genes, pufQ,pufB, pufA, pufL, pufM, and pufC, is a new variety in photosynthetic bacteria in the sense thatpufQ and pufC coexist. The amino acid sequence of the cytochrome subunit of the reaction center deduced from thepufC sequence revealed that this cytochrome contains only three possible heme-binding motifs; the heme-1-binding motif of the corresponding tetraheme cytochrome subunits was not present. This is the first exception of the “tetraheme” cytochrome family in purple bacteria and green filamentous bacteria. The pufC sequence also revealed that the sixth axial ligands to heme-1 and heme-2 irons were not present in the cytochrome either. This cytochrome was actually detected in membrane preparation as a 43-kDa protein and shown to associate functionally with the photosynthetic reaction center as the immediate electron donor to the photo-oxidized special pair of bacteriochlorophyll. This new cytochrome should be useful for studies on the role of each heme in the cytochrome subunit of the bacterial reaction center and the evolution of proteins in photosynthetic electron transfer systems.

This new cytochrome should be useful for studies on the role of each heme in the cytochrome subunit of the bacterial reaction center and the evolution of proteins in photosynthetic electron transfer systems. The photosynthetic pigment-protein system of purple bacteria consists of a reaction center (RC) 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase(s); MOPS, 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. complex and two light-harvesting complexes, LH1 and LH2. The light energy captured by LH1 and LH2 is transferred to the RC, where the primary photochemical reaction takes place. Two types of RC are known in purple bacteria. One has a tightly bound subunit of a c-type cytochrome at the periplasmic side that donates electrons to the photo-oxidized RC core complex. The other does not have the cytochrome subunit and accepts electrons directly from water-soluble electron carriers such as cytochrome c 2 (1Dutton P.L. Prince R.C. Clayton R.K. Sistron W.R.

A three-dimensional structure of the RC of Blastochloris (formerly calledRhodopseudomonas) viridis showed that the cytochrome subunit has four c-type hemes aligned along the long axis of this subunit (5Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). These four hemes are distinguishable in terms of the peak wavelengths of the α-bands and the redox midpoint potentials in B. viridis. It has been shown that the hemes are arranged sequentially with high-low-high-low midpoint potentials from the special pair of bacteriochlorophylls in the LM core, the core part of the reaction center complex composed of L and M subunits and cofactors (6Dracheva S.M. Drachev L.A. Konstantinov A.A. Semenov A.Y. Skulachev V.P. Arutjunjan A.M. Shuvalov V.A. Zaberezhnaya S.M. Eur. J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This alternate arrangement of hemes seems to be conserved through the cytochrome subunits of various purple bacteria, although its significance in the function has not been clarified (4Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Reaction Center Associated Cytochromes. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 775-805Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the cytochrome subunits of various purple bacteria have been reported, the sequence identities among the subunits being over 40% (9Nagashima K.V.P. Sakuragi Y. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 349-355Crossref Google Scholar). All of the sequences consistently conserve four heme-binding motifs (Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His) and methionine and histidine residues as the sixth axial ligands for the heme irons. The four heme-binding motifs were also conserved in a green filamentous bacterium, Chloroflexus aurantiacus, which is phylogenetically distant from purple bacteria (10Dracheva S. Williams J.A. Van Driessche G. Van Beeumen J.J. Blankenship R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11451-11458Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytochrome subunit has often been called a “tetraheme cytochrome.” When hemes are numbered according to the order in the amino acid sequence from the N terminus, the four hemes of the cytochrome subunit are arranged in the structure of the B. viridis RC in the order of heme-3, heme-4, heme-2, and heme-1 from the special pair in the membrane (11Weyer K.A. Lottspeich F. Gruenberg H. Lang F. Oesterhelt D. Michel H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we showed direct evidence through mutagenesis on the cytochrome subunit of Rubrivivax gelatinosus that electron transfer to the cytochrome subunit from soluble cytochromes occurred via electrostatic interactions between negatively charged amino acids surrounding heme-1 and positively charged amino acids on the soluble cytochromes (12Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a suggestion by Knaff et al. (13Knaff D.B. Willie A. Long J.E. Kriauciunas A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These charged residues on the cytochrome subunit are well conserved among many purple bacteria so far examined, suggesting that the most distant heme-1 works as a direct electron acceptor from the soluble electron carriers (9Nagashima K.V.P. Sakuragi Y. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 349-355Crossref Google Scholar). This indicates that all four hemes are involved in the electron transfer from the soluble carrier to the special pair. The RC complexes of purple bacteria are known to consist, at least, of L, M, and H subunits. Light-harvesting (LH) complexes are composed of two membrane spanning polypeptides, α and β subunits, which bind bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids. In purple photosynthetic bacteria, β and α polypeptides of the LH1 and the L and M polypeptides of RC are encoded by pufB, pufA, pufL, andpufM genes, respectively, which form an operon called “puf operon.” The H polypeptide of RC is encoded by the puhA gene that is out of the puf operon (14Youvan D.C.

In species with the bound cytochrome subunit, thepufC gene coding for the RC-bound c-type cytochrome is located immediately downstream of pufM in the operon. Some species have other genes in their puf operons.Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus have the pufQ gene upstream ofpufB and the pufX gene downstream ofpufM (17Bauer C.E. Young D.A.

In R. gelatinosus, two unidentified ORFs were detected in the puf operon (21Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Ohyama S. Shimada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2477-2484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An unidentified ORF was also found in Acidiphilium rubrum puf operon (22Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Wakao N. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purple photosynthetic bacteria are classified into three subclasses, α, β, and γ, based on the nucleotide sequences of 16 S rRNA. The α subclass is further divided into four subgroups, α1 to α4 (23Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 221-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α3 subgroup contains three genera of photosynthetic species,Rhodobacter, Rhodovulum, andRoseobacter. The genus Rhodobacter contains freshwater species, whereas the other two genera consist of marine species (24Hiraishi A. Ueda Y. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 15-23Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence data for puf operon are available in the species of Rhodobacter andRoseobacter but not in the Rhodovulum species. It has been reported that the RC of Roseobacter denitrificanscontains the cytochrome subunit (2Matsuura K. Shimada K. Current Research in Photosynthesis.

Gad'on N. Labahn A. Drews G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5247-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although closely related species such as R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroidesdo not contain this subunit (1Dutton P.L. Prince R.C.

The pufQ andpufX genes have been reported only in twoRhodobacter species (17Bauer C.E. Young D.A. Marrs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Davis J. Donohue T.G. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 320-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Farchaus J.W. Gruenberg H.

Acta. 1992; 1100: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Why species in α3 subclass show such varied structures of RCs and puf operons has not been determined yet. In the present study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of thepuf operon of a purple nonsulfur bacterium, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum. Results indicate that this bacterium has a unique RC-bound cytochrome subunit that has only three heme-binding motifs, one of which, in addition, lacks the amino acid residue functioning as the sixth ligand for the heme iron. Cells of R. sulfidophilum and R. sphaeroides were grown photosynthetically at 30 °C in screw-capped bottles filled with a PYS medium, as described by Nagashima et al. (26Nagashima K.V.P. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ForR. sulfidophilum, the PYS medium was supplemented with 0.35m sodium chloride. Cells of R. denitrificanswere grown aerobically in the dark at room temperature with a medium, as described by Shioi (27Shioi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 567-572Google Scholar). Escherichia coli was grown at 37 °C in a Luria-Bertani medium. When required, ampicillin (100 μg/ml; final concentration) was added to the medium. The R. sulfidophilum genomic cosmid library was constructed in our previous study (28.Masuda, S., Matsumoto, Y., Nagashima, K. V. P., Shimada, K., Inoue, K., Bauer, C. E., Matsuura, K., Proceedings of XIth International Congress on Photosynthesis, 1998, Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, in press.Google Scholar). The pufB and pufA and part of the pufL genes of R. sulfidophilum were amplified by polymerase chain reaction according to Hiraishi and Ueda (24Hiraishi A. Ueda Y. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 15-23Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The sequences of the two primers used for polymerase chain reaction, 5′-AGAGGGAGCTCGCATGA-3′ and 5′-CCGGGTTTGTAGTGGAA-3′, were well conserved in most purple bacteria at the 5′ end of thebchZ gene encoding an enzyme for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis and the 3′ end of the L subunit of RC, respectively (26Nagashima K.V.P. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragment was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP as instructed by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). This fragment was then used as the probe for colony hybridization to screen the wholepuf operon of R. sulfidophilum (Fig. 1,probe A). Nine positive clones were selected from the cosmid library. Inserted DNA fragments in one of the nine cosmid vectors were digested with EcoRI and screened by Southern blot hybridization using the same probe as described in the cosmid screening. An approximately 10-kb DNA fragment giving a positive signal was identified and cloned into the plasmid pUC118, being named pUFS101. This plasmid was used as the template for DNA sequencing, as described below. DNA manipulation, colony hybridization, Southern blot hybridization, and plasmid isolation were carried out according to a manual of molecular cloning (29Maniatis T. Fritsch F.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing of pUFS101 (see “Screening and Cloning of the puf Genes”) was performed using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and a 310A DNA Sequencer or a 377A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides designed to generate overlapping DNA sequences to complete the DNA sequence analysis (primer walking) were ordered from Life Technologies, Inc. The DNA sequences were analyzed using the DNASIS program (Hitachi). The total RNA of R. sulfidophilum was extracted with a RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). Electrophoresis of the total RNA of R. sulfidophilum was performed in 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (40 mm MOPS, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.2 m formaldehyde, pH 7.0). After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to the positively charged nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). The probe used for hybridization was the polymerase chain reaction product used for colony hybridization to screen the whole puf genes of R. sulfidophilum (Fig. 1, probe A) or the 1.2-kb DNA fragment corresponding to the pufC excised from pUFS101 byApaI endonuclease (Fig. 2, probe B). The DNA fragment was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP as instructed by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). RNA Molecular Weight Marker I (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as a molecular weight standard. Hybridization was carried out according to a manual of molecular cloning (29Maniatis T. Fritsch F.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells of R. sphaeroides were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with distilled water. Cells of R. sulfidophilum and R. denitrificans were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 100 mm sodium chloride. Washed cells were then centrifuged and suspended in a 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, supplemented with 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted with sonication and treated with DNaseI. Membrane fragments were collected by a method of differential centrifugation as a sedimented fraction between 7000 ×g for 20 min and 280,000 × g for 20 min. To obtain membrane preparations free of soluble electron carrier proteins, the membrane preparations were suspended in a 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, supplemented with 100 mm sodium chloride and 0.01% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 280,000 ×g for 20 min and then resuspended in the same buffer. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Heme staining was performed by the method of Thomas et al.(31Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The absorbance changes due to the photo-oxidation of cytochromes induced by xenon flash illumination in the membrane preparations free of soluble electron carrier proteins were recorded with a single beam spectrophotometer, as described previously (32Matsuura K. Fukushima A. Shimada K. Satoh T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 21-25Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A 10-kb DNA fragment showing a positive hybridizing signal to a polymerase chain reaction product containing R. sulfidophilum pufB,pufA, and pufL genes (Fig.1, probe A) was cloned into pUC118 and named pUFS101. The 5.4-kb region in the inserted DNA fragment was sequenced and analyzed, as shown in Fig.2. This nucleotide sequence had six ORFs, each of which had a consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence, GGAG (one GAGG), preceding the start codon, ATG. Comparisons with the pufgenes of other photosynthetic bacteria revealed that five of the six ORFs were pufB, pufA, pufL, pufM, and pufC, which encode the β and α subunits of the LH1 light-harvesting complex, and the L, M, and cytochrome subunits of the RC complex, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the remaining ORF upstream ofpufB showed significant sequence identities to those ofpufQ gene products of R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides, as shown in Fig. 3. The ORF was identified as pufQ, because it encodes a protein with 73 amino acids showing 37 and 38% identities to thepufQ gene products of R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides, respectively. The role of this gene product has not been fully clarified yet but has been suggested to be involved in the assembly of pigment-protein complexes and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis (33Bauer C.E. Marrs B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Gong L. Lee J.K. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 173: 2946-2961Crossref Google Scholar). The upstream region of the pufQ gene of R. sulfidophilum contained a nucleotide sequence showing significant sequence identity to bchZ, which encodes an enzyme for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis found in many purple bacteria (21Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Ohyama S. Shimada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2477-2484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Taylor D.P. Cohen S.N. Clark W.G. Marrs B.L. J.

An incompletely sequenced ORF found downstream ofpufC in R. sulfidophilum showed a high identity to the 5′ region of ORF 641 encoding the β-chain of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is located downstream of the puf operon in R. capsulatus and R. denitrificans (DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBankTM accession numbers Z11165 and X83392, respectively). Two putative hairpin structures were found betweenpufC and this ORF (Fig. 2). One of these structures had a 10-base pair stem part with a calculated free enthalpy of −28.1 kcal/mol followed by poly(T) residues. These findings indicate that thepuf operon of R. sulfidophilum is terminated after pufC. No other ORFs were found in R. sulfidophilum puf operon, leading to the conclusion that thepuf operon in this species is constructed with an order ofpufQ, pufB, pufA, pufL,pufM, and pufC, the combination of which has not been reported previously in other purple bacteria. Two additional putative hairpin loop structures were found betweenpufQ and pufB and pufA andpufL (Fig. 2). The locations of these two hairpin-loop structures are the same as those in the puf operon ofR. capsulatus (Fig. 1) (17Bauer C.E. Young D.A. Marrs B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hairpin loop betweenpufA and pufL has been suggested to work as an mRNA decay terminator for the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity, providing the necessary mRNA stability for the proper functioning of thepuf operon (39Zhu Y.S. Kiley P.J. Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10366-10374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Klug G. Adams C.W. Belasco J. Doerge B. Cohen S.N.

ApufC gene coding for the cytochrome subunit of RC was found in R. sulfidophilum puf operon (Figs. 1 and 2). The deduced amino acid sequence of PufC in R. sulfidophilum consisted of 356 amino acids with the calculated molecular weight of 39,145. The protein had the highest similarity to its homologue of R. denitrificans (40% identity). An amino acid sequence alignment of the cytochrome subunits of R. sulfidophilum and various purple bacteria is shown in Fig. 4. Surprisingly, one of the four conserved heme-binding motifs (Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His), corresponding to heme-1 in the tetraheme subunit of other species, was not detected in R. sulfidophilum,whereas three other possible heme-binding sites were conserved. Only in this bacterium, methionine residues functioning as the axial ligands to the first heme and the second heme irons (positions 118 and 157, respectively) (5Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar) were not conserved either. The putative α and β subunits of LH1 were composed of 54 and 48 amino acid residues, respectively, and showed the highest identities, exceeding 70%, with R. capsulatus. This subunits contained almost all amino acid residues commonly conserved in the corresponding polypeptides of other purple bacteria, including the histidine residues (32nd and 39th of the α and β subunits, respectively) presumed to bind bacteriochlorophylls (42Zuber H. Cogdell R.J. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Structure and Organization of Purple Bacterial Antenna Complexes. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 315-348Google Scholar). The alignment of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of M subunits from various purple bacteria is shown in Fig. 5. The additional 17–20 amino acids at the C terminus of the M subunit have been reported only in bacteria having RC-bound cytochrome subunits and are thought to contribute to the binding between the cytochrome subunit and the LM core (4Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Reaction Center Associated Cytochromes. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 775-805Google Scholar). R. sulfidophilum had the additional C-terminal sequence of the M subunit as well, although it was a little shorter than the others. Because the gene combination of thepuf operon of R. sulfidophilum was revealed to be different from those of other purple bacteria (Fig. 1) and the gene coding for the RC-bound cytochrome was unique, as described above, we performed Northern hybridization experiments to identify the transcripts of this puf operon. Results are shown in Fig.6. The total RNA was extracted from photosynthetically grown cells. Two probes were used for Northern hybridization (Fig. 1, probes A and B). One of the two probes corresponding to pufQBA and the part ofpufL (probe A, Fig. 6, lane 1) was hybridized strongly with a 0.6-kb band and weakly with an approximately 4.5-kb band. Another probe corresponding to pufC(probe B, Fig. 6, lane 2) was only hybridized with the approximately 4.5-kb band. In the Rhodobacterspecies, the transcript corresponding to pufQ was detected with the specific probes to the pufQ gene, and its band was almost the same in size as the pufBA transcript (34Gong L. Lee J.K. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 173: 2946-2961Crossref Google Scholar). The 0.6-kb band in Fig. 6, therefore, was likely to contain both thepufQ and the pufBA transcripts. The 4.5-kb transcript probably includes the whole puf operon,pufQ, pufB, pufA, pufL,pufM, and pufC. The 0.6-kb transcripts were more abundant than the 4.5-kb transcript. This difference may be due to abundance in pufBA transcripts, a factor thought to adjust the ratio of LH1 peptides to RC proteins (39Zhu Y.S. Kiley P.J. Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10366-10374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Klug G. Adams C.W. Belasco J. Doerge B. Cohen S.N. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins from R. sulfidophilumand from phylogenetically related species, R. denitrificansand R. sphaeroides, were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins containing c-type cytochromes were specifically stained (Fig. 7). The band at 43.1 kDa inR. sulfidophilum corresponds to the RC-bound cytochrome (lane 1). A similar band at 48.3 kDa was observed inR. denitrificans (lane 2) but not in R. sphaeroides (lane 3), consistent with the presence of the RC-bound cytochrome in the former two species and its absence in the last species (4Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Reaction Center Associated Cytochromes. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 775-805Google Scholar, 24Hiraishi A. Ueda Y. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 15-23Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Bands seen at 31.6, 35.7, and 34.5 kDa inlanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively, correspond to cytochrome c 1 in the cytochromebc 1 complex. The flash-induced absorbance changes in the α-band region of c-type cytochromes were observed in membrane preparations from R. sulfidophilum and the related species (Fig.8). The absence of soluble cytochromes in the preparation was ensured by treatment with a salt and a detergent (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fast photo-oxidation of the RC-bound cytochrome in R. sulfidophilum and R. denitrificans was observed as absorbance decreased at 554–540 nm, which is a characteristic feature of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit (Fig. 8 A, traces a and b). The transient spectra of cytochrome photo-oxidation are clearly seen in Fig. 8 B for R. sulfidophilum (circles) and R. denitrificans (triangles). On the other hand, no photo-oxidation of cytochromes was seen in the kinetics and spectrum of R. sphaeroides (Fig. 8, A,trace c, and B, squares). In this study, we found new characteristics in the nucleotide sequence of the puf operon of R. sulfidophilumand confirmed the presence and function of the product of a unique cytochrome gene. The R. sulfidophilum puf operon contained, from upstream, pufQ, pufB, pufA,pufL, pufM, and pufC genes, the combination of which has not been reported in other purple bacteria investigated so far in the sense that both pufQ andpufC are present in the operon. The amino acid sequence alignment of the RC-bound cytochrome subunits of R. sulfidophilum and various purple bacteria revealed that the heme-1-binding site (Fig. 4, position 131–135) is not conserved inR. sulfidophilum, although three other possible heme-binding sites were observed. Methionine residues at positions 118 and 157, which are thought to be the axial ligands to heme-1 and heme-2 irons, respectively, were not conserved either (Fig. 4). No alternatives for the heme-1-binding site and the two ligands were found in the sequence. Therefore, only two heme-binding sites bear similarity to those of the tetraheme cytochrome subunits in other purple bacteria in addition to the unusual heme-2-binding site. Northern hybridization analysis clearly indicated that the gene coding for this unique cytochrome subunit is transcribed as a part of puf operon as in other purple bacteria (Fig. 6). Low stringency genomic Southern hybridization experiments with a pufC-specific probe showed thatpufC is a single copy gene on the R. sulfidophilum chromosome (data not shown). These observations suggest that this bacterium has lost the heme-1 from the RC-bound cytochrome subunit. The SDS-PAGE analysis in combination with the heme-staining method (Fig. 7) indicates that pufC in R. sulfidophilumis indeed translated in vivo and the product is integrated into the membrane. Furthermore, the RC-bound cytochrome in the membrane of R. sulfidophilum is photoactive, as shown by the flash-induced absorbance changes (Fig. 8). The cytochrome subunit is presumed to accept electrons from water-soluble cytochromes and to transfer them to the photooxidized RC core complex. It has been shown that electron transfer reactions from soluble electron donors to the cytochrome subunit are controlled by charge interactions (12Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Knaff D.B. Willie A. Long J.E. Kriauciunas A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The study of site-directed mutagenesis inR. gelatinosus has shown that negatively charged amino acids (Glu) surrounding the heme-1 (positions 82, 113, and 129 in Fig. 4), which are well conserved among purple bacteria, have a stimulative effect on the rate of electron transfer, suggesting that the heme-1 of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit is a direct electron acceptor from soluble electron donors in purple bacteria (9Nagashima K.V.P. Sakuragi Y. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 349-355Crossref Google Scholar, 12Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The absence of a heme-1-binding domain in R. sulfidophilum suggests that the site of interaction with soluble cytochromes is different from that in usual purple bacteria. This idea is supported by the charge distribution on the surface of the cytochrome subunit, because the above-mentioned three glutamate residues that are suggested to be important for the interaction are not conserved in R. sulfidophilum (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that the electron transfer between the cytochrome subunit and soluble electron donors does not occur on the surface around the heme-1 but may occur around the other hemes of the cytochrome subunit in R. sulfidophilum. An unidentified interaction site on the cytochrome subunit will be revealed by the method of site-directed mutagenesis, as has been done in R. gelatinosus (12Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the cytochrome subunit in RC is still unclear, because some species of purple bacteria lack this subunit. Until now, the following properties of the subunit have been shown: 1) the four hemes are arranged sequentially with high-low-high-low midpoint potentials; 2) the subunit can reduce the photo-oxidized special pair of bacteriochlorophylls faster than the soluble cytochromes; and 3) the heme-1 of the cytochrome is a site involved in the electron flow from soluble electron carriers, indicating that all four hemes of the subunit are likely to be involved in electron transfer toward the photo-oxidized special pair of bacteriochlorophylls (12Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Knaff D.B. Willie A. Long J.E. Kriauciunas A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The existence of a cytochrome subunit containing only three hemes, including one unusual heme in R. sulfidophilum,suggests that all four hemes and the arrangement of high-low-high-low midpoint potentials are not essential requirements for the functions of the subunit. We have previously reported that a R. gelatinosus mutant lacking the cytochrome subunit is able to grow photosynthetically (43Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Possibly, the main role of the cytochrome subunit is to reduce the photo-oxidized special pair of bacteriochlorophyll fast enough to avoid the electron backflow (“back reaction”) from the ubiquinone to the oxidized special pair. Rhodobacter species do not have thepufC gene coding for the subunit, having a pufXgene at that position instead (Fig. 1). Because the PufX has been suggested to be involved in efficient electron transfer from the RC to the bc 1 complex (19Farchaus J.W. Gruenberg H. Oesterhelt D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 977-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lilburn T.G. Haith C.E. Prince R.C. Beatty J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it may also reduce the back reaction. Thus, PufX may be a functional alternative of the cytochrome subunit in photosynthetic electron transport in theRhodobacter species. However, some purple photosynthetic bacteria, at least Rhodospirillum rubrum, have neitherpufC nor pufX genes in the puf operon. This bacterium may have other systems to reduce the possibilities of back reaction. It should be noted that the pufQ gene was found in R. sulfidophilum puf operon that had been detected only in theRhodobacter species (Fig. 1). This gene product was suggested to be an integral membrane protein involved in the assembly of pigment-protein complexes and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis (33Bauer C.E. Marrs B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,34Gong L. Lee J.K. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 173: 2946-2961Crossref Google Scholar). The hydropathy profile of the pufQ gene product ofR. sulfidophilum showed high similarities to those ofR. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides (data not shown). Characterization of pufQ gene in R. sulfidophilum would be useful for further understanding of its role. Finally, the study presented here clearly demonstrated that R. sulfidophilum utilizes a unique RC-bound cytochrome subunit that contains only three heme-binding sites. Our preliminary experiments of the membrane redox titration showed the unique characteristic of the subunit in that the redox potentials of these three hemes were −380, −20, and +360 mV, the middle one showing an unusual absorbance spectrum. Further biochemical and biophysical studies of this cytochrome subunit will help us to understand not only the physiological significance of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit but also the evolution of RC complexes and electron transfer systems in photosynthetic bacteria."

Miniglucagon, which does not interfere with the adenylyl cyclase activity, inhibits at picomolar concentrations the hepatic plasma membrane calcium pump (10Mallat A. Pavoine C. Dufour M. Lotersztajn S. Bataille D. Pecker F. Nature. 1987; 325: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On cultured cardiac myocytes, miniglucagon was shown to potentiate at nanomolar concentrations the positive inotropic effect of glucagon, whereas, when used alone at picomolar concentrations, it displayed a negative inotropic effect on myocyte contraction (11Pavoine C.

These observations suggested a new role for glucagon as a prohormone and a biological role for miniglucagon as a daughter hormone that modulates the effects of the mother hormone (12Bataille D. Kuroki Sho. Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Dufour M. Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Brechler V. Pecker F. Biomed. Res. 1992; 13: 137-142Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pancreas is the only known tissue in which miniglucagon is present in a stored form, at molar concentrations in the range of 2–5% of that of glucagon (13Blache P. Kervran A.

In view of preliminary results suggesting that miniglucagon is able to inhibit glucose- and glucagon-induced insulin release (12Bataille D. Kuroki Sho. Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Dufour M. Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Brechler V. Pecker F. Biomed.

Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), in particular a response to glucose in the physiological range. We have also explored the intracellular pathway through which miniglucagon inhibits insulin release. We show here that miniglucagon, in a concentration range (starting at 10−14–10−13m) which fits with the amount of peptide presumably present in the extracellular medium within the islets, is able to suppress by 80–100% the insulin release stimulated by molecules known to open voltage-dependent calcium channels such as glucose, glucagon, tGLP-1, or glibenclamide, but not the insulin release stimulated by carbachol, a molecule known to increase InsP3 and cytosolic Ca2+. Miniglucagon had no effect on the cellular cyclic AMP levels but suppressed secretagogue-induced calcium entry. Miniglucagon induced a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and thus probably inhibited the action of all those secretagogues via an indirect inhibition of the voltage-dependent l-type calcium channels. The miniglucagon action on insulin release was suppressed after pre-treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. It is proposed that miniglucagon, present in pancreatic A-cells, acts as a local inhibitory regulator of insulin release by turning off the main external calcium source for β cells via a specific receptor linked, through a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein, to ion channels that control the cell polarity. Nle27 miniglucagon was synthesized in our laboratory (15Le-Nguyen D. Dufour M. Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Bataille D. Shiba T. Sakakibara S. Peptide Chemistry.

Insulin release was determined using a static incubation method in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C with cells in exponential growth. The medium culture was changed 18 h before the experiments. Insulin secretion from MIN6 cells monolayers was performed in HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (119 mmol/liter NaCl; 4 mmol/liter KCl; 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4; 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4; 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2; 20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5) containing 0.5% BSA (KRB buffer). The day of the experiment, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with 500 μl of KRB buffer. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in 500 μl of KRB buffer containing 1 mmol/liter glucose in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. This buffer was removed, and MIN6 cells were then preincubated for 2 h in 500 μl of KRB buffer containing varying concentrations of glucose and other test agents. At the end of the incubation period, media were collected, and floating cells, if any, were eliminated by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Insulin in supernatants was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (16Kervran A. Rieutort M. Guillaume M. Diabetes. Metab. 1976; 2: 67-72Google Scholar), using125I-insulin, rat insulin standard, and anti-insulin porcine antiserum. Briefly, the assay was performed in a final volume of 500 μl of 0.025 m borate buffer containing 0.5% BSA. After a 4-day incubation at 4 °C, separation of free insulin was realized using activated charcoal (5 g/100 ml in 0.1 mborate buffer) after addition of 100 μl/sample horse serum. After dilution and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min, the pellet was counted in a γ-scintillation counter (LKB-Wallac). MIN6 cells were grown in 24-well plates for 3–5 days under the same conditions as for insulin release. The medium was changed 1 day before the experiments. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 4.5 mmol/liter glucose without fetal calf serum before the addition of 500 μl of DMEM buffer supplemented with 1% BSA and 1 mm IBMX as an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase and containing the test substances. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were extracted using 60% perchloric acid, the sample was neutralized with 9 N KOH succinylated to increase the sensitivity of the assay (17Delaage M.A. Roux D. Cailla H.L. Folco G. Paoletti R. Molecular Biology and Pharmacology of Cyclic Nucleotides. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1978: 151-171Google Scholar), and cyclic AMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay. 24 h before the experiment, the culture medium was changed. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed twice with 500 μl of KRB buffer and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 250 μl of KRB buffer containing 1 mmol/liter glucose in 5% CO2, 95% air. The preincubation solution was then replaced by 250 μl of KRB containing 8 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK; 5–50 mCi/mg Ca) and the test agents. The reaction, developed at 37 °C, was stopped by aspiration of the medium. The cells were rapidly washed four times with ice-cold buffer (135 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm lanthanium chloride, 10 mm HEPES). The cells were then solubilized in 1 ml of KRB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. An aliquot of the solution (100 μl) was then assayed for 45Ca2+ content in a β-counter after addition of a liquid scintillation medium (Complete Phase Combining System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated onto plastic Petri dishes and maintained in tissue culture prior to use. For whole-cell voltage clamp, cells were chosen that were rounded and apparently single. For current-clamp recording, both single cells and clusters of cells were used. To maintain cell metabolism and second-messenger systems intact, membrane currents and potential were recorded using the perforated-patch whole-cell technique as described previously (18Hughes S.J. Faehling M. Proks P. Thorneley C.W. Smith P.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Fewtrell C.M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 767-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ca2+ currents were measured using voltage clamp with a bath solution that contained (in mm) 108 NaCl, 30 TEACl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose and 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 76 Cs2SO4, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Perforation was obtained by the addition of 0.2 μg ml–1 amphotericin B to the pipette solution and was considered adequate when the series conductance was > 40 nS (mean 69 ± 8 nS, n = 10). Inward Ca2+currents were elicited by stepping the membrane to potentials positive to −60 mV for 250 ms at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. The holding potential was −70 mV. Currents flowing because of leak conductances and uncompensated capacitance were removed by subtracting the scaled average of currents elicited by voltage steps to −60, −80, and −90 mV. To control for variation in cell size, currents have been normalized to the cell capacitance (mean 7.3 ± 0.5 picofarad,n = 10). Membrane potential was monitored using current clamp with the same solutions used for the measurement of Ca2+ currents except that TEACl in the bath was replaced with NaCl, glucose was added as required, and Cs+ in the pipette was replaced with K+. Currents and potentials are referenced to the pipette in the bath. No corrections have been made for liquid junction potentials (<4 mV) or series resistance errors (<2 mV). All experiments were conducted at 32 ± 1 °C. Results were analyzed by Student'st test for unpaired data. We first analyzed the response of our batches of MIN6 cells to classical secretagogues, namely glucose (an indirect depolarizing agent), glucagon, and tGLP-1 (potentiators of glucose-induced insulin release via a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway), and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide (a blocker of ATP-dependent potassium channels). These molecules increased, at concentrations similar to that observed in other biological models, insulin release from this beta cell line: glucose, at 20 mm, induced a 6-fold increase in this parameter as compared with base line measured at 1 mmglucose, the half-maximal response being achieved at around 10 mm (Fig. 1,inset). As shown in Fig. 1, insulin release was also dose-dependently stimulated by glucagon (EC50 = 10.1 ± 0.15 nm) and tGLP-1 (EC50 = 1.32 ± 0.2 nm), as well as (data not shown) by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide (EC50 ≈ 20 nm), all experiments being run in the presence of 10 mmglucose. As shown in Fig.2 A, miniglucagon dose-dependently inhibited the 10 mmglucose-induced insulin release. The threshold dose for the miniglucagon effect was observed between 0.01 and 0.1 pm, EC50 was around 2 pm, and a virtually complete inhibition was noted at 1 nm miniglucagon. In Fig.2 B, it may be seen that miniglucagon also dose-dependently inhibited 20 nmglibenclamide-induced insulin release in a range starting in the sub-picomolar concentrations with an IC50 around 0.3 pm. In Fig. 3, A andB, it may be seen that miniglucagon also dose-dependently inhibited 10 nmglucagon-induced or 10 nm tGLP-1-induced insulin release, again at threshold doses between 0.01 and 0.1 pm. Half-maximal effects were noted at concentrations close to 1 pm, and again, a very large proportion (around 90%) of the stimulated secretion was suppressed at 1 nm miniglucagon (Fig. 3, A and B). Because glucagon and tGLP-1 are known to stimulate insulin releasevia a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway (20Rajan A.S. Hill R.S. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we determined whether miniglucagon might modify the B-cell cyclic AMP content. Both tGLP-1 and glucagon stimulated by a 2-fold factor cyclic AMP production in MIN6 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). As expected from the data obtained when insulin release was studied, glucagon (EC50 = 3.17 ± 0.05, n = 4) was less potent than tGLP-1 (EC50 = 1.34 ± 0.1, n = 4) (Fig. 4). In contrast, miniglucagon did not display any effect on basal or on glucagon- or tGLP-1-stimulated cyclic AMP production. These results clearly indicate that miniglucagon inhibits both glucagon- and tGLP-1- stimulated insulin release without interfering with the cyclic AMP pathway. Because glucose, sulfonylureas, glucagon, and tGLP-1 have the common ability to induce calcium entry, we determined whether miniglucagon might also inhibit insulin release stimulated by a secretagogue known to act mainly via a calcium release from intracellular stores. For that purpose, we used the cholinergic agonist carbachol, known to potentiate glucose-induced insulin release. As shown in Fig. 5, miniglucagon was unable to modify the 10 μm (Fig. 5 A) or the 1 μm carbachol-induced (Fig. 5 B) insulin release in the range of 0.01 to 100 pm, which was shown to deeply affect the stimulatory effect of glucose, sulfonylurea, glucagon, or tGLP-1. However, a significant inhibition was noted of the highest (1 nm) miniglucagon dose both at 1 and 10 μmcarbachol. It is apparent from all these data that miniglucagon acts on the beta cell through a pathway that is shared by glucose, glucagon, tGLP-1, and sulfonylureas but not by carbachol. Because calcium influx through L type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) has a key role in secretagogue-induced insulin release (29Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), VDCC are a good candidate for being this common step. We therefore tested the modulating effect of miniglucagon on Ca2+ influx triggered by the above secretagogues. As shown in Fig.6 A, miniglucagon dose-dependently inhibited 10 mmglucose-induced Ca2+ influx with an IC50 around 1 pm. Similarly, miniglucagon totally suppressed the potentiating effect of 10 nm glucagon plus 10 mm glucose-induced Ca2+ influx (Fig.6 B). Miniglucagon displayed significant effects at doses as low as 0.1 pm on these Ca2+ influx. Taken together, our findings strongly suggested that miniglucagon inhibits insulin release by blocking the secretagogue-induced Ca2+influx into the beta cells. Given the importance of VDCC in secretagogue-induced insulin release (23Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W.G. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 29Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that miniglucagon might affect the behavior of this particular channel. To address this issue, we designed the following series of experiments. First, an opener of L type Ca2+ channels, Bay K-8644 (24Brown A.M. Kunze D.L. Yatani A. Nature. 1984; 311: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), was used to open the channel under conditions of 10 mm glucose stimulation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, miniglucagon was able in the range 0.01 pm to 1 nm to totally suppress the Bay K-8644-induced Ca2+ influx, displaying significant effects at doses as low as 0.01 pm. For comparison, 1 nm miniglucagon was as effective as 2 μm nifedipine (Fig. 7 A), a direct inhibitor of L type Ca2+ channels (25Bechem M. Hebish S. Schramm M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As additional proof of the identity of the type of Ca2+ channel involved in the miniglucagon action and because opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels may be obtained by membrane depolarization, we analyzed whether miniglucagon was able to suppress a potassium-induced Ca2+ influx similar in size to that induced by physiological insulin secretagogues. As shown in Fig.7 B, miniglucagon, in the 0.01 pm to 1 nm dose range, almost totally suppressed the 10 mm potassium-induced Ca2+ influx. The above data suggest that the inhibitory effect of miniglucagon on insulin release is because of closure of L type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. To address the hypothesis of a direct or an indirect effect of the miniglucagon on these calcium channels, we tested the effect of miniglucagon 1) on L type Ca2+ currents and 2) on the MIN6 cell electrical activity that controls Ca2+ influx (26Cook D.L. Perara E. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Drews G. Debuyser A. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1646-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Pace C.S. Murphy M. Conant S. Lacey P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: C164-C171Crossref Google Scholar, 29Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. Inward Ca2+currents were elicited at potentials positive to −60 mV. They were characterized by a rapid rising phase that peaked and then slowly inactivated to a steady state level (Fig.8 A). Both the peak- and steady state current-voltage relationships are bell-shaped. The maximum inward current occurs at approximately +10 mV and reverses at potentials positive to +40 mV (Fig. 8 C). The relationship between integrated Ca2+ entry and voltage mirrors that of current with voltage. Maximum Ca2+ influx occurred at approximately +10 mV (Fig. 8 D). After 5 min of perfusion of 10−10mminiglucagon, a concentration that inhibits insulin secretion by 93% (Fig. 2 A), the Ca2+ currents remained unchanged in seven cells tested (two examples displayed in Fig. 8 B). Neither the peak nor the steady state current-voltage relationship were affected by the hormone (Fig. 8 C). The integral Ca2+ entry was also unaffected by the peptide (Fig.8 D). A lack of effect of 10−10mminiglucagon on Ca2+ currents was also observed in single beta cells isolated from normal mice (data not shown, n= 4). These data indicate that miniglucagon does not reduce Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion from MIN6 cells by a direct block of the Ca2+ channels. Somatostatin, at a concentration (10−9m) that inhibits insulin secretion by 45% was also without effect on Ca2+ currents (data not shown, n = 2), as previoulsy shown in beta cells isolated from normal mice (30Renstrom E. Ding W.G. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Neuron. 1996; 17: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We next investigated the effect of the peptide on the membrane potential and electrical activity induced by glucose. The electrical activity of the beta cell results from the complex interplay of several different ionic conductances (29Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in electrical activity can be used as a sensitive detector of the effect of drugs and hormones on ion channels. Furthermore, glucose-induced insulin secretion is directly controlled by the Ca2+ influx that results from the Ca2+-dependent action potential activity induced by this secretagogue. Therefore, any minor change in ion channel behavior and electrical activity will have major effects on insulin secretion. In the absence of exogenous metabolite, the membrane potential of the MIN6 cell was electrically silent with a mean value of −65 ± 1 mV (n = 18). In 19 cells tested, the membrane potential began to depolarize within 33 ± 13 s (n = 11) of the addition of 10 mm glucose. After 51 ± 4 s, the membrane potential was sufficiently depolarized (−48 ± 2 mV, n = 8) to evoke electrical activity (Fig. 9 A). In the majority of cases, this consisted of continuous firing of action potentials. However in three instances, the clustering of action potentials into burst-like electrical activity was observed. These were reminiscent of the typical bursting behavior observed in the intact islet (data not shown) (29Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pace C.S. Tarvin J.T. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In three of nine cells tested, 10−10m miniglucagon reduced the frequency of action potential firing. In four cells tested, 10−9m miniglucagon consistently caused the membrane potential to hyperpolarize, which terminated the electrical activity. The membrane potential hyperpolarized to −64 ± 4 mV, a value close to that found in the absence of glucose (−68 ± 2 mV for the same cells). The hyperpolarization was also associated with a decrease in voltage noise and a reduction in the input resistance of the cell. Taken together these data are consistent with miniglucagon activating a potassium conductance. A 10-fold high dose of miniglucagon (10−8m) had similar effects. In three cells tested, 10−7m somatostatin produced very similar effects to 10−9mminiglucagon: hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and abolition of the electrical activity. These effects of somatostatin are very similar to those that have been previously reported for beta cells, isolated from normal mouse using a similar concentration of peptide (30Renstrom E. Ding W.G. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Neuron. 1996; 17: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Pace C.S. Tarvin J.T. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is known from other studies (32Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Brechler V. Roche B. Dufour M. Le-Nguyen D. Bataille D. Pecker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9876-9880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that miniglucagon is active through a specific receptor linked to at least one type of GTP binding protein (G protein). To determine the type of G protein involved in the action of miniglucagon on beta cells, we analyzed whether pretreating MIN6 cells with pertussis toxin would modify the effectiveness of miniglucagon on secretagogue-induced insulin release. First, both control and toxin-pretreated MIN6 cells (200 ng/ml, overnight) responded to an elevation of glucose from 1 to 25 mm with an increased rate of insulin release, although toxin-pretreated cells consistently showed a higher secretory rate at glucose 10 mm (data not shown). An overnight pretreatment of the cells with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin completely suppressed the inhibitory effect of 0.1 μm somatostatin and 1 nm miniglucagon on 10 mm glucose-induced insulin release (Fig. 10). Because it was shown that adrenaline may activate, via the α2 receptors, potassium channels in a G protein-sensitive manner (38Rorsman P. Bokvist K. Ämmälä C. Arkhammar P. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Wahlander K. Nature. 1991; 349: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we have verified that yohimbine, an α2-receptor blocker, did not interfere with the miniglucagon action. Indeed, 10 mm glucose-induced insulin release by MIN6 cells was inhibited by 0.1 nmminiglucagon to the same extent in the absence and in the presence of 10 μm yohimbine (data not shown). Within the general mechanisms of proglucagon processing leading to various peptide fragments with different biological roles (7Bataille D. Lefebvre P.J. Glucagon III, Handbook Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 31-51Google Scholar), processing of glucagon into miniglucagon at its Arg17-Arg18 doublet displays many singularities. (i) The site is not a typical processing site for prohormone convertases (PCs) which use mostly Lys-Arg or Arg-Lys doublets (33Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 34Thomas L. Leduc R. Thorne B.A. Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or more complex combinations such as the R-X-K/R-R used by furin (35Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we showed that glucagon is cleaved at its dibasic site by an original protease referred to as MGE, which was isolated from liver membranes (6Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Dufour M. Cohen-Solal A. Duckworth W. Bataille D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21748-21753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and characterized as a 100-kDa protein (6Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Dufour M. Cohen-Solal A. Duckworth W. Bataille D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21748-21753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal product of the reaction, glucagon 19–29 or “miniglucagon,” displays original features, in particular it modulates the hepatic plasma membrane calcium pump (10Mallat A. Pavoine C. Dufour M. Lotersztajn S. Bataille D. Pecker F. Nature. 1987; 325: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and plays a role in the inotropic and chronotropic action of glucagon (11Pavoine C. Brechler V. Kervran A. Blache P. Le-Nguyen D. Laurent S. Bataille D. Pecker F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C993-C999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its activity is mediated by a specific receptor that remains to be characterized but that is already known to be linked to G proteins (32Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Brechler V. Roche B. Dufour M. Le-Nguyen D. Bataille D. Pecker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9876-9880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The miniglucagon action is observed at picomolar concentrations, that is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the active concentrations of glucagon, the mother hormone. (iii) The strikingly high clearance rate of the peptide from circulation, mostly because of its very rapid degradation by the liver (8Blache P. Kervran A. Dufour M. Martinez J. Le-Nguyen D. Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Bataille D. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1989; 308, Série 3: 467-472Google Scholar, 13Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Laur J. Cohen-Solal A. Devilliers G. Mangeat P. Martinez J. Bataille D. Biomed. Res. 1988; 9 Suppl. 3: 19-28Google Scholar), precludes any hormonal status. Accordingly, a role as a “daughter peptide”, released locally from circulating glucagon and modulating the action of the mother hormone just before being degraded, was established (7Bataille D. Lefebvre P.J. Glucagon III, Handbook Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 31-51Google Scholar, 12Bataille D. Kuroki Sho. Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Dufour M. Lotersztajn S. Pavoine C. Brechler V. Pecker F. Biomed. Res. 1992; 13: 137-142Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of miniglucagon in pancreas (13Blache P. Kervran A. Le-Nguyen D. Laur J. Cohen-Solal A. Devilliers G. Mangeat P. Martinez J. Bataille D. Biomed. Res. 1988; 9 Suppl. 3: 19-28Google Scholar) and in a pancreatic alpha cell line 2P. Blache and M. Dufour, unpublished data. at molar concentrations ranging from 2 to 5% of that of glucagon suggested a role for miniglucagon in islet physiology. Our study was designed in light of this background. As an in vitro model of pancreatic beta cell, we used the MIN6 cell line which displays most of the features of authentic beta cells, in particular the graded release of insulin in response to physiological concentrations of glucose (14Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and to several other insulin-secretagogues. Here we show that miniglucagon is a highly potent and efficient inhibitor of insulin release. In view of the miniglucagon concentrations in the alpha cells (2 orders of magnitude lower than that of glucagon) and if we suppose, as a working hypothesis, that glucagon and miniglucagon are released at the same rate, then it is logical to expect an effect of miniglucagon in the 10−11m range because glucagon acts on beta cells, and on other target cells, in the nanomolar range (36Kofod H. Andreu D. Thams P. Merrifield R.B. Hedeskov C.J. Hansen B. Lernmark Å. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: E454-E458PubMed Google Scholar). The threshold effects of miniglucagon observed in the 10−13 to 10−12m range gives miniglucagon the status of a possible local regulator of insulin release even if the peptide is released at a much lower rate than glucagon. Further studies are required, however, to analyze the conditions under which miniglucagon is released from the alpha cells to get further insight in the precise role of miniglucagon in islet physiology. Miniglucagon has the characteristics of a very potent and efficient inhibitor of insulin release triggered by secretagogues known to act largely via calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. These channels may be activated by membrane depolarization induced either by changes in extracellular K+ concentration or via closure ofK ATP channels (e.g. glucose and sulfonylurea), by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation (e.g. glucagon and tGLP-1), or by direct action of a pharmacological agent (e.g. Bay K-8644). We report here that miniglucagon is able to completely inhibit calcium uptake elicited by glucose, high extracellular K+, glucagon, or tGLP-1 and Bay K-8644. It was thus of particular importance to determine how miniglucagon acts on calcium channels. First, as miniglucagon is unable to modify cyclic AMP levels, we can conclude that the peptide does not modulate l-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels via cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Another possibility was that miniglucagon acts directly on Ca2+channels via a G protein, as shown for acetylcholine (37Gilon P. Yakel J. Gromada J. Zhu Y. Henquin J.C. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 65-76Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, from electrophysiological experiments, we were able to determine that the peptide does not have a direct effect on the beta cell Ca2+ channels. Third, miniglucagon was able to alter transmembranous cationic fluxes, as manifested by hyperpolarization, and to decrease the incidence of spike activity elicited by glucose. This provides a strong indication that miniglucagon acts by opening potassium channels, triggering a membrane hyperpolarization and thus suppressing the ability of secretagogues to open voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. It is noteworthy that, similarly to somatostatin, galanin or adrenaline (30Renstrom E. Ding W.G. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Neuron. 1996; 17: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Rorsman P. Bokvist K. Ämmälä C. Arkhammar P. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Wahlander K. Nature. 1991; 349: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the miniglucagon receptor is linked to its main effector (probably the potassium channels) via a pertussis-sensitive G protein. On the other hand, one of the originalities of miniglucagon is that it has no effect on cyclic AMP, indicating that a peptide may trigger a deep and long term inhibition of insulin release without modifying this parameter and suggesting that the miniglucagon receptor interacts with a G protein, or a set of G proteins that differ from that interacting with somatostatin and galanin receptors. Determining the precise type of G protein involved in the miniglucagon action, characterizing the beta cell miniglucagon receptor linked to this G protein and analyzing the physiological conditions of miniglucagon release inside the islets, in a dependent or independent manner as compared with that of glucagon, are new issues in the development of this research on this newly discovered potential physiological mechanism by which an islet cell may control insulin release. Analysis of this mechanism in pathological states may also shed a new light on particular aspects of diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2093459027,"Cyclophilin B is a cyclosporin A-binding protein exhibiting peptidyl-prolyl <i>cis/trans</i> isomerase activity. We have previously shown that it interacts with two types of binding sites on T lymphocytes. The type I sites correspond to specific functional receptors and the type II sites to sulfated glycosaminoglycans. The interactions of cyclophilin B with type I and type II sites are reduced in the presence of cyclosporin A and of a synthetic peptide mimicking the N-terminal part of cyclophilin B, respectively, suggesting that the protein possesses two distinct binding regions. In this study, we intended to characterize the areas of cyclophilin B involved in the interactions with binding sites present on Jurkat cells. The use of cyclophilin B mutants modified in the N-terminal region demonstrated that the <sup>3</sup>Lys-Lys-Lys<sup>5</sup> and<sup>14</sup>Tyr-Phe-Asp<sup>16</sup> clusters are probably solely required for the interactions with the type II sites. We further engineered mutants of the conserved central core of cyclophilin B, which bears the catalytic and the cyclosporin A binding sites as an approach to localize the binding regions for the type I sites. The enzymatic activity of cyclophilin B was dramatically reduced after substitution of the Arg<sup>62</sup> and Phe<sup>67</sup>residues, whereas the cyclosporin A binding activity was destroyed by mutation of the Trp<sup>128</sup> residue and strongly decreased after modification of the Phe<sup>67</sup> residue. Only the substitution of the Trp<sup>128</sup> residue reduced the binding of the resulting cyclophilin B mutant to type I binding sites. The catalytic site of cyclophilin B therefore did not seem to be essential for cellular binding and the cyclosporin A binding site appeared to be partially involved in the binding to type I sites."
https://openalex.org/W2123586247,"The inability of the S17N mutant of Rap1A to sequester the catalytic domain of the Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (van den Berghe, N., Cool, R. H., Horn, G., and Wittinghofer, A. (1997) Oncogene 15, 845-850) prompted us to study possible fundamental differences in the way Rap1 interacts with C3G compared with the interaction of Ras with the catalytic domain of the mouse Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc25(Mm). A variety of mutants in both Ras and Rap1A were designed, and both the C3G and Cdc25(Mm) catalyzed release of guanine nucleotide from these mutants was studied. In addition, we could identify regions in Rap2A that are responsible for the lack of recognition by C3G and induce high C3G activity by replacement of these residues with the corresponding Rap1A residues. The different Ras and Rap mutants showed that many residues were equally important for both C3G and Cdc25(Mm), suggesting that they interact similarly with their substrates. However, several residues were also identified to be important for the exchange reaction with only C3G (Leu70) or only Cdc25(Mm) (Gln61 and Tyr40). These results are discussed in the light of the structure of the Ras-Sos complex and suggest that some important differences in the interaction of Rap1 with C3G and Ras with Cdc25(Mm) indeed exist and that marker residues have been identified for the different structural requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1992732990,"Formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement on host cells is inhibited by the membrane-bound glycoprotein, CD59. The inhibitory activity of CD59 is species restricted, and human CD59 is not effective against rat complement. Previous functional analysis of chimeric human/rat CD59 proteins indicated that the residues responsible for the species selective function of human CD59 map to a region contained between positions 40 and 66 in the primary structure. By comparative analysis of rat and human CD59 models and by mutational analysis of candidate residues, we now identify the individual residues within the 40–66 region that confer species selective function on human CD59. All nonconserved residues within the 40–66 sequence were substituted from human to rat residues in a series of chimeric human/rat CD59 mutant proteins. Functional analysis revealed that the individual human to rat residue substitutions F47A, T51L, R55E, and K65Q each produced a mutant human CD59 protein with enhanced rat complement inhibitory activity with the single F47A substitution having the most significant effect. Interestingly, the side chains of the residues at positions 47, 51, and 55 are all located on the short single helix (residues 47–55) of CD59 and form an exposed continuous strip parallel to the helix axis. A single human CD59 mutant protein containing rat residue substitutions at all three helix residues produced a protein with species selective activity comparable to that of rat CD59. We further found that synthetic peptides spanning the human CD59 helix sequence were able to inhibit the binding of human CD59 to human C8, but had little effect on the binding of rat CD59 to rat C8.

Complement activation can lead to the formation of the proinflammatory and cytolytic complement membrane attack complex (MAC) 1The abbreviations used are: MAC, membrane attack complex; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

Host cells are normally protected from the effects of the MAC by CD59, a widely distributed membrane-bound glycoprotein. The mature CD59 protein consists of 77 amino acids arranged in a single compact cysteine-rich domain composed of two antiparallel β-sheets, five protruding surface loops, and a short helix (1Fletcher C.M Harrison R.A. Lachmann P.J. Neuhaus D. Structure. 1994; 2: 185-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. Anton van der Merwe P. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4471-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CD59 functions by binding the terminal complement proteins C8 and C9 in the assembling MAC and interfering with its membrane insertion (3Rollins S.A. Zhao J.I. Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2345-2351PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rollins S.A. Sims P.J. J.

Because of species selective recognition of C8 and/or C9 (3Rollins S.A. Zhao J.I. Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2345-2351PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lehto T. Morgan B.P. Meri S. Immunology. 1997; 90: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the activity of CD59 is species restricted. However, species restriction is not absolute, and the effectiveness of CD59 from different species against heterologous complement varies. Mutational analysis of CD59 has begun to define residues important for its complement inhibitory function. Two basic strategies have been used. In one approach, mutagenesis of human CD59 was used to determine protein regions and amino acids essential for its inhibitory function against human complement (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Bodian D.L. Davies S.J. Morgan B.P. Rushmere N.K. J. Exp.

Dis. 1996; 22: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies have putatively mapped the human CD59 active site to one side of the protein that contains the short helix. Most of the identified functionally important human residues are well conserved between species and are located in the vicinity of a hydrophobic cleft on the membrane-distal face of the protein (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a second related approach, residues important for species selective function have been identified by functional analysis of chimeric human/animal CD59 proteins (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Zhao X.J. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10665-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether CD59 from different species share a common ligand binding site with species selective binding determined by other residues via indirect or allosteric mechanisms, or whether the residues involved in CD59 species selectivity are directly involved in ligand binding. In a quantitative study on the species selectivity of human and rat CD59, it has been shown that human CD59 is not effective against rat complement, but that rat CD59 is equally effective against rat and human complement (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of human/rat CD59 chimeric proteins has indicated that the residues responsible for the species selective activity of human CD59 lie between positions 40 and 66 in the primary structure (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, a more recent study using chimeric human/rabbit CD59 indicated that sequence between residues 42 and 58 determine human CD59 species selectivity (12Zhao X.J. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10665-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identify individual residues involved in the species selective function of human CD59. Human CD59 cDNA was a gift from H. Okada (Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan) and the isolation of rat CD59 was described previously (13Rushmere N.K. Harrison R.A. van der Berg C.W. Morgan B.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 containing the G418 selection marker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for all DNA manipulation and recombinant protein expression. All DNA primers used in PCR-based mutagenesis procedures were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Inc. (Coralville, IA). Recombinant CD59 proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) that were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Rabbit antiserum to CHO cell membranes (14Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared as described (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Anti-tag monoclonal antibody 2A10 directed against NANPNANPNA, a repeat domain of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, was described previously (4Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies used for flow cytometry were from Sigma. Rat C8 was purified as described (16Jones J. Laffafian I. Morgan B.P. Complement Inflamm. 1990; 7: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble rat and human CD59 was expressed in CHO cells and purified by affinity chromatography as described (2Kieffer B. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. Willis A.C. Anton van der Merwe P. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4471-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Human C8 was purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). Four CD59 sequence specific peptides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (>80%) by Genemed (South San Francisco, CA); peptide 1, RLRENELTY; peptide 2, FNDVTTRLRENELTY; peptide 3, WKFEHCNFNDVTTRLRENELTY; and peptide 4, NFNDVTTRLRE. Normal human serum was obtained from the blood of healthy volunteers in the laboratory. Rat serum was purchased from Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). Residue substitutions in human CD59 were prepared by standard PCR mutagenesis techniques as described (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the first PCR amplification, 5′ and 3′ primers matching an untranslated region of human CD59 and containing aHindIII and ApaI site, respectively, were paired with primers spanning the target site in which a rat amino acid codon was substituted. Each final PCR product was digested withHindIII and ApaI and was cloned into pCDNA3 expression vector for sequencing and expression. To quantitate the relative expression of recombinant proteins, an oligonucleotide encoding the tag-peptide sequence NANPNANPNA was inserted after the human CD59 N-terminal Leu codon as described (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with pCDNA3 constructs using LipofectAMINETM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected by the addition of G418 (400 μg/ml) 3 days after transfection. After 14 days of selection, stable populations of CHO cells each expressing similar levels of tagged recombinant protein were sorted by flow cytometry by means of anti-tag monoclonal antibody 2A10 as described (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At least three rounds of cell sorting were required to obtain homogeneous cell populations expressing similar levels of recombinant protein. For quantitative analysis of tagged recombinant protein expression, stably transfected detached CHO cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody 2A10 (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed again, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. All incubations and washing were carried out in Dulbecco's modified essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Cells for sorting were fluorescently labeled as above but were not fixed. Sorting was done in a Coulter Epics Elite with EPS sort module (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Complement-mediated CHO cell lysis assays were performed as described previously (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in 20% heat-treated anti-CHO antiserum, washed once, and exposed to 20% human or rat serum (either active or heat-inactivated). Cell lysis was determined by both trypan blue exclusion and by measuring the release of a preloaded fluorescent probe, calcein-AM (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both methods gave similar results. Lysis was determined using sets of homogenous cell populations expressing similar levels of rat CD59, human CD59, or chimeric CD59 on their surface (Ref. 11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and also see above). The ability of synthetic human CD59 peptides to inhibit the binding of CD59 to its ligand C8 was determined using a previously described microtiter plate binding assay (4Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human or rat C8 was coated onto microtiter wells, and the respective binding of biotinylated human or rat CD59 was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of peptide. CD59 (at final concentration of 20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and different concentrations of peptide were mixed before addition to C8 coated wells. All peptides were prepared as a 4 mg/ml stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline. Peptide 3 (see above) required a short sonication for solubilization. Binding of biotinylated CD59 was determined by means of Extravidin-peroxidase soluble o-phenylenediamine substrate system (Sigma). CD59 was biotinylated using EZ-link LC-biotin as described by the manufacturer for the biotinylation of IgG, using the same protein:biotin ratios (Pierce). Ratios were calculated based on molecular weights of 18,000 and 155,000 for CD59 and IgG, respectively (these ratios were determined to be important). Modeling by homology and subsequent analyses were performed with the ICM program developed for molecular modeling and structure predictions by global restrained energy optimization of arbitrarily constrained molecules (17Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 18Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The energy is calculated with ECEPP/3 force field (19Nemethy G. Gibson K.D. Palmer K.A. Yoon C.N. Paterlini G. Zagari A. Rumsey S. Scheraga H.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 6472-6484Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar) extended by recently developed solvation and side-chain entropic terms (18Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The following terms were included in the energy function: van der Waals and 1-4 nonbonded interactions, hydrogen bonding, torsion, electrostatic, disulfide bond restraints, solvation energy, and side-chain entropy. Cut off distance for truncation of van der Waals and electrostatic interactions was set to 7.5, and for hydrogen bond interactions it was set to 3.0. The side-chain torsion angles were predicted by simultaneous global optimization of the energy for all residues that were different in the rat and human sequences. The biased probability Monte Carlo-minimization method (18Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) was used for global optimization. A region around insertion at the C terminus was predicted with the loop prediction procedure described earlier (20Cardozo T. Totrov M.M. Abagyan R.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The final root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms between the human and rat coordinate sets was 0.64A. The molecular surface was built with the fast analytical “contour buildup” algorithm (21Totrov M.M. Abagyan R.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Human CD59 is not an effective inhibitor of rat complement, and previous functional analysis of chimeric human/rat CD59 proteins demonstrated that residues important for the species selective function of human CD59 lie between positions 40–66 in the primary structure (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To identify the individual residues involved in human CD59 species selective function, we first built a model of rat CD59 on the basis of the known structure of human CD59 and determined the location and the distribution of nonconserved surface patches within the 40–66 amino acid region of human and rat CD59. The CD59 sequences can be aligned with 45% sequence identity and only a single residue insertion at the C terminus of the protein (Fig.1). A model by homology was built and refined using the ICM global energy optimization procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analytical molecular surfaces (21Totrov M.M. Abagyan R.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for both human and rat proteins were then built, and the surface shape and distribution of surface patches of human and rat CD59 were analyzed (see Fig. 2, A andB). Residues 40–66 are shown in color in Fig. 2, and as previously shown (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), they all map to one side of the molecule. The region of CD59 shown in white represents the three-dimensional location of the regions that do not appear to be involved in species selective function (i.e. residues 1–39 and 66–77).Figure 2Diagrams of human and rat CD59. Panels A and B show a comparison of molecular surfaces in the region identified as important for species selective function (residues 40–66). The surface of regions 1–39 and 66–77 that are not important for species selectivity is coloredwhite. Conserved residues previously identified as functionally important in human CD59 (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Bodian D.L. Davies S.J. Morgan B.P. Rushmere N.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are coloredmagenta and are not numbered. Side chains of all nonidentical residues within the 40–66 sequence (and potentially responsible for species selective activity) are colored red(negatively charged residues), blue (positively charged residues), yellow (hydrophobic residues), andgreen (other residues). Backbone atoms of other residues, as well as side chains of residues that are identical in human and rat CD59 and therefore not important for species selectivity, are shown inwhite. Panel C is a ribbon diagram of human CD59 showing the residues experimentally determined to influence species selectivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of the models revealed pronounced differences between groups of clustered residues within the 40–66 region. The two largest and most conspicuously different groupings were six clustered residues at positions 48, 52, 55, 56, 57, and 58 that will produce very different surface patterns of electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity in the human and rat proteins, and three residues at positions 41, 43, and 44 that form a cluster of difference in shape and electrostatic properties. Other nonconserved groupings include residues 47 and 51, and residues 60, 62, and 66 that occur in a linear arrangement across the membrane proximal face of CD59 (this arrangement is not apparent in the views of CD59 shown in Fig. 2). Human to rat amino acid substitutions that result in acquisition of rat complement inhibitory activity will identify functionally important residues. To determine whether the candidate residue groups identified by model comparison above are involved in the species selective function of human CD59, the groups of residues were substituted for corresponding rat residues. Some additional residues were also substituted so that all nonidentical residues within the 40–66 sequence were accounted for. Further, some substitutions were made for residues that are outside of the 40–66 sequence, but that neighbor human residues previously identified as important for CD59 activity (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Bodian D.L. Davies S.J. Morgan B.P. Rushmere N.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mutant human CD59 proteins containing groups of substituted rat residues that were initially prepared and tested are shown in Fig. 3(mutant series A). The proteins were recombinantly expressed on the surface of CHO cells, and cell populations expressing similar levels of protein were isolated (see “Experimental Procedures”) and then assayed for their susceptibility to human and rat serum. CD59 expression levels were quantitated using flow cytometry by means of an epitope tag inserted at the N terminus of all recombinantly expressed proteins as described previously (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 show that human CD59, rat CD59, and all chimeric CD59 proteins are equally effective against human complement, indicating that none of the substitutions had any adverse effect on protein conformation and activity. When compared with the activity of human CD59, the A1, A3, A6, and A7 chimeric proteins provided enhanced protection against rat complement. The A6 and A7 proteins were about 25 and 70% as effective as rat CD59 against rat complement, respectively (calculated based on the difference between rat complement-mediated lysis of CHO cells expressing either human or rat CD59) (Fig. 4). The A6 and A7 proteins were significantly more effective against rat complement than the A1 and A3 proteins. Each of the A6 and A7 chimeras contained only two substituted residues (Fig.3), putatively identifying one or more human residues from a total of four that primarily determine the species selective activity of human CD59, i.e. Phe-47, Thr-51, Arg-55, and Lys-65. The human to rat R55E substitution is common to the A1, A3, and A6 proteins, suggesting that this substitution is responsible for the slightly increased inhibitory activity against rat complement of the A1 and A3 proteins. In a second series of mutations, each of the four candidate functionally important human residues, and a residue not expected to effect species selectivity (Lys-41), were individually substituted for corresponding rat residues (see Fig. 3, series B). The data in Fig. 5 show that the individual substitution of each candidate human residues with the corresponding rat residue produced a protein with enhanced rat complement inhibitory activity. The F47A substitution (B4 mutant) was by far the most effective at enhancing the activity of human CD59 against rat complement. This single rat residue substitution in human CD59 resulted in a protein that was about 65% as effective as rat CD59 against rat complement (Fig. 5). The T51L and R55E substitutions resulted in proteins that each possessed close to 20% of rat CD59 inhibitory activity. The K65Q substitution also appeared to display a small (about 10%), but statistically insignificant increase in activity against rat complement. Nevertheless, the A6 protein that contains both an R55E and K65Q substitution (Fig. 4) was slightly more effective against rat complement than an R55E substitution alone (Fig. 5). The single human to rat residue substitution at position 41 (K41R) did not alter the functional characteristics of human CD59, as predicted from functional data obtained with the A2 protein (contains a K41R substitution). To further confirm an important role for residue 47 in determining the species selective function of human CD59, an additional mutant protein was prepared containing a human to mouse substitution at residue position 47 (protein B5 (F47G), see Fig. 3). We have shown previously that human CD59 is not effective against mouse complement (22Yu J. Caragine T. Chen S. Morgan B.P. Frey A.F. Tomlinson S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the single F47G substitution produced a mutant protein possessing species selective function that was quantitatively similar to the F47A (human to rat) substitution (Fig. 5). None of the residue substitutions had any effect on human complement inhibitory activity, indicating that all recombinant proteins were correctly folded (Fig. 5). The positions and side-chain characteristics of the identified functionally important human residues on the CD59 protein are shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the side chains of the Phe-47, Thr-51, and Arg-55 residues are all located in a strip on the same face of the CD59 helix (Fig. 2 C). In a final mutant CD59 protein, each of the three human helix residues that individually affected species selective function were substituted with rat residues (mutant B7, Fig. 5). The rat complement inhibitory activity of this mutant protein approached that of rat CD59 (about 80% as effective) (Fig. 5), further indicating that the identified helix residues, and in particular Phe-47, are the principal determinants of human CD59 species selective function. We used a previously characterized microtiter plate binding assay to determine whether synthetic human CD59 peptides from the vicinity of the helix region could interfere with the binding of CD59 to its ligand, C8. We found two peptides, both spanning the helix residue sequence, that modestly inhibited the binding of human CD59 to human C8; a peptide to CD59 ratio of 320:1 inhibited binding by 30–40% (peptides 2 and 3, Fig. 6). In contrast, the same peptides were much less effective at inhibiting the binding of rat CD59 to rat C8. This data is consistent with the above mutagenesis data and suggests that the identified CD59 helix residue(s) are directly involved in the species selective binding of C8. A shorter peptide containing the helix residues (peptide 4, Fig. 6), as well as a peptide containing sequence C-terminal to the helix residues (peptide 1, Fig. 6), had little effect on the binding of CD59 to C8. A possible explanation for the lack of inhibition by the short helix peptide is that the N- and/or C-terminal helix residue extensions of the longer peptides stabilize a structure that is more favorable for binding. In a functional assay, the CD59 peptides were also tested for their effect on human C5b-9-mediated hemolysis of human erythrocytes (as described in Ref. 23Tomlinson S. Whitlow M.B. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1927-1934PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide binding to C8 in the assembling C5b-9 complex at a cell surface might interfere with the inhibitory effect of CD59, but the peptides had no effect on C5b-9-mediated hemolysis (not shown). By measuring the inhibitory activity of chimeric human-rat CD59 proteins against human and rat complement, it was previously determined that the species divergent 40–66 residue sequence contains the residues important for the species restricted function of human CD59 (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have now identified individual residues within this region that are responsible for human CD59 species selectivity. Individual substitutions of the human residues Phe-47, Thr-51, and Arg-55 for corresponding rat residues, each produced proteins with enhanced activity against rat complement. The substitution of all three residues in a single protein resulted in a CD59 protein (termed B7) with a species selective activity that was quantitatively similar to that of rat CD59; compared with the negligible activity of human CD59 against rat complement, the B7 mutant was about 80% as effective as rat CD59 at inhibiting rat complement. A fourth residue, Lys-65, also appears to contribute to the selectivity of human CD59 function, albeit to a lesser degree than the three helix residues, and may at least partly account for the slightly reduced activity of the B7 protein against rat complement as compared with rat CD59. No other nonconserved residue within the 40–66 sequence had any detectable effect on the species selective function of human CD59. The residues identified here as determinants of species selectivity are distinct from previously identified human CD59 active site residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of human CD59 (nonconservative substitution) has indicated that residues Phe-23, Asp-24, Trp-40, Arg-53, Leu-54, Glu-56, and Tyr-62 are important for human CD59 function (8Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Bodian D.L. Davies S.J. Morgan B.P. Rushmere N.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Petranka J. Zhao J. Norris J. Tweedy N.B. Ware R.E. Sims P.J. Rosse W.F. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1996; 22: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). With the exception of Tyr-62, these residues are located on the membrane-distal face of CD59 in the vicinity of a hydrophobic cleft, and with the further exception of residues Phe-23 and Glu-56, they are conserved in human and rat CD59 (refer to Fig. 1). It is possible that CD59 from different species possess a conserved ligand binding site, and that nonconserved residues in CD59 proteins influence the specificity of ligand binding via indirect or allosteric mechanisms. Alternatively, CD59 residues involved in determining the species selectivity may participate directly in ligand binding. We identify Phe-47, Thr-51, and Arg-55 as being the residues primarily involved in restricting human CD59 activity. In rat CD59, these residues are replaced by alanine, leucine, and glutamic acid, respectively. Interestingly, these three residues form a continuous strip parallel to the axis of the CD59 helix and are exposed to the solvent. It is therefore considered unlikely that the side chains of residues Phe-47, Thr-51, and Arg-55 influence specificity through affecting the relative position of the helix with respect to other binding pocket residues. Rather, it seems more likely that these residues are directly involved in ligand binding. The side-chain differences between the three human and rat CD59 residues are such that all three substitutions can potentially contribute to specificity, provided that this phase of the short helix is involved in the direct interaction. The phenylalanine and alanine side chains are both hydrophobic but differ in size, the threonine and leucine differ by a polar group and hydrophobic character, and arginine and glutamic acid have different charges although they share the same hydrophobic stem. The single residue that contributes by far the most to human CD59 species selective function is Phe-47. A key role for Phe-47 in species selectivity was further indicated by functional analysis of a human to mouse F47G substitution (see “Results”). Perhaps a binding pocket on the rodent C8/C9 ligands that can accommodate the rodent alanine and glycine residues cannot accommodate the large phenylalanine residue in the corresponding location on human CD59. Such an explanation is compatible with the fact that rat (11Yu J. Dong S. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and mouse (22Yu J. Caragine T. Chen S. Morgan B.P. Frey A.F. Tomlinson S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) CD59 are both effective against human complement, whereas human CD59 does not function effectively against rodent complement. Also compatible with this “docking” concept is the previous result that a nonconservative F47E mutation resulted in a human CD59 protein with only a weak protective effect against human complement (9Bodian D.L. Davies S.J. Morgan B.P. Rushmere N.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was suggested from this finding that Phe-47 may be at the periphery of the human CD59 active site. The positively charged residue Lys-65 in human CD59 that is replaced by a polar Gln-65 in rat CD59 also had a small effect on species selectivity. Lys-65 is positioned next to the conserved and functionally important residue Asp-24 (9Bodian D.L. Davies S.J. Morgan B.P. Rushmere N.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and is located at one end of the hydrophobic cleft that may be important for complement ligand binding (see above). The current data does not exclude the possibility that the location of residues that determine species selectivity may differ in different CD59 proteins. Nevertheless, consistent with the current data, a recent analysis of the species selectivity of chimeric human/rabbit CD59 proteins indicated that species selectivity is determined solely by sequence contained between residues 42 and 58 of human CD59 (12Zhao X.J. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10665-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of the patterns of species selectivity of various cloned CD59 proteins is consistent with functional contributions from residues at positions 47, 51, and 55. Mouse and rat CD59 display similarities in their pattern of species selectivity with regard to homologous and human complement, and both have a small side chain in position 47 (glycine and alanine, respectively), a long hydrophobic side chain in position 51 (leucine and methionine, respectively), and a conserved residue at position 55 (glutamic acid) (refer to Fig. 1). In contrast, human, primate, and pig CD59 are all effective against human but not rodent complement. In CD59 from these species, the Phe-47 is conserved, the residue substitution threonine to serine in position 51 preserves the side-chain hydroxyl group, whereas human Arg-55 is replaced in primate and pig CD59 by a smaller side chain, rather than to an oppositely charged residue (as in rodent CD59). Rabbit CD59, however, which does not provide effective protection from human complement (12Zhao X.J. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10665-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), contains an oppositely charged residue at position 55 (glutamic acid instead of arginine) and may account for its incompatibility with human CD59, despite similarities in positions 47 and 51. Recombinant soluble complement inhibitors based on membrane regulators of complement activation are effective at suppressing inflammation and disease pathology in a variety of animal models, and an understanding of the molecular basis for CD59 function may provide the rationale for the design of efficient soluble MAC inhibitory constructs for clinical application. Inhibiting the terminal pathway of complement but leaving the activation pathway intact may offer significant clinical advantages in diseases in which the MAC plays an important role. This is because products of the complement activation pathway play important roles in immunity to infection and in immune complex catabolism. Evidence indicates that an effective CD59-based inhibitor will also provide efficient protection from complement-mediated hyperacute rejection of xenotransplanted tissue (24Squinto S.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Ryan U.S. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 967-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transgenic pig organs expressing high levels of human CD59 are protected from human complement and show prolonged survival when transplanted into primates (26Byrne G.W. McCurry K.R. Martin M.J. McClellan S.M. Platt J.L. Logan J.S. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27McCurry K.R. Kooyman D.L. Alvarado C.G. Cotterell A.H. Martin M.J. Logan J.S. Platt J.L. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The identification here of the residues important for species selectivity and the conservation of these residues in human and pig CD59 support the view that the level of CD59 expression will be more important than the species of CD59 in prolonging pig to human graft survival (28Hinchcliffe S.J. Rushmere N.K. Hanna S.M. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3924-3932PubMed Google Scholar, 29Maher S.E. Pflugh D.L. Larsen N.J. Rothschild M.F. Bothwell A.L. Transplantation. 1998; 66: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, defining the functional site(s) of CD59 may also assist in the design of inhibitors of CD59. Inhibiting CD59 function on the surface of tumor cells may prove effective in anti-tumor complement-dependent immunotherapy. We thank Dr. John Hirst for performing flow cytometry."

Elongation factor (EF) 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; wt, wild type; aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA.Tu belongs to the superfamily of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, factors involved in numerous cellular processes as carrier of information or biological components. Common characteristics in the family are the switching between active and inactive conformations depending on whether GTP or GDP is bound (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar), an intrinsic GTPase activity that can be stimulated several orders of magnitude by specific factors (GTPase-activating proteins), and the property that the GDP/GTP exchange can be enhanced by specific exchange factors (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) (reviewed in Refs. 4Boguski M.S.

EF-Tu acts as carrier of aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the ribosome in the elongation phase of bacterial protein biosynthesis. It has a long history of functional and structural studies offering many insights into its functioning (6Krab I.M. Parmeggiani A. Biochim. Biophys.

Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) are now available. These provide snapshots of the dynamics of the factor during its cycle, which involves large interdomain rearrangements. On the other hand, many functional questions, such as the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, the EF-Tu cycle on the ribosome, and the structure-function relationships of many structural elements, still remain unanswered or are awaiting satisfactory answers. Domain 1 of EF-Tu (G domain) has the guanine nucleotide-binding protein conserved fold and contains the “fingerprint” conserved sequence motifs taking care of the interaction with the nucleotide (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 3Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Each of the first three consensus motifs contains a residue involved in the coordination network of the essential magnesium ion interacting with the β- and γ-phosphates of the nucleotide. In Escherichia coli EF-Tu, these residues are Thr-25 and Thr-61, which bind to the magnesium ion directly via the OH-oxygen, and Asp-80 and Asp-50, which hydrogen-bond each to one of the water molecules, completing the coordination sphere of magnesium. In other guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, threonine from the first consensus element is often substituted by a serine, which can coordinate similarly to magnesium. The important role of this metal ion in the nucleotide binding is emphasized by the observation that its chelation decreases the affinity for GDP and GTP by at least 3 orders of magnitude (14Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Weissbach H. Pestka S. Molecular Mechanisms in Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323-373Google Scholar). Significant amounts of free magnesium are not necessary for GTPase activity, and the tightly bound magnesium ion must be extracted with a large excess of EDTA before activity is lost (15Ivell R. Sander G. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6852-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Mistou M.Y. Cool R.H. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EF-Tu Thr-25 is central in this coordination of magnesium, whereas Thr-61 located on the opposite side of the magnesium ion with respect to Thr-25 is only coordinated in the GTP form (7Berchtold H.

Moreover, the homologue of Thr-61 in Ha-Ras p21, Thr-35, was found to only weakly interact with the ion in the GTP-bound form (17Halkides C.J. Farrar C.T. Larsen R.G. Redfield A.G. Singel D.J.

On the other hand, mutation of p21 Ser-17 (the homologue of EF-Tu Thr-25) can be associated with dominant negative phenotypes, emphasizing its functional importance (19Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 21Stacey D.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because in EF-Tu the structure-function relationships of the residues involved in magnesium coordination are still mostly unexplored, we have analyzed in well defined in vitro conditions the effects associated with the substitution of Thr-25 with two closely related amino acids, serine and alanine. Serine is the amino acid functionally most similar to threonine; this substitution thus minimizes the changes induced in the magnesium ion network. The replacement with alanine emphasizes the consequences of suppressing the link to the magnesium ion. A double mutant EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S) isolated during the course of this study was also characterized and found to display intermediary properties, thus allowing to distinguish more precisely between specific effects of the two single substitutions. Ribosomes, EF-G, Phe-tRNA synthetase, and partially purified tRNAPhe (5 to 11%) were prepared from E. coli as reported (23Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Chinali G. Wolf H. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Highly purified tRNAPhe was also obtained from Sigma. To obtain rapid purification, EF-Tu wt and mutants were overproduced as fusion with glutathione S-transferase (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEX-2TtufA is a derivative of pGEX-2T (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) containing the E. coli tufA gene coding sequence contiguous to the thrombin recognition sequence LVPRGS, where serine represents the first amino acid of EF-Tu (26.Anborgh, P. H., Elongation Factor Tu from E. coli. Mechanism and Action of a New Specific Antibiotic and Site-directed Mutagenesis.Ph.D. thesis, 1993, Leiden University, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). The very efficient cleavage by thrombin after arginine results in EF-Tu containing an additional N-terminal glycine, as compared with the native cellular EF-Tu, the N terminus of which is acetylated (27Arai K. Clark B.F.C. Duffy L. Jones M.D. Kaziro Y. Laursen R.A. L'Italien J. Miller D.L. Nagarkatti S. Nakamura S. Nielsen K.M. Petersen T.E. Takahashi K. Wade M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1326-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All mutant proteins and also the control wt used in this study were produced in this way. Mutant T25A was generated by means of the polymerase chain reaction. Mutant T25S was obtained by the Unique Site Elimination method (28Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), using a kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Interestingly, when trying to construct the mutant T25S using either polymerase chain reaction or Unique Site Elimination methods with an 18 base mutagenic primer, we systematically obtained a double mutant H22Y/T25S resulting from the substitution of a flanking base. Use of a longer primer of 25 bases including codon 22 allowed us to obtain T25S alone. The EF-Tu mutants were overproduced in E. coli DH5α grown in LB medium at 30 °C to 0.5–0.8 A 600, after which induction with 0.08 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside took place at 22 °C with incubations up to 40 h. Cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 110 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 7 mm ME and 10% glycerol (Buffer A). After centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2.5 ml of resin /g of cells), which was then extensively washed at 4 °C with Buffer A containing 30–150 μm GDP, to remove bound EF-Ts as far as possible. Glutathione S-transferase-EF-Tu was cleaved in situ and eluted at 4 °C with Buffer A supplemented with 30 μm GDP, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 1 unit/ml thrombin at a low flow rate (approximately 0.3 ml/min) until no more protein was released. Thrombin in the eluent was inactivated by adding 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The obtained EF-Tu was further purified to remove residual EF-Ts, using either Q Sepharose chromatography or Superdex 75 gel filtration. For the first method, the eluate from the glutathione affinity column was brought to a final GDP concentration of 250 μm and applied to a Q Sepharose FF column (6 ml). This was washed with Buffer A containing 250 μm GDP to induce the dissociation of EF-Tu·EF-Ts, and 120 mm KCl, at which concentration EF-Ts cannot bind to the resin. EF-Tu was eluted with a linear KCl gradient to 400 mm. For the second method, the affinity column eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon CentriFlo 25) to <2 ml before loading on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 column, which was eluted with Buffer A containing 40 μm GDP. Pooled peak fractions from Q Sepharose or Superdex columns were concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 55% glycerol, 20 μm GDP and stored at −30 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Poly(Phe) synthesis was determined kinetically from the formation of hot trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material (29Swart G.W.M. Parmeggiani A. Kraal B. Bosch L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24622-24628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were measured as described. Details are reported in the legends to the figures. GlutathioneS-transferase-fused EF-Tu was expressed in E. coli DH5α cells grown in LB medium at 30 °C to 0.5–0.8A 600. At this cell concentration and temperature, induction by 0.08 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6–8 h resulted in high level overproduction. However, whereas overproduced glutathioneS-transferase-EF-Tu wt and T25S displayed good solubility (70–80%), yielding up to 2 mg of thrombin-cleaved EF-Tu/g cells (wet weight), mutants T25A and H22Y/T25S were about 10% soluble. Longer induction times (up to 40 h) at lower temperature during the induction phase (22 °C) somewhat increased the solubility. On the glutathione affinity column, some EF-Ts is always retained as a complex with EF-Tu, making a second purification step necessary, either by Q Sepharose chromatography or Superdex 75 gel filtration (see under “Materials and Methods”). This was particularly the case for the Ala mutant, which complexes very tightly with EF-Ts (75% EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex was still present after the first affinity step). The presence of an additional glycine at the N-terminal extremity in EF-Tu wt did not modify its function in any of the activities tested in this work, including poly(Phe) synthesis. As shown in TableI, the single substitution T25S decreases the affinity for GDP already by a factor three, due to an increase in dissociation rate, whereas the association rate is comparable to wt. The T25A substitution and the addition of substitution H22Y to T25S have more dramatic effects: dissociation rates are 2 orders of magnitude higher than wt, and association rates decreased. Thus the affinity constants have μm instead of nmvalues, a difference of 3 orders of magnitude. The fast GDP dissociation causes a technical problem concerning the evaluation of the GDP binding capacity for mutants H22Y/T25S and T25A. The half-lives of 1 min and 25 s, respectively, are of the order of the filter washing time. Consequently the loss of nucleotide during filter washing is considerable; compared with wt around 50–60% of GDP is retained on filter by the double mutant and EF-Tu(T25A) shows more variation, but still retains 25–50%. Taking this and the order of the dissociation reaction into account, we estimated that the actual GDP binding capacity of these mutants should not differ much from that of EF-Tu wt (T25S proved identical). Consequently, we did not apply a correction factor in evaluating experiments in the other sections. For the properties presented in this section, a standardized washing procedure reduced experimental variation. Because the calculation of the constants in this section is based on relative experimental values at different time points or nucleotide concentrations, this technical difficulty does not affect the values in Table I.Table INucleotide interaction parametersGDPGTP104 k off10−4 k on1Calculated as k on =k off/K d, assuming a two-state association/dissociation reaction without intermediate steps.K d104 k off10−4 k on1Calculated as k on =k off/K d, assuming a two-state association/dissociation reaction without intermediate steps.K ds−1s−1m−1μms−1s−1m−1μmwt3.9560.00070810.461.78T25A2701.32.1ND1Could not be determined (ND) by the nitrocellulose binding method.ND1Could not be determined (ND) by the nitrocellulose binding method.ND1Could not be determined (ND) by the nitrocellulose binding method.H22Y/T25S1081.11.03500.3410.4T25S10480.00212533.40.75Shown are apparent rate constants for dissociation (k off) and association (k on) of GDP and GTP and the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) measured at 0 °C.a Calculated as k on =k off/K d, assuming a two-state association/dissociation reaction without intermediate steps.b Could not be determined (ND) by the nitrocellulose binding method.

A related reduction of filter retention compared with the theoretical value is already observed for EF-Tu(wt)·GTP filter binding, 2A. Parmeggiani, unpublished observation. and is worse for the mutants. For EF-Tu(T25A), GTP retention by the filter-bound protein was even immeasurable. For the T25S single and double substitutions, GTP dissociation rates turned out to be 3–4-fold higher than for wt. Interestingly, although for the double mutant the affinity is nearly 6-fold lower and the association rate is not much changed compared with wt, for the T25S single substitution the affinity is actually slightly higher than for EF-Tu wt, and therefore the association rate is about 7-fold higher. The most complete indication about the health of an EF-Tu mutant is its ability to support protein biosynthesis. We tested this activity by poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis at a magnesium ion concentration of 10 mm to ensure that the differences seen were not the result of insufficient saturation of EF-Tu with aa-tRNA, or insufficient binding to the ribosomal A site (see next paragraph); the GTP concentration was 400 μm, far above the affinity values measured at 0 °C, to convert the EF-Tu to the GTP form. As shown in Fig.1, EF-Tu(T25S) could synthesize poly(Phe) as efficiently as wt. The double mutant EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S) had a lower activity, about half that of EF-Tu wt. Surprisingly, EF-Tu(T25A), also, showed an activity that was significantly above the background level and was ∼10% that of the EF-Tu wt elongation rate. The enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to poly(U)-programmed ribosomes shows a modified dependence on Mg2+ concentration only for EF-Tu(T25A) and the double mutant, that of EF-Tu(T25S) being the same as that of EF-Tu wt (Fig. 2). EF-Tu(T25A) needed considerably (5–6 mm) more magnesium ion than EF-Tu wt to obtain 50% of the maximum binding of Phe-tRNAPhe; moreover, it was unable to reach the same plateau of binding as EF-Tu wt at any of the Mg2+concentrations used, its maximum level corresponding to about 75% the control. In contrast, the double mutant displayed the same plateau level as EF-Tu wt, even though it needed approximately 3 mmmore magnesium. The optimum enzymatic activity, defined as the highest ratio of enzymatic versus nonenzymatic binding occurred between 8 and 11 mm Mg2+. This prompted our choice of a standard 10 mm magnesium ion concentration for the other assays. The ability to participate in poly(Phe) synthesis and enzymatic binding, described in the previous section, established that the mutants have conserved either full (EF-Tu(T25S)) or at least partial activity (EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S) and EF-Tu(T25A)). On the other hand, the ability of EF-Tu to protect the ester-bond of aa-tRNA from spontaneous hydrolysis was strongly affected with the latter two mutants, as shown in Fig. 3, at 10 mm Mg2+. In fact EF-Tu(T25S) induced the same protection as EF-Tu wt, whereas with the other two mutants, the half-life of Phe-tRNAPhe decreased from several hours to approximately 20 min, i.e. to virtually the same level as obtained with Phe-tRNAPhe in the absence of EF-Tu. This was surprising, especially in the case of the double mutant that was shown above to sustain a high rate of poly(Phe) synthesis and, at 10 mm Mg2+, nearly the same enzymatic binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome as EF-Tu wt. For measuring the intrinsic GTPase activity of these mutants, high GTP concentrations were used to saturate the EF-Tu with nucleotide, but for EF-Tu(T25A), this may not have been sufficient to ensure complete saturation. The intrinsic GTPase activity of the mutants versus that of EF-Tu wt was variously affected (Fig.4 A): for EF-Tu(T25S), it was comparable to that of EF-Tu wt and for the double mutant it was markedly reduced (∼25%), whereas the rate of EF-Tu(T25A) was so low that it was difficult to determine. Interestingly, the presence of Phe-tRNAPhe, which at magnesium concentrations ≤10 mm is known to hinder the hydrolysis of the EF-Tu wt-bound GTP (23Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Fasano O. Créchet J.B. Parmeggiani A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 124: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Parlato G.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4400-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), decreased the activity of EF-Tu(T25S) by 60%, as for EF-Tu wt, whereas EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S) did not always show a clear reduction, and for EF-Tu(T25A) it gave low but measurable rates with a good correlation coefficient, at ∼5% of the wt intrinsic rate. Kirromycin was able to enhance the GTPase activity of EF-Tu(T25S) and EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S), but not of EF-Tu(T25A), on which it was virtually inactive (Fig. 4 B). Nevertheless, in poly(Phe) synthesis, the 50% inhibitory concentration for this mutant is even slightly lower (approximately 2 times) than for wt (not shown). Interestingly, kirromycin could compensate entirely the negative influence of the double mutation on the GTPase. The presence of the ribosome, whether programmed with poly(U) or not (the latter not shown), markedly enhanced the GTPase activity of EF-Tu. In the absence of EF-Ts, the turnover rate of GTP hydrolysis of EF-Tu(T25S) is twice that of EF-Tu wt, as shown in Fig. 4 C. This reflects the higher intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange rate of this mutant; in the presence of 50 nm EF-Ts, where the hydrolysis rate becomes limiting again, this difference disappears. The intrinsic GDP dissociation rate of the double mutant and that of EF-Tu(T25A) are sufficiently high that the turnover GTPase rate is not limited by GDP/GTP exchange (not shown). The double mutant shows the same rate as wt in the absence of EF-Ts, but if compared with wt under conditions in which the catalysis is rate-limiting (in the presence of EF-Ts), it is lower by a factor of 5. Interestingly, EF-Tu(T25A) displays a clear GTPase in the presence of ribosomes, approximately 3% of the ribosome-stimulated wt rate (when the background rate is subtracted). The turnover rates of wt and the other mutants in the presence of ribosomes are 25–35 times their intrinsic GTPase rates. That of EF-Tu(T25A) is thus stimulated by ribosome as least as much. In Ras proteins, mutants of Ser-17, the residue equivalent to EF-Tu Thr-25, are known to cause a dominant negative phenotype, meaning that the mutant competes effectively with wt Ras for binding to its specific exchange factor, sequestering it and preventing activation of Ras. This was found to be associated with a strong decrease in the affinity of the mutants for GDP, and even more for GTP. To examine whether the same also holds for EF-Tu Thr-25 mutants, the stimulation by EF-Ts of the dissociation of radiolabeled GDP from EF-Tu wt was followed in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonlabeled EF-Tu·GDP. As shown in Fig. 5, the inhibition of the stimulation of EF-Ts on the EF-Tu(wt)·[3H]GDP dissociation as a function of the concentration of added nonlabeled EF-Tu revealed a competitive inhibitory effect—i.e. an effect much stronger than when the “competitor” is EF-Tu wt—only in the case of EF-Tu(T25A). This is very likely due to a sequestration of EF-Ts resulting from the formation of a stable complex with EF-Tu(T25A), as was observed also during the purification of this mutant after overexpression in E. coli. Interestingly, no dominant inhibitory effect could be observed with EF-Tu(T25S) and EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S), even though for the double mutant the nucleotide affinity is affected to almost the same extent as for EF-Tu(T25A). This work analyzes the effect induced on EF-Tu functions by substituting threonine 25, a strictly conserved α-helix 1 residue that flanks at the C-terminal side the P-loop (L1), and represents an essential element in the network coordinating the nucleotide-bound magnesium ion. Previous work of Hwang et al. (38Hwang Y.W. McCabe P.G. Innis M.A. Miller D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that substitution of this residue by isoleucine abolishes the interaction with the nucleotide. We decided to extend the analysis of the function of this crucial residue by introducing two other substitutions in the hope of correlating functional data with the recent impressive development of our knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of EF-Tu and its complexes. We also intended to compare the effects of this mutation with those reported for other guanine nucleotide-binding proteins on substituting the homologous residue. The obtained results confirm the important structural role of this residue in the magnesium-substrate coordination, yet they show subtle effects not readily predictable from the current structural models. As for the nucleotide binding, the decrease in affinity of EF-Tu(T25A) for GDP by 3 orders of magnitude emphasizes the central role that the magnesium ion plays in the binding of the nucleotide to EF-Tu. EF-Tu(T25S) shows a 3-fold increase in dissociation rate, causing a subtle modification of the GDP affinity. This could be explained in terms of modification of the effector loop structure. In fact, two effector loop residues, Phe-46 and Ile-49 (Tyr-47 and Ile-50, respectively, in Thermus thermophilus) at both edges of the one-turn helix α1′ make hydrophobic contacts with the Thr-25 side chain methyl group, forming a kind of “hydrophobic clamp” (conserved motif (Y/F)XX(I/V)) around it (Fig.6, A and B). It represents the major interaction of this part of the effector region, in between the hypervariable first part and the conserved second part. Loss of this stabilizing hydrophobic interaction could unfavorably alter the structure of the effector loop, possibly affecting the water-mediated bond of Asp-50 with the Mg2+. In eukaryal and archeal EF1αs, the conserved Thr at position 25 is replaced by a conserved Ser that lacks the β-carbon methyl group. Notably, in these factors the hypervariable part of the effector loop has in place of the hydrophobic clamp motif of prokaryal EF-Tu, a conserved very hydrophobic motif containing several bulky aromatic residues. 3I. M. Krab, unpublished observation. This might indicate a steric compensation for the absence of the methyl group at position 25. The surprising effect of the supplementary mutation H22Y on the nucleotide affinity of EF-Tu(T25S) is more difficult to explain. Residue His-22 is part of the P-loop pointing toward L6 preceding helix α3. Substitution by the approximately 1.5 Å longer tyrosine in the same orientation would cause a steric collision with the β-carbon of Met-112. Its accommodation would thus imply a displacement of L6, and consequently perhaps also of helix α3 (Fig. 6 C). Noteworthy, in the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex crystal structure, this helix has been displaced in the same direction by approximately 1.5 Å as a consequence of the intrusion of EF-Ts Phe-81 in between EF-Tu helices α2 and α3. Thus, such a displacement might cause modifications similar to the sequence of interactions (from His-118 via Gln-114 to the P-loop) that Wang et al. (12Wang Y. Jiang Y. Meyering-Voss M. Sprinzl M. Sigler P.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) propose to lead to release of the nucleotide. Another possible effect of substitution H22Y could be the deformation of the P-loop, hindering nucleotide accommodation. The slightly higher magnesium requirement for enzymatic binding indicates that some perturbation indeed occurs at the level of the magnesium binding elements in the double mutant and not with the single substitution T25S. A related observation deserves some attention. In Ras proteins, mutations of the position equivalent to EF-Tu Thr-25 are known to be associated with dominant negative phenotypes (19Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 21Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This has been shown in vitro for Ras2p(S24N) to be associated with increased stability of the complex of Ras2p with its exchange factor (22Créchet J.B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 39Poullet P. Créchet J.B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), thus leading to sequestration of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Interestingly, here we describe two mutants of EF-Tu (EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S) and EF-Tu(T25A)) that have a comparable decrease in affinity for GDP, whereas only one, EF-Tu(T25A), shows dominant negative-like behavior through increased stability of the complex with EF-Ts. Nevertheless the stimulation by EF-Ts of GDP dissociation on EF-Tu(H22Y/T25S) is not less efficient than with wt (not shown). This indicates that the interaction of the magnesium ion with Thr-25 plays a central role in the mechanism of dissociation of the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complex. In the crystal structure of the complex, the phosphate cavity is not completely open due to a peptide flip in the P-loop. If the stable interaction Mg2+-Thr-25(OH) cannot be formed, the insertion of the nucleotide into the binding site and the release of EF-Ts has apparently a much lower chance of succeeding. This observation may also have implications for the reverse process, the dissociation of EF-Tu·nucleotide by EF-Ts, in which breaking of the Mg2+-Thr-25(OH) bond could represent the major energetic barrier. This would emphasize the importance of the displacement of magnesium in the mechanism of stimulation of EF-Tu·GDP dissociation by EF-Ts, in agreement with the model of Kawashima et al.(11Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Concerning the influence of the various mutations on the GTPase activity, the most striking observation is the different effects on the stimulation of the EF-Tu GTPase by kirromycin and ribosomes. The negative influence of the double mutation on the intrinsic GTPase can be completely compensated by kirromycin, whereas the GTPase of EF-Tu(T25A) is completely insensitive to the antibiotic, although it still interacts. In contrast, ribosomes are shown here to stimulate all mutants and wt comparably. This is probably related to a different mechanism of stimulation of the catalysis by the two agents, which are known to have an additive effect (15Ivell R. Sander G. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6852-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ribosome stimulation may be somehow related to that proposed for the GTPase-activating protein stimulation of small GTPases, even though some caution in comparing the two systems is in order (6Krab I.M. Parmeggiani A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the enhancing effect of the ribosome is not critically dependent on the tight interaction of the magnesium ion with the core of EF-Tu, although the magnesium ion is essential for achieving the correct binding of nucleotide and the intrinsic GTPase. This is in evident contrast with the effect of the antibiotic kirromycin that we show here to stimulate the GTPase only if the Mg2+-25(OH) bond is intact, thus indicating a different mechanism of action from that of the ribosome. The location and mode of binding of the antibiotic to EF-Tu are not yet precisely defined. Whereas resistance mutations were mapped to the interface of domains 1 and 3 (40Abdulkarim F. Liljas L. Hughes D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Mesters J.R. Zeef L.A.H. Hilgenfeld R. de Graaf J.M. Kraal B. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4877-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the known competition between EF-Ts and kirromycin for binding to EF-Tu could rather implicate elements from the EF-Tu·EF-Ts contact area (L1(P-loop), L6-α3, and α4 (11Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar)) in kirromycin binding (6Krab I.M. Parmeggiani A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consequently, kirromycin could have a direct or indirect interaction with the GTPase center, perhaps acting through the P-loop. There it might strengthen the hydrogen bond of the Asp-21 main chain NH toward the βγ-bridging oxygen, which was suggested for p21 to play a major role in the intrinsic GTPase (42Maegley K.A. Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8160-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Concerning the interaction with tRNA, we have observed various effects. First, the activities in poly(Phe) and enzymatic binding indicate that EF-Tu(T25S) has conserved full ability to bind aa-tRNA, that also the double mutant at 10 mm Mg2+ is like wt, and that even EF-Tu(T25A) has conserved at least partial activity. In surprising contrast is the complete lack of protection against spontaneous hydrolysis of the aa-tRNA ester bond by the latter two mutants. We interpret this to indicate that whereas the overall binding of aa-tRNA may not be dramatically affected, the interaction with the aminoacyl end of the tRNA is anomalous for these mutants. Interestingly, this recalls the situation observed for wt EF-Tu in the presence of the antibiotic enacyloxin IIa (43Cetin R. Krab I.M. Anborgh P.H. Cool R.H. Watanabe T. Sugiyama T. Izaki K. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2604-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A combination of factors probably contributes to the impaired rate of poly(Phe) synthesis with two of the three mutants: the anomalous ternary complex, the reduced efficiency of the GTPase center, and in the case of EF-Tu(T25A) also the more stable complex with EF-Ts. To conclude, our results underline the importance of the magnesium binding by Thr-25 in the functioning of EF-Tu, whereas on the other hand the ability of EF-Tu to participate in protein synthesis proves conserved to some extent even in the absence of this bond. This shows that modification of the magnesium-nucleotide binding network, although drastic, as in the case of substitution of the key component Thr-25 by Ala, is still compatible with an active overall conformation of the EF-Tu molecule. It also emphasizes that although the Mg2+-Thr-25(OH) bond contributes greatly to the stability of nucleotide binding, other interactions are important too. Drs. K. Harmark and A. Weijland have done in our group some preliminary work on Thr-25 mutants using a different vector and purification system. We thank Dr. R. Hilgenfeld for providing coordinates of EF-Tu crystal structures and Drs. J. B. Créchet, E. Jacquet, and A. Weijland for comments on the manuscript."
