https://openalex.org/W2910856350,"A redox road to recovery Device longevity is a key issue for organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells. Encapsulation can limit degradation arising from reactions with oxygen and water, but light, electric-field, and thermal stresses can lead to metastable elemental lead and halide atom defects. Wang et al. show that for the lead-iodine system, the introduction of the rare earth europium ion pair Eu 3+ -Eu 2+ can shuttle electrons and recover lead and iodine ions (Pb 2+ and I − ). Devices incorporating this redox shuttle maintained more than 90% of their initial power conversion efficiencies under various aging conditions. Science , this issue p. 265"

Nonetheless, the process of tuning catalyst structure to optimize selectivity is still largely empirical. Zahrt et al. present a framework for more efficient, predictive optimization. As a proof of principle, they focused on a known coupling reaction of imines and thiols catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid compounds. By modeling multiple conformations of more than 800 prospective catalysts, and then training machine-learning algorithms on a subset of experimental results, they achieved highly accurate predictions of enantioselectivities.

OPCs are conventionally considered a homogeneous population, particularly with respect to their electrophysiological properties, but this has been debated. We show, by using single-cell electrophysiological recordings, that OPCs start out as a homogeneous population but become functionally heterogeneous, varying both within and between brain regions and with age. These electrophysiological changes in OPCs correlate with the differentiation potential of OPCs; thus, they may underlie the differentiational differences in OPCs between regions and, likewise, differentiation failure with age.

Glial cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia are conventionally thought of as homogeneous cell types; however, recent findings show that glial cells, like neurons, have a different transcriptome and proteome depending on the brain region and with age and that the glial cell transcriptome, but not the neuronal one, is mostly altered by aging (Soreq et al., 2017Soreq L.

How these changes relate to cellular function is unclear, and the functional implications of glial cell heterogeneity and age-related brain changes are yet to be understood. The fourth type of glial cell, the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC), which expresses the proteoglycan NG2, is widely distributed throughout the adult brain and is the main proliferative cell present in the adult CNS (Dawson et al., 2003Dawson M.R.L.

Neurosci. 2003; 24: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Its function in the adult CNS is relatively unclear. During development, OPCs give rise to oligodendrocytes that generate myelin, which ensures fast signal transmission and provides metabolic support to axons (Nave, 2010Nave K.-A.

With age, however, motor learning and myelin regeneration decline (Huang et al., 2011Huang J.K. Jarjour A.A. Nait Oumesmar B. Kerninon C. Williams A. Krezel W. Kagechika H. Bauer J. Zhao C.

Growing evidence, both in vitro and in vivo, shows that neuronal activity and glutamate signaling are regulatory signals for myelination and remyelination in young adults (de Faria et al., 2018de Faria Jr., O.

OPCs have the capacity to sense changes in neuronal activity and glutamate release because OPCs express glutamate receptors and receive depolarizing synaptic inputs from axons in both white and gray matter (Bergles et al., 2000Bergles D.E.

These electrophysiological properties, along with the expression of voltage-gated ion channels such as tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels, have become a defining feature of OPCs (Clarke et al., 2012Clarke L.E. Young K.M. Hamilton N.B. Li H. Richardson W.D. Attwell D. Properties and fate of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the corpus callosum, motor cortex, and piriform cortex of the mouse.J.

Excitability and synaptic communication within the oligodendrocyte lineage.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, not all OPCs express these electrophysiological properties (Chittajallu et al., 2004Chittajallu R. Aguirre A. Gallo V. NG2-positive cells in the mouse white and grey matter display distinct physiological properties.J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Káradóttir et al., 2008Káradóttir R. Hamilton N.B. Bakiri Y. Attwell D. Spiking and nonspiking classes of oligodendrocyte precursor glia in CNS white matter.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Whether this heterogeneity has a functional significance or whether it is solely a transitional stage prior to differentiation is debated (Clarke et al., 2012Clarke L.E. Young K.M. Hamilton N.B. Li H. Richardson W.D. Attwell D. Properties and fate of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the corpus callosum, motor cortex, and piriform cortex of the mouse.J.

Excitability and synaptic communication within the oligodendrocyte lineage.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Whether OPCs are a heterogeneous cell population is controversial. On one hand, depletion and functional studies have indicated that forebrain OPCs, despite arising from three different origins in subsequent waves during early development, are functionally similar (Clarke et al., 2012Clarke L.E. Young K.M. Hamilton N.B. Li H. Richardson W.D. Attwell D. Properties and fate of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the corpus callosum, motor cortex, and piriform cortex of the mouse.J.

Dorsally and ventrally derived oligodendrocytes have similar electrical properties but myelinate preferred tracts.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6809-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, electrophysiological studies of OPCs in the hippocampus and corpus callosum (CC) have reported OPCs to be homogeneous (Clarke et al., 2012Clarke L.E. Young K.M. Hamilton N.B. Li H. Richardson W.D. Attwell D. Properties and fate of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the corpus callosum, motor cortex, and piriform cortex of the mouse.J.

Excitability and synaptic communication within the oligodendrocyte lineage.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). On the other hand, OPCs have been shown to respond differently to growth factors (Mason and Goldman, 2002Mason J.L. Goldman J.E. A2B5+ and O4+ cycling progenitors in the adult forebrain white matter respond differentially to PDGF-AA, FGF-2, and IGF-1.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and cytokines (Lentferink et al., 2018Lentferink D.H. Jongsma J.M. Werkman I. Baron W. Grey matter OPCs are less mature and less sensitive to IFNγ than white matter OPCs: consequences for remyelination.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and they have differential transcriptional profiles (Marques et al., 2018Marques S. van Bruggen D. Vanichkina D.P. Floriddia E.M. Munguba H. Väremo L. Giacomello S. Falcão A.M. Meijer M. Björklund Å.K. et al.Transcriptional convergence of oligodendrocyte lineage progenitors during development.Dev. Cell. 2018; 46: 504-517.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depending on the region, OPCs differ in their capability to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes. For example, OPCs from the CC differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes more efficiently than OPCs taken from the cortex (CTX; gray matter) (Viganò et al., 2013Viganò F. Möbius W. Götz M. Dimou L. Transplantation reveals regional differences in oligodendrocyte differentiation in the adult brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1370-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In line with this, the electrophysiological properties of OPCs reportedly differ between gray and white matter OPCs (Chittajallu et al., 2004Chittajallu R. Aguirre A. Gallo V. NG2-positive cells in the mouse white and grey matter display distinct physiological properties.J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) despite having the same developmental origin. Hence, we asked whether the electrophysiological properties of OPCs change with age and brain region as transcriptional studies have demonstrated for other types of glial cells, altering their capability to monitor and respond to neuronal activity. To address this, we used single-cell electrophysiological recordings in heterozygous NG2-EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) knockin mice, where the expression of the reporter gene is regulated according to the endogenous NG2 gene, allowing unbiased sampling of this population. We report that OPCs start out as a homogeneous population but become functionally heterogeneous, varying both within and between brain regions and age. These electrophysiological changes correlate with the differentiation potential of OPCs. To investigate the electrophysiological membrane properties of OPCs from first appearance to old age, we used heterozygous NG2-EYFP knockin mice (NG2-EYFP); in these mice, all parenchymal EYFP+ cells are Olig2- and NG2-positive throughout life, indicating that EYFP expression tightly follows expression of the NG2 protein (Karram et al., 2008Karram K. Goebbels S. Schwab M. Jennissen K. Seifert G. Steinhäuser C. Nave K.A. Trotter J. NG2-expressing cells in the nervous system revealed by the NG2-EYFP-knockin mouse.Genesis. 2008; 46: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). We voltage-clamped OPCs at embryonic day 13 (E13) because mouse forebrain OPCs first appear at E12.5 (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N. Fogarty M. Iannarelli P. Grist M. Wegner M. Richardson W.D. Competing waves of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and postnatal elimination of an embryonic lineage.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar); then at E18, when the second wave (E15.5) is established; at postnatal day 0 (P0), which coincides with the third wave (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N. Fogarty M. Iannarelli P. Grist M. Wegner M. Richardson W.D. Competing waves of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and postnatal elimination of an embryonic lineage.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar); then weekly for the first month, when myelination rates are the highest (Hamano et al., 1998Hamano K. Takeya T. Iwasaki N. Nakayama J. Ohto T. Okada Y. A quantitative study of the progress of myelination in the rat central nervous system, using the immunohistochemical method for proteolipid protein.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 108: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); and then every 2 to 3 months until P330, when myelination efficacy has declined (Huang et al., 2011Huang J.K. Jarjour A.A. Nait Oumesmar B. Kerninon C. Williams A. Krezel W. Kagechika H. Bauer J. Zhao C. Baron-Van Evercooren A. et al.Retinoid X receptor gamma signaling accelerates CNS remyelination.Nat.

Remarkable stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes in mice.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 316-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). A supposed defining feature of OPCs is the presence of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV), a stereotypic transient inward current that is evoked upon depolarization beyond −50 mV. This depolarization-evoked transient inward current was absent in OPCs at E13. In fact, at this time, no voltage-gated currents were detected in OPCs. We first detected a depolarization-evoked transient inward current, known to be TTX-sensitive NaV (De Biase et al., 2010De Biase L.M. Nishiyama A. Bergles D.E. Excitability and synaptic communication within the oligodendrocyte lineage.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Káradóttir et al., 2008Káradóttir R.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and outward currents known to represent voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) currents, in a subset of OPCs at E18. Notably, KV currents were detected in 85% of cells, whereas NaV were detected in only 38% of OPCs at E18 (p = 0.04), indicating that KV channel expression starts before NaV expression. Although both the proportion of OPCs with functional NaV channels and their density sharply increased after birth, the proportion of OPCs with NaV channel expression lagged behind KV channels (Figure 1I). The peak NaV channel density coincided with the start of myelination (21.5 ± 1.7 pA/pF, p = 1.6 × 10−10) and was detected in over 90% of OPCs recorded from the second postnatal week (Hamano et al., 1998Hamano K. Takeya T. Iwasaki N. Nakayama J. Ohto T. Okada Y. A quantitative study of the progress of myelination in the rat central nervous system, using the immunohistochemical method for proteolipid protein.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 108: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The density of NaV channels began to decline after the first month to a lower steady level (13.8 ± 1.2 pA/pF, p = 5 × 10−3) following the end of the peak period of developmental myelination (Hamano et al., 1998Hamano K. Takeya T. Iwasaki N. Nakayama J. Ohto T. Okada Y. A quantitative study of the progress of myelination in the rat central nervous system, using the immunohistochemical method for proteolipid protein.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 108: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Figures 1C, 1D, and 1I). Despite the decline in NaV density with age, the majority, but not all, of postnatal OPCs had detectable NaV currents (Figures 1D and 1I). OPCs without NaV had a compact high membrane resistance, similar to that of OPCs with NaV (p = 0.54), but not a low membrane resistance, as is more reminiscent of OPCs that have started to differentiate (De Biase et al., 2010De Biase L.M. Nishiyama A. Bergles D.E. Excitability and synaptic communication within the oligodendrocyte lineage.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cell capacitance, a measure of membrane surface area, significantly changed with age (p = 4 × 10−7), starting low, peaking at the time when the myelination rate is highest in the forebrain, and then declining after the first month to a level similar to that of prenatal cells (Figure 1J). None of these properties differed between male and female animals (Figures S1A–S1C). These data show that newly formed OPCs acquire voltage-gated ion channels at different rates and that the density of voltage-gated ion channels, and thus OPC excitability, changes throughout the life of the animals. The timing of these changes, intriguingly, aligns with key milestones of myelination and development. To address when OPCs acquire functional glutamate receptors, we voltage-clamped OPCs from E13–P330 as before. We first detected kainate-evoked currents (30 μM; activates both α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid [AMPA] and kainate [KA] receptors) in a majority of OPCs at E18 (86%; Figures 1E, 1F, and 1I), coinciding with the appearance of KV. At this time point, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 60 μM)-evoked currents were undetectable (Figures 1G–1I). When myelination in the forebrain is at its highest rate (P6–P35; Hamano et al., 1998Hamano K. Takeya T. Iwasaki N. Nakayama J. Ohto T. Okada Y. A quantitative study of the progress of myelination in the rat central nervous system, using the immunohistochemical method for proteolipid protein.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 108: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), NMDA receptor (NMDAR) density peaked, coinciding with peak NaV density, and, at this time, the proportion of OPCs with NMDARs was the highest, at ∼80% (Figures 1H and 1I). In contrast to NMDA, KA-evoked currents were detected in nearly all OPCs after birth (Figure 1E, 1F, and 1I). AMPA/KA receptor (KAR) densities gradually increased with age (p = 2.1 × 10−5; Figures 1E and 1F). Following sexual maturity, NMDAR density began to decrease, and NMDA-evoked currents were barely detectable by 6 months (0.006 ± 0.005 pA/pF, p = 3 × 10−4; Figures 1G–1I) and completely undetectable at 9 months, a time when remyelination potential has declined (Huang et al., 2011Huang J.K. Jarjour A.A. Nait Oumesmar B. Kerninon C. Williams A. Krezel W. Kagechika H. Bauer J. Zhao C. Baron-Van Evercooren A. et al.Retinoid X receptor gamma signaling accelerates CNS remyelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and addition of new myelinating oligodendrocytes in the CC has ceased (Tripathi et al., 2017Tripathi R.B. Jackiewicz M. McKenzie I.A. Kougioumtzidou E. Grist M. Richardson W.D. Remarkable stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes in mice.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 316-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The glutamate receptor density in OPCs did not, however, differ between female and male animals (Figures S1D–S1F). Spontaneous synaptic-like inputs became prominent at the end of the first week (p = 0.008) and remained comparable throughout life (0.02 ± 0.008 Hz, p = 0.2). These data show that OPCs acquire functional glutamate receptors at different rates and that their density peaks at different ages. In particular, NMDAR density and the proportion of OPCs with NMDARs peaked at the time of myelination. Importantly, although OPCs receive synaptic inputs at similar frequencies throughout life, their response to these inputs is likely to vary with age, in line with altered glutamate receptor expression. The observed changes in ion channel and glutamate receptor densities in OPCs with age, intriguingly, align with milestones of myelination and development. Thus, to test whether the molecular signatures of key biological properties in OPCs also change with age, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of OPCs isolated by PDGFRα magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS; enriching for OPCs expressing PDGFRα) at different ages: E16, P12, P80, and P310. We observed that embryonic OPCs had molecular signatures of migrating cells (e.g., Dcc and Ephb2), significantly more so compared with OPCs from P12 or older mice. However, at P12, OPCs had stronger signatures of proliferating (e.g., Pdgfra, Ptch1, and Mki67) and committed OPCs (Myrf and Enpp6) and upregulated signal transduction but a reduced migratory molecular signature (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D ). Both molecular signatures of differentiation and proliferation decreased from P12 to P80 and further decreased in old OPCs. Between P12 and P80, there is a significant decrease in molecular signatures for cell cycle regulation (e.g., Mki67, H2afx, and Ccnb2), differentiation, and metabolism at the time when myelination starts to decline (Figure 2C). OPCs from older animals further downregulate cell cycle regulatory and differentiation genes, concomitant with upregulation of pro-quiescence genes and downregulation of genes regulating anti-quiescence, sensing neuronal activity, stem cell maintenance, and transcription (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2E). The gene expression of NaV (α subunits Scn3a and Scn7a, and β auxiliary subunits Scn1b, Scn3b, and Scn4b) and NMDAR subunits (Grin1, Grin2a, Grin 2C, and Grin3a) significantly increased from embryonic to postnatal OPCs, and subsequently all remained constant to old age, with the exception of Grin3a and Scn3b. However, AMPAR and KAR subunits, apart from Grik3, remained constant from E16 to old age (Figures S2A–S2C; Table S1). These results reflect that NaV, NMDAR, and AMPA/KAR protein expression is post-transcriptionally and/or post-translationally regulated in OPCs. Given the clear change in cell cycle regulatory signatures in older OPCs, we investigated age-related cell cycle changes in OPCs with flow cytometry (Figures 3A, 3B, and S2E–S2G). We identified that the proportion of OPCs in G0/G1 and G2/M phase changed with age (p = 0.003 and p = 9 × 10−6; Figures 3C and 3E), but not the proportion of OPCs in S phase (p = 0.33; Figure 3D). The proportion of OPCs in G2/M phase peaked around P12 (Figure 3E), reflecting the high proliferative state at this time point, which coincided with the peak NaV density (Figures 1C and 1D) and expression of proliferative genes (Figure 2C), and plateaued at P80, a time when NaV density plateaued and cell cycle genes were downregulated (Figures 2C and 2E). The proportion of OPCs in G0/G1 phase gradually increased with age (Figure 3C), indicative of a gradual lengthening of G1 phase or an accumulation of OPCs entering G0 phase. The gradual increase in G0/G1 resembled the gradual increase in AMPA/KAR densities. To test whether ion channel expression changes with the cell cycle, we crossed NG2-EYFP mice with either Fucci2a mice, in which mCherry is expressed during G0/G1 phase (Mort et al., 2014Mort R.L. Ford M.J. Sakaue-Sawano A. Lindstrom N.O. Casadio A. Douglas A.T. Keighren M.A. Hohenstein P. Miyawaki A. Jackson I.J. Fucci2a: a bicistronic cell cycle reporter that allows Cre mediated tissue specific expression in mice.Cell Cycle. 2014; 13: 2681-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; Figures 3A and 3G), or Ki67-RFP mice, in which the reporter protein RFP is expressed during G2/M phase (Basak et al., 2014Basak O. van de Born M. Korving J. Beumer J. van der Elst S. van Es J.H. Clevers H.

OPCs in an active cell cycle (cycling, Ki67-RFP+ or Fucci-mCherry−) have a 1.7-fold higher density of NaV than OPCs in G0/G1phase (non-cycling, Ki67-RFP− or Fucci-mCherry+; Figure 3H; p = 4 × 10−4). There was no change detected in either NMDAR or AMPA/KAR densities between G2/M phase and G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (NMDAR, p = 0.42; AMPA/KAR, p = 0.35; Figures 3I and 3J) or in the proportion of OPCs with detectable evoked currents (NMDAR, p = 0.051; AMPA/KAR, p = 0.86). Neither mouse line can discriminate between OPCs in G1 and G0 phases of the cell cycle. However, if ion channel densities in the G1 phase differ from G0, then an increased heterogeneity would be expected in the recordings from non-cycling OPCs (G0/G1 phase) compared with cycling OPCs (G2/M phase). To test for heterogeneity, we analyzed the variance in the dataset between non-cycling OPCs and cycling OPCs. The variance in the density of NaV channels and NMDARs was identical between both states (NaV, p = 0.08; NMDAR, p = 0.87), whereas the variance in AMPA/KAR densities differed greatly (p = 5 × 10−8), implying that AMPA/KAR densities in OPCs might differ between G1 and G0 phase of the cell cycle.

This regime has been achieved for both bosonic and fermionic atoms, but molecules, with their many internal states, present a special challenge. De Marco et al. cooled a bulk gas of fermionic potassium-rubidium molecules to quantum degeneracy (see the Perspective by Zelevinsky). The authors first cooled atomic potassium and rubidium gases separately, then bound them together into potassium-rubidium molecules, and finally brought the molecules down to their ground state. The density profile of the molecular gas revealed the system's quantum nature, which in turn kept the gas stable by suppressing chemical reactions. Science , this issue p. 853 ; see also p. 820"

Rosenfeld et al. analyzed how CCN affect the properties of marine stratocumulus clouds, which reflect much of the solar radiation received by Earth back to space (see the Perspective by Sato and Suzuki). The CCN abundance explained most of the variability in the radiative cooling. Thus, the magnitude of radiative forcing provided by these clouds is much more sensitive to the presence of CCN than current models indicate, which suggests the existence of other compensating warming effects.

Setting the scene, Spilker reviews the numerous discoveries made using Cassini during the 13 years it spent orbiting Saturn. Iess et al. measured the gravitational pull on Cassini, separating the contributions from the planet and the rings. This allowed them to determine the interior structure of Saturn and the mass of its rings. Buratti et al. present observations of five small moons located in and around the rings. The moons each have distinctive shapes and compositions, owing to accretion of ring material. Tiscareno et al. observed the rings directly at close range, finding complex features sculpted by the gravitational interactions between moons and ring particles. Together, these results show that Saturn's rings are substantially younger than the planet itself and constrain models of their origin.

https://openalex.org/W2909260710,"In the tumor microenvironment (TME) ATP and its receptor P2X7 exert a pivotal influence on cancer growth and tumor-host interactions. Here we analyzed the different effect of P2X7 genetic deficiency versus its antagonism on response against P2X7-expressing implanted tumors. We focused on immune cell expression of ATP degrading enzymes CD39 and CD73 and in vivo measured TME's ATP. The immune infiltrate of tumors growing in P2X7 null mice shows a decrease in CD8+ cells and an increased number of Tregs, overexpressing the fitness markers OX40, PD-1, and CD73. A similar Treg phenotype is also present in the spleen of tumor-bearing P2X7 null mice and it is paralleled by a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines and an increase in TGF-β. Differently, systemic administration of the P2X7 blocker A740003 in wild-type mice left unaltered the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and Treg lymphocytes but increased CD4+ effector cells and decreased their expression of CD39 and CD73. P2X7 blockade did not affect spleen immune cell composition or ectonucleotidase expression but increased circulating INF-γ. Augmented CD73 in P2X7 null mice was mirrored by a decrease in TME ATP concentration and nucleotide reduced secretion from immune cells. On the contrary, TME ATP levels remained unaltered upon P2X7 antagonism, owing to release of ATP from cancerous cells and diminished ectonucleotidase expression by CD4+ and dendritic cells. These data point at P2X7 receptor as a key determinant of TME composition due to its combined action on immune cell infiltrate, ectonucleotidases, and ATP release."

Here we report the observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions between $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules in the rovibrational ground state and $^{40}$K atoms. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levels of their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of the magnetic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss rate coefficients. We have observed three resonances at approximately 101 G in various atom-molecule scattering channels, with the widths being a few hundred milliGauss. The observed atom-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with an unprecedented resolution. Our work will help to improve the understanding of complicated ultracold collisions, and open up the possibility of creating ultracold triatomic molecules."

These findings reveal a morphogenetic role for IRs and demonstrate the central role of phasic thermosensing in innocuous thermosensation. Animals rely on thermosensation to maintain appropriate body temperatures; avoid thermal extremes; and, in vipers, bats, and blood-feeding insects, locate warm-blooded prey (Bagriantsev and Gracheva, 2015Bagriantsev S.N.

Peripheral thermosensation in mammals.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). From insects to vertebrates, thermosensing depends on multiple classes of thermosensors with distinct thermal sensitivities and behavioral roles (Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015Barbagallo B. Garrity P.A. Temperature sensation in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 34: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Palkar et al., 2015Palkar R. Lippoldt E.K. McKemy D.D.

Peripheral thermosensation in mammals.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thermosensors activated by noxious heat or cold commonly exhibit temperature thresholds beyond which they drive aversive responses. On the other hand, thermosensors responsive to innocuous temperatures commonly lack temperature thresholds. They instead exhibit robust baseline spiking and are more responsive to changes in temperature than its absolute value (Hensel, 1976Hensel H. Functional and structural basis of thermoreception.Prog. Brain Res. 1976; 43: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Palkar et al., 2015Palkar R. Lippoldt E.K. McKemy D.D. The molecular and cellular basis of thermosensation in mammals.Curr.

Neurosci. 2014; 15: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). For example, in mammalian skin, innocuous cooling sensors primarily exhibit transient increases in firing upon cooling and decreases upon warming, while innocuous warming sensors exhibit the converse behavior (Hensel, 1976Hensel H. Functional and structural basis of thermoreception.Prog. Brain Res. 1976; 43: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). While it is clear that innocuous thermosensors have key roles in thermoregulation, how they encode temperature information and control thermoregulatory responses remains a major area of inquiry (Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015Barbagallo B.

At the molecular level, multiple receptors have been implicated in innocuous thermosensing and behavioral thermoregulation in Drosophila. The Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel TRPA1 and the Gustatory Receptor (GR) GR28b mediate warmth-sensing in distinct sets of thermosensory neurons (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N.

In addition, a trio of Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), IR21a, IR25a, and IR93a, was recently shown to mediate the detection of cooling in the larva (Knecht et al., 2016Knecht Z.A. Silbering A.F. Ni L.

The IRs are a large family of invertebrate-specific sensory receptors related to variant ionotropic glutamate receptors (Croset et al., 2010Croset V. Rytz R. Cummins S.F. Budd A. Brawand D.

Among the IRs involved in thermosensing, IR25a and IR93a serve as co-receptors and act in multiple classes of sensory neurons, while IR21a appears specific for cooling detection (Knecht et al., 2016Knecht Z.A. Silbering A.F. Ni L. Klein M. Budelli G. Bell R. Abuin L. Ferrer A.J. Samuel A.D. Benton R. Garrity P.A.

How the information provided by these multiple classes of molecular receptors supports thermosensory behavior remains an open question. At a cellular level, rapid responses to innocuous temperatures in Drosophila rely on peripheral thermosensors, including Hot Cells and Cold Cells (Gallio et al., 2011Gallio M. Ofstad T.A. Macpherson L.J. Wang J.W. Zuker C.S.

Hot and Cold Cells are located in the arista, an extension of the antenna, and provide thermosensory input to target neurons in the antennal lobe of the fly brain (Frank et al., 2015Frank D.D.

Mazor O. Wilson R.I. Thermosensory processing in the Drosophila brain.Nature. 2015; 519: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). How Drosophila Hot and Cold Cells encode thermosensory information, including whether their activities primarily reflect absolute temperature (tonic signaling), temperature change (phasic signaling), or both (phasic-tonic signaling), has not been determined. At an anatomical level, the sensory endings of Hot Cells and Cold Cells have very different morphologies (Foelix et al., 1989Foelix R.F. Stocker R.F. Steinbrecht R.A. Fine structure of a sensory organ in the arista of Drosophila melanogaster and some other dipterans.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hot Cell outer segments are small and finger-like, while Cold Cell outer segments are large and terminate in elaborate lamellae, layers of infolded plasma membrane thought to contain the thermotransduction machinery (Foelix et al., 1989Foelix R.F. Stocker R.F. Steinbrecht R.A. Fine structure of a sensory organ in the arista of Drosophila melanogaster and some other dipterans.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The extent of lamellation varies among Cold Cells within and between insect species and correlates with the neuron’s thermosensitivity (Altner and Loftus, 1985Altner H. Loftus R.

Many vertebrate thermosensory neurons also have elaborate morphologies—from free nerve endings in mammalian skin to mitochondria-packed termini in rattlesnake pit organs (Goris, 2011Goris R.C. Infrared organs of snakes: an integral part of vision.J. Herpetol. 2011; 45: 2-14Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Munger and Ide, 1988Munger B.L. Ide C.

Morphologic diversity of cutaneous sensory afferents revealed by genetically directed sparse labeling.eLife. 2012; 1: e00181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Despite the potential importance of these structures for thermotransduction, the molecules specifying them are unknown (Dong et al., 2015Dong X. Shen K. Bülow H.E.

Branching out: mechanisms of dendritic arborization.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Here, we use a combination of electrophysiology, molecular genetics, ultrastructure, and behavior to investigate how the Drosophila thermosensory system encodes thermosensory input and to identify key regulators of thermosensor development and function. These studies reveal that the cold cells are phasic detectors of temperature change, not cold sensors. Their steady-state activity does not increase at colder temperatures. Instead, they are transiently activated upon cooling and transiently inhibited upon warming, exhibiting this activity at temperatures both above and below the fly’s preferred temperature. Furthermore, although activated by cooling, they mediate both warm and cool avoidance behavior. We suggest that cold cells be renamed “Cooling Cells” to accurately reflect their properties. At the molecular level, we find they rely upon a trio of IR family receptors to detect temperature (rather than the previously reported Brividos; Gallio et al., 2011Gallio M. Ofstad T.A. Macpherson L.J. Wang J.W. Zuker C.S. The coding of temperature in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2011; 144: 614-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and ultrastructural analyses reveal a role for IR family sensory receptors in specifying sensory neuron morphogenesis as well as thermosensitivity. To assess thermosensory encoding in the arista, we established an electrophysiological preparation to monitor arista thermoreceptor spiking in response to discrete temperature steps. Prior studies have relied on calcium imaging, which reports relative rather than absolute levels of activity, limiting the ability to distinguish among tonic, phasic, and phasic-tonic sensory encoding. Extracellular recording was performed through an opening created at the antennal arista tip, distal to thermoreceptor endings. The arista contains two classes of thermosensory neurons, originally called Cold Cells and Hot Cells. In wild-type animals, only the cooling-activated spikes of Cold Cells were readily observed (Figures 1A and S1A). When detected, the warming-activated spikes of Hot Cells were ∼4-fold smaller in amplitude; they were detectable above background only in rare preparations with highly favorable signal to noise (Figure S2) or in animals whose Cold Cells were functionally compromised, as detailed below. When exposed to alternating air streams of different temperatures (20°C versus 25°C or 25°C versus 30°C), Cold Cell activity transiently decreased during warming (often ceasing for a few seconds) and transiently increased during cooling (Figure 1A). To further assess how Cold Cell spiking encodes thermosensory input, samples were held at constant temperature (30°C) for ∼120 s to establish a stable baseline firing rate, cooled to 25°C over ∼4 s, and subsequently held at 25°C for another ∼120 s. Consistent with high thermosensitivity, Cold Cell spiking increased by >50% after an ∼0.1° decrease (∼0.52 s after cooling onset), reaching a peak spike rate of approximately three times baseline after an ∼0.2°C decrease (∼0.65 s after cooling onset). Indicative of rapid adaptation, the response declined toward pre-stimulus levels even as the cooling ramp continued toward 25°C (Figures 1B and S1B). Importantly, Cold Cells did not exhibit tonic thermoreceptor activity. Steady-state spike rates of samples held at 30°C and 25°C were not statistically distinct; in fact, spike rates trended lower at 25°C, the opposite of tonic cold receptor activity (102 ± 20 [SEM, n = 7] at 30°C, 92 ± 19 [n = 7] at 25°C). Thus, under the conditions examined, Cold Cells behave as rapidly adapting, phasic thermoreceptors. Their activity is bidirectional in that they are activated by cooling and inhibited by warming. Cold Cells operated similarly at temperatures above and below the fly’s preferred temperature of ∼25°C, as they also exhibited robust phasic responses to cooling from 25°C to 20°C (Figure 1C, purple trace). The absence of tonic cold receptor activity was particularly apparent when comparing the spike rates of samples held at constant temperature for ∼60 s after a temperature change. For example, at this time point, preparations cooled to ∼25°C exhibited higher spike rates than preparations heated to ∼25°C (Figure 1C, green and orange traces, respectively), demonstrating the persistent influence of prior exposure to cooling and warming. In addition, samples held at ∼20°C for ∼60 s after cooling had similar spike rates as samples held at ∼30°C for ∼60 s after heating, further demonstrating that Cold Cell spiking is not tightly coupled to absolute temperature (Figure 1C, purple and pink traces, respectively). Together, these data demonstrate that Cold Cells are not receptors for cool temperatures, at least under the conditions examined here. Rather, they serve as phasic sensors whose activity reflects recent temperature change. Cold Cell thermosensing has been proposed to involve a set of TRP channels, the Brividos (Gallio et al., 2011Gallio M. Ofstad T.A. Macpherson L.J. Wang J.W. Zuker C.S. The coding of temperature in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2011; 144: 614-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into their function, we assessed their impact on Cold Cell responses using electrophysiology. Surprisingly, we observed no alterations in Cold Cell thermosensitivity when testing the brivido1 and brivido2 mutants used in that prior study (Figures 1D–1F and S1C–S1F). To exclude assay details or strain contamination as explanations for our failure to observe a defect, calcium imaging was found to yield a consistent result (Figures S1D and S1E), and the presence of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Figure S1F). One possible explanation for the discrepancy between our results and the prior report could be that genetic background differences among strains in the prior report altered GCaMP expression levels, yielding apparent reductions in response amplitude even though the neuron’s underlying thermosensitivity was unchanged. As Cold Cells showed no detectable requirement for Brividos to sense temperature, alternative receptors were sought. Cooling detection in Drosophila larvae depends on three IRs: IR21a, IR25a, and IR93a (Knecht et al., 2016Knecht Z.A. Silbering A.F. Ni L. Klein M. Budelli G. Bell R. Abuin L. Ferrer A.J. Samuel A.D.

Klein M. Svec K.V. Budelli G. Chang E.C. Ferrer A.J. Benton R. Samuel A.D. Garrity P.A. The ionotropic receptors IR21a and IR25a mediate cool sensing in Drosophila.eLife. 2016; 5: e13254Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). IR21a and IR25a expression has been detected in the arista (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), and adults lacking these IRs show altered thermal preferences (Enjin et al., 2016Enjin A. Zaharieva E.E. Frank D.D. Mansourian S. Suh G.S. Gallio M. Stensmyr M.C. Humidity sensing in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: 1352-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), making them promising candidates. To assess whether IR proteins might participate in Cold Cell thermotransduction, their distribution within the arista was examined. Immunostaining revealed robust concentrations of IR21a, IR25a, and IR93a proteins in Cold Cell sensory endings, consistent with a role in thermosensing (Figure 2). Expression of IR25a and IR93a, but not IR21a, was also detected in Hot Cells (Figure 2), consistent with the broader expression of the IR25a and IR93a co-receptors compared to cooling-specific IR21a. Immunostaining for each IR was eliminated in the corresponding mutant, confirming antisera specificity (Figure S3). Arista thermoreceptor responses were examined in Ir21a, Ir25a, and Ir93a mutants. Consistent with an essential role for each of these IRs in Cold Cell thermosensing, the cooling-activated responses characteristic of Cold Cells were abolished in each Ir mutant (Figures 3A, 3D, 3F, 3H, 3J, S4A, and S4B). Rather than cooling-activated responses, each Ir mutant exhibited warming-activated spiking (Figures 3A, S4A, and S4B); this was subsequently found to come from the Hot Cell, whose activity is more readily detected in the Ir mutants. The phenotype of each Ir mutant was rescued using the corresponding wild-type transgene, confirming specificity (Figures 3E, 3G, 3I, and 3J). Cold Cell responses were unaffected in Gr28b mutant animals, whose Hot Cells are not thermosensitive, indicating that Hot and Cold Cell thermosensitivity are functionally independent (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3J). To confirm that the warmth-activated spiking observed in the Ir mutants reflected Hot Cell activity, Ir21a,Gr28b double mutants, in which the Hot Cell is not thermosensitive, were examined. Indeed, responses in the Ir21a,Gr28b double mutants animals completely lacked thermosensitivity (Figures 3A, 3C, and 3J). The results of these electrophysiological analyses were confirmed using calcium imaging. Thermosensitive Cold Cell responses, monitored using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6m, were dramatically reduced in Ir21a, Ir25a, and Ir93a mutants, while Hot Cell responses were unaffected (Figures S4C and S4D). Thus, IR21a, IR25a, and IR93a are specifically required for Cold Cell thermosensing. As noted above, Hot Cell spikes were rarely detected in wild-type recordings but readily visible in Ir mutants. Calcium imaging revealed no decrement in Hot Cell responses in any of the Ir mutants (Figures S4C and S4D), so we analyzed Hot Cell spiking in greater detail in one Ir mutant, Ir93a−/−. Hot Cells exhibited robust phasic thermosensitivity, with warming eliciting transient increases in spiking and cooling transient decreases in spiking (Figures S4B, S5A, and S5B). The response was highly thermosensitive (though less thermosensitive than the Cold Cell response), as warming of ∼2.5 to 3°C resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in Hot Cell spiking (Figure S5C). In contrast to the Cold Cells, which were purely phasic, the Hot Cells also exhibited tonic thermosensory responses (Figure S5B). When held at constant temperature, steady-state Hot Cell spiking was temperature dependent (17 ± 3 Hz at 20°C [n = 7, mean ± SEM], 37 ± 6 at 25°C [n = 14], and 74 ± 17 at 30°C [n = 7] [30°C distinct from 20°C, alpha = 0.01, Tukey HSD]). This corresponds to a Q10 of ∼4.4, which is modest but larger than the mean Q10 of ∼2.3 for biological processes (Dell et al., 2011Dell A.I. Pawar S. Savage V.M. Systematic variation in the temperature dependence of physiological and ecological traits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 10591-10596Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that Hot Cell activity reflected a combination of recent temperature change and absolute temperature, at least under the conditions assayed here. As the Cold Cells possess large and morphologically elaborate sensory endings (Altner and Loftus, 1985Altner H. Loftus R. Ultrastructure and function of insect thermo- and hygroreceptors.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1985; 30: 273-295Crossref Google Scholar, Foelix et al., 1989Foelix R.F. Stocker R.F. Steinbrecht R.A. Fine structure of a sensory organ in the arista of Drosophila melanogaster and some other dipterans.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we examined whether Cold Cell morphology was visibly altered by IR loss. This seemed a possibility, as IR loss both abolished Cold Cell spiking and permitted the observation of Hot Cell spiking (Figure 3), as might be predicted if Cold Cell dendrite morphology were affected. Thermoreceptor sensory endings were initially examined by fluorescence immunostaining for beta-tubulin, as microtubules are both enriched in Cold Cell sensory endings (Foelix et al., 1989Foelix R.F. Stocker R.F. Steinbrecht R.A. Fine structure of a sensory organ in the arista of Drosophila melanogaster and some other dipterans.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and readily identified in electron micrographs, permitting correlation between light and electron microscopy. In wild-type tissue, three thick regions of tubulin staining were detected, corresponding to three arista sensilla, each containing microtubule-rich thermoreceptor dendrites (Figure 4A). IR21a staining overlapped and extended distal to each tubulin-rich region, consistent with IR21a’s enrichment in the outer segment of the Cold Cell sensory ending. In Ir21a mutants, not only was IR21a immunostaining absent, but also tubulin staining was greatly reduced (Figure 4A). Ir25a and Ir93a mutant phenotypes were similar to one another but less severe than the Ir21a phenotype; in both Ir25a and Ir93a mutants, three discrete regions of tubulin staining were present, but the distal concentration of IR21a protein was absent (Figure 4A). To examine the morphological impact of IR loss at higher resolution, we used transmission electron microscopy of samples that were structurally well preserved by high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution. In wild-type, each arista sensillum contains one Hot Cell and one Cold Cell, and each thermoreceptor extends a dendrite with a short ciliary region from which protrudes a morphologically distinct outer segment (Figure 4B) (Foelix et al., 1989Foelix R.F.

Our hypothesis was that bumblebee hives collected from a Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) infected tomato greenhouse, preserve an infectious primary inoculum. Placing a bumblebee hive collected from a ToBRFV contaminated greenhouse, in a glass-/net-house containing only uninfected healthy tomato plants, spread ToBRFV disease. Control uninfected tomato plants grown in a glass-/net-house devoid of any beehive remained uninfected. ToBRFV-contaminated hives carried infectious viral particles as demonstrated in a biological assay on laboratory test plants of virus extracted from hive components. Viral particles isolated from a contaminated hive had a typical tobamovirus morphology observed in transmission electron microscopy. Assembly of ToBRFV genome was achieved by next generation sequencing analysis of RNA adhering to the bumblebee body. Bumblebee dissection showed that ToBRFV was mostly present in the abdomen suggesting viral disease spread via buzz pollination. These results demonstrate that bumblebee hives collected from ToBRFV-contaminated greenhouses carry a primary inoculum that reflects the status of viruses in the growing area. This new mode of ToBRFV spread by pollinators opens an avenue for detection of viruses in a growing area through analysis of the pollinators, as well as emphasizes the need to reevaluate the appropriate disease management protocols."

Given that the same projectile population strikes Earth and the Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be quantified by using a method to date lunar craters with diameters greater than 10 kilometers and younger than 1 billion years. We found that the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago. The terrestrial crater record shows similar results, suggesting that the deficit of large terrestrial craters between 300 million and 650 million years ago relative to more recent times stems from a lower impact flux, not preservation bias. The almost complete absence of terrestrial craters older than 650 million years may indicate a massive global-scale erosion event near that time."

https://openalex.org/W2909627637,"Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSN) is implicated in neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease and has prompted searches for natural compounds inhibiting αSN aggregation and reducing its tendency to form toxic oligomers. Oil from the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) represents the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet and contains variable levels of phenolic compounds, many structurally related to the compound oleuropein. Here, using αSN aggregation, fibrillation, size-exclusion chromatography–multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS)-based assays, and toxicity assays, we systematically screened the fruit extracts of 15 different olive varieties to identify compounds that can inhibit αSN aggregation and oligomer toxicity and also have antioxidant activity. Polyphenol composition differed markedly among varieties. The variety with the most effective antioxidant and aggregation activities, Koroneiki, combined strong inhibition of αSN fibril nucleation and elongation with strong disaggregation activity on preformed fibrils and prevented the formation of toxic αSN oligomers. Fractionation of the Koroneiki extract identified oleuropein aglycone, hydroxyl oleuropein aglycone, and oleuropein as key compounds responsible for the differences in inhibition across the extracts. These phenolic compounds inhibited αSN amyloidogenesis by directing αSN monomers into small αSN oligomers with lower toxicity, thereby suppressing the subsequent fibril growth phase. Our results highlight the molecular consequences of differences in the level of effective phenolic compounds in different olive varieties, insights that have implications for long-term human health."
https://openalex.org/W2908611668,"Background Adiponectin (AD) cardioprotective activities are mediated by AMPK, a fuel-sensing molecule sharing common targets and cellular activities with SIRT-1. Whether AD preconditioning may involve SIRT-1 activity is not known; however, the protective role of SIRT-1 during ischemia and the potential interplay between AMPK and SIRT-1 suggest this possibility. Methods Isolated hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 85) underwent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R, 30/180 min). Preconditioning with resveratrol (RSV, SIRT-1 activator) was compared to preconditioning with AD alone, or in combination with compound C (CC, AMPK inhibitor) or sirtinol (STN, SIRT-1 inhibitor). For each heart, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular developed pressure (dLVP), coronary flow (CF) and left ventricular infarct mass (IM) were measured, together with the phosphorylation/activation status of AMPK, LKB1, eNOS and SIRT-1, at the beginning (15 min) and at the end (180 min) of reperfusion. Results and conclusions When compared to I/R, both RSV and AD improved cardiac function and reduced IM (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). Cardioprotective effects of AD were completely reversed in the AD+CC group, and significantly attenuated in the AD+STN group. Both RSV and AD increased eNOS, AMPK and LKB1 phosphorylation (for each parameter: p < 0.05 vs. I/R, in both RSV and AD treatment groups) at 15 min of reperfusion, and SIRT-1 activity at the end of reperfusion (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 vs. I/R, respectively). Interestingly, AD-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK and LKB1, and SIRT-1 deacetylation activity was markedly reduced in both the AD+CC and AD+STN groups (p < 0.05 vs. AD). Thus, AD-mediated cardioprotection requires both AMPK and SIRT-1 signaling pathways, that act as a component of a cycle and regulate each other’s activities."

After BMT, antiviral antibodies that would have kept CMV at bay dwindle because host plasma cells are ablated and the donor B cell pool reconstitutes poorly.

In contrast to bacterial enzymes, there are very few reports on fungal GH30-7 xylanases. Cellulolytic fungi, such as Trichoderma reesei, Myceliophthora thermophila, and Talaromyces cellulolyticus, which are promising enzyme sources for hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass (14Karnaouri A.

However, information on their catalytic properties is limited, except for those expressed in T. reesei. This fungus produces two types of GH30-7 xylanases possessing exo-xylanase activity toward the reducing end of xylan (XYN IV) and glucuronoxylanase activity similar to the bacterial GH30-8 enzyme (XYN VI) (19Tenkanen M.

The notable difference in the sequences of fungal GH30-7 and GH30-8 xylanases is the absence of an Arg293 counterpart (20Biely P. Puchart V. Stringer M.A. Mørkeberg Krogh K.B.R Trichoderma reesei XYN VI: a novel appendage-dependent eukaryotic glucuronoxylan hydrolase.FEBS J. 2014; 281 (25041335): 3894-390310.1111/febs.12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Without a three-dimensional structure of GH30-7, it is hard to determine the structural underpinnings of the MeGlcA appendage dependence of XYN VI and structural differences between exo-xylanase and glucuronoxylanase. In a preliminary study, we detected two GH30-7 proteins from T. cellulolyticus, termed Xyn30A (NCBI protein ID GAM43270) and Xyn30B (GAM36763), which were secreted as major proteins in a culture containing birchwood glucuronoxylan (Fig. S1). Xyn30A has been predicted to be a putative exo-xylanase from its relatively high sequence similarity with XYN IV (77%), whereas Xyn30B has remained to be identified due to lack of an appropriate GH30-homologous protein. Here, we report the catalytic properties and crystal structure of Xyn30B. Xyn30B exhibited an obvious, MeGlcA appendage–dependent glucuronoxylanase activity. Moreover, we found that Xyn30B exhibits a novel xylobiohydrolase activity wherein xylobiose (Xyl2) is released from the nonreducing end of β-1,4-xylan and XOS. This unique bifunctional activity and the conserved Arg residue found in Xyn30B are discussed based on the structural comparison between GH30-8 and GH30-7 xylanase. The Xyn30B gene is composed of 1,425 bp without introns in the T. cellulolyticus genome and encodes a protein consisting of 474 amino acid residues. Xyn30B has a relatively high amino acid sequence identity with fungal GH30-7 enzymes, such as XYN IV (38.2%) and XYN VI (42.2%) from T. reesei and XYLD (53.4%) from Bispora sp. (19Tenkanen M.

Two conserved catalytic residues previously identified in GH30 xylanase—a general acid/base residue and a nucleophilic residue—were found to correspond with Glu202 and Glu297, respectively, in Xyn30B (Fig. 1, gray highlights). As with XYN IV and XYN VI, an Arg residue responsible for recognition of the MeGlcA in GH30-8 enzymes is not conserved in Xyn30B (Fig. 1, red box). The Xyn30B amino acid sequence includes a signal sequence (residues 1–22) as predicted by the SignalP server (23Nielsen H. Predicting secretory proteins with signalP.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1611 (28451972): 59-7310.1007/978-1-4939-7015-5_6Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The cleavage site of the signal peptide was estimated to lie between Ala19 and Ile20 or between Ala22 and Gln23. Eight of the N-glycosylation sites (Asn60, Asn88, Asn111, Asn154, Asn215, Asn334, Asn346, and Asn412) were predicted by the NetNglyc server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. Xyn30B was overexpressed using the T. cellulolyticus homologous expression system (24Inoue H. Fujii T. Yoshimi M. Taylor 2nd, L.E. Decker S.R. Kishishita S. Nakabayashi M. Ishikawa K. Construction of a starch-inducible homologous expression system to produce cellulolytic enzymes from Acremonium cellulolyticus.J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2013; 40 (23700177): 823-83010.1007/s10295-013-1286-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme showed a molecular mass slightly larger than 49,403 Da, which has been estimated from the primary structure excluding the N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the average molecular mass of Xyn30B determined by TOF-MS was 56,354 Da, indicating that Xyn30B was glycosylated at several sites. The glycosylation sites in Xyn30B were assigned by X-ray crystallography, as described below. Xyn30B exhibited xylanase activity on beechwood xylan (11.3 units mg−1) and birchwood xylan (9.0 units mg−1), whereas degradation activities for arabinoxylan, carboxymethyl cellulose, glucomannan, and xyloglucan were not detected by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. The optimum pH and temperature for hydrolysis of beechwood xylan were estimated around pH 4 and 50 °C, respectively (Fig. S2). Xyn30B retained more than 90% activity after incubation for 30 min at 40 °C in pH over a range of 3–6.5 and was stable for 24 h at temperatures below 40 °C at pH 4.0. The initial degradation product of beechwood xylan by Xyn30B was found to be acidic XOSs, whereas linear oligosaccharides and xylose were hardly detected (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that Xyn30B is a glucuronoxylan-specific xylanase. Xyn30B also degraded the MeGlcA-appended oligosaccharide analogue, borohydride-reduced aldotetrauronic acid (BR-MeGlcA3Xyl3), into aldotriuronic acid (MeGlcA2Xyl2) and xylitol. Kinetic parameters were also determined as follows: Km = 19 mg ml−1 and kcat = 17 s−1 for beechwood xylan; Km = 0.064 mm and kcat = 23 s−1 for BR-MeGlcA3Xyl3. The low Km value for BR-MeGlcA3Xyl3 suggests that Xyn30B has high affinity for MeGlcA. The molecular content in acidic XOS produced by Xyn30B was evaluated by ESI(−)-MS (Fig. 4A). Acidic products were readily observed as singly and doubly charged deprotonated species generically labeled [XylnMeGlcA − H]− (1−, mainly COO− from MeGlcA) and [XylnMeGlcA − 2H]2− (2−, COO− from MeGlcA and O− from anomeric carbon). They correspond to the XOS backbones formed by n xylose units and carrying one MeGlcA moiety with no information about its position. The ESI(−) analysis filters the oligoxylose species, Xyln, carrying no acidic moiety and allows for instant visualization of the shortest acidic product, which was found to be Xyl2MeGlcA at m/z 471 (Fig. 4A, highlighted in boldface red) and associated with a broad distribution of longer congeners up to Xyl14MeGlcA at m/z 1,027 (2−). The position of the MeGlcA moiety along the XOS chain (reducing end, nonreducing end, or in between) was further revealed using a multistage MS procedure (MSn). Upon activation in MS2 (Fig. 4B), the [Xyl2MeGlcA − H]− expelled a neutral C2H4O2 via a cross-ring cleavage, yielding 0,2A3 at m/z 411 (−60 Da) concomitantly to a xylose unit via a glycosidic bond cleavage that yielded a C2 at m/z 339 (−132 Da). As the precursor ion is two xylose units long, it instantly indicates that the MeGlcA is located at the nonreducing end of Xyl2 (Fig. 4C). Both cross-ring and glycosidic bond cleavages have been found to occur only at the reducing ends of deprotonated acidic products (25Reis A. Domingues M.R.M Domingues P. Ferrer-Correia A.J. Coimbra M.A. Positive and negative electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry as a tool for structural characterisation of acid released oligosaccharides from olive pulp glucuronoxylans.Carbohydr.

Mass Spectrom. 2018; (30597672)10.1002/jms.432110.1002/jms.4321Google Scholar). The ESI(−)-MS3 spectrum of C2 displays two product ions formed upon its dehydration (B2 at m/z 321, −18 Da) and a cross-ring cleavage of the last xylose moiety (0,2X2 at m/z 249) as the two sole fragmentation pathways that are opened up by the MeGlcA position at the reducing end of the activated species (Fig. 4B). Both the cross-ring cleavage (yielding 0,2A4 at m/z 543) and the glycosidic bond cleavage (yielding C3 at m/z 471) were observed in the ESI(−)-MS2 fingerprint of the deprotonated acidic product, [Xyl3MeGlcA − H]−, at m/z 603 (Fig. 5A), indicating that the MeGlcA residue is not located at its reducing end. In the MS3 spectra (Fig. 5A), C3 was found to dissociate into B3 at m/z 453 (dehydration, −18 Da) and 0,2X2 only (cross-ring cleavage at the reducing end). Deviating from the MS2 spectrum of [Xyl2MeGlcA − H]− (Fig. 4B) but resembling the MS3 pattern of C2 from [Xyl2MeGlcA − H]−, it unambiguously localized the acidic MeGlcA pendant group at the reducing end of C3. In a reverse chain reconstruction, one xylose unit was added to the reducing end of C3, demonstrating that [Xyl3MeGlcA − H]− carries the glucuronic acid moiety one unit away from the reducing end (Fig. 5C). A similar conclusion was drawn for [Xyl5MeGlcA − H]− at m/z 867 (Fig. 5B); the ESI(−)-MS2 spectrum barely displayed a xylose-shorter C5 ion product at m/z 735 (glycosidic bond cleavage at the reducing end), indicating the MeGlcA is not located at the reducing end but probably one unit away, considering the low intensity of C5 (26Fouquet T. Sato H. Nakamichi Y. Matsushika A. Inoue H. Electrospray multistage mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode for the unambiguous molecular and structural characterization of acidic hydrolysates from 4-O-methylglucuronoxylan generated by endoxylanases.J. Mass Spectrom. 2018; (30597672)10.1002/jms.432110.1002/jms.4321Google Scholar). Its ESI(−)-MS3 fingerprint was eventually identical to the previous MS3 pattern of C3 from [Xyl3MeGlcA − H]− (Fig. 5A) with the B5 and 0,2X2 product ions only (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the MeGlcA is positioned at the reducing end of C5, one unit away for [Xyl5MeGlcA − H]−. This indicates a generic MeGlcA2Xyln (n > 1) shape for the all of the acidic products released using Xyn30B (Fig. 4A). From these results, Xyn30B appears to specifically cleave glucuronoxylan at the second glycosidic linkage from the MeGlcA residue toward the reducing end, similarly to typical GH30 glucuronoxylanases. During the hydrolysis of beechwood xylan by Xyn30B, we noticed that Xyl2 was produced after prolonged incubation and increased protein loading of the reaction mixture (Fig. 6A). The increases in MeGlcA2Xyl2 and MeGlcA2Xyl3 were also observed with a decrease in longer acidic XOS in the mixture. These results indicate that Xyl2 was produced by further degradation of the acidic XOS. The specific production of Xyl2 suggests that Xyn30B has xylobiohydrolase activity, releasing Xyl2 units from the acidic XOSs that were generated in the initial stage of the reaction. This activity was predicted to release the product from the nonreducing end of MeGlcA2Xyln. In addition, the production of xylotetraose (Xyl4) and xylohexaose (Xyl6) was significantly increased with increasing time compared with that of xylotriose (Xyl3) and xylopentaose (Xyl5) (Fig. 6A). The product concentrations are shown in Table S1. These observations imply that the xylobiohydrolase activity was accompanied by transglycosylation activity, which transfers the Xyl2 from the acidic XOS to the free acceptors (Xyl2 and Xyl4). The xylobiohydrolase activity of Xyn30B was also confirmed for linear XOS, which was MeGlcA appendage–independent. When Xyl3 was used as the substrate, xylose and Xyl2 were produced as hydrolysates, and Xyl5 was formed through a transglycosylation (Fig. 6B). The hydrolase and transglycosylation activities of Xyl3 were 0.388 and 0.303 units mg−1 for the production of xylose and Xyl5, respectively. The major products from Xyl4 were identified as Xyl2 and Xyl6. A small amount of unidentified XOS longer than Xyl6 was also observed during the hydrolysis of these substrates, probably due to further transglycosylation (Fig. 6B, arrows). In contrast, no products were produced when only Xyl2 was used as the substrate (data not shown), suggesting that transglycosylation occurs during the hydrolysis. These results indicate that Xyn30B is a bifunctional enzyme possessing both MeGlcA appendage–dependent glucuronoxylanase activity and xylobiohydrolase (including transglycosylation) activity. The crystal structure of Xyn30B was determined at 2.25 Å resolution by molecular replacement using CaXyn30A as the search model (PDB code 5CXP). The data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The Xyn30B crystal was in the P212121 space group with two protein molecules (chains A and B) in the asymmetric unit.

https://openalex.org/W2910506989,"The eastern Brazilian Amazon contains many isolated ferruginous savanna ecosystem patches (locally known as 'canga vegetation') located on ironstone rocky outcrops on the top of plateaus and ridges, surrounded by tropical rainforests. In the Carajás Mineral Province (CMP), these outcrops contain large iron ore reserves that have been exploited by opencast mining since the 1980s. The canga vegetation is particularly impacted by mining, since the iron ores that occur are associated with this type of vegetation and currently, little is known regarding the extent of canga vegetation patches before mining activities began. This information is important for quantifying the impact of mining, in addition to helping plan conservation programmes. Here, land cover changes of the Canga area in the CMP are evaluated by estimating the pre-mining area of canga patches and comparing it to the actual extent of canga patches. We mapped canga vegetation using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) from 1973 Landsat-1 MSS, 1984 and 2001 Landsat-5 TM, and 2016 Landsat-8 OLI images, and found that canga vegetation originally occupied an area of 144.2 km2 before mining exploitation. By 2016, 19.6% of the canga area was lost in the CMP due to conversion to other land-use types (mining areas, pasturelands). In the Carajás National Forest (CNF), located within the CMP, the original canga vegetation covered 105.2 km2 (2.55% of the CNF total area), and in 2016, canga vegetation occupied an area of 77.2 km2 (1.87%). Therefore, after more than three decades of mineral exploitation, less than 20% of the total canga area was lost. Currently, 21% of the canga area in the CMP is protected by the Campos Ferruginosos National Park. By documenting the initial extent of canga vegetation in the eastern Amazon and the extent to which it has been lost due to mining operations, the results of this work are the first step towards conserving this ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2909578210,"As complications associated with antibiotic resistance have intensified, copper (Cu) is attracting attention as an antimicrobial agent. Recent studies have shown that copper surfaces decrease microbial burden, and host macrophages use Cu to increase bacterial killing. Not surprisingly, microbes have evolved mechanisms to tightly control intracellular Cu pools and protect against Cu toxicity. Here, we identified two genes (copB and copL) encoded within the Staphylococcus aureus arginine-catabolic mobile element (ACME) that we hypothesized function in Cu homeostasis. Supporting this hypothesis, mutational inactivation of copB or copL increased copper sensitivity. We found that copBL are co-transcribed and that their transcription is increased during copper stress and in a strain in which csoR, encoding a Cu-responsive transcriptional repressor, was mutated. Moreover, copB displayed genetic synergy with copA, suggesting that CopB functions in Cu export. We further observed that CopL functions independently of CopB or CopA in Cu toxicity protection and that CopL from the S. aureus clone USA300 is a membrane-bound and surface-exposed lipoprotein that binds up to four Cu+ ions. Solution NMR structures of the homologous Bacillus subtilis CopL, together with phylogenetic analysis and chemical-shift perturbation experiments, identified conserved residues potentially involved in Cu+ coordination. The solution NMR structure also revealed a novel Cu-binding architecture. Of note, a CopL variant with defective Cu+ binding did not protect against Cu toxicity in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that the ACME-encoded CopB and CopL proteins are additional factors utilized by the highly successful S. aureus USA300 clone to suppress copper toxicity."

We found previously that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC), the most potent and abundant Lxr ligand in the developing mouse midbrain, promotes mDA neurogenesis in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that 24,25-EC promotes mDA neurogenesis in an Lxr-dependent manner in the developing mouse midbrain in vivo and also prevents toxicity induced by the Lxr inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, using MS, we show that overexpression of human cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) increases the levels of both 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) and 24,25-EC in the developing midbrain, resulting in a specific increase in mDA neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, but has no effect on oculomotor or red nucleus neurogenesis. 24-HC, unlike 24,25-EC, did not affect in vitro neurogenesis, indicating that the neurogenic effect of 24,25-EC on mDA neurons is specific. Combined, our results indicate that increased levels of 24,25-EC in vivo, by intracerebroventricular delivery in WT mice or by overexpression of its biosynthetic enzyme CYP46A1, specifically promote mDA neurogenesis. We propose that increasing the levels of 24,25-EC in vivo may be a useful strategy to combat the loss of mDA neurons in Parkinson's disease.

https://openalex.org/W2910925293,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently used to treat chronic disorders in children, including inflammation and cancer. Prolonged treatment with GCs is well known to impair bone growth, an effect linked to increased apoptosis and suppressed proliferation in growth plate chondrocytes. We hypothesized that the endogenous antiapoptotic protein humanin (HN) may prevent these effects. Interestingly, GC-induced bone growth impairment and chondrocyte apoptosis was prevented in HN overexpressing mice, HN-treated wild-type mice, and in HN-treated cultured rat metatarsal bones. GC-induced suppression of chondrocyte proliferation was also prevented by HN. Furthermore, GC treatment reduced Indian Hedgehog expression in growth plates of wild-type mice but not in HN overexpressing mice or HN-treated wild-type animals. A Hedgehog (Hh) antagonist, vismodegib, was found to suppress the growth of cultured rat metatarsal bones, and this effect was also prevented by HN. Importantly, HN did not interfere with the desired anti-inflammatory effects of GCs. We conclude that HN is a novel regulator of Hh signaling preventing GC-induced bone growth impairment without interfering with desired effects of GCs. Our data may open for clinical studies exploring a new possible strategy to prevent GC-induced bone growth impairment by cotreating with HN.—Zaman, F., Zhao, Y., Celvin, B., Mehta, H.

The objective of this study was to develop a 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-incorporated CSC with improved antibacterial properties, while maintaining the original advantageous features of CSC. MPC was incorporated into a commercial CSC (Endocem MTA) at 0 wt% (control), 1.5%, 3.0 wt%, 5.0 wt%, 7.5 wt%, and 10 wt%. The setting time, compressive strength, water sorption, and glycerol contact angle were measured. Protein absorption was measured and bacterial adhesion on the surface was evaluated using Enterococcus faecalis. The bactericidal effect was examined by the disc diffusion test. Mineralization ability was assessed based on calcium ion deposition, as assessed by alizarin red staining, after immersion into Hank’s balanced salt solution for 7 days. High concentrations of MPC in CSC (7.5 wt% and 10 wt%) increased the setting time, reduced compressive strength, and reduced wettability. MPC (3 wt%) had greater protein repellent and anti-biofouling effects than those of control and test materials (P < 0.001). However, no bactericidal effect was observed for any control or test materials. There was greater calcium ion deposition on the surface of MPC-supplemented CSC than on the control (P < 0.001). The addition of 3 wt% MPC polymer to CSC confers protein-repellent properties and reduced bacterial attachment, with the potential for improved mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2910580023,"While numerous studies have investigated body image, including body weight perception, most of which have focused on adolescents or young women, few studies have attempted to evaluate body weight perceptions in adult women according to age groups. This study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of self-perceived weight and actual body mass index (BMI) values among adult Korean women according to age. We used data from the 2016 Korean Study of Women's Health Related Issues, a population-based, nationwide, cross-sectional survey. BMI was calculated from self-reported weight and height. Participants were asked to describe their body image by choosing one of the following descriptions: very underweight, underweight, about right, overweight, or obese. The proportions of women aged 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years who underestimated their body weight relative to their actual BMI category were 12.6%, 15.1%, 22.2%, 34.0%, 45.6%, and 50.7%, respectively; those who overestimated their body weight comprised 18.7%, 17.8%, 14.3%, 10.8%, and 7.4%. In all BMI categories, the proportion of those who overestimated their weight status increased as age decreased, while those who underestimated their weight status increased as age increased. After adjusting for possible covariates, age was strongly associated with both underestimation and overestimation. The odds ratio for underestimating one's weight status among women aged 70-79 yeas was 2.96 (95% CI: 2.10-4.18), and that for overestimation was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.35-0.79), compared to women aged 20-29 years. Age is the most important factor associated with weight perceptions among Korean women, affecting both underestimation and overestimation of weight status."
https://openalex.org/W2909952443,"Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway that transports cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for hydrolysis. It is completed by SNARE-mediated fusion of the autophagosome and endolysosome membranes. This process must be carefully regulated to maintain the organization of the membrane system and prevent mistargeted degradation. As yet, models of autophagosomal fusion have not been verified within a cellular context because of difficulties with assessing protein interactions in situ Here, we used high-resolution fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)-FRET of HeLa cells to identify protein interactions within the spatiotemporal framework of the cell. We show that autophagosomal syntaxin 17 (Stx17) heterotrimerizes with synaptosome-associated protein 29 (SNAP29) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7) in situ, highlighting a functional role for VAMP7 in autophagosome clearance that has previously been sidelined in favor of a role for VAMP8. Additionally, we identified multimodal regulation of SNARE assembly by the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein VPS33A, mirroring other syntaxin-SM interactions and therefore suggesting a unified model of SM regulation. Contrary to current theoretical models, we found that the Stx17 N-peptide appears to interact in a positionally conserved, but mechanistically divergent manner with VPS33A, providing a late ""go, no-go"" step for autophagic fusion via a phosphoserine master-switch. Our findings suggest that Stx17 fusion competency is regulated by a phosphosite in its N-peptide, representing a previously unknown regulatory step in mammalian autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2909938442,"Although head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has in the past been largely associated with tobacco use, human papillomavirus (HPV+) oropharynx cancer has in recent years emerged as the fastest growing type of HNSCC. Patients with HPV+ HNSCC have a better prognosis; however, the 5-year survival for both HPV+ and HPV− subtypes with recurrent or metastatic disease is poor. To gain insights into the tumor microenvironments of both HNSCC subtypes and identify potential therapeutic targets, we performed epigenomic deconvolution on 580 HNSCC samples from the TCGA dataset. Deconvolution revealed distinct molecular and histoepigenetic profiles of the two tumor subtypes, including their cellular composition, epigenomic profiles and gene expression for constituent cell types, and potential cancer cell-specific targets. Our analyses show that high abundance of both CD8 T-cells and B-cells explains better prognosis in HPV+ HNSCC. Deconvolution of gene expression profiles revealed higher expression of the immunotherapy target PD-1 in HPV+ immune cells compared to HPV− cells, suggesting that HPV+ tumors may preferentially benefit from PD-1 targeted therapy. Further analyses identified HPV+ and HPV− cancer cell surface proteins that can also serve as potential targets for therapy. Specifically, Wnt pathway receptor ROR2 is preferentially overexpressed in HPV+ subtypes, suggesting opportunities for development of targeted therapy based on HPV status. In summary, the comprehensive molecular and histoepigenetic analysis of tumor microenvironments by epigenomic deconvolution reveals potential novel biomarkers and targets for precision therapy of HNSCC."

The aim of this study was to clarify the extent of this intoxication, its mortality and factors associated with mortality.National databases from Statistics Denmark were used to identify individuals who suffered from CO-poisoning during 1995-2015, as well as information regarding co-morbidities, mortality and manner of death.During the period from 1995 to 2015, 22,930 patients suffered from CO-poisoning in Denmark, and 21,138 of these patients (92%) were hospitalized. A total of 2,102 patients died within the first 30 days after poisoning (9.2%). Among these, 1,792 (85% of 2,102) were declared dead at the scene and 310 (15% of 2,102) died during hospitalization. Deaths due to CO-poisoning from smoke were intentional in 6.3% of cases, whereas deaths due to CO containing gases were intentional in 98.0% of cases. Among patients who survived >30 days, there was no significant difference in survival when comparing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) treatment with no HBO treatment after adjustment for age and co-morbidities such as drug abuse, psychiatric disease, stroke, alcohol abuse, arterial embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease and atrial fibrillation. Several co-morbidities predicted poorer outcomes for patients who survived the initial 30 days.Poisoning from smoke and/or CO is a frequent incident in Denmark accounting for numerous contacts with hospitals and deaths. Both intoxication and mortality are highly associated with co-morbidities interfering with cognitive and physical function. Treatment with HBO was not seen to have an effect on survival."

Usually phosphorus (P) is the most limiting nutrient for crop growth in these regions. The aim of this study was to characterize the gene expression profiles of the genotypes of common bean IAC Imperador (P-responsive) and DOR 364 (P-unresponsive) under different P concentrations using RNA-seq transcriptome sequencing technology. Plants were grown hydroponically, with application of two P concentrations (4.00 mg L-1 restrictive level and 8.00 mg L-1 control level). Differential expression analyses, annotation, and functional classification were performed comparing genotypes within each P rate administered and comparing each genotype response to the different P levels. Considering differential expression analyses within genotypes, IAC Imperador exhibited 1538 up-regulated genes under P restriction and 1679 up-regulated genes in the control, while DOR 364 exhibited 13 up-regulated genes in the control and only 2 up-regulated genes under P restriction, strongly corroborating P-unresponsiveness of this genotype. Genes related to phosphorus restriction were identified among the differentially expressed genes, including transcription factors such as WRKY, ERF, and MYB families, phosphatase related genes such as pyrophosphatase, acid phosphatase, and purple acid phosphatase, and phosphate transporters. The enrichment test for the P restriction treatment showed 123 enriched gene ontologies (GO) for IAC Imperador, while DOR 364 enriched only 24. Also, the enriched GO correlated with P metabolism, compound metabolic processes containing phosphate, nucleoside phosphate binding, phosphorylation, and also response to stresses. Thus, this study proved to be informative to phosphorus limitation in common bean showing global changes at transcript level."

These areas provide critical input to midbrain dopamine neurons regarding expected outcomes, suggesting that effects on learning may result from changes in dopaminergic error signaling.

Notably, these drug-induced deficits are observed after relatively limited drug exposure and are not restricted to a subset of animals, suggesting that declines in processing in these systems do not operate alone but are instead a key early change that could lay the foundation for subsequent progression to addiction. Further, the effects are long lasting, persisting weeks or months after cessation of drug use in short-lived rodents. Thus, they may be particularly relevant to long-term clinical problems such as relapse. A key brain region involved in learning when predictions about outcomes are violated is the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the dopamine neurons that reside therein (Langdon et al., 2018Langdon A.J.

Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine and then, after at least a month of forced abstinence, single-unit activity was recorded from VTA dopamine neurons in response to positive and negative reward prediction errors induced by changes in the number or timing of an expected reward, using a task in which we have shown initial learning to be affected by cocaine self-administration (Roesch et al., 2007bRoesch M.R.

Compared to dopamine neurons recorded in the sucrose-trained or naive controls, those in cocaine-experienced rats failed to signal negative prediction errors in response to reward omission, showed diminished signaling of positive prediction errors in response to unexpected rewards, and failed to fire differentially to reward-predictive cues. These results resemble changes in dopaminergic error signals observed after lesions to orbitofrontal and ventral striatal regions directly upstream (Jo and Mizumori, 2016Jo Y.S. Mizumori S.J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2910844783,"Cutaneous secretions produced by amphibians of the family Bufonidae are rich sources of bioactive compounds that can be useful as new chemical templates for agrochemicals. In crop protection, the use of elicitors to induce responses offers the prospect of durable, broad-spectrum disease control using the plant’s own resistance. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of methanolic extracts of cutaneous secretions of two species of amphibians of the family Bufonidae found in the Amazon biome—Rhaebo guttatus (species 1) and Rhinella marina (species 2)—in the synthesis of phytoalexins in soybean cotyledons, bean hypocotyls, and sorghum mesocotyls. Additionally, changes in the enzyme activity of β-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase (POX), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and in the total protein content of soybean cotyledons were determined. In the soybean cultivar ‘TMG 132 RR’, our results indicated that the methanolic extract of R. guttatus cutaneous secretions suppressed glyceollin synthesis and β-1,3-glucanase activity and increased POX and PPO activities at higher concentrations and total protein content at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. On the other hand, the methanolic extract of R. marina cutaneous secretions induced glyceollin synthesis in the soybean cultivars ‘TMG 132 RR’ and ‘Monsoy 8372 IPRO’ at 0.1–0.2 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. The methanolic extract of R. marina cutaneous secretions also increased the specific activity of POX and PPO in ‘Monsoy 8372 IPRO’ and ‘TMG 132 RR’, respectively, and decreased the activity of β-1,3-glucanases in ‘Monsoy 8372 IPRO’. At 0.3 mg/mL, it stimulated phaseolin synthesis. The extracts did not express bioactivity in the synthesis of deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum mesocotyls. The study in soybean suggests that the bioactivity in defense responses is influenced by cultivar genotypes. Therefore, these results provide evidence that extracts of cutaneous secretions of these amphibians species may contribute to the bioactivity of defense metabolites in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2910393669,"Previous research has examined empathic concern by presenting toddlers with a sad stimulus and examining their emotional response, with the conclusion that toddlers display empathy. Yet, such research has failed to include basic control conditions involving some other aversive stimulus such as white noise. Nor has it compared toddlers to adults to examine potential development in empathy. In the present study, we showed toddlers and adults four video types: infant crying, infant laughing, infant babbling, and a neutral infant accompanied by white noise. We then coded happiness and sadness while viewing the videos, and created a difference score (happiness minus sadness), testing 52 toddlers and 61 adults. Whereas adults showed more sadness towards infant crying than any other stimulus, toddlers’ response to crying and white noise was similar. Thus, the toddler response to crying was comparable to previous studies (slight sadness), but was no different to white noise and was significantly reduced relative to adults. As such, toddlers’ response seemed to be better characterized as a reaction to an aversive stimulus rather than empathy."
https://openalex.org/W2908756950,"N-Nitroso compounds (NOCs) are common DNA-alkylating agents, are abundantly present in food and tobacco, and can also be generated endogenously. Metabolic activation of some NOCs can give rise to carboxymethylation and pyridyloxobutylation/pyridylhydroxybutylation of DNA, which are known to be carcinogenic and can lead to gastrointestinal and lung cancer, respectively. Herein, using the competitive replication and adduct bypass (CRAB) assay, along with MS- and NMR-based approaches, we assessed the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of three O6-alkyl-2′-deoxyguanosine (O6-alkyl-dG) adducts, i.e. O6-pyridyloxobutyl-dG (O6-POB-dG) and O6-pyridylhydroxybutyl-dG (O6-PHB-dG), derived from tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and O6-carboxymethyl-dG (O6-CM-dG), induced by endogenous N-nitroso compounds. We also investigated two neutral analogs of O6-CM-dG, i.e. O6-aminocarbonylmethyl-dG (O6-ACM-dG) and O6-hydroxyethyl-dG (O6-HOEt-dG). We found that, in Escherichia coli cells, these lesions mildly (O6-POB-dG), moderately (O6-PHB-dG), or strongly (O6-CM-dG, O6-ACM-dG, and O6-HOEt-dG) impede DNA replication. The strong blockage effects of the last three lesions were attributable to the presence of hydrogen-bonding donor(s) located on the alkyl functionality of these lesions. Except for O6-POB-dG, which also induced a low frequency of G → T transversions, all other lesions exclusively stimulated G → A transitions. SOS-induced DNA polymerases played redundant roles in bypassing all the O6-alkyl-dG lesions investigated. DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) and Pol V, however, were uniquely required for inducing the G → A transition for O6-CM-dG exposure.

DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) and Pol V, however, were uniquely required for inducing the G → A transition for O6-CM-dG exposure. Together, our study expands our knowledge about the recognition of important NOC-derived O6-alkyl-dG lesions by the E. coli DNA replication machinery. Environmental exposure and endogenous metabolism can give rise to a variety of DNA adducts (1Fu D. Calvo J.A. Samson L.D. Balancing repair and tolerance of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents.Nat.

In this vein, two potential types of carcinogenic adducts formed from NOC exposure are of emerging concern, i.e. the pyridyloxobutyl (POB) and pyridylhydroxybutyl (PHB) adducts derived from tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines and carboxymethyl adducts arising from endogenous NOCs (5Hecht S.S.

Thus, it is important to understand how the O6-alkyl-2′-deoxyguanosine (O6-alkyl-dG) lesions derived from the above-mentioned NOCs affect the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication. Several replication studies have been performed to assess the impact of O6-POB-dG and O6-CM-dG lesions on the flow of genetic information. O6-POB-dG was found to be highly mutagenic, and it induces exclusively G → A transition in Escherichia coli, whereas it elicits both G → A transition and G → T transversion in mammalian cells (15Du H.

O6-CM-dG is able to form Watson—Crick–type bp with thymidine, thereby inducing G → A transition mutation (37Zhang F. Tsunoda M. Suzuki K. Kikuchi Y. Wilkinson O. Millington C.L. Margison G.P.

In mammalian cells, Pol κ and Pol ζ are required for the efficient bypass of this lesion, and only G → A transition was observed (38Wu J. Wang P. Li L. Williams N.L. Ji D. Zahurancik W.J. You C.

However, it remains unknown how O6-PHB-dG compromises the efficiency and accuracy of DNA replication. Herein, we incorporated O6-POB-dG, O6-PHB-dG, O6-CM-dG, and its two analogs, i.e. O6-aminocarbonylmethyl-dG (O6-AMC-dG) and O6-hydroxyethyl-dG (O6-HOEt-dG), into single-stranded plasmids and examined how these lesions impede DNA replication and elicit mutation(s) in E. coli cells. We also explored the roles of SOS-induced DNA polymerases in bypassing these lesions. The primary objective of this project was to elucidate how the O6-substituted guanine lesions arising from tobacco-derived and endogenous NOCs (Fig. 1) compromise the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication in E. coli cells. To this end, ODNs harboring a series of O6-alkyl-dG lesions at a specific site were synthesized and confirmed by ESI-MS and MS/MS analyses (Fig. 2 and Figs. S1–S7). A previously described CRAB assay (Fig. 3 and Fig. S8) was employed to determine the impacts of these lesions on DNA replication in E. coli cells and to determine how replication across these lesions is influenced by SOS-induced DNA polymerases (39Wang P.

After cellular replication, the region of interest in the progeny genomes was amplified by PCR, the ensuing products were digested with two restriction endonucleases, i.e. BbSI and MluCI, and the restriction fragments were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and native PAGE (Fig. 4 and Figs.

Both O6-POB-dG and O6-PHB-dG are highly mutagenic and mainly induce G → A transition (10-mer A), although a low rate of G → T mutation (10-mer T) was also observed for O6-POB-dG. O6-CM-dG induced a much lower frequency of G → A mutation. The 13-mer radiolabeled band is the corresponding fragment liberated from the PCR product of the competitor genome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results from PAGE and LC-MS/MS analyses revealed the lack of insertion or deletion mutations (Fig. 4 and Fig. S9–S14). Hence, we calculated the bypass efficiencies of O6-POB-dG and O6-PHB-dG from the ratio of the 10-mer products emanating from lesion and control genomes, over the 13-mer product, generated from the competitor plasmid (Fig. 4 and Figs. S11–S14), by taking into account the molar ratios of the lesion and control over the competitor genomes employed at the initial transfection. It turned out that these two lesions were moderate impediments to DNA replication in WT AB1157 cells, with O6-PHB-dG exerting a stronger blockage effect (Fig. 5A). The roles of SOS-induced DNA polymerases in bypassing the O6-POB-dG and O6-PHB-dG were also investigated by performing the assay in E. coli strains deficient in Pol II, Pol IV, Pol V, or all three in combination. It turned out that a substantial diminution in bypass efficiency was observed only when all three SOS-induced DNA polymerases were depleted, which is consistent with the observations made previously for other O6-alkyl-dG lesions (30Wang P.

On the basis of previous results, we hypothesized that the p53 pathway and ICMT expression may be linked in cancer cells. Here, we studied whether WT p53 and cancer-associated p53 point mutants regulate ICMT levels and whether ICMT overexpression affects tumor progression. Studying the effect of p53 variants on ICMT mRNA and protein levels in cancer cells, we found that WT p53 and p53 mutants differentially affect ICMT expression, indicating that p53 status influences ICMT levels in tumors. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we constructed ICMT–luciferase reporters and found that WT p53 represses ICMT transcription. In contrast, p53 mutants showed a positive effect on ICMT expression. Promoter truncation analyses pinpointed the repressive effect of WT p53 to the −209 and −14 region on the ICMT promoter, and ChIP assays indicated that WT p53 is recruited to this region. Instead, a different promoter region was identified as responsible for the mutant p53 effect. Studying the effect of ICMT overexpression on tumor-associated phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, and analyzing breast and lung cancer databases, we identified a correlation between p53 status and ICMT expression in breast and lung cancers. Moreover, we observed that ICMT overexpression is correlated with negative clinical outcomes. Our work unveils a link between postprenylation protein processing and the p53 pathway, indicating that the functional interplay between WT and mutant p53 alters ICMT levels, thereby affecting tumor aggressiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2910260214,"We propose a strategy to counteract the salt-driven disassembly of multiliposomal complexes made by electrostatic co-assembly of anionic small unilamellar liposomes and cationic star-shaped polyelectrolytes (made of quaternized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (qPDMAEMA100)3.1). The combined action of (qPDMAEMA100)3.1 and a nonionic star-shaped polymer (PEO12-b-PPO45)4, which comprises diblock copolymer arms uniting a poly(ethylene oxide) PEO inner block and a poly(propylene oxide) PPO terminal block, leads to a stabilization of these complexes against disintegration in saline solutions. Hereby, the anchoring of the PPO terminal blocks to the lipid bilayer and the bridging between several liposomes are at the origin of the promoted structural stability. Two-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy verifies the formation of multiliposomal complexes with (PEO12-b-PPO45)4. The polyelectrolyte and the amphiphilic polymer work synergistically, as the joint action still assures some membrane integrity, which is not seen for the mere (PEO12-b-PPO45)4-liposome interaction alone."
https://openalex.org/W2911102362,"It is difficult to accurately predict the natural course of allergic rhinitis (AR), because it is affected by a wide variety of environmental influences, as well as genetic predisposition. Considering the high prevalence of allergic rhinitis in children and adolescents, caregivers should be given appropriate information regarding the disease course. This study aimed to understand the prognosis of allergic rhinitis by examining the relationship between allergic sensitization and rhinitis symptoms during this developmental period.This cross-sectional study included 1069 children aged 9-16 years from the Korean International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Survey database who had completed health questionnaires, and for whom skin prick test results were available. Data were collected during May 2016. The distribution of sensitization and allergic symptoms was compared by age groups (elementary, middle, and high school). Data were analyzed using linear-by-linear analysis.Sensitization to at least one tested allergen differed by age (59.2%, 58.3%, 68.2%, in elementary, middle, and high school students, respectively; p = 0.025), and seasonal allergen sensitization (35.0%, 37.1%, 53.9%, respectively) increased with age (p < 0.001). Conversely, the proportion of rhinitis symptoms among sensitized children decreased as age increased (58.80%, 52.90%, 49.70%, respectively; p = 0.047). However, the rate of non-allergic rhinitis was age-independent.With increasing age during childhood and adolescence, symptomatic allergic rhinitis decreases; thus, subclinical allergic rhinitis increases. This suggests that the symptoms of later-sensitized children are less clearly manifested, or that the symptoms reduce as previously sensitized children mature. This should be clarified further in a longitudinal study."
https://openalex.org/W2909382399,"Intestinal integrity is maintained by balanced numbers of CD103+ Dendritic cells (DCs), which generate peripherally induced regulatory T cells (iTregs). We have developed a mouse model where DC-specific constitutive CD40 signals caused a strong reduction of CD103+ DCs in the lamina propria (LP) and intestinal lymph nodes (LN). As a consequence, also iTregs were strongly reduced and transgenic mice on the C57Bl/6-background (B6) developed fatal colitis. Here we describe that transgenic mice on a pure Balb/c-background (B/c) do not show any pathologies, while transgenic C57Bl/6 x Balb/c (F1) mice develop weak colon inflammation, without fatal colitis. This graded pathology correlated with the effects of CD40-signalling on DCs in each background, with striking loss of CD103+ DCs in B6, but reduced in F1 and diminished in B/c background. We further show direct correlation of CD103+ DC-numbers with numbers of iTregs, the frequencies of which behave correspondingly. Striking effects on B6-DCs reflected robust loss of surface MHCII, known to be crucial for iTreg induction. Furthermore, elevated levels of IL-23 together with IL-1, found only in B6 mice, support generation of intestinal IFN-γ+IL-17+ Th17 cells and IFN-γ+ Th1 cells, responsible for onset of disease. Together, this demonstrates a novel aspect of colitis-control, depending on genetic background. Moreover, strain-specific environmental sensing might alter the CD103+ DC/iTreg-axis to tip intestinal homeostatic balance to pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2909152419,"A diversity of arthropods (myrmecophiles) thrives within ant nests, many of them unmolested though some, such as the specialized Eucharitidae parasitoids, may cause direct damage to their hosts. Ants are known to discriminate between nestmates and non-nestmates, but whether they recognize the strength of a threat and their capacity to adjust their behavior accordingly have not been fully explored. We aimed to determine whether Ectatomma tuberculatum ants exhibited specific behavioral responses to potential or actual intruders posing different threats to the host colony and to contribute to an understanding of complex ant-eucharitid interactions. Behavioral responses differed significantly according to intruder type. Ants evicted intruders that represented a threat to the colony’s health (dead ants) or were not suitable as prey items (filter paper, eucharitid parasitoid wasps, non myrmecophilous adult weevils), but killed potential prey (weevil larvae, termites). The timing of detection was in accordance with the nature and size of the intruder: corpses (a potential source of contamination) were detected faster than any other intruder and transported to the refuse piles within 15 min. The structure and complexity of behavioral sequences differed among those intruders that were discarded. Workers not only recognized and discriminated between several distinct intruders but also adjusted their behavior to the type of intruder encountered. Our results confirm the previously documented recognition capabilities of E. tuberculatum workers and reveal a very fine-tuned intruder discrimination response. Colony-level prophylactic and hygienic behavioral responses through effective removal of inedible intruders appears to be the most general and flexible form of defense in ants against a diverse array of intruders. However, this generalized response to both potentially lethal and harmless intruders might have driven the evolution of ant-eucharitid interactions, opening a window for parasitoid attack and allowing adult parasitoid wasps to quickly leave the natal nest unharmed."
https://openalex.org/W2910395388,"Background Sick leaves are important events for both the worker and the employer. Many factors are related with sick leaves and depending on the factors the worker could perform a successful return to work. In this sense, the objective of this study is to identify those factors associated with return to work after sick leaves in a group of public workers in Brazil. Methods A case-control study of return to work after sick leaves in a university campus from 2010 to 2015. Logistic regression models were adjusted for two different response variables: return to work with and without restrictions. A digital database was created and completed with data from manual sources. Results A computerised database has been created, based on manual records, which has allowed us to identify labour and non-labour factors associated with the return to work after a sick leave and the possible functional readaptation, with or without restrictions, in public workers. Age at the beginning of the process, number of sick leaves, those of more than 16 days, average duration (total time of sick leaves / number of medical records), and mid-level healthcare positions were associated with return to work without restrictions. In the model of return to work with restrictions, the age of hiring by the university, the number of sick leaves, those of more than 16 days, and mid-level healthcare positions, both rural work and operational positions, were associated to the response variable. Conclusions This study has allowed us to identify the factors associated with the return to work after a period of sick leave in a large group of public workers. However, more research is needed on the mental disorders that cause sick leaves, their evaluation and the handling of these situations."

However, physical exertion and caffeine consumption have not been examined as immediate triggers of MI in low and middle-income countries.Using a self-matched case-crossover design, we examined the acute risk of MI in the hour following episodes of physical exertion, caffeinated coffee, and tea consumption among MI survivors in Thailand.A total of 506 Thai participants (women = 191, men = 315) were interviewed between 2014 and 2017 after sustaining an acute MI. We compared each subject's exposure to physical exertion and consumption of caffeine- containing beverages in the hour preceding the onset of MI with the subject's expected usual frequency in the prior year to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).Of the 506 participants, 47 (9.3%) engaged in moderate or heavy physical exertion, 6 (1.2%) consumed tea, and 21 (4.2%) consumed coffee within the hour before MI. The relative risk of MI after moderate or heavy physical exertion was 3.0 (95% CI 2.2-4.2) compared to periods of no exertion, with a higher risk among more sedentary participants compared to active participants. Compared to times with no caffeinated beverage consumption, there was a higher risk of MI in the hour following consumption of caffeinated tea (RR = 3.7; 95%CI: 1.5-9.3) and coffee (RR = 2.3; 95%CI: 1.4-3.6).Physical exertion, coffee and tea consumption were associated with a higher risk of MI in the subsequent hour compared to times when the participants were sedentary or did not consume caffeinated beverages.

https://openalex.org/W2908978099,"I sat hunched over my computer screen, analyzing data, when a university administrator walked into our lab and handed out a series of sealed envelopes. Puzzled, I opened the letter addressed to me: “It has become necessary for the University to effect a layoff of your position as a Postdoctoral Scholar.” In silence, my labmates opened their own letters, all of which said essentially the same thing. I knew that our lab was under investigation, but I had no inkling that my job was in jeopardy, so the news came as a huge shock. My mind raced from concerns about my personal finances—“How will I pay rent?”—to questions about my future in science: “How will we finish our experiments? Will this mark the end of my research career?”

Three years earlier, I had started my postdoc brimming with enthusiasm, excited to work for a brilliant scientist on a project that, we hoped, would help people with hearing loss—a group that includes me. My enthusiasm was short-lived. Almost as soon as I arrived, it became clear that the lab had problems. For one, my supervisor had been receiving animal care violation warnings for the lab's work with mice for years. They continued to pile up during my tenure, at times forcing us to suspend our experiments. Eventually, our funding was cut off entirely and the lab was shut down.

I ended up digging out of the mess and moving on to a second postdoc. Now I'm back to doing research that I love in a functional lab, and I'm glad I persevered. But looking back, I wish I hadn't sunk so much time into my first postdoc lab. I should have quit and moved on much sooner. For others who may be in similar situations, here are tips to avoid drowning with a sinking ship.

DO NOT BE BLINDED BY PASSION. Enthusiasm and drive are key ingredients for scientific careers. However, they can be problematic when they prevent you from seeing warning signs clearly. My intense desire to find treatments to reverse hearing loss led me to mistakenly write off serious lab issues as small bumps in the road. Had I been more objective, I would have realized that those “bumps” were actually major obstacles.

TAKE PERSONNEL DYNAMICS SERIOUSLY. Collaboration and teamwork are essential in science; you can't function as an island. Blinded by passion, I disregarded the lack of honest communication with my supervisor about the problems in our lab. In retrospect, that was an obvious warning sign.

DO NOT BE TRAPPED BY FEAR. I fretted that if I didn't publish anything from my postdoc, no one would hire me. That's one reason I stuck with my ill-fated lab. But the concern turned out to be unfounded. Finding a new position after I was laid off wasn't easy, but I survived by being transparent about what happened and pushing forward with confidence. One thing that helped me move past my postdoc mess was looking back at my past successes to remind myself that I am a good scientist.

FOCUS ON YOURSELF. Pointing fingers is easy, but burning bridges—and wasting energy on casting blame—won't help you move forward. When problems arise, don't engage in pointless battles. Instead, take stock of your situation and decide what's best for you. Write down the pros and cons of your job; examine your career goals; and talk to your trusted mentors, colleagues, friends, and family. Along the way, be open to the possibility that it may be best to quit.

DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST STRIKE. Don't waste time in a bad environment. During my 3 years in my first postdoc lab, there were many times when I should have quit, but instead I hung on, hoping the situation would improve. Your life is not a game. Don't wait for strike three.

The region9s rich paleontological and archaeological record persuaded former President Barack Obama to designate the area a national monument in the waning days of his administration. But in December 2017, President Donald Trump slashed the size of the monument by 85%, prompting the typically apolitical Society for Vertebrate Paleontology to sue—along with environmentalists, archaeologists, outdoor companies, and five Native American tribes. If they win, the ruling could set a precedent that would help safeguard the boundaries of 158 national monuments; if they lose, future presidents could gain new powers to downsize them. Paleontologists fear a ruling against them would have devastating consequences for Bears Ears, just as they are starting to uncover fossils there that could rewrite Earth9s early history."
https://openalex.org/W2910337580,"A large body of research has revealed the challenges that disproportionately affect women as they climb the academic ladder. One area that has received relatively little attention is women's experiences at academic conferences, which are often integral to academics' professional development. As conferences are attended by professional colleagues and influential players in specific fields, the professional consequences of any gender bias in criticism are likely to be amplified at such venues. Here, we explore the degree to which the likelihood of audience members asking a question and offering criticism is associated with the gender of a presenter. Audience questions were tabulated during the authors' visits to the three American Anthropological Association Annual Meetings. The results suggested that men were indeed marginally more likely to ask a question, both when considering all types of questions and when considering only critical questions. However, there was no evidence that they differentially targeted women for these questions. Future research might explore what motivates assertive and critical speech in men and women and how their experiences in receiving it might differ, particularly in academic settings in which critical speech might be considered more acceptable."
https://openalex.org/W2909942095,"We have developed a Poisson random field model for estimating the distribution of selective effects of newly arisen nonsynonymous mutations that could be observed as polymorphism or divergence in samples of two related species under the assumption that the two species populations are not at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium. The model is applied to 91Drosophila genes by comparing levels of polymorphism in an African population of D. melanogaster with divergence to a reference strain of D. simulans. Based on the difference of gene expression level between testes and ovaries, the 91 genes were classified as 33 male-biased, 28 female-biased, and 30 sex-unbiased genes. Under a Bayesian framework, Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to the model in which the distribution of selective effects is assumed to be Gaussian with a mean that may differ from one gene to the other to sample key parameters. Based on our estimates, the majority of newly-arisen nonsynonymous mutations that could contribute to polymorphism or divergence in Drosophila species are mildly deleterious with a mean scaled selection coefficient of -2.81, while almost 86% of the fixed differences between species are driven by positive selection. There are only 16.6% of the nonsynonymous mutations observed in sex-unbiased genes that are under positive selection in comparison to 30% of male-biased and 46% of female-biased genes that are beneficial. We also estimated that D. melanogaster and D. simulans may have diverged 1.72 million years ago."
