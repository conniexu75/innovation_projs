https://openalex.org/W2060582555,"Proteolytic fragments of human plasma fibronectin were used to identify monoclonal antibodies reacting with the various domains of fibronectin. One of these antibodies, which reacts with cell-attachment-promoting fragments of fibronectin, inhibits attachment of cells to fibronectin-coated surfaces. A cell-attachment-promoting, chymotryptic, 120 kilodalton fragment was cleaved further with pepsin into three main fragments. The smallest, 15 kilodalton fragment was purified by affinity chromatography on the cell-attachment-inhibiting antibody insolubilized on Sepharose. This fragment is active in promoting cell attachment but lacks the other known binding activities of fibronectin. It can be localized between the collagen-binding and heparin-binding domains, about 127 to 197 kilodaltons from the NH2 terminus of the polypeptide. These results show that the interaction of fibronectin with cells is restricted to a defined portion of the molecule and is independent of the direct involvement of the known affinities toward other macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W1970078675,"Mouse cells transformed with herpes simplex virus and containing the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene in an inactive state were treated with 5-azacytidine. The result was the reexpression of the viral TK gene. Two days of exposure to 5-azacytidine followed by 2 days of expression time was sufficient for maximal induction of the TK+ phenotype. The induction of TK expression by 5-azacytidine was concentration-dependent, with maximal induction at 10 micromoles per liter. 5-Azacytidine also inhibited the decay of TK expression in TK+ transformants removed from selective conditions. Analysis of the methylation patterns of the viral TK gene with restriction endonucleases Hpa II and Msp I showed the active gene to be unmethylated, the inactive gene methylated, and the 5-azacytidine-induced gene unmethylated."
https://openalex.org/W2042570087,"Using electron microscopy of spread chromatin, we have observed nonnucleolar transcription units from Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora erythrocephala that display specific cleavage of nascent transcripts. We have quantitatively analyzed 20 of these relatively long transcription units. The primary RNP structure of homologous transcripts is nonrandom with respect to both RNA sequence and the cleavage event. In general, released RNA fragments have a smooth fibrillar RNP morphology (approximately 50 A wide) and retained segments have a thicker particulate morphology (approximately 250 A diameter). A characteristic secondary structure formation also accompanies cleavage--that is, RNP fibril loops form by association of noncontiguous transcript sequences that correspond to the terminal regions of the segment to be released. RNP particles form at the loop base sequences prior to their association and apparently coalesce upon loop formation. These loops, and thus the released segments, range in length from 1 and 25 kb on the examples we have analyzed. Cleavage of nascent hnRNA transcripts appears to be a fairly common event in these organisms and occurs within 0.3-3 min after transcription of the cleavage site."

https://openalex.org/W1532928035,"Expression of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein gene in embryonic, adult, and neoplastic tissues was assessed by RNA dot hybridization using 32P-labeled alpha-fetoprotein cDNA as probe, alpha-fetoprotein mRNA was present in high levels in total RNA from yolk sac endoderm, fetal liver, and an alpha-fetoprotein-producing hepatoma. In contrast, this mRNA was greatly depleted in total RNA from yolk sac mesoderm and essentially absent in brain, adult liver, and a non-alpha-fetoprotein-producing hepatoma. These results indicated that alpha-fetoprotein gene expression was controlled primarily at the transcriptional level. The presence of the modified base, 5-methylcytosine, in the alpha-fetoprotein gene was studied by comparing hybridization patterns obtained by Southern blot analysis of DNA cleaved with the restriction endonuclease isoschizomers Msp I and Hpa II. The gross sequence organization and reiteration frequency of the alpha-fetoprotein gene were invariant among the DNA samples, whereas, in each case, there was a positive correlation between hypomethylation of six CCGG (Hpa II) sites in the alpha-fetoprotein gene and expression of this gene. These Hpa II sites were distributed throughout a large portion of the alp]a-fetoprotein gene. Patterns of cytosine methylation in this gene were established before day 15 of gestation in yolk sac endoderm and mesoderm."

https://openalex.org/W2037603790,"The molecular weight (as determined by molecular sieve chromatography) of human gamma interferon, formerly referred to as immune or type II interferon, is between 40,000 and 70,000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gamma interferon activity was recovered mainly from two regions of the gels corresponding to molecular weights of 20,000 and 25,000. The results suggest that in native form human gamma interferon may be aggregated."
https://openalex.org/W1486084384,"Murine extra-embryonic endodermal cell lines derived from either teratocarcinomas or mouse embryos contain a cytoskeletal protein (Endo A) of Mr = 55,000. Endo A was immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled lysates of three parietal endodermal cell lines, A presumptive visceral endodermal cell line, and a fetal hepatoma cell line, but not from fibroblasts, myoblasts, erythroleukemic cells, neuroblastoma cells, keratinocytes, or embryonal carcinoma cells. Embryonal carcinoma cells induced to differentiate by exposure to retinoic acid synthesized increased amounts of Endo A approximately 48 h after exposure to the inducer. Two-dimensional gel analysis of immunoprecipitated samples confirmed that Endo A is distinct from vimentin and murine keratinocyte proteins recognized by two different keratin antisera. Comparison by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitated Endo A labeled with either [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate indicated that the multiple forms of Endo A resolved by isoelectric focusing were due, at least in part, to phosphorylation. Serine was identified as the phosphorylated amino acid. Endo A was the only major antigenic protein found in a parietal endodermal cell line which was recognized by a monoclonal antibody prepared by other investigators against trophoblast cytoskeletons. The results indicate that Endo A, like the previously described Endo B protein, is distinct from other cytoskeletal proteins and will be useful as a marker of the differentiation of murine embryonal carcinoma cells to extra-embryonic endoderm."

https://openalex.org/W2057634641,"The genome-linked protein (VPg) of poliovirus has been chemically synthesized, coupled to bovine serum albumin carrier and injected into rabbits. An antibody response was elicited not only by the full-length synthetic VPg peptide, but also by a synthetic 14-amino-acid carboxy-terminal peptide. All antisera reacted with virus-specific proteins from HeLa cells infected with poliovirus. Three of these proteins have previously been implicated by others as precursors of VPg. No free cytoplasmic VPg could be detected, and the antibodies did not react with radiolabeled proteins from uninfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529421195,"We induced goat antibodies to Drosophila RNA polymerase II and rabbit antibodies to the isolated 215,000-dalton and 140,000-dalton polymerase II subunits (P215 and P140, respectively). Similarly, we induced rabbit antibodies to wheat germ RNA polymerase II and to the 220,000-dalton subunit and 140,000-dalton subunit (P220 and P140, respectively). Anti-polymerase antibodies precipitated the homologous native enzyme and inhibited its activity in vitro, while several of the anti-subunit sera did neither. The anti-Drosophila P215 serum specifically labeled RNA polymerase II fixed in situ on polytene chromosomes. We reacted the antibodies with polymerase subunits separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (protein blotting). Each antibody to whole polymerase reacted with multiple subunits, while the anti-subunit sera each reacted specifically with the subunit employed as immunogen. The anti-subunit sera also cross-reacted with the analogous subunit from several heterologous polymerases II (from yeast, wheat germ, Drosophila, and calf thymus), demonstrating shared subunit-specific determinants in polymerase II from widely divergent organisms. The anti-polymerase sera also showed cross-reactivity with subunits of heterologous enzymes, but only in one case did the cross-reactivity involve subunits other than the two largest ones. Specifically, the goat anti-Drosophila polymerase serum displayed easily detectable cross-reactivity with four low molecular weight subunits of calf thymus polymerase II, providing a unique demonstration of antigenic relatedness of small RNA polymerase II subunits from different higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1558098254,"Virus-induced human alpha interferon (HuIFN-alpha) derived from Namalwa cells and purified to a specific activity of 2 X 10(8) units/mg of protein was radiolabeled with 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter reagent to a specific activity of 4-12 microCi/micrograms of protein. The binding of this 125I-IFN to bovine kidney cells was examined at 4 degrees C. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicate the presence of 650 binding sites/cell and binding of the ligand with an apparent Kd of 6 X 10(-11) M. Trypsin or acid treatment of cells to which 125I-IFN was bound resulted in the release of greater than or equal to 77% of the radioactivity, indicating a majority of radiolabeled material was bound to the cell surface. Antibodies against human leukocyte IFN but not antibodies against human fibroblast IFN inhibited the binding of radiolabeled IFN to the cells. The binding of 125I-IFN was not inhibited by a 75-fold molar excess of mouse IFN but was inhibited 30% by a 200-fold molar excess of human beta (fibroblast) IFN. These data are compatible with the Lower biological activities of these IFNs on bovine kidney cells. Several Escherichia coli derived HuIFN-alpha s inhibited the binding of the radiolabeled IFN to the same extent as native HuIFN-alpha s, but four fragments of HuIFN-alpha 1, an E. coli-derived 86 amino acid NH2-terminal fragment as well as 3 different synthetic carboxy-terminal fragments of 140, 56, or 46 amino acids did not inhibit binding."
https://openalex.org/W1532260141,"Poly(A)-RNAs enriched for glycinin coding sequences were injected into frog oocytes and translated in the presence of either [3H]leucine or [3H]isoleucine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis indicated that radioactive proteins similar in size to the authentic acidic and basic polypeptide components of glycinin were not present among the glycinin-related proteins synthesized. Instead, high molecular weight precursors (Mr = 58,000-67,000) were immunoprecipitated. Unlike disulfide-linked native glycinin complexes which were cleaved by disulfide reduction, products purified from either rabbit reticulocyte lysate or oocyte translation systems were insensitive to reducing agents. The glycinin-related proteins synthesized in the oocyte were 1000 to 2000 daltons smaller than those synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate system. This result, which suggested that the oocyte system had removed NH2-terminal leader sequences of the preglycinin polypeptides, was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of proteins synthesized in oocytes. Radioactive label was found exactly at the positions predicted by the NH2-terminal sequences of the acidic polypeptide component of native glycinin. Glycinin precursors, therefore, have an NH2-terminal leader sequence followed by the acidic peptide component and then the basic polypeptide component, joined in peptide linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1567659898,"A double-stranded cDNA library was constructed using total poly(A)+ RNA from the goose uropygial gland. Clones containing sequences complementary to fatty acid synthase mRNA were initially identified by colony hybridization with a 32P-labeled cDNA transcribed from RNA enriched for fatty acid synthase mRNA. Identity of the fatty acid synthase clones was confirmed by hybrid-selected translation. Mature fatty acid synthase mRNA is approximately 16 kilobases in length. When unfed neonatal goslings were fed for 24 hr, relative synthesis of hepatic fatty acid synthase increased more than 42-fold. Concomitantly, hepatic fatty acid synthase mRNA levels increased 70-fold. Thus, nutritional regulation of the synthesis of hepatic fatty acid synthase probably occurs at the pretranslational level. The availability of a specific probe for fatty acid synthase mRNA should allow us to analyze the regulation of expression of this gene during development, by nutrition and by hormones in both liver and uropygial gland."

https://openalex.org/W1509375306,"A library of cloned cDNA to male mouse submaxillary gland poly(A)-containing RNA was constructed in the plasmid pBR322. Inserts containing sequences estimated to be in the 1-5% abundance class were identified by hybridization to radiolabeled cDNA and examined by nucleotide sequence analysis. A sequence coding for a peptide with 57% homology to the only complete kallikrein sequence reported to date (from pig pancreas) was identified by a computer search program. This insert appears to code for the COOH-terminal 149 amino acids of a protein presumed therefore to be a serine protease. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein with analogous sequences in the three characterized members of the mouse submaxillary gland kallikrein arginyl esteropeptidase group of enzymes revealed extensive homology, although not complete identity. Thus, there are at least four members of this enzyme family expressed in the mouse submaxillary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1489316039,"The antitumor drug, bleomycin, interacts with either Fe(II) and O 2 or Fe(III) and H2O2 to form an activated complex which attacks DNA. Under aerobic conditions, both reactions yield similar quantities of free bases and products consisting of base plus deoxyribose carbon atoms 1 to 3. Under anaerobic conditions, activated bleomycin releases only free base. The yield of free base is the same under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, provided DNA is furnished in excess. When the DNA concentration is limiting, more base is released under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions. Drug self-destruction proceeds as quickly and completely in the presence or absence of O2."
https://openalex.org/W2037926255,"Hypophysectomy of adult male rats abolishes α2u globulin synthesis; synthesis can be fully restored by daily administration of androgen, thyroid hormone, glucocorticoid and growth hormone for 12 days. It has been previously reported that growth hormone is not required to maintain α2u globulin mRNA levels, and that growth hormone functions only translationally. We have reexamined the role of growth hormone in α2u globulin synthesis using a cloned α2u globulin cDNA probe. Measurement of α2u globulin mRNA levels by hybridization and cell-free translation, and of α2u globulin synthesis by pulse-labeling in vivo, demonstrates that growth hormone is required to maintain full, steady state hepatic levels of both α2u globulin and its mRNA. Furthermore, the small amount of hepatic α2u globulin mRNA that accumulates in the absence of growth hormone is efficiently translated in vivo. Thus we now find no evidence for growth-hormone-mediated translational control. We have also found that rats hypophysectomized prepubescently respond to the multihormonal restoration therapy to only 10% of the α2u globulin mRNA levels observed in rats hypophysectomized as adults. This finding suggests that some unidentified pituitary factor(s) is required during puberty to potentiate normal α2u globulin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1573709473,"beta 2-Microglobulin has been isolated and crystallized from bovine colostrum and represents the only crystalline form of this protein reported. The complete sequence of bovine beta 2-microglobulin was determined using only one proteolytic enzyme, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. Automated degradation of the intact molecule and two large peptides produced by enzymic digestion provided unequivocal placement of all residues. Bovine beta 2-microglobulin, molecular weight 11,630, contains 98 residues as compared with 99 for the human, rabbit, guinea pig, and murine proteins. The valine residue at position 49 in all the aforementioned species is deleted in the bovine variant. This crystalline protein is also uniquely characterized by three di-prolyl sequences in the first third of the molecule. beta 2-Microglobulin is a highly conserved protein, and in a comparison of absolute amino acid sequence differences among species, bovine beta 2- microglobulin ranges from a low of 24 substitutions as compared with the rabbit homologue and 26 for human to 32 for mouse and guinea pig."
https://openalex.org/W2070869485,"One of the factors regulating the accessibility of specific DNA sequences to endonuclease nicking during meiosis is a group of small nuclear RNA molecules, 125 nucleotides in length and transcribed by RNA polymerase III. These molecules (referred to as PsnRNA) are synthesized during meiotic prophase, when chromosomes are undergoing homologous pairing or are already paired. Accessibility to the meiotically active DNA sequences (P DNA) depends on an as-yet-undefined alteration in chromatin structure. PsnRNA is a critical factor in the alteration; it cannot be replaced by other forms of RNA. The specificity of the chromatin sites altered by PsnRNA appears to be a function of sequence complementarity between it and P DNA. Under in vivo conditions the effective action of PsnRNA depends on homologous chromosome pairing. Chromatin sites housing P-DNA sequences in nuclei isolated from cells lacking homologous pairing are not affected by meiotic endonuclease or DNAse II. Accessibility to these sites can be effected by incubation of the nuclei with PsnRNA, but only if the nuclei are from zygotene-pachytene cells. Analyses of pachytene nuclei preincubated with PsnRNA indicate that PsnRNA renders chromatin accessible to at least two endonucleases, meiotic endonuclease and DNAase II, and that it also limits such accessibility to regions housing the complementary P-DNA sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1534691281,"We have prepared site-specific immunological reagents to study the orientation and surface topography of the integral membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies with strong affinity for antigenic determinants on proteolytic and cyanogen bromide fragments of bacteriorhodopsin have been isolated and characterized. Three distinct antibody binding sites have been identified on the cytoplasmic surface of bacteriorhodopsin. The first due is readily accessible in native bacteriorhodopsin and lies close to the COOH terminus. This binding site is lost when only three amino acid residues are removed from the COOH terminus. The second site, which is also near the COOH terminus, is located approximately within the 17 COOH terminal amino acid residues. The third site is in the fragment that comprises Tyr-83 to Met-118 and is probably contained in the short loop connecting the third and fourth helices. The use of COOH terminus-specific antibodies in determination of the orientation of bacteriorhodopsin molecules in the Halobacterium halobium membrane confirms the earlier conclusion that the COOH terminus is on the cytoplasmic side."
https://openalex.org/W1621668999,"The structure of the carbohydrate units of alpha-fetoprotein from fetal calf serum has been studied. Glycopeptides and oligosaccharides were prepared from alpha-fetoprotein by protease treatment and hydrazinolysis, respectively, and subjected to carbohydrate and amino acid analysis. Two N-glycosidic glycans are present in each alpha-fetoprotein molecule. These were separated into concanavalin A (ConA)-reactive and nonreactive species on ConA-Sepharose. Methylation analysis, Smith degradation, sequential exoglycosidase treatments, and sizing suggested that the major, ConA-nonreactive fraction is composed of triantennary and the minor, ConA-reactive fraction, of biantennary complex-type ConA-reactive and -nonreactive fractions of intact alpha-fetoprotein, respectively, and refractionated on Con A-Sepharose. The results indicate that 75% of alpha-fetoprotein molecules contain two triantennary complex-type glycans, 20% contain one triantennary and one biantennary glycan, and 5% contain two biantennary glycans. The last two molecular variants are bound to ConA. These results explain, at least in part, the previously found heterogeneity of alpha-fetoprotein with respect to charge and molecular size, and provide a biochemical basis for the differing reactivities toward ConA of alpha-fetoprotein from the yolk sac, fetal liver, and various tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1574483091,"The newly developed monoclonal antibody technology was applied to the production of antibodies selective for Drosophila melanogaster choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6). Two stable cell lines, 1C8 and 1G4, were isolated from NS-1/spleen cell hybrids by employing a choline acetyltransferase enzyme activity-screening method. Both cell lines were cloned twice and were maintained in continuous culture and as ascites tumors. Purified antibody was isolated from ascites fluids by pH elution after adsorption to Protein A-Sepharose. Both antibodies eluted from the Protein A-Sepharose as a single subclass, IgG1, and directly inhibited choline acetyltransferase activity. Scatchard analysis of titration data for choline acetyltransferase antibody-enzyme interaction generated linear curves for both antibodies: KA for 1C8 was 2.77 X 10(7) M-1 and KA for 1G4 was 0.78 X 10(7) M-1. Inclusion of the choline acetyltransferase substrate acetyl-CoA at 10 times the KM in the antibody-enzyme reaction mixture substantially reduced the level of inhibition observed with both antibodies; choline, however, exhibited no protective effect. Neither antibody reacted with choline acetyltransferase-containing extracts of vertebrates or other insect neural tissues. We conclude that the two antibodies are nonidentical, monoclonal, and highly selective for D. melanogaster choline acetyltransferase, both reacting at or near the acetyl-CoA binding region of the enzyme-active site."
https://openalex.org/W1485516554,"The DNA sequence of the entire gene for penicillinase of Bacillus licheniforms 749 has recently been determined (Neugebauer, K., Sprengel, R., and Schaller, H. (1981) Nucleic Acid Res. 9, 2577-2588). Here we show that a primary translation product (Mr 35,000) can be synthesized in vitro by translation of B. licheniformis mRNA in a EScherichia coli cell-free system, or in vivo, after phenylethyl alcohol treatment of B. licheniformis. The partial NH2-terminal sequence of the in vivo synthesized primary translation product, termed prepenicillinase, was in agreement with the NH2-terminal sequence deduced from the DNA sequence. Furthermore, when a B. licheniformis membrane fraction plus the nonionic detergent Nikkol were present in the in vitro translation system, prepenicillinase was proteolytically processed to a polypeptide (Mr 31,250) that comigrated electrophoretically with the membrane-bound form of this enzyme. The partial NH2-terminal sequence of this processed form showed that it had lost 26 NH2-terminal residues present in prepenicillinase. We propose that the observed cleavage was due to membrane-associated and detergent-activated signal peptidase and consequently, that the 26-residue-long extension of nascent prepenicillinase functions in translocation across the prokaryotic plasma membrane. Based on our partial protein sequence data and the DNA sequence data, the signal peptidase-processed penicillinase starts with a Cys residue. Cotranslational and post-translational modifications of this NH2-terminal Cys, similar to those observed in the E. coli lipoprotein, might be the only means by which penicillinase can be anchored to the outer leaflet of the B. licheniformis plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1489733138,"The addition of calcium chloride to rat liver homogenates resulted in activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by as much as 50%. The enhanced activity was inhibited by quinolinic acid; it was not additive with activation by FeCl2, and stimulation was prevented by 1,10-phenanthroline. Activation by calcium was lost when the particulate fractions of liver were removed, but an activating system could be reconstituted with isolated mitochondria, purified P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, and purified ferroactivator. Iron-loaded mitochondria were more responsive to calcium than controls. A release of Fe2+ from washed mitochondria could be detected spectrophotometrically when 25-75 nmol of Ca/mg of protein were added to the mitochondrial suspension. If Ca2+ was buffered with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, the threshold of Ca2+ necessary for release of Fe2+ was approximately 10(-7) M, with peak response between 5 X 10(-7) and 10(-6) M. Total Fe2+ detected was normally 20-30 pmol of Fe2+/mg of protein. The synthetic activator of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, 3-aminopicolinic acid, as well as other picolinic acid derivatives, is capable of withdrawing Fe2+ associated with the mitochondrial fraction; after incubation with mitochondria, 3-aminopicolinate will activate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the absence of exogenous metal."

Both alpha-amanitin-sensitive and -resistant RNA polymerase activities are depressed to the same degree by the treatment with methylnitrosourea. The depression in RNA synthesis is virtually prevented when the treated cells are cultured in the presence of 3-aminobenzamide, a specific inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. Analyses of the RNA extracted from the cells labeled with [3H]uridine by agarose gel electrophoresis and by poly(U)-Sepharose column chromatography show that the contents of ribosomal precursor RNA and poly(A)-containing RNA are both low in the methylnitrosourea-treated cells as compared with those in the untreated cells and that the reduction in the contents of these kinds of RNA is almost completely prevented by the addition of 3-aminobenzamide to the culture medium. These results suggest that the enhancement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation causes the decrease in both synthesis of ribosomal RNA and messenger RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1506106277,"Using microsequencing techniques and proteins labeled in vitro with tritiated amino acids we have obtained the following NH2-terminal sequences for six canine pancreatic presecretory proteins: pretrypsinogen 1, pretrypsinogen 2+3, prechymotrypsinogen 2, preproelastase1, preporcarboxypeptidase A1, preamylase. Points of cleavage by the transport peptidase, indicated by the vertical arrows, were located from sequences of authentic products synthesized in the presence of membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. All of the identified residues in the pancreatic transport peptides are hydrophobic. Predictions of secondary structure were calculated for each of the transport peptides. The data indicated neither a common primary of secondary structure which could be interpreted as the signal for functional binding of the nascent presecretory protein to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. These findings suggest that the initial interaction with the membrane or membrane receptor may depend in part, on the hydrophobic nature of the transport peptides. Five of the presecretory proteins showed a region with a high probability of forming a beta-turn immediately following the cleavage point. This feature may give the nascent peptide a region of flexibility that would facilitate both its insertion as a loop structure into the membrane and its cleavage by the transport peptidase. The sequences of authentic secretory products derived from a variety of pancreatic tissues suggest that hydrophilic residues are required immediately following the cleavage point in order to allow translocation of the nascent polypeptide chains across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1592118044,"Several leukocyte interferon species have been purified from a continuous human myeloblast cell line. The purification procedure involving selective precipitations, gel chromatography, and several steps of high performance liquid chromatography results in interferons with specific activities of 1 to 4 X 10(8) units/mg on bovine MDBK cells. The total yield of interferon is 23%, with the yield of the individual fractions ranging from 0.2 to 11.4%. Five fractions are homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular weights of the interferons were estimated by mobility on the sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and range from 17,600 to 26,200. The species differ in their relative antiviral activities on two cell lines, bovine MDBK and human AG-1732. In addition, the pure species have similar, but distinct, amino acid compositions and tryptic peptide profiles. These result support the conclusion that leukocyte interferon consists of several homologous proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1561325347,"alpha 2u globulin synthesis ceases when a liver cell becomes malignant. We have compared the structure and transcription of the alpha 2u globulin genes in Morris hepatomas 5123D and 7793 with that of normal hepatic genes using alpha 2u globulin cDNA as a hybridization probe. No alpha 2u globulin mRNA was detected in hepatoma 7793 by cell-free translation, Northern blot, or R0t analysis. In hepatoma 5123D, however, a small number of alpha 2u globulin RNA sequences were detected by Northern blot and R0t analysis, but this RNA was not detectably translationally active either in vivo or in an in vitro cell-free translational system. No structural differences between normal liver and the hepatoma alpha 2u globulin genes were observed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA digested with restriction endonucleases Pst I, Bam HI, or Ava I. However, a general demethylation of cytosine residues in the alpha 2u globulin genes of hepatomas has been found using the restriction enzyme Hha I and the isoschizomeric pair of restriction enzymes Msp I and Hpa II. Therefore, loss of the alpha 2u globulin phenotype in these hepatomas is accompanied by extensive demethylation of DNA sequences within and/or immediately flanking the alpha 2u globulin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1600243878,"Lack of three different amino acids or treatment with the analogue DL-serine hydroxamate does not induce the accumulation of ppGpp and pppGpp, the 3'-pyrophosphates of GDP and GTP, respectively, in Rhizobium meliloti strain 41. Surprisingly, RNA accumulation is controlled under the above mentioned conditions stringently. Moreover, no significant RNA accumulation was found during chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin treatment, suggesting that R. meliloti, unlike any other bacteria in investigated so far, is not able to accumulate RNA without ongoing protein synthesis. On the other hand, lack of carbon source and ammonium starvation result in a significant ppGpp accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1482784897,"Abstract Resonances of 1H NMR spectra (360 MHz) due to several individual substituents of myelin basic protein reconstituted into phospholipid micelles have been resolved and assigned. With the aid of spin echo techniques to remove overlapping signals in the region of 2-3 ppm, singlet resonances due to the two myelin basic protein methionine S--CH3 groups (Met-20 and Met-167) and the Ala-1 N-acetyl methyl group were observed. In the presence of sufficient lysophosphatidylcholine to fully bind the protein, differential broadening occurred for Met S--CH3 resonances; Met-20 lost about 40% of its original integrated intensity (while displaying no significant line broadening) but Met-167 and N-acetyl-Ala-1 resonances did not appear to be influenced by lipid. The differential broadening of the Met-20 (versus the Met-167 and N-acetyl-Ala-1) resonances was proposed to arise from (a) specific restriction to local molecular motion of the Met-20 (but not Met-167) side chain (i.e. due to its penetration into the hydrophobic micelle lipid matrix or its proximity to specific protein/lipid electrostatic sites); or (b) transmitted dynamic effects of overall protein binding to micellar particles (due to the relatively fewer degrees of rotational freedom available to Met-20 versus N-acetyl-Ala-1 and Met-167 near protein termini). Evidence favoring the latter alternative is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1597415590,"Pulse and pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that a heterogeneous polypeptide with an apparent Mr = 68,000 was the first intracellular anti-alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-precipitable polypeptide synthesized by rat Mc-A-RH-7777 hepatoma cells. The 68,000-dalton polypeptide may consist of polypeptides with apparent molecular weights ranging from 68,000 to 70,000. It was the precursor of two intracellular anti-AFP-precipitable polypeptides of 69,000 and 73,000 apparent molecular weight. The latter were secreted into the medium without further processing. The anti-AFP-precipitable polypeptides in both cells and medium incorporated [3H]glucosamine, indicating that these polypeptides are at least partially glycosylated. The 68,000-dalton polypeptide in cells was bound mostly to concanavalin A-Sepharose, whereas the 69,000-dalton polypeptide was entirely unbound. The 73,000-dalton polypeptide consisted of concanavalin A-bound and -unbound variants. Tunicamycin completely abolished the uptake of [3H]glucosamine into anti-AFT-precipitable polypeptides in both cells and medium, and the resulting polypeptide of apparent Mr = 66,000 did not bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose. Tunicamycin did not affect the synthesis or secretion of AFP by hepatoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1483303303,"Platelet secretory granules were used for in vitro studies bearing on the mechanism of exocytosis. A morphologically homogeneous preparation of alpha-granules was obtained from porcine platelets. The granules were shown to be osmotically fragile, as determined by electron microscopy, turbidity measurements, and the release of protein upon hypotonic lysis. Lysis could also be induced in isotonic media by addition of gramicidin to granules suspended in NaCl or KCl. Increasing the osmotic strength of the medium prevented this effect. The antibiotic had no effect when added to granules in sucrose solution. Submillimolar concentrations of Ca2+ drastically reduced the turbidity of granule suspensions while releasing protein to the supernatant. Electron micrographs showed that Ca2+-treated granules lost most of their electron-dense core, indicating that lysis had occurred. Mg2+ and other divalent cations failed to induce this response. The effect occurred in NaCl or KCl but not in sucrose or sorbitol solutions. Increasing the osmotic content of the medium with sucrose suppressed the Ca2+-induced lysis. It is suggested that Ca2+ increases the ionic permeability of the granule membrane leading to solute influx followed by osmotically coupled water uptake and, therefore, swelling and lysis. During platelet activation, Ca2+-induced granule swelling could provide the driving force for membrane fusion leading to exocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1494621625,"Abstract We had shown earlier (Gopalakrishna, Y., Langley, D., Sarkar, N. (1981) Nucleic Acid Res. 9, 3545-3554) that a substantial fraction of mRNA of various bacterial species carries 3'-terminal polyadenylate sequences. In this paper, we show that poly(A)-containing RNA from Bacillus subtilis can serve as template for the synthesis of complementary DNA by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, provided that oligodeoxythymidylate is added as primer. Poly(A)-RNA purified by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose was 20 times more effective as template for cDNA formation than total bacterial RNA, whereas rRNA was inactive. The average chain length of the cDNA was 400 nucleotides (range = 230-800 nucleotides), and 95% of the cDNA could be degraded by the single-strand specific S1 nuclease after denaturation. The small fraction (5%) that was resistant to S1 nuclease may represent duplex hairpin structures. Annealing with poly(A)-RNA protected cDNA from degradation by S1 nuclease, indicating that cDNA indeed contains nucleotide sequences complementary to poly(A)-RNA. These results constitute independent evidence that a large fraction (about 40%) of B. subtilis mRNA is polyadenylated. Moreover, the synthesis of cDNA to bacterial mRNA provides an important new tool for the study of bacterial mRNA structure."

https://openalex.org/W1481198303,"A strain of fungus Cladosporium herbarum extracellularly produced an inhibitor specific for mammalian alpha-amylase. The inhibitor was purified 81-fold by freeze-thawing, heat treatment, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-75, DEAE-Sephacel, and Bio-Gel P-100. An apparent molecular weight of approximately 18,000 was estimated for the inhibitor using Bio-Gel P-100 filtration. The purified inhibitor preparation was a glycoprotein containing about 10% carbohydrate. The amino acid analysis of the inhibitor showed abundances of Gly, Asp, Glu, Ser, Ala, and Thr residues. The inhibitor was stable between pH 5 and 12 at 4 degrees C, and below 80 degrees C at pH 7.0. A binary complex formation out of equimolar amounts of the inhibitor and alpha-amylase, was demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Bio-Gel P-100 chromatography. Kinetic studies exhibited that the inhibitor noncompetitively inhibited the enzyme reaction with a Ki value of 2.3 approximately 4.8 x 10(-10) M, by combining with the enzyme molecule at a different site from the substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1577293079,"The antigenic structure of human albumin was investigated in order to establish whether or not there was any similarity between its antigenic sites. Using immunoadsorbent columns prepared with cyanogen bromide fragments of human serum albumin, antibodies directed against different portions of the albumin molecules were isolated. Measurement of the amount of the antibodies isolated and study of their specificity by inhibition techniques show that these subpopulations of antibodies reacted not only with the fragment used for their isolation (homologous) but also with the other fragments (heterologous). Heterologous fragments were inhibiting only at a very high concentration with regard to the homologous ones. These results show that there is a weak cross-reactivity between different portions of the albumin molecule. This reaction is most probably due to the homology existing in the sequence of the human albumin molecule which has arisen by gene duplication. The same type of behavior can be predicted to extent to other molecules which have evolved by similar mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1601699538,"Poly(A)-rich RNA has been isolated from calf thymus and translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system. Three peptides with Mr = 58,000, 33,000, and 13,000 were specifically immunoprecipitated from the translation products with calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase antiserum. An oligo(dT)-purified preparation of calf terminal transferase competed with only the Mr = 58,000 peptide in the immunoprecipitation reaction. The anti-terminal transferase serum did not precipitate a Mr = 58,000 peptide from translation products of spleen or liver mRNA, but it did precipitate the Mr = 33,000 and 13,000 peptides from products of spleen mRNA and a Mr = 13,000 peptide from products of liver mRNA. In addition, when an affinity-purified antibody to calf terminal transferase was used, only a Mr = 58,000 peptide was immunoprecipitated from the translation products of calf thymus mRNA, and none was immunoprecipitated from spleen or liver mRNA products. This antibody also precipitated a Mr = 58,000 peptide from the cell lysates of calf thymocytes labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine. These results demonstrate that calf terminal transferase is biosynthesized as a Mr = 58,000 peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1504729878,"A method which involves Percoll gradient centrifugation, is described for separating rabbit reticulocytes from other blood cells, including erythrocytes. This permits a quantitative comparison of the adenylate cyclase activity of reticulocyte membranes which had been induced either by bleeding (30% reticulocytosis) or by repeated injections of phenylhydrazine (90% reticulocytosis). Adenylate cyclase activity was greatly impaired on exposure to the hemolytic agent; total activity was reduced about 20-fold. However, a more selective loss was observed in terms of hormonal stimulation. Prostaglandin E1 was 2-fold more effective than either sodium fluoride or Forskolin in stimulating the enzyme from bled reticulocytes, whereas it was 3-fold less effective than either fluoride or Forskolin in the case of membranes from animals which had been exposed to phenylhydrazine. A stimulatory adenosine receptor was detectable only in reticulocytes which had not been treated with the hemolytic agent. These studies suggest that purified reticulocytes from bled animals represent the most suitable model system in which to study the maturation of red blood cells."
