https://openalex.org/W2784667865,"Both mitochondria and lysosomes are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and dysfunction of both organelles has been observed in multiple diseases. Mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fission and fusion to maintain a functional mitochondrial network, which drives cellular metabolism. Lysosomes similarly undergo constant dynamic regulation by the RAB7 GTPase, which cycles from an active GTP-bound state into an inactive GDP-bound state upon GTP hydrolysis. Here we have identified the formation and regulation of mitochondria-lysosome membrane contact sites using electron microscopy, structured illumination microscopy and high spatial and temporal resolution confocal live cell imaging. Mitochondria-lysosome contacts formed dynamically in healthy untreated cells and were distinct from damaged mitochondria that were targeted into lysosomes for degradation. Contact formation was promoted by active GTP-bound lysosomal RAB7, and contact untethering was mediated by recruitment of the RAB7 GTPase-activating protein TBC1D15 to mitochondria by FIS1 to drive RAB7 GTP hydrolysis and thereby release contacts. Functionally, lysosomal contacts mark sites of mitochondrial fission, allowing regulation of mitochondrial networks by lysosomes, whereas conversely, mitochondrial contacts regulate lysosomal RAB7 hydrolysis via TBC1D15. Mitochondria-lysosome contacts thus allow bidirectional regulation of mitochondrial and lysosomal dynamics, and may explain the dysfunction observed in both organelles in various human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2785043177,"The poor correlation of mutational landscapes with phenotypes limits our understanding of the pathogenesis and metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here we show that oncogenic dosage-variation has a critical role in PDAC biology and phenotypic diversification. We find an increase in gene dosage of mutant KRAS in human PDAC precursors, which drives both early tumorigenesis and metastasis and thus rationalizes early PDAC dissemination. To overcome the limitations posed to gene dosage studies by the stromal richness of PDAC, we have developed large cell culture resources of metastatic mouse PDAC. Integration of cell culture genomes, transcriptomes and tumour phenotypes with functional studies and human data reveals additional widespread effects of oncogenic dosage variation on cell morphology and plasticity, histopathology and clinical outcome, with the highest KrasMUT levels underlying aggressive undifferentiated phenotypes. We also identify alternative oncogenic gains (Myc, Yap1 or Nfkb2), which collaborate with heterozygous KrasMUT in driving tumorigenesis, but have lower metastatic potential. Mechanistically, different oncogenic gains and dosages evolve along distinct evolutionary routes, licensed by defined allelic states and/or combinations of hallmark tumour suppressor alterations (Cdkn2a, Trp53, Tgfβ-pathway). Thus, evolutionary constraints and contingencies direct oncogenic dosage gain and variation along defined routes to drive the early progression of PDAC and shape its downstream biology. Our study uncovers universal principles of Ras-driven oncogenesis that have potential relevance beyond pancreatic cancer. Oncogenic dosage variation along distinct evolutionary routes defines fundamental aspects of pancreatic cancer biology and phenotypic diversification. Despite the availability of hundreds of pancreatic cancer genomes, it has been difficult to associate specific mutation patterns with distinct biological features. To address this, Roland Rad and colleagues tracked genomic alterations during the development of pancreatic cancer, aiming to link mutations to heterogeneous phenotypes. Human and mouse studies reveal that different gene dosages of an activating KRAS mutation are critical determinants of pancreatic cancer biology, including early progression, metastasis, histopathology, cellular plasticity and clinical aggressiveness. Mutant KRAS is amplified through distinct evolutionary routes during tumorigenesis that are defined by prior alterations of specific tumour suppressors and oncogenes. This study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer and may aid advances in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2784237640,"The spliceosome is a highly dynamic macromolecular complex that precisely excises introns from pre-mRNA. Here we report the cryo-EM 3D structure of the human Bact spliceosome at 3.4 Å resolution. In the Bact state, the spliceosome is activated but not catalytically primed, so that it is functionally blocked prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. The spliceosomal core is similar to the yeast Bact spliceosome; important differences include the presence of the RNA helicase aquarius and peptidyl prolyl isomerases. To examine the overall dynamic behavior of the purified spliceosome, we developed a principal component analysis-based approach. Calculating the energy landscape revealed eight major conformational states, which we refined to higher resolution. Conformational differences of the highly flexible structural components between these eight states reveal how spliceosomal components contribute to the assembly of the spliceosome, allowing it to generate a dynamic interaction network required for its subsequent catalytic activation."
https://openalex.org/W2784870515,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms are usually tested when environmental and biological artifacts are intentionally avoided. In this study, we deliberately introduced different perturbations in order to test the robustness of a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based BCI. Specifically we investigated to what extent a drop in performance is related to the degraded quality of EEG signals or rather due to increased cognitive load. In the online tasks, subjects focused on one of the four circles and gave feedback on the correctness of the classification under four conditions randomized across subjects: Control (no perturbation), Speaking (counting loudly and repeatedly from one to ten), Thinking (mentally counting repeatedly from one to ten), and Listening (listening to verbal counting from one to ten). Decision tree, Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers were used to evaluate the classification performance using features generated by canonical correlation analysis. During the online condition, Speaking and Thinking decreased moderately the mean classification accuracy compared to Control condition whereas there was no significant difference between Listening and Control conditions across subjects. The performances were sensitive to the classification method and to the perturbation conditions. We have not observed significant artifacts in EEG during perturbations in the frequency range of interest except in theta band. Therefore we concluded that the drop in the performance is likely to have a cognitive origin. During the Listening condition relative alpha power in a broad area including central and temporal regions primarily over the left hemisphere correlated negatively with the performance thus most likely indicating active suppression of the distracting presentation of the playback. This is the first study that systematically evaluates the effects of natural artifacts (i.e. mental, verbal and audio perturbations) on SSVEP-based BCIs. The results can be used to improve individual classification performance taking into account effects of perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2784966818,"Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) rely upon Arctic sea ice as a physical habitat. Consequently, conservation assessments of polar bears identify the ongoing reduction in sea ice to represent a significant threat to their survival. However, the additional role of sea ice as a potential, indirect, source of energy to bears has been overlooked. Here we used the highly branched isoprenoid lipid biomarker-based index (H-Print) approach in combination with quantitative fatty acid signature analysis to show that sympagic (sea ice-associated), rather than pelagic, carbon contributions dominated the marine component of polar bear diet (72–100%; 99% CI, n = 55), irrespective of differences in diet composition. The lowest mean estimates of sympagic carbon were found in Baffin Bay bears, which were also exposed to the most rapidly increasing open water season. Therefore, our data illustrate that for future Arctic ecosystems that are likely to be characterised by reduced sea ice cover, polar bears will not only be impacted by a change in their physical habitat, but also potentially in the supply of energy to the ecosystems upon which they depend. This data represents the first quantifiable baseline that is critical for the assessment of likely ongoing changes in energy supply to Arctic predators as we move into an increasingly uncertain future for polar ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2784201937,"Maternal depression was recently conceptualized as a network of interacting symptoms. Prior studies have shown that low self-efficacy, as an index of maternal functioning, is one important source of stress that worsens depression. We have limited information, however, on the specific relationships between depression symptoms and self-efficacy. In this study, we used regularized partial correlation networks to explore the multivariate relationships between maternal depression symptoms and self-efficacy over time. Depressed mothers (n = 306) completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale at four time points, between four and eight weeks apart. We estimated (a) the network structure of the 20 CES-D depression symptoms and self-efficacy for each time point, (b) determined the centrality or structural importance of all variables, and (c) tested whether the network structure changed over time. In the resulting networks, self-efficacy was mostly negatively connected with depression symptoms. The strongest relationships among depression symptoms were ‘lonely—sleep difficulties’ and ‘inability to get going—crying’. ‘Feeling disliked’ and ‘concentration difficulty’ were the two most central symptoms. In comparing the network structures, we found that the network structures were moderately stable over time. This is the first study to investigate the network structure and their temporal stability of maternal depression symptoms and self-efficacy in low-income depressed mothers. We discuss how these findings might help future research to identify clinically relevant symptom-to-symptom relationships that could drive maternal depression processes, and potentially inform tailored interventions. We share data and analytical code, making our results fully reproducible."
https://openalex.org/W2791013502,"Burden of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae remains high despite the availability of conjugate vaccines. Mucosal immunization targeting the lungs is an attractive alternative for the induction of local immune responses to improve protection against pneumonia. Our group had previously described the development of poly(glycerol adipate-co-ω-pentadecalactone) (PGA-co-PDL) polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) adsorbed with Pneumococcal surface protein A from clade 4 (PspA4Pro) within L-leucine microcarriers (nanocomposite microparticles—NCMPs) for mucosal delivery targeting the lungs (NP/NCMP PspA4Pro). NP/NCMP PspA4Pro was now used for immunization of mice. Inoculation of this formulation induced anti-PspA4Pro IgG antibodies in serum and lungs. Analysis of binding of serum IgG to intact bacteria showed efficient binding to bacteria expressing PspA from clades 3, 4 and 5 (family 2), but no binding to bacteria expressing PspA from clades 1 and 2 (family 1) was observed. Both mucosal immunization with NP/NCMP PspA4Pro and subcutaneous injection of the protein elicited partial protection against intranasal lethal pneumococcal challenge with a serotype 3 strain expressing PspA from clade 5 (PspA5). Although similar survival levels were observed for mucosal immunization with NP/NCMP PspA4Pro and subcutaneous immunization with purified protein, NP/NCMP PspA4Pro induced earlier control of the infection. Conversely, neither immunization with NP/NCMP PspA4Pro nor subcutaneous immunization with purified protein reduced bacterial burden in the lungs after challenge with a serotype 19F strain expressing PspA from clade 1 (PspA1). Mucosal immunization with NP/NCMP PspA4Pro targeting the lungs is thus able to induce local and systemic antibodies, conferring protection only against a strain expressing PspA from the homologous family 2."
https://openalex.org/W2784779125,"Females experience higher risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries; males experience higher risk of hamstring strain injuries. Differences in injury may be partially due to sex differences in knee flexor (KF) to knee extensor (KE) muscle size ratio and the proportional size of constituent muscles.To compare the absolute and proportional size, and mass distribution, of individual KE and KF muscles, as well as overall size and balance (size ratio) of these muscle groups between the sexes.T1-weighted axial plane MR images (1.5T) of healthy untrained young males and females (32 vs 34) were acquired to determine thigh muscle anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA). Maximal ACSA (ACSAmax) of constituent muscles, summated for KF and KE muscle groups, and the KF:KE ratio were calculated.Females had 25.3% smaller KE ACSAmax (70.9±12.1 vs 93.6±10.3 cm2; P<0.001) and 29.6% smaller KF ACSAmax than males (38.8±7.3cm2 vs 55.1±7.3cm2; P<0.001). Consequently, females had lower KF:KE ACSA ratio (P = 0.031). There were sex differences in the proportional size of 2/4 KE and 5/6 KF. In females, vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris long-head (BFlh) and semimembranosus (SM) were a greater proportion and sartorius (SA), gracilis (GR) and biceps femoris short-head (BFsh) a smaller proportion of their respective muscle groups compared to males (All P<0.05).Sex differences in KF:KE ACSAmax ratio may contribute to increased risk of ACL injury in females. Sex discrepancies in absolute and proportional size of SA, GR, VL and BFlh may contribute further anatomical explanations for sex differences in injury incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2792492396,"Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) is a global health issue. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare plasmids coding for resistance to ESC isolated from 16 avian commensal and 17 avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains obtained respectively at slaughterhouse or from diseased broilers in 2010–2012. Plasmid DNA was used to transform E. coli DH5alpha, and the resistances of the transformants were determined. The sequences of the ESC-resistance plasmids prepared from transformants were obtained by Illumina (33 plasmids) or PacBio (1 plasmid). Results showed that 29 of these plasmids contained the blaCTX-M-1 gene and belonged to the IncI1/ST3 type, with 27 and 20 of them carrying the sul2 or tet(A) genes respectively. Despite their diverse origins, several plasmids showed very high percentages of identity. None of the blaCTX-M-1-containing plasmid contained APEC virulence genes, although some of them were detected in the parental strains. Three plasmids had the blaCMY-2 gene, but no other resistance gene. They belonged to IncB/O/K/Z-like or IncFIA/FIB replicon types. The blaCMY-2 IncFIA/FIB plasmid was obtained from a strain isolated from a diseased broiler and also containing a blaCTX-M-1 IncI1/ST3 plasmid. Importantly APEC virulence genes (sitA-D, iucA-D, iutA, hlyF, ompT, etsA-C, iss, iroB-E, iroN, cvaA-C and cvi) were detected on the blaCMY-2 plasmid. In conclusion, our results show the dominance and high similarity of blaCTX-M-1 IncI1/ST3 plasmids, and the worrying presence of APEC virulence genes on a blaCMY-2 plasmid."

Precise control of hepatic gluconeogenesis is thus critical for maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in diseases by regulating diverse biological processes, but the function of lncRNAs in maintaining normal physiology, particularly glucose homeostasis in the liver, remains largely unexplored. We identified a novel liver-enriched long non-coding RNA, Gm10768, and examined its expression patterns under pathophysiological conditions. We further adopted gain- and loss-of-function strategies to explore the effect of Gm10768 on hepatic glucose metabolism and the possible molecular mechanism involved. Our results showed that the expression of Gm10768 was significantly increased in the liver of fasted mice and was induced by gluconeogenic hormonal stimuli. Functionally, overexpression of Gm10768 activated hepatic gluconeogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner. In contrast, depletion of Gm10768 suppressed hepatic glucose production both in vitro and in vivo. Adenovirus-mediated hepatic knockdown of Gm10768 improved glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia of diabetic db/db mice. Mechanistically, Gm10768 sequestrated microRNA-214 (miR-214) to relieve its suppression on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a positive regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Taken together, we identified Gm10768 as a new lncRNA activating hepatic gluconeogenesis through antagonizing miR-214 in mice.

https://openalex.org/W2791342919,"Acoustic studies have revealed that patients with Essential Tremor treated with thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) may suffer from speech deterioration in terms of imprecise oral articulation and reduced voicing control. Based on the acoustic signal one cannot infer, however, whether this deterioration is due to a general slowing down of the speech motor system (e.g., a target undershoot of a desired articulatory goal resulting from being too slow) or disturbed coordination (e.g., a target undershoot caused by problems with the relative phasing of articulatory movements). To elucidate this issue further, we here investigated both acoustics and articulatory patterns of the labial and lingual system using Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) in twelve Essential Tremor patients treated with thalamic DBS and twelve age- and sex-matched controls. By comparing patients with activated (DBS-ON) and inactivated stimulation (DBS-OFF) with control speakers, we show that critical changes in speech dynamics occur on two levels: With inactivated stimulation (DBS-OFF), patients showed coordination problems of the labial and lingual system in terms of articulatory imprecision and slowness. These effects of articulatory discoordination worsened under activated stimulation, accompanied by an additional overall slowing down of the speech motor system. This leads to a poor performance of syllables on the acoustic surface, reflecting an aggravation either of pre-existing cerebellar deficits and/or the affection of the upper motor fibers of the internal capsule."
https://openalex.org/W2794377218,"A safe and effective vaccine adjuvant is important in modern vaccines. Various Chinese herbal polysaccharides can activate the immune system. Cistanche deserticola (CD) is a traditional Chinese herb and an adjuvant candidate. Here, we confirmed that water-extractable polysaccharides of CD (WPCD) could modulate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. In a dose-dependent manner, WPCD significantly promoted the maturation and function of murine marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) through up-regulating the expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40, allogenic T cell proliferation, and the yields of IL-12 and TNF-α via toll-like receptor4 (TLR4), as indicated by in vitro experiments. In addition, its immunomodulatory activity was also observed in mice. WPCD effectively improved the titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a and markedly enhanced the proliferation of T and B cells, the production of IFN-γ and IL-4 in CD4+ T cells and the expression level of IFN-γ in CD8+ T cells better than Alum. Furthermore, WPCD could markedly up-regulate the expression levels of CD40 and CD80 on DCs in spleen and down-regulate the Treg frequency. The study suggests that polysaccharides of Cistanche deserticola are a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant for eliciting both humoral immunity and cellular immunity by activating DCs via TLR4 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2786302216,"Neutrophils migrate to sites infected by pathogenic microorganisms. This migration is regulated by neutrophil-secreted ATP, which stimulates neutrophils in an autocrine manner through purinergic receptors on the plasma membrane. Although previous studies have shown that ATP is released through channels at the plasma membrane of the neutrophil, it remains unknown whether it is also released through alternate secretory systems involving vesicular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), a key molecule for vesicular storage and nucleotide release, in ATP secretion from neutrophils. RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis indicated that VNUT is expressed in mouse neutrophils. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that VNUT mainly colocalized with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a marker of tertiary granules, which are secretory organelles. In mouse neutrophils, ATP release was inhibited by clodronate, which is a potent VNUT inhibitor. Furthermore, neutrophils from VNUT−/− mice did not release ATP and exhibited significantly reduced migration in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that tertiary granule-localized VNUT is responsible for vesicular ATP release and subsequent neutrophil migration.

https://openalex.org/W2791147412,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as one of the main factors related to cancer progression, however, the conversion mechanism of normal fibroblasts (NOFs) to CAFs has not been well elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of CAF transformation from NOFs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study found that NOFs exposed to OSCC cells transformed to senescent cells. The cytokine antibody array showed the highest secretion levels of IL-6 and CXCL1 in NOFs co-cultured with OSCC cells. Despite that both IL-6 and CXCL1 induced the senescent phenotype of CAFs, CXCL1 secretion showed a cancer-specific response to transform NOFs into CAFs in OSCC, whereas IL-6 secretion was eventuated by common co-culture condition. Further, CXCL1 was released from NOFs co-cultured with OSCC cells, however, CXCL1 was undetectable in mono-cultured NOFs or co-cultured OSCC cells with NOFs. Taken together, this study demonstrates that CXCL1 can transform NOFs into senescent CAFs via an autocrine mechanism. These data might contribute to further understanding of CAFs and to development of a potential therapeutic approach targeting cancer cells-CAFs interactions."

However, recent studies have hypothesized that lack of sleep may instigate internet use for leisure. To elucidate the potential effects of sleep time on internet use, we explored the different associations between sleep time and internet use according to its purpose.The population-based, cross-sectional study group from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS) collected data from 57,425 middle school students in 2014 and 2015. Sleep time over the past 7 days was classified into the following groups: < 7 h (6 h); ≥ 7 h, < 8 h (7 h); ≥ 8 h, < 9 h (8 h); and ≥ 9 h (9+ h). Internet use time per day was separately surveyed for leisure and for study and categorized as follows: 0 h; > 0 h, ≤ 1 h (1 h); > 1 h, ≤ 2 h (2 h); and > 2 h (2+ h) per day. Information on age, sex, region of residence, body mass index (BMI), economic level, parental education level, stress level, school performance level, and sleep satisfaction were retrieved. The relationships between sleep time and internet use time for leisure/study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression with complex sampling. In the subgroup analysis according to sleep satisfaction (good, normal, and poor), the associations of sleep time with internet use for leisure were analyzed using the same methods.Compared to 9+ h of sleep, less sleep was related to a long internet use time (2+ h) for leisure (adjusted odds ratio, AOR [95% confidence interval, CI] of sleep: 8 h = 1.23 [1.14-1.32]; 7 h = 1.42 [1.31-1.54]; and 6 h = 1.56 [1.44-1.70]; P < 0.001). Conversely, a relationship between less sleep and a long internet use time (2+ h) for study was evident only for 6 h of sleep (AOR of sleep: 8 h = 0.84 [0.84-1.04]; 7 h = 1.05 [0.94-1.17]; and 6 h = 1.32 [1.27-1.59]; P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis according to sleep satisfaction, less sleep was associated with a long internet use time for leisure in all sleep satisfaction groups, although the relationship was more significant in the lower sleep satisfaction group.Less sleep was significantly related to long-term use of the internet for leisure, whereas this association was not definite for internet use for study. Furthermore, poor sleep quality potentiated the relationship between less sleep time and internet use for leisure."
https://openalex.org/W2793359608,"Elaeagnus angustifolia is one of the most extensively afforested tree species in environment-harsh regions of northern China. Despite its exceptional tolerance to saline soil, the intrinsic adaptive physiology has not been revealed. In this study, we investigated the growth, organ-level ionic relations and organic osmoregulation of the seedlings hydroponically treated with 0, 100 and 200 mM NaCl for 30 days. We found that the growth characteristics and the whole-plant dry weight were not obviously stunted, but instead, were even slightly stimulated by the treatment of 100 mM NaCl. In contrast, these traits were significantly inhibited by 200 mM NaCl treatment. Interestingly, as compared with the control (0 mM NaCl), both 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments had a promotional effect on root growth as evidenced by 26.3% and 2.4% increases in root dry weight, respectively. Roots had the highest Na+ and Cl- concentrations and obviously served as the sink for the net increased Na+ and Cl-, while, stems might maintain the capacity of effective Na+ constraint, resulting in reduced Na+ transport to the leaves. K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in three plant organs of NaCl-treated seedlings presented a substantial decline, eventually leading to an enormously drop of K+/Na+ ratio. As the salt concentration increased, proline and soluble protein contents continuously exhibited a prominent and a relatively tardy accumulation, respectively, whereas soluble sugar firstly fell to a significant level and then regained to a level that is close to that of the control. Taken together, our results provided quantitative measures that revealed some robust adaptive physiological mechanisms underpinning E. angustifolia’s moderately high salt tolerance, and those mechanisms comprise scalable capacity for root Na+ and Cl- storage, effectively constrained transportation of Na+ from stems to leaves, root compensatory growth, as well as an immediate and prominent leaf proline accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2793665896,"The crucian carp Carassius carassius (Linnaeus, 1758), is native to many European freshwaters. Despite its wide distribution, the crucian carp is declining in both the number and sizes of populations across much of its range. Here we studied 30 individuals of a putative pure population from Helsinki, Finland. Despite clear external morphological features of C. carassius, an individual was of a higher ploidy level than the others. We therefore applied a set of molecular genetic (S7 nuclear and cytochrome b mitochondrial genes) and cytogenetic tools (sequential fluorescent 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI], Chromomycin A3 [CMA3], C-banding and in situ hybridization [FISH] with both 5S and 28S ribosomal DNA probes) to determine its origin. While all examined characteristics of a diploid representative male (CCAHe2Fi) clearly corresponded to those of C. carassius, a triploid individual (CCAHe1Fi) was more complex. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nuclear genome of CCAHe1Fi contained three haploid sets: two C. gibelio and one C. carassius. However the mitochondrial DNA was that of C. gibelio, demonstrating its hybrid origin. The FISH revealed three strong (more intensive) 5S rDNA loci, confirming the triploid status, and an additional 24 weak (less intensive) signals were observed in the chromosome complement of CCAHe1Fi. On the other hand, only two strong and 16 weak 5S rDNA signals were visible on the chromosomes of the CCAHe2Fi male. 28S rDNA FISH revealed four strong signals in both CCAHe1Fi and CCAHe2Fi individuals. CMA3 staining revealed four to six CMA3-positive bands of CCAHe1Fi, while that of diploids contained only two to four. The fact that a polyploid hybrid Carassius female with a strong invasive potential may share morphological characters typical for endangered C. carassius highlights a need to combine genetic investigations of Carassius cryptic diversity with conservation measures of C. carassius in Europe."

Information on the circulating genotypes of HRSV from regions with high-burden of infection is vital in the global efforts towards the development of protective vaccine. We report here the genotypes of HRSV circulating among children in Ibadan, the first of such from Nigeria.Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs collected from 231 children presenting with respiratory infections in some health facilities for care as well as those attending immunization centers for routine vaccination in Ibadan, Nigeria were used for the study. The 2nd hypervariable (HVR2) region of the glycoprotein (G) gene of HRSV was amplified and sequenced using HRSV group specific primers. HRSV was detected in 41 out of the 231 samples. Thirty-three of the isolates were successfully subtyped(22 subtype A and 11 subtype B). Fourteen of the subtype A and all the subtype B were successfully sequenced and genotyped. Phylogenetic analysis showed that genotype ON1 with 72 nucleotide (nt) duplication was the major subgroup A virus (11 of 14) detected together with genotype NA2. All the HRSV subtype B detected belong to the BA genotype with characteristic 60nt duplication. The ON1 genotypes vary considerably from the prototype strain due to amino acid substitutions including T292I which has not been reported elsewhere. The NA2 genotypes have mutations on four antigenic sites within the HVR2relative to the prototype A2. In conclusion, three genotypes of HRSV were found circulating in Ibadan, Nigeria. Additional study that will include isolates from other parts of the country will be done to determine the extent of genotype diversity of HRSV circulating in Nigeria."

This study explored independent associations and effect modification between lifetime substance use and mood disorder in relation to food insecurity. Poisson regression analysis of data from British Columbia respondents (n = 13,450; 12 years+) in the 2007/08 Canadian Community Health Survey was conducted. Measures included The Household Food Security Survey Module (7.3% food insecure), recent diagnosis of a mood disorder (self-reported; 9.5%), lifetime use of cannabis, cocaine/crack, ecstasy, hallucinogens, and speed, any lifetime substance use, sociodemographic covariates, and the interaction terms of mood disorder by substance. For those with recent diagnosis of a mood disorder the prevalence of lifetime substance use ranged between 1.2 to 5.7% and were significantly higher than those without recent mood disorder diagnosis or lifetime use of substances (p’s < 0.05). For respondents with a recent mood disorder diagnosis or who used cannabis, food insecurity prevalence was higher compared to the general sample (p < 0.001); prevalence was lower for cocaine/crack use (p < 0.05). Significant effect modification was found between mood disorder with cannabis, ecstasy, hallucinogen and any substance use over the lifetime (PRs 0.51 to 0.64, p’s 0.022 to 0.001). Independent associations were found for cocaine/crack and speed use (PRs 1.68, p’s < 0.001) and mood disorder (PRs 2.02, p’s < 0.001). Based on these findings and the existing literature, future study about coping and resilience in the context of substance use, mental health, and food insecurity may lead to the development of relevant interventions aimed at mental well-being and food security."
https://openalex.org/W2790103932,"Background Immigrants often encounter barriers in the health system that may affect their health care outcomes. In order to better cater to the needs of immigrants, many health care institutions have increased their efforts in recent years to provide services which are more sensitive to the needs of an increasingly diverse population. Little is known about whether these efforts are successful. This study examines difference in outcomes of tertiary prevention between immigrants and the autochthonous population in Germany over the period of 2006–2014. Methods The analysis is based on a 10% random sample of routine data on completed tertiary preventive treatments in Germany during 2006–2014. Four different indicators of treatment effectiveness were compared between patients with a nationality from Germany, Portugal/Spain/Italy/Greece, Turkey and Former Yugoslavia using logistic regression adjusted for demographic/socioeconomic factors. Interaction terms for year were modeled to examine group differences over time. Results Depending on the outcome, Turkish and Former Yugoslavian nationals had an 23%-69% higher chance of a poor treatment effectiveness than Germans (OR = 1.23 [95%-CI = 1.15,1.32] and OR = 1.69 [95%-CI = 1.55,1.83], respectively). Fewer differences were observed between nationals from Portugal/Spain/Italy/Greece and Germans. Disparities did not significantly differ between the years in which services were utilized. Conclusion Measures implemented by health care institutions did not reduce existing health care disparities between immigrants and the majority population in Germany. One potential reason is that existing approaches are unsystematic and often not properly evaluated. More targeted strategies and a thorough evaluation is needed in order to improve health care for immigrants sustainably."
https://openalex.org/W2793470165,"Estrogen exerts protective effects against cardiovascular diseases in premenopausal women, but is associated with an increased risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke in older postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that activation of the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) can cause either relaxation or contraction of arteries. It is highly likely that these dual actions of GPER may contribute to the seemingly paradoxical effects of estrogen in regulating coronary artery function. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that activation of GPER enhances agonist-stimulated porcine coronary artery contraction via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation and its downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway. Isometric tension studies and western blot were performed to determine the effect of GPER activation on coronary artery contraction. Our findings demonstrated that G-1 caused concentration-dependent relaxation of ET-1-induced contraction, while pretreatment of arterial rings with G-1 significantly enhanced ET-1-induced contraction. GPER antagonist, G-36, significantly inhibited both the G-1-induced relaxation effect and G-1-enhanced ET-1 contraction. Gallein, a Gβγ inhibitor, significantly increased G-1-induced relaxation, yet inhibited G-1-enhanced ET-1-mediated contraction. Similarly, inhibition of EGFR with AG1478 or inhibition of Src with phosphatase 2 further increased G-1-induced relaxation responses in coronary arteries, but decreased G-1-enhanced ET-1-induced contraction. Western blot experiments in porcine coronary artery smooth muscle cells (PCASMC) showed that G-1 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, which was inhibited by AG-1478. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the level of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) released by ET-1 treatment increased two-fold; whereas pre-incubation with G-1 further increased ET-1-induced HB-EGF release to four-fold over control conditions. Lastly, the role of ERK1/2 was determined by applying the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, in isometric tension studies and detecting phospho-ERK1/2 in immunoblotting. PD98059 potentiated G-1-induced relaxation response, but blocked G-1-enhanced ET-1-induced contraction. By western blot, G-1 treatment decreased phospho-ERK1/2, however, in the presence of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ22536, G-1 significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PCASMC. These data demonstrate that activation of GPER induces relaxation via cAMP as well as contraction via a mechanism involving transactivation of EGFR and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in porcine coronary arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2786576618,"Restaurant prepared foods are known to be energy-dense and high in fat and sodium, but lower in protective nutrients. There is evidence of higher risk of adiposity, type II diabetes, and heart disease in frequent consumers of restaurant meals. However, the risk of mortality as a long-term health consequence of frequent consumption of restaurant meals has not been examined. We examined the prospective risk of all-cause and coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes (cardiometabolic) mortality in relation to frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals in a national cohort. We used frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals information collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, conducted from 1999–2004, with mortality follow-up completed through Dec. 31, 2011 (baseline age ≥ 40y; n = 9107). We estimated the relative hazard of all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality associated with weekly frequency of eating restaurant meals using Cox-proportional hazards regression methods to adjust for multiple covariates. All analyses accounted for complex survey design and included sample weights. Over 33% of all respondents reported eating ≥3 restaurant prepared meals/week. In this cohort, 2200 deaths due to all causes and 665 cardiometabolic deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 9 years. The covariate-adjusted hazard ratio of all cause or cardiometabolic mortality in men and women reporters of <1 or 1–2 restaurant prepared meals did not differ from those reporting ≥3 meals/week (P>0.05). The results were robust to effect modification by baseline BMI, years of education, and baseline morbidity. Expectedly, the 24-h dietary intakes of whole grains, fruits, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin C, potassium and magnesium at baseline were lower, but energy, energy density, and energy from fat were higher in more frequent restaurant meal reporters (P<0.05). Baseline serum HDL cholesterol, folate, and some carotenoids were inversely associated with the frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals (P<0.05); however, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and c-reactive protein were unrelated (P<0.05). The weekly frequency of eating restaurant prepared meals and prospective risk of mortality after 9 years were not related in this cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2790059750,"Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) is one of the important insect pests in rice field. Bt agents were recommended in the C. medinalis control and Bt rice is bred as a tactic to control this insect. However, the tolerance or resistance of insect to Bt protein is a main threat to the application of Bt protein. In order to investigate the response of C. medinalis transcriptome in defending a Cry1C toxin, high-through RNA-sequencing was carried in the C. medinalis larvae treated with and without Cry1C toxin. A total of 35,586 high-quality unigenes was annotated in the transcriptome of C. medinalis midgut. The comparative analysis identified 6,966 differently expressed unigenes (DEGs) between the two treatments. GO analysis showed that these genes involved in proteolysis and extracellular region. Among these DEGs, carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase and P450 were differently expressed in the treated C. medinalis midgut. Furthermore, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase were identified in DEGs, and most of them up-regulated. In addition, thirteen ABC transporters were downregulated and three upregulated in Cry1C-treated C. medinalis midgut. Based on the pathway analysis, antigen processing and presentation pathway, and chronic myeloid leukemia pathway were significant in C. medinalis treated with Cry1C toxin. These results indicated that serine protease, detoxification enzymes and ABC transporter, antigen processing and presentation pathway, and chronic myeloid leukemia pathway may involved in the response of C. medinalis to Cry1C toxin. This study provides a transcriptomal foundation for the identification and functional characterization of genes involved in the toxicity of Bt Cry protein against C. medinalis, and provides potential clues to the studies on the tolerance or resistance of an agriculturally important insect pest C. medinalis to Cry1C toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2790686124,"HIV synergy with sexually transmitted co-infections is well-documented in the clinic. Co-infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae in particular, increases genital HIV shedding and mucosal transmission. However, no animal model of co-infection currently exists to directly explore this relationship or to bridge the gap in understanding between clinical and in vitro studies of this interaction. This study aims to test the feasibility of using a humanized mouse model to overcome this barrier. Combining recent in vivo modelling advancements in both HIV and gonococcal research, we developed a co-infection model by engrafting immunodeficient NSG mice with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells to generate humanized mice that permit both systemic HIV infection and genital N. gonorrhoeae infection. Systemic plasma and vaginal lavage titres of HIV were measured in order to assess the impact of gonococcal challenge on viral plasma titres and genital shedding. Engrafted mice showed human CD45+ leukocyte repopulation in blood and mucosal tissues. Systemic HIV challenge resulted in 104−105 copies/mL of viral RNA in blood by week 4 post-infection, as well as vaginal shedding of virus. Subsequent gonococcal challenge resulted in unchanged plasma HIV levels but higher viral shedding in the genital tract, which reflects published clinical observations. Thus, human CD34+ stem cell-transplanted NSG mice represent an experimentally tractable animal model in which to study HIV shedding during gonococcal co-infection, allowing dissection of molecular and immunological interactions between these pathogens, and providing a platform to assess future therapeutics aimed at reducing HIV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2784566327,"Cytology is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method used for pre-operative diagnosis of canine mammary tumors (CMTs) in veterinary practice. Studies related to human breast cancer showed the Robinson’s grading system—established for invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC, NOS) and used on cytological material—to not only closely correspond to the histopathological grading but also be helpful in assessing prognosis and selecting most suitable treatments before surgery. The objectives of this study were: to evaluate the accuracy of cytological diagnosis and cytological Robinson’s grading system compared to the histopathological examination of CMTs; to compare of cytological features and cytomorphometric parameters with tumor behavior, as well as cytological and histological grading; and to determine an association of the Robinson’s grading system and cytological background details with metastases, and patients’ survival. We report substantial diagnostic accuracy in detecting simple types and high grade tumors. Cytological diagnosis of tumor behavior showed relatively low sensitivity and specificity compared to human studies, and this might be caused by the heterogeneous morphology of CMTs. The presence of mucosecretory material and extracellular matrix was not significantly associated with tumor behavior. We report a positive correlation between both grading systems and cytological features (included in Robinson’s grading), the presence of necrotic debris, inflammation, and red blood cells. A negative correlation was determined only for the presence of extracellular matrix. The univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed a significantly higher risk of developing metastasis and shorter overall survival for dogs with tumors of grade 2 or 3 on cytology. In addition, these tumors were the most common cause of CMT-related deaths in dogs. Taken together, our findings suggest that the Robinson’s method of cytological grading applied for malignant CMTs evaluated in cytological smears regardless of tumor type can be adapted to veterinary cytology. Additionally, some background features seem to aid malignancy assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2784878047,"Background Children exposed to family poverty have been found to have higher morbidity and mortality rates, poorer mental health and cognitive outcomes and reduced life chances across a wide range of life domains. There is, however, very little known about the extent to which poverty is experienced by children over their early life course, particularly in community samples. This study tracks changes in family poverty and the main factors that predict family poverty (adverse life experiences) over a 30-year period since the birth of the study child. Methods Data are from a prospective, longitudinal, birth cohort study conducted in Brisbane, Australia. Consecutive families were recruited at the mothers’ first obstetrical visit at one of two major obstetrical hospitals in Brisbane. Data are available for 2087 families with complete data at the 30-year follow-up. Poverty was measured using family income at each time point (adjusted for inflation). Findings Poverty affects about 20% of families at any time point. It is common for families to move in and out of poverty, as their circumstances are affected by such adversities as unemployment and marital breakdown. Over the period of the study about half the families in the study experienced poverty on at least one occasion. Only a very small minority of families experienced persistent poverty over the 30-year duration of the study. Logistic regressions with time lag show that family poverty predicts subsequent adversities and adverse events predict subsequent poverty. Conclusions Experiences of poverty and adversity are common and may vary greatly over the child’s early life course. In assessing the health consequences of poverty, it is important to distinguish the timing and chronicity of early life course experiences of poverty and adversity."
https://openalex.org/W2785008467,"Poorly water-soluble and photosensitive pesticide compounds are difficult to formulate as solvent-free nanoformulations with high efficacy. A avermectin solid nanodispersion with a mean particle size of 188 nm was developed by microprecipitation and lyophilisation techniques. The suspensibility and wetting time of the solid nanodispersion in water were 99.8% and 13 s, respectively, superior to those of conventional water dispersible granules and wettable powders. The anti-photolysis performance of the nanoformulation was twice that of the technical material, and the biological activity against diamondback moths was more than 1.5 times that of the conventional solid formulations while taking LC 50 as the evaluation index. Moreover, the formulation composition substantially decreased the surfactant content and avoided organic solvents. Microprecipitation combined with lyophilisation is an easy and promising method to construct solid nanoformulations for pesticides with poor water solubility and environmental sensitivity. The application of the highly effective solid nanodispersion in crop production will have a great potential in reducing chemical residues and environmental pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2790241067,"Taste and smell alterations have been recognized as common symptoms in relation to various cancers. However, previous research suggests that patients do not receive sufficient support in managing taste and smell alterations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate how persons with experience from lung cancer-related taste and smell alterations reason about resources and strategies offered and used to manage these symptoms. Data from semi-structured individual interviews with 13 women and four men were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. We used Kleinman's now classic medical anthropological model of local health care systems, consisting of the personal, professional, and folk sector, to interpret and understand how people respond to sickness experiences in their daily lives. By presenting the findings using this model, we demonstrate that most strategies for dealing with taste and smell alterations were undertaken in the personal sector, i.e. in participants' daily lives, on an individual level and in interaction with family, social networks and communities. Taste and smell alterations implied two overarching challenges: 1) adjusting to no longer being able to trust information provided by one's own senses of taste and/or smell, and 2) coming to terms with taste and smell alterations as a part of having lung cancer. Health care professionals' involvement was described as limited, but appeared to fulfil most participants' expectations. However, through provision of normalizing information, practical advice, and to some extent, emotional support, health care professionals had potential to influence strategies and resources used for dealing with taste and smell alterations. With this study, we further the understanding of how people deal with lung cancer-related taste and smell alterations and discuss the role of health care professionals for this process."
https://openalex.org/W2792529603,"Pteropus poliocephalus (grey-headed flying foxes) are recognised vectors for a range of potentially fatal human pathogens. However, to date research has primarily focused on viral disease carriage, overlooking bacterial pathogens, which also represent a significant human disease risk. The current study applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, community analysis and a multi-tiered database OTU picking approach to identify faecal-derived zoonotic bacteria within two colonies of P. poliocephalus from Victoria, Australia. Our data show that sequences associated with Enterobacteriaceae (62.8% ± 24.7%), Pasteurellaceae (19.9% ± 25.7%) and Moraxellaceae (9.4% ± 11.8%) dominate flying fox faeces. Further colony specific differences in bacterial faecal colonisation patterns were also identified. In total, 34 potential pathogens, representing 15 genera, were identified. However, species level definition was only possible for Clostridium perfringens, which likely represents a low infectious risk due to the low proportion observed within the faeces and high infectious dose required for transmission. In contrast, sequences associated with other pathogenic species clusters such as Haemophilus haemolyticus-H. influenzae and Salmonella bongori-S. enterica, were present at high proportions in the faeces, and due to their relatively low infectious doses and modes of transmissions, represent a greater potential human disease risk. These analyses of the microbial community composition of Pteropus poliocephalus have significantly advanced our understanding of the potential bacterial disease risk associated with flying foxes and should direct future epidemiological and quantitative microbial risk assessments to further define the health risks presented by these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2784715417,"Spontaneous echo-contrast (SEC) and thrombus observed in trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is known as a strong surrogate marker for future risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL). The efficacy of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) compared to warfarin to prevent SEC or thrombus in patients with AF or AFL is currently unknown. AF or AFL patients who underwent direct current cardioversion (DCCV) and pre-DCCV TEE evaluation from January 2014 to October 2016 in a single center were analyzed. The prevalence of SEC and thrombus were compared between patients who received NOAC and those who took warfarin. NOAC included direct thrombin inhibitor and factor Xa inhibitors. Among 1,050 patients who were considered for DCCV, 424 patients anticoagulated with warfarin or NOAC underwent TEE prior to DCCV. Eighty patients who were anticoagulated for less than 21 days were excluded. Finally, 344 patients were included for the analysis (180 warfarin users vs. 164 NOAC users). No significant difference in the prevalence of SEC (44.4% vs. 43.9%; p = 0.919), dense SEC (13.9% vs. 15.2%; p = 0.722), or thrombus (2.2% vs. 4.3%; p = 0.281) was observed between the warfarin group and the NOAC group. In multivariate analysis, there was no association between NOAC and risk of SEC (odds ratio [OR]: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.796–2.297, p = 0.265) or thrombus (OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 0.726–16.039, p = 0.120). In conclusion, effectiveness of NOAC is comparable to warfarin in preventing SEC and thrombus in patients with AF or AFL undergoing DCCV. However, numerical increase in the prevalence of thrombus in NOAC group warrants further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2789624824,"Increasing temperature and nitrogen (N) deposition are two large-scale changes projected to occur over the coming decades. The effects of these changes on dissolved organic matter (DOM) are largely unknown. This study aimed to assess the effects of warming and N addition on the quantity and quality of DOM from a subtropical Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation. Between 2014 and 2016, soil solutions were collected from 0–15, 15–30, and 30–60 cm depths by using a negative pressure sampling method. The quantity and quality of DOM were measured under six different treatments. The spectra showed that the DOM of the forest soil solution mainly consisted of aromatic protein-like components, microbial degradation products, and negligible amounts of humic-like substances. Warming, N addition, and warming + N addition significantly inhibited the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the surface (0–15 cm) soil solution. Our results suggested that warming reduced the amount of DOM originating from microbes. The decrease in protein and carboxylic acid contents was mostly attributed to the reduction of DOC following N addition. The warming + N addition treatment showed an interactive effect rather than an additive effect. Thus, short-term warming and warming + N addition decreased the quantity of DOM and facilitated the migration of nutrients to deeper soils. Further, N addition increased the complexity of the DOM structure. Hence, the loss of soil nutrients and the rational application of N need to be considered in order to prevent the accumulation of N compounds in soil."
https://openalex.org/W2790884176,"Background β-cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) when expanded in monolayer culture and give rise to highly proliferative mesenchymal cells that retain the potential to re-differentiate into insulin-producing cells. Objective To investigate whether EMT takes place in the endocrine non-β cells of human islets. Methodology Human islets isolated from 12 multiorgan donors were dissociated into single cells, purified by magnetic cell sorting, and cultured in monolayer. Results Co-expression of insulin and the mesenchymal marker vimentin was identified within the first passage (p1) and increased subsequently (insulin+vimentin+ 7.2±6% at p1; 43±15% at p4). The endocrine non-β-cells did also co-express vimentin (glucagon+vimentin+ 59±1.5% and 93±6%, somatostatin+vimentin+ 16±9.4% and 90±10% at p1 and p4 respectively; PP+vimentin+ 74±14% at p1; 88±12% at p2). The percentage of cells expressing only endocrine markers was progressively reduced (0.6±0.2% insulin+, 0.2±0.1% glucagon+, and 0.3±0.2% somatostatin+ cells at p4, and 0.7±0.3% PP+ cells at p2. Changes in gene expression were also indicated of EMT, with reduced expression of endocrine markers and the epithelial marker CDH-1 (p<0.01), and increased expression of mesenchymal markers (CDH-2, SNAI2, ZEB1, ZEB2, VIM, NT5E and ACTA2; p<0.05). Treatment with the EMT inhibitor A83-01 significantly reduced the percentage of co-expressing cells and preserved the expression of endocrine markers. Conclusions In adult human islets, all four endocrine islet cell types undergo EMT when islet cells are expanded in monolayer conditions. The presence of EMT in all islet endocrine cells could be relevant to design of strategies aiming to re-differentiate the expanded islet cells towards a β-cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2785970748,"For adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy of tumor-reactive T cells, an effective therapeutic outcome depends upon cell dose, cell expansion in vivo through a minimally differentiated phenotype, long term persistence, and strong cytolytic effector function. An incomplete understanding of the biological coupling between T cell expansion, differentiation, and response to stimulation hinders the co-optimization of these factors. We report on a biophysical investigation of how the short-term kinetics of T cell functional activation, through molecular stimulation and cell-cell interactions, competes with phenotype differentiation. T cells receive molecular stimulation for a few minutes to a few hours in bulk culture. Following this priming period, the cells are then analyzed at the transcriptional level, or isolated as single cells, with continuing molecular stimulation, within microchambers for analysis via 11-plex secreted protein assays. We resolve a rapid feedback mechanism, promoted by T cell—T cell contact interactions, which strongly amplifies T cell functional performance while yielding only minimal phenotype differentiation. When tested in mouse models of ACT, optimally primed T cells lead to complete tumor eradication. A similar kinetic process is identified in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells collected from a patient with metastatic melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2790560671,"The effects of supplementation of arginine-silicate-inositol complex (ASI; 49.5-8.2-25 g/kg, respectively) to laying hens were investigated with respect to eggshell quality, calcium (Ca) balance, and expression of duodenal proteins related to Ca metabolism (calbindin and tight junction proteins). A total of 360 laying hens, 25 weeks old, were divided into 3 groups consisting of 6 replicate of cages, 20 birds per cage. The groups were fed a basal diet and the basal diet supplemented with 500 or 1000 mg ASI complex per kilogram for 90 days. Data were analyzed by ANCOVA using data during the first week of the adaptation period as covariates. As the ASI complex supplementation level increased, there were increases in feed intake (P < 0.0001), egg production (P < 0.001), egg weight (P < 0.0001) and eggshell weight (P < 0.001) weight, and shell thickness (P < 0.001) and decreases in feed conversion ratio and cracked egg percentage (P < 0.0001 for both). Concentrations of serum osteocalcin (P < 0.0001), vitamin D (P < 0.0001), calcium (P < 0.001), phosphorus (P < 0.001), and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.008) as well as amounts of calcium retention (P < 0.0001) and eggshell calcium deposition (P < 0.001), and Ca balance (P < 0.0001) increased, whereas amount of calcium excretion (P < 0.001) decreased linearly in a dose-dependent manner. The ASI complex supplementation increased expressions of calcium transporters (calbindin-D28k, N sodium-calcium exchanger, plasma membrane calcium ATPase, and vitamin D receptor) and tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin) in the duodenum in a linear fashion (P < 0.0001 for all). In conclusion, provision of dietary ASI complex to laying hens during the peak laying period improved eggshell quality through improving calcium utilization as reflected by upregulation of genes related to the calcium metabolism. Further studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of each of the ASI complex ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W2791010296,"Sarcoglycanopathies are rare autosomic limb girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in one of the genes coding for sarcoglycan (α, β, δ, and γ-sarcoglycans). Sarcoglycans form a complex, which is an important part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex that protects sarcolemma against muscle contraction-induced damages. Absence of one of the sarcoglycan at the plasma membrane induces the disappearance of the whole complex and perturbs muscle fiber membrane integrity. We previously demonstrated that point mutations in the human sarcoglycan genes affects the folding of the corresponding protein, which is then retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein quality control and prematurely degraded by the proteasome. Interestingly, modulation of the quality control using pharmacological compounds allowed the rescue of the membrane localization of the mutated sarcoglycan. Two previously generated mouse models, knock-in for the most common sarcoglycan mutant, R77C α-sarcoglycan, failed in reproducing the dystrophic phenotype observed in human patients. Based on these results and the need to test therapies for these fatal diseases, we decided to generate a new knock-in mouse model carrying the missense mutation T151R in the β-sarcoglycan gene since this is the second sarcoglycan protein with the most frequently reported missense mutations. Muscle analysis, performed at the age of 4 and 9-months, showed the presence of the mutated β-sarcoglycan protein and of the other components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex at the muscle membrane. In addition, these mice did not develop a dystrophic phenotype, even at a late stage or in condition of stress-inducing exercise. We can speculate that the absence of phenotype in mouse may be due to a higher tolerance of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control for amino-acid changes in mice compared to human."
https://openalex.org/W2785016326,"The role of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the transmission of HIV-1 has not been extensively studied. Here, we investigated the association of KIR gene content polymorphisms with perinatal HIV-1 transmission. The KIR gene family comprising 16 genes was genotyped in 313 HIV-1 positive Kenyan mothers paired with their infants. Gene content polymorphisms were presented as presence of individual KIR genes, haplotypes, genotypes and KIR gene concordance. The genetic data were analyzed for associations with perinatal transmission of HIV. There was no association of infant KIR genes with perinatal HIV-1 transmission. After adjustment for gravidity, viral load, and CD4 cell count, there was evidence of an association between reduction in perinatal HIV-1 transmission and the maternal individual KIR genes KIR2DL2 (adjusted OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.24-1.02, P = 0.06), KIR2DL5 (adjusted OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23-0.95, P = 0.04) and KIR2DS5 (adjusted OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.80, P = 0.01). Furthermore, these maternal KIR genes were only significantly associated with reduction in perinatal HIV transmission in women with CD4 cell count ≥ 350 cells/ μl and viral load <10000 copies/ml. Concordance analysis showed that when both mother and child had KIR2DS2, there was less likelihood of perinatal HIV-1 transmission (adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20-0.96, P = 0.039). In conclusion, the maternal KIR genes KIR2DL2, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS5, and KIR2DS2 were associated with reduction of HIV-1 transmission from mother to child. Furthermore, maternal immune status is an important factor in the association of KIR with perinatal HIV transmission."

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of sleep characteristics in the MetS (index and factors) in Spanish children. Cross-sectional study including a sample of 210 children aged 8-to-11-years belonging to 20 schools from the province of Cuenca, Spain was conducted. Cardiometabolic risk and actigraphy sleep patterns were determined and analysed using correlation coefficients, ANCOVA models and a propensity score derivation model. Overall, children in the lower time in bed category and those who went to bed later (> 23:15h) showed worse values in the cardiometabolic profile and risk index. Differences were observed when the total time in bed was below 9h 15mins. Our study shows that short sleep duration could be a risk factor for cardiometabolic risk in children, and bedtime may independently influence this risk. In addition, our data suggests that children's sleep hygiene should be incorporated in parenting educational programs."
https://openalex.org/W2784430290,"The high-affinity interaction between biotin and streptavidin has opened avenues for using recombinant proteins with site-specific biotinylation to achieve efficient and directional immobilization. The site-specific biotinylation of proteins carrying a 15 amino acid long Biotin Acceptor Peptide tag (BAP; also known as AviTag) is effected on a specific lysine either by co-expressing the E. coli BirA enzyme in vivo or by using purified recombinant E. coli BirA enzyme in the presence of ATP and biotin in vitro. In this paper, we have designed a T7 promoter-lac operator-based expression vector for rapid and efficient cloning, and high-level cytosolic expression of proteins carrying a C-terminal BAP tag in E. coli with TEV protease cleavable N-terminal deca-histidine tag, useful for initial purification. Furthermore, a robust three-step purification pipeline integrated with well-optimized protocols for TEV protease-based H10 tag removal, and recombinant BirA enzyme-based site-specific in vitro biotinylation is described to obtain highly pure biotinylated proteins. Most importantly, the paper demonstrates superior sensitivities in indirect ELISA with directional and efficient immobilization of biotin-tagged proteins on streptavidin-coated surfaces in comparison to passive immobilization. The use of biotin-tagged proteins through specific immobilization also allows more efficient selection of binders from a phage-displayed naïve antibody library. In addition, for both these applications, specific immobilization requires much less amount of protein as compared to passive immobilization and can be easily multiplexed. The simplified strategy described here for the production of highly pure biotin-tagged proteins will find use in numerous applications, including those, which may require immobilization of multiple proteins simultaneously on a solid surface."

Here, using FTIR difference spectroscopy and a dual pH/peptide titration assay, we show that rhodopsin maintains certain flexibility upon binding the “finger loop” of visual arrestin (prepared as synthetic peptide ArrFL-1). We found that two distinct complexes can be stabilized depending on the protonation state of E3.49 in the conserved (D)ERY motif. Both complexes exhibit different interaction modes and affinities of ArrFL-1 binding. The plasticity of the receptor within the rhodopsin/ArrFL-1 complex stands in contrast to the complex with the C terminus of the Gt α-subunit (GαCT), which stabilizes only one specific substate out of the conformational ensemble. However, Gt α-subunit binding and both ArrFL-1–binding modes involve a direct interaction to conserved R3.50, as determined by site-directed mutagenesis. Our findings highlight the importance of receptor conformational flexibility and cytoplasmic proton uptake for modulation of rhodopsin signaling and thereby extend the picture provided by crystal structures of the rhodopsin/arrestin and rhodopsin/ArrFL-1 complexes. Furthermore, the two binding modes of ArrFL-1 identified here involve motifs of conserved amino acids, which indicates that our results may have elucidated a common modulation mechanism of class A GPCR–G protein/-arrestin signaling.

Unlike other class A G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein–coupled receptorTMtransmembrane helixPBSpeptide-binding spectra. the photoreceptor rhodopsin contains the light-sensitive cofactor retinal as a ligand, which is covalently bound to the opsin apoprotein. Upon light-induced cis/trans isomerization of retinal and subsequent alterations within the binding pocket, the signal propagates via GPCR-conserved interhelical networks toward the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor, where major structural rearrangements take place. The most prominent structural change is the rotational outward tilt of transmembrane helix (TM) 6, which opens a cytoplasmic binding crevice and thus constitutes the main prerequisite for binding and activation of signaling via the G protein transducin (1Farrens D.L.

On the receptor side, substituted M6.40Y forms a stable hydrogen bond to highly conserved R3.50 (3.1 Å), resulting in the strong constitutive activity observed for this mutant (13Han M. Smith S.O.

Interestingly, this hydrogen bond stabilizes the R3.50 side chain in a conformer too far away from highly conserved Y5.58 to make a direct interaction (3.9 Å).

Further examination of the structure suggests that the changed hydrogen bond network, because of the activating M6.40Y mutation, prevents the R3.50 guanidinium group from forming intermolecular bonds with the arrestin finger loop. However, the interaction between R3.50 and the finger loop is present in the crystal structure of native light-activated rhodopsin in complex with the arrestin finger loop peptide ArrFL-1 (Fig. 1B). In this crystal structure, distances are such that two strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between R3.50-G75 (2.7 Å) and the backbones of K8.48-G76 (3.0 Å) are formed, and also an additional intramolecular R3.50-Y5.58 (3.2 Å) bond is within range of hydrogen bonding (17Szczepek M.

In addition to the perturbation which might be introduced by stabilizing inserts or mutations, crystal structures represent only a single low energy conformation stabilized by the crystal lattice.

In the case of light-activated rhodopsin, the agonist-bound equilibrium conformations have been identified as “Metarhodopsin” states, each characterized by a specific arrangement of crucial amino acids and their connecting hydrogen bond networks. These “microswitches” (21Fahmy K. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. Photoactivated state of rhodopsin and how it can form.Biophys.

The agonist-bound receptor conformations are either active (R*) or inactive (R) conformations referring to whether or not TM6 outward tilt has occurred. Final proton uptake at the open binding crevice neutralizes E3.49 from the conserved (D)ERY motif (22Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P.

In the present study, we employ a dual pH/peptide titration assay, site-directed mutagenesis, and FTIR double difference spectroscopy to answer the following questions on arrestin-receptor interaction: (i) Which of the receptor conformations shown in Scheme 1 interact with the arrestin finger loop, and do the resulting protein complexes exhibit distinct binding modes? (ii) To what extent is R3.50 involved in binding the finger loop? This is of special interest because R3.50 is one of the highest conserved amino acids within the class A of GPCRs and its mutation is known to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (26Min K.C.

(iii) Finally, we hope to resolve the conflicting pictures of the rhodopsin/finger loop–binding interface provided by X-ray crystallographic studies (Fig. 1). Full-length arrestins are known to undergo substantial conformational changes upon binding to the active receptor (8Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Kinetics, binding constant, and activation energy of the 48-kDa protein-rhodopsin complex by extra-metarhodopsin II.Biochemistry. 1989; 28 (2719933): 1770-177510.1021/bi00430a052Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Scheerer P.

Such changes interfere with identifying receptor changes when monitored by FTIR spectroscopy, making unambiguous band assignments challenging (30Beyrière F. Sommer M.E. Szczepek M. Bartl F.J.

Therefore, to allow more straightforward and unambiguous interpretation of our data, we made use of ArrFL-1, a synthetic peptide derived from the finger loop of arrestin-1 (rod visual arrestin, 67YGQEDIDVMGL77) (31Feuerstein S.E. Pulvermüller A. Hartmann R. Granzin J. Stoldt M. Henklein P. Ernst O.P. Heck M. Willbold D. Koenig B.W.

The finger loop constitutes the key interaction site of arrestins with their cognate GPCRs (32Pulvermüller A. Schroder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. Interactions of metarhodopsin II. Arrestin peptides compete with arrestin and transducin.J. Biol.

Beyrière F. Hofmann K.P. Elgeti M. Kazmin R. Rose A. Bartl F.J. von Stetten D. Heck M. Sommer M.E. Hildebrand P.W. Scheerer P.

This makes ArrFL-1 a robust and powerful tool to investigate binding of the arrestin finger loop to rhodopsin. In Fig. 2A, normalized FTIR difference spectra of native rhodopsin in urea-washed membranes are shown. The difference spectra were calculated from spectra recorded before and after photoactivation at pH values between 6.0 and 9.1. From such difference spectra, fingerprints of active and inactive receptor conformations can be derived (33Siebert F. Application of FTIR spectroscopy to the investigation of dark structures and photoreactions of visual pigments.Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-32310.1002/ijch.199500033Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A good measure of the amount of active species is the positive difference band at 1744 cm−1, which has been assigned to the reorganization of a hydrogen bond network connecting TM3 and TM5 occurring during receptor activation (34Beck M. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Spectroscopic evidence for interaction between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 in rhodopsin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9585578): 7630-763910.1021/bi9801560Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The intensity increase at this frequency as the pH is lowered indicates that the active conformation is stabilized by proton uptake and formation of R*H+ (cf. Scheme 1). A plot of the normalized intensity change at 1744 cm−1 versus pH is shown in Fig. 2C (θ(1744 cm−1), blue symbols). At pH 6 the receptor molecules are quantitatively present in the protonated active conformation (R*H+). Receptor deprotonation, occurring with an apparent pKa of 7.5, releases the receptor into an equilibrium between R and R* states (24Mahalingam M. Martínez-Mayorga K. Brown M.F. Vogel R. Two protonation switches control rhodopsin activation in membranes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105 (18997017): 17795-1780010.1073/pnas.0804541105Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At the alkaline end point of the titration (approx. pH 9) about 35% of light-activated rhodopsin exists in the deprotonated conformation (R*), whereas the remaining 65% exists as inactive R. It is important to emphasize that proton uptake is not the cause for TM6 outward movement but is instead its consequence (35Knierim B. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. Hubbell W.L. Sequence of late molecular events in the activation of rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hence formation of the cytoplasmic binding crevice for G protein and arrestin interaction occurs already in R*, although catalytic activity toward the G protein requires the fully accomplished binding site of the protonated R*H+ state (37Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Regulation of the rhodopsin-transducin interaction by a highly conserved carboxylic acid group.Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (8343512): 7229-723610.1021/bi00079a020Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A finding which is in agreement with the C-terminal peptide of the Gt α-subunit stabilizing exclusively the protonated R*H+ conformation (38Elgeti M. Rose A.S. Bartl F.J. Hildebrand P.W. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. Precision vs flexibility in GPCR signaling.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23883288): 12305-1231210.1021/ja405133kCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mm ArrFL-1 peptide, several additional bands appear in the difference spectrum which reflect binding-induced structural changes in both binding partners, as well as newly formed specific interactions between them (Fig. 2B). Additionally, binding of ArrFL-1 peptide leads to a pronounced stabilization of the active conformations as indicated by the overall more consistent intensity of FTIR difference bands in the amide regions (amide I around 1650 cm−1, amide II around 1550 cm−1) and above 1700 cm−1 (protonated side chain carboxyls), even at high pH. Evaluation of θ values at 1744 cm−1 reveals a slight upshift of the apparent pKa and a significant increase of the alkaline end point level, i.e. the amount of the deprotonated active conformation R* (Fig. 2C, green). This trend is clearly dependent on the ArrFL-1 concentration: At 20 mm ArrFL-1 the apparent pKa is around 8.1 and the alkaline end point level is approximately 70% (Fig. 2C, magenta). To globally evaluate the stabilizing effect of increasing peptide concentration on the equilibria of receptor species and to determine the ArrFL-1 binding constants to the R* and R*H+ conformations we extended Scheme 1 by two more receptor species representing the ArrFL-1 interacting conformations (Scheme 2). The connecting equilibrium constants and respective binding affinities to R* and R*H+ can be deduced from a global fit of this model to all data points in Fig. 2C (colored lines) (see “Experimental Procedures” or Ref. 38Elgeti M. Rose A.S. Bartl F.J. Hildebrand P.W. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. Precision vs flexibility in GPCR signaling.J. Am. Chem.

The calculated binding constants for ArrFL-1 binding to the two active receptor conformations R* and R*H+ are KD (R*) = K3 = 6 ± 1 mm and KD (R*H+) = a· K3 =3 ± 2 mm, respectively (compare KD = 350 μm for the Gα C-terminal peptide GαCT (38Elgeti M.

ArrFL-1 binding leads to the occurrence of additional difference bands overlapping those reflecting receptor activation (e.g. the positive band at 1659 cm−1) (Fig. 2B). To be able to directly compare the modes of interaction between the arrestin finger loop and the deprotonated or protonated receptor species (R*·ArrFL-1 and R*H+·ArrFL-1), we calculated the so-called peptide-binding spectra (PBS), which have been used repeatedly to characterize conformational changes and new molecular interactions formed because of peptide binding (38Elgeti M.

FTIR difference spectra were measured in the presence and absence of 20 mm ArrFL-1 peptide (Δ(w/ ArrFL-1) and Δ(w/o ArrFL-1), gray and black lines in Figure 3, Figure 4, respectively).

Here, we report that a Darier disease (DD) mutation of SERCA2b that changes a glutamate to a lysine in the cytoplasmic loop between TM8 and TM9 (E917K) relieves these kinetic constraints. We analyzed the effects of this mutation on the overall reaction and the individual partial reactions of the Ca2+ pump compared with the corresponding mutations of the SERCA2a and SERCA1a isoforms, lacking the SERCA2b tail. In addition to a reduced affinity for Ca2+, caused by the mutation in all three isoforms examined, we observed a unique enhancing effect on the turnover rates of ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport for the SERCA2b E917K mutation. This relief of kinetic constraints contrasted with inhibitory effects observed for the corresponding SERCA2a and SERCA1a (E918K) mutations. These observations indicated that the E917K/E918K mutations affect the rate-limiting conformational change in isoform-specific ways and that the SERCA2b mutation perturbs the interactions of TM11 with other SERCA2b regions. Mutational analysis of an arginine in TM7 that interacts with the glutamate in SERCA1a crystal structures suggested that in wildtype SERCA2b, the corresponding arginine (Arg-835) may be involved in mediating the conformational restriction by TM11. Moreover, the E917K mutation may disturb TM11 through the cytoplasmic loop between TM10 and TM11.

P-type ATPases are generally made up of three cytoplasmic domains: P (phosphorylation domain, contains the phosphorylated aspartic acid residue); N (nucleotide-binding domain), and A (actuator domain). The transmembrane sector consists of 6–12 helical segments, whose movements, leading to substrate translocation across the membrane, are coupled with the movements of the cytoplasmic domains, resulting in a coordinated ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation (4Toyoshima C.

We unexpectedly found this mutation to relieve the kinetic constraints normally imposed by the SERCA2b tail. To understand the role of the SERCA2b tail in the functional effects of the SERCA2b E917K mutation, we replaced the corresponding residue in SERCA2a (E917K) and SERCA1a (E918K and E918A), which do not possess the tail characteristic of SERCA2b. Furthermore, we studied the effects of alanine mutations of Arg-835 in SERCA2a/2b and Arg-836 in SERCA1a, as this arginine residue, located in TM7, interacts with Glu-918 in the crystal structures of SERCA1a. The results demonstrate the importance of both Glu-917 and Arg-835 of SERCA2b in mediating the kinetic effects of the SERCA2b tail.

ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport measurements presented below were corrected for expression level by calculating the turnover rates (molecular rates, i.e. rate of ATP hydrolysis or Ca2+ transport per active enzyme).

This difference between the wildtypes illustrates the kinetic constraints imposed on SERCA2b by its tail. Unexpectedly, the present results with the mutants revealed that the maximal turnover rate of the ATPase activity of DD mutant SERCA2b E917K is 1.3-fold higher than that of the SERCA2b wildtype, whereas the corresponding SERCA1a E918K mutant showed a significant 1.6-fold reduction of the maximal turnover rate of ATPase activity relative to wildtype SERCA1a. A similar difference between the effects of the corresponding mutations in SERCA2b and SERCA1a was noted for the turnover rate of Ca2+ transport, being 1.5-fold enhanced for E917K in SERCA2b and reduced as much as 2.5-fold for E918K in SERCA1a, relative to the corresponding wildtype (Table 1). Thus, the inhibition of the SERCA2b wildtype relative to the SERCA1a wildtype is relieved by the E917K mutation in SERCA2b. A relation of this finding to the presence of the SERCA2b tail (TM11 plus LE) was revealed by the data obtained with the SERCA2a E917K mutant and wildtype, which do not possess the SERCA2b tail but are otherwise identical to mutant and wildtype SERCA2b. In the SERCA2a protein environment, the mutation was inhibitory similar to the finding with SERCA1a, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 1 and Table 1), thus indicating that the activation seen for SERCA2b E917K is the consequence of a change of the interaction of the SERCA2b tail, relieving its inhibitory influence.Table 1Expression and characteristics of the overall ATPase and Ca2+ transport reactionsExpressionaExpression levels (shown relative to the corresponding wildtype) were determined by measuring the level of phosphorylation under stoichiometric conditions (see “Experimental procedures”).nTurnover ATPasebMaximal turnover rate of ATPase activity (mol of phosphate liberated/s/mol of enzyme expressed).nTurnover Ca2+ uptakecMaximal turnover rate of Ca2+ transport (mol of Ca2+ taken up in microsomes/min/mol of enzyme expressed).

https://openalex.org/W2790642738,"To optimize ecosystem services provided by agricultural drainage networks (ditches) in headwater catchments, we need to manage the spatial distribution of plant species living in these networks. Geomorphological variables have been shown to be important predictors of plant distribution in other ecosystems because they control the water regime, the sediment deposition rates and the sun exposure in the ditches. Whether such variables may be used to predict plant distribution in agricultural drainage networks is unknown. We collected presence and absence data for 10 herbaceous plant species in a subset of a network of drainage ditches (35 km long) within a Mediterranean agricultural catchment. We simulated their spatial distribution with GLM and Maxent model using geomorphological variables and distance to natural lands and roads. Models were validated using k-fold cross-validation. We then compared the mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) values obtained for each model and other metrics issued from the confusion matrices between observed and predicted variables. Based on the results of all metrics, the models were efficient at predicting the distribution of seven species out of ten, confirming the relevance of geomorphological variables and distance to natural lands and roads to explain the occurrence of plant species in this Mediterranean catchment. In particular, the importance of the landscape geomorphological variables, ie the importance of the geomorphological features encompassing a broad environment around the ditch, has been highlighted. This suggests that agro-ecological measures for managing ecosystem services provided by ditch plants should focus on the control of the hydrological and sedimentological connectivity at the catchment scale. For example, the density of the ditch network could be modified or the spatial distribution of vegetative filter strips used for sediment trapping could be optimized. In addition, the vegetative filter strips could constitute new seed bank sources for species that are affected by the distance to natural lands and roads."

Understanding these elements of disadvantage is vital in understanding population obesity trends and the development of effective and equitable interventions. This study examined the relationship between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and geographic remoteness with prospective trends in mean body mass index (BMI) among immigrants to Australia. Longitudinal data (2006–2014) from a national panel survey of Australian adults was divided into an immigrant-only sample (n = 4,293, 52.6% women and 19,404 person-year observations). The data were analysed using multi-level random effects linear regression modelling that controlled for individual socioeconomic and demographic factors. Male immigrants living in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods had significantly higher mean BMI compared with those living in the least disadvantaged. Over time, mean BMI increased for all groups except for men living in the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods, for whom mean BMI remained almost static (0.1 kg/m2 increase from 2006 to 2014), effectively widening neighbourhood inequalities. Among women, mean BMI was also significantly higher in the most compared with the least, disadvantaged neighbourhoods (β = 2.08 kg/m2; 95%CI: 1.48, 2.68). Neighbourhood inequalities were maintained over time as mean BMI increased for all groups at a similar rate. Male and female immigrants residing in outer regional areas had significantly higher mean BMI compared with those living in major cities; however, differences were attenuated and no longer significant following adjustment for ethnicity, individual socioeconomic position and neighbourhood disadvantage. Over time, mean BMI increased in all male and female groups with no differences based on geographic remoteness. Obesity prevention policy targeted at immigrant cohorts needs to include area-level interventions that address inequalities in BMI arising from neighbourhood disadvantage, and be inclusive of immigrants living outside Australia’s major cities."

This study's aim was to evaluate the quality of such services and identify factors affecting service quality from the perspective of well-child health care providers located in China's Hunan Province. To achieve this, a qualitative descriptive method was employed, with 22 well-child health care providers being recruited, using purposive sampling, from among the provinces' government community health centers. The participants completed individual semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 25-30 minutes that were designed to obtain their views on well-child health care administration in the province. Then, the interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. The main finding was that participants felt that the delivery of well-child health care services in Hunan Province is insufficient. Factors they mentioned as negatively affecting the delivery of such services included the region's fragmented primary health care system, inadequate attention to this issue from parents and community health care center managers, and a lack of specialized well-child care knowledge. Thus, currently, well-child health care is not being successfully implemented in Hunan Province; consequently, in order to successfully implement well-child health care in this region, community health care centers should invest more resources and funding, particularly into education programs for well-child health care providers."
https://openalex.org/W2793701628,"Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living (non-symbiotic) eukaryote yet described, is a unicellular green alga of the Prasinophyceae family. It has a very simple cellular organization and presents a unique starch granule and chloroplast. However, its starch metabolism exhibits a complexity comparable to higher plants, with multiple enzyme forms for each metabolic reaction. Glucan phosphatases, a family of enzymes functionally conserved in animals and plants, are essential for normal starch or glycogen degradation in plants and mammals, respectively. Despite the importance of O. tauri microalgae in evolution, there is no information available concerning the enzymes involved in reversible phosphorylation of starch. Here, we report the molecular cloning and heterologous expression of the gene coding for a dual specific phosphatase from O. tauri (OsttaDSP), homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana LSF2. The recombinant enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity to characterize its oligomeric and kinetic properties accurately. OsttaDSP is a homodimer of 54.5 kDa that binds and dephosphorylates amylopectin. Also, we also determined that residue C162 is involved in catalysis and possibly also in structural stability of the enzyme. Our results could contribute to better understand the role of glucan phosphatases in the metabolism of starch in green algae."
https://openalex.org/W2784909683,"Crohn's Disease (CD) in Spain lacks of a unified National Clinical Pathway and not even any early detection program and professional follow-up outpatient attention once it has been diagnosed. Little is known about the Spanish health professionals' views of the experiences of individuals living with Crohn's Disease nationwide and also about how the Spanish Health System faces this situation. A qualitative research method was conducted to explore this topic through in-depth interviews with eleven healthcare professionals, who represented different clinics treating people with CD from the province of Alicante (Spain). Three topics and seven sub-topics were derived from the analysis of the content emerging from the interviews. The three main topics were: the healthcare system as a hindrance for ongoing treatment of CD, the impact of the disease, support networks. The knowledge of CD gained by healthcare professionals, in the contexts studied here within, with regards to the psychosocial aspects and the experience of those living with the disease and their immediate circles, is poor, if not null on an academic level, becoming experiential on their incorporation into the professional field. Additionally, a priori, they lack the tools to address the doubts and concerns of patients from the moment of diagnosis through the ongoing care of the patient. Organizational hindrances, such as the lack of time and consensual guidelines for adequately monitoring CD patients in Alicante (Spain), further restrict the patient-professional relationship. Due to the consensus established by the National Agency regulating the contents of the Health Professions' Education and Training across the country, we are assuming that the phenomenon highlighted may be similar in other parts of Spain. Therefore, it can be said that healthcare professionals have a limited understanding of the impact of CD on the day-to-day life of those affected, not being considered a part of the CD patients' formal support network. Nonetheless, they are conscious of this limitation and advocate for multidisciplinary teams as the best means of attending to people living with CD. Our study outcomes may represent the first step onto identifying strategies and best practices for establishing an effective therapeutic relationship, as well as any hindering factors."

Thresholds or tipping points are commonly used to indicate when populations become vulnerable to extinction and to trigger changes in conservation actions. However, quantitative methods to determine such thresholds have not been well explored. The Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus) was removed from the list of threatened and endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2016 and our objectives were to determine the most appropriate parameters and thresholds for monitoring and management action. Capture mark recapture (CMR) data from 2006 to 2012 were used to estimate population parameters and variances. We used stochastic population simulations and conditional classification trees to identify demographic rates for monitoring that would be most indicative of heighted extinction risk. We then identified thresholds that would be reliable predictors of population viability. Conditional classification trees indicated that annual apparent survival rates for adult females averaged over 5 years () was the best predictor of population persistence. Specifically, population persistence was estimated to be ≥95% over 100 years when , suggesting that this statistic can be used as threshold to trigger management intervention. Our evaluation produced monitoring protocols that reliably predicted population persistence and was cost-effective. We conclude that population projections and conditional classification trees can be valuable tools for identifying extinction thresholds used in monitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W2786747777,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene can reduce function of the CFTR ion channel activity and impair cellular chloride secretion. The gold standard method to assess CFTR function of ion transport using the Ussing chamber requires a high number of airway epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface, limiting the application of this method for high throughput screening of potential therapeutic compounds in primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) featuring less common CFTR mutations. This study assessed an alternative approach, using a small scale halide assay that can be adapted for a personalized high throughput setting to analyze CFTR function of pAEC.Pediatric pAECs derived from children with CF (pAECCF) were established and expanded as monolayer cultures, before seeding into 96-well plates for the halide assay. Cells were then transduced with an adenoviral construct containing yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) reporter gene, alone or in combination with either wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR) or p.Phe508del CFTR. Four days post transduction, cells were stimulated with forskolin and genistein, and assessed for quenching of the eYFP signal following injection of iodide solution into the assay media.Data showed that pAECCF can express eYFP at high efficiency following transduction with the eYFP construct. The halide assay was able to discriminate functional restoration of CFTR in pAECCF treated with either WT-CFTR construct or the positive controls syntaxin 8 and B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 shRNAs.The current study demonstrates that the halide assay can be adapted for pediatric pAECCF to evaluate restoration of CFTR function. With the ongoing development of small molecules to modulate the folding and/or activity of various mutated CFTR proteins, this halide assay presents a small-scale personalized screening platform that could assess therapeutic potential of molecules across a broad range of CFTR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2794241372,"Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies on the optimal level of ART adherence to achieve reliable viral suppression, avert HIV drug resistance, and prevent avoidable deaths. It has been shown that there are various groups of people living with HIV at high-risk of non-adherence to ART in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness and value-of-information of directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) versus self-administered ART among people living with HIV, at high risk of non-adherence to ART in sub-Saharan Africa.A Markov model was developed that describes the transition between HIV stages based on the CD4 count, along with direct costs, quality of life and the mortality rate associated with DAART in comparison with self-administered ART. Data used in the model were derived from the published literature. A health system perspective was employed using a life-time time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of parameter uncertainty. Value of information analysis was also conducted. The expected cost of self-administered ART and DAART were $5,200 and $15,500 and the expected QALYs gained were 8.52 and 9.75 respectively, giving an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8,400 per QALY gained. The analysis demonstrated that the annual cost DAART needs to be priced below $200 per patient to be cost-effective. The probability that DAART was cost-effective was 1% for a willingness to pay threshold of $5,096 for sub-Saharan Africa. The value of information associated with the cost of DAART and its effectiveness was substantial.From the perspective of the health care payer in sub-Saharan Africa, DAART cannot be regarded as cost-effective based on current information. The value of information analysis showed that further research will be worthwhile and potentially cost-effective in resolving the uncertainty about whether or not to adopt DAART."
