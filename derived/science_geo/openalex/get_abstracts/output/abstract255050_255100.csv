https://openalex.org/W2079282879,"Autophagy-related gene (Atg) 5 is a gene product required for the formation of autophagosomes. Here, we report that Atg5, in addition to the promotion of autophagy, enhances susceptibility towards apoptotic stimuli. Enforced expression of Atg5-sensitized tumour cells to anticancer drug treatment both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, silencing the Atg5 gene with short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in partial resistance to chemotherapy. Apoptosis was associated with calpain-mediated Atg5 cleavage, resulting in an amino-terminal cleavage product with a relative molecular mass of 24,000 (Mr 24K). Atg5 cleavage was observed independent of the cell type and the apoptotic stimulus, suggesting that calpain activation and Atg5 cleavage are general phenomena in apoptotic cells. Truncated Atg5 translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria, associated with the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-xL and triggered cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Taken together, calpain-mediated Atg5 cleavage provokes apoptotic cell death, therefore, represents a molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis--a finding with potential importance for clinical anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2098022922,"Protein aggregation is an established pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the initiation of this process in vivo. Intracerebral injection of dilute, amyloid-β (Aβ)–containing brain extracts from humans with Alzheimer's disease or β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice induced cerebral β-amyloidosis and associated pathology in APP transgenic mice in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The seeding activity of brain extracts was reduced or abolished by Aβ immunodepletion, protein denaturation, or by Aβ immunization of the host. The phenotype of the exogenously induced amyloidosis depended on both the host and the source of the agent, suggesting the existence of polymorphic Aβ strains with varying biological activities reminiscent of prion strains."
https://openalex.org/W1977688919,"Although BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein–cleaving enzyme 1) is essential for the generation of amyloid-b peptide in Alzheimer's disease, its physiological function is unclear. We found that very high levels of BACE1 were expressed at time points when peripheral nerves become myelinated. Deficiency of BACE1 resulted in the accumulation of unprocessed neuregulin 1 (NRG1), an axonally expressed factor required for glial cell development and myelination. BACE1 –/– mice displayed hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation of small-diameter afferent fibers, very similar to that seen in mice with mutations in type III NRG1 or Schwann cell–specific ErbB2 knockouts. Thus, BACE1 is required for myelination and correct bundling of axons by Schwann cells, probably through processing of type III NRG1."
https://openalex.org/W1994122295,"Transcription factors (TFs) interact with specific DNA regulatory sequences to control gene expression throughout myriad cellular processes. However, the DNA binding specificities of only a small fraction of TFs are sufficiently characterized to predict the sequences that they can and cannot bind. We present a maximally compact, synthetic DNA sequence design for protein binding microarray (PBM) experiments that represents all possible DNA sequence variants of a given length k (that is, all 'k-mers') on a single, universal microarray. We constructed such all k-mer microarrays covering all 10-base pair (bp) binding sites by converting high-density single-stranded oligonucleotide arrays to double-stranded (ds) DNA arrays. Using these microarrays we comprehensively determined the binding specificities over a full range of affinities for five TFs of different structural classes from yeast, worm, mouse and human. The unbiased coverage of all k-mers permits high-throughput interrogation of binding site preferences, including nucleotide interdependencies, at unprecedented resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2001620437,"Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is one of the best-studied microbially mediated industrial processes because of its ecological and economic relevance. Despite this, it is not well understood at the metabolic level. Here we present a metagenomic analysis of two lab-scale EBPR sludges dominated by the uncultured bacterium, “Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis.” The analysis sheds light on several controversies in EBPR metabolic models and provides hypotheses explaining the dominance of A. phosphatis in this habitat, its lifestyle outside EBPR and probable cultivation requirements. Comparison of the same species from different EBPR sludges highlights recent evolutionary dynamics in the A. phosphatis genome that could be linked to mechanisms for environmental adaptation. In spite of an apparent lack of phylogenetic overlap in the flanking communities of the two sludges studied, common functional themes were found, at least one of them complementary to the inferred metabolism of the dominant organism. The present study provides a much needed blueprint for a systems-level understanding of EBPR and illustrates that metagenomics enables detailed, often novel, insights into even well-studied biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2098282622,"The contribution of bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs) to tumor angiogenesis has been controversial, primarily because of their low numbers in blood vessels of untreated tumors. We show that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) leads to an acute mobilization of CEPs, which home to the viable tumor rim that characteristically remains after such therapy. Disruption of this CEP spike by antiangiogenic drugs or by genetic manipulation resulted in marked reductions in tumor rim size and blood flow as well as enhanced VDA antitumor activity. These findings also provide a mechanistic rationale for the enhanced efficacy of VDAs when combined with antiangiogenic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2090469070,"To resolve the controversy about messengers regulating KCNQ ion channels during phospholipase C–mediated suppression of current, we designed translocatable enzymes that quickly alter the phosphoinositide composition of the plasma membrane after application of a chemical cue. The KCNQ current falls rapidly to zero when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P 2 or PI(4,5)P 2 ] is depleted without changing Ca 2+ , diacylglycerol, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Current rises by 30% when PI(4,5)P 2 is overproduced and does not change when phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is raised. Hence, the depletion of PI(4,5)P 2 suffices to suppress current fully, and other second messengers are not needed. Our approach is ideally suited to study biological signaling networks involving membrane phosphoinositides."

https://openalex.org/W2035287163,"In individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, malignant progenitors in the graft contribute to leukemic relapse, but the mechanisms of homing and engraftment of leukemic CML stem cells are unknown. Here we show that CD44 expression is increased on mouse stem-progenitor cells expressing BCR-ABL and that CD44 contributes functional E-selectin ligands. In a mouse retroviral transplantation model of CML, BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors from CD44-mutant donors are defective in homing to recipient marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and impaired induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease. By contrast, CD44-deficient stem cells transduced with empty retrovirus engraft as efficiently as do wild-type HSCs. CD44 is dispensable for induction of acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia by BCR-ABL, indicating that CD44 is specifically required on leukemic cells that initiate CML. The requirement for donor CD44 is bypassed by direct intrafemoral injection of BCR-ABL1-transduced CD44-deficient stem cells or by coexpression of human CD44. Antibody to CD44 attenuates induction of CML-like leukemia in recipients. These results show that BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic stem cells depend to a greater extent on CD44 for homing and engraftment than do normal HSCs, and argue that CD44 blockade may be beneficial in autologous transplantation in CML."
https://openalex.org/W1967565706,"The glmS ribozyme is the only natural catalytic RNA known to require a small-molecule activator for catalysis. This catalytic RNA functions as a riboswitch, with activator-dependent RNA cleavage regulating glmS messenger RNA expression. We report crystal structures of the glmS ribozyme in precleavage states that are unliganded or bound to the competitive inhibitor glucose-6-phosphate and in the postcleavage state. All structures superimpose closely, revealing a remarkably rigid RNA that contains a preformed active and coenzyme-binding site. Unlike other riboswitches, the glmS ribozyme binds its activator in an open, solvent-accessible pocket. Our structures suggest that the amine group of the glmS ribozyme-bound coenzyme performs general acid-base and electrostatic catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2010257803,"Abnormally synchronized synaptic transmission in the brain causes epilepsy. Most inherited forms of epilepsy result from mutations in ion channels. However, one form of epilepsy, autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF), is characterized by mutations in a secreted neuronal protein, LGI1. We show that ADAM22, a transmembrane protein that when mutated itself causes seizure, serves as a receptor for LGI1. LGI1 enhances AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. The mutated form of LGI1 fails to bind to ADAM22. ADAM22 is anchored to the postsynaptic density by cytoskeletal scaffolds containing stargazin. These studies in rat brain indicate possible avenues for understanding human epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2067218310,"Sleep is a vital, evolutionarily conserved phenomenon, whose function is unclear. Although mounting evidence supports a role for sleep in the consolidation of memories, until now, a molecular connection between sleep, plasticity, and memory formation has been difficult to demonstrate. We establish Drosophila as a model to investigate this relation and demonstrate that the intensity and/or complexity of prior social experience stably modifies sleep need and architecture. Furthermore, this experience-dependent plasticity in sleep need is subserved by the dopaminergic and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate signaling pathways and a particular subset of 17 long-term memory genes."

https://openalex.org/W2055958441,"In mammals, odorant receptors (ORs) direct the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) toward targets in the olfactory bulb. We show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signals that regulate the expression of axon guidance molecules are essential for the OR-instructed axonal projection. Genetic manipulations of ORs, stimulatory G protein, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and cAMP response element–binding protein shifted the axonal projection sites along the anteriorposterior axis in the olfactory bulb. Thus, it is the OR-derived cAMP signals, rather than direct action of OR molecules, that determine the target destinations of OSNs."
https://openalex.org/W1994958501,"Ribozymes are thought to have played a pivotal role in the early evolution of life, but relatively few have been identified in modern organisms. We performed an in vitro selection aimed at isolating self-cleaving RNAs from the human genome. The selection yielded several ribozymes, one of which is a conserved mammalian sequence that resides in an intron of the CPEB3 gene, which belongs to a family of genes regulating messenger RNA polyadenylation. The CPEB3 ribozyme is structurally and biochemically related to the human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozymes. The occurrence of this ribozyme exclusively in mammals suggests that it may have evolved as recently as 200 million years ago. We postulate that HDV arose from the human transcriptome."

https://openalex.org/W1967946076,"Haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolases are a vast superfamily of largely uncharacterized enzymes, with a few members shown to possess phosphatase, β-phosphoglucomutase, phosphonatase, and dehalogenase activities. Using a representative set of 80 phosphorylated substrates, we characterized the substrate specificities of 23 soluble HADs encoded in the Escherichia coli genome. We identified small molecule phosphatase activity in 21 HADs and β-phosphoglucomutase activity in one protein. The E. coli HAD phosphatases show high catalytic efficiency and affinity to a wide range of phosphorylated metabolites that are intermediates of various metabolic reactions. Rather than following the classical “one enzyme-one substrate” model, most of the E. coli HADs show remarkably broad and overlapping substrate spectra. At least 12 reactions catalyzed by HADs currently have no EC numbers assigned in Enzyme Nomenclature. Surprisingly, most HADs hydrolyzed small phosphodonors (acetyl phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, and phosphoramidate), which also serve as substrates for autophosphorylation of the receiver domains of the two-component signal transduction systems. The physiological relevance of the phosphatase activity with the preferred substrate was validated in vivo for one of the HADs, YniC.

Many of the secondary activities of HADs might have no immediate physiological function but could comprise a reservoir for evolution of novel phosphatases. Most enzymes form families of paralogs whose members are related by sequence and catalyze similar reactions but have evolved specific biological functions. Comprehensive determination of the substrate specificities and selectivities of all metabolic enzymes in an organism is an essential step toward understanding the relationship between the proteome and the metabolome. By the most recent estimate, Escherichia coli possesses at least 1186 metabolic enzymes and 1005 metabolites (1Keseler I.M. Collado-Vides J. Gama-Castro S. Ingraham J. Paley S. Paulsen I.T. Peralta-Gil M. Karp P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D334-D337Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The most common functional group in the metabolome is phosphate; 35-40% of the metabolites contain a phosphate group (2Nobeli I. Ponstingl H. Krissinel E.B. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 697-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

The great majority of these proteins have no known biochemical or biological function. In any individual genome, the number of HAD genes can range from 10 to 20 in different bacteria to 100 in humans and 115 in Arabidopsis thaliana (InterPro data base). HADs share little overall sequence similarity (15-30% identity), but they can be unequivocally identified by the presence of three short conserved sequence motifs (3Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Most of the characterized HADs have phosphatase activity (CO-P bond hydrolysis), and several also catalyze dehalogenase (C-halogen bond hydrolysis), phosphonatase (C-P bond hydrolysis), and β-phosphoglucomutase (CO-P bond hydrolysis and intramolecular phosphoryl transfer) reactions (3Koonin E.V.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the vast majority of HADs remains uncharacterized. Since these enzymes generally show little sequence similarity, the catalyzed reaction and, especially, the substrate specificity are hard to predict on the basis of sequence conservation and have to be determined experimentally.The E. coli genome encodes five membrane-bound and 23 soluble HAD-like hydrolases, representing ∼40% of the E. coli proteins with known or predicted small molecule phosphatase activity (1Keseler I.M. Collado-Vides J. Gama-Castro S. Ingraham J. Paley S. Paulsen I.T. Peralta-Gil M. Karp P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D334-D337Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). None of the E. coli HADs is essential for bacterial growth (13Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. Campbell J.W. Balazsi G. Ravasz E. Daugherty M.D. Somera A.L. Kyrpides N.C. Anderson I. Gelfand M.S.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Using a set of 80 representative phosphorylated metabolites, we characterized the substrate specificities of all 23 soluble E. coli HADs and found that they comprise a family of promiscuous phosphatases with overlapping substrate profiles and are capable of hydrolyzing a wide range of phosphorylated metabolites, including carbohydrates, nucleotides, organic acids, coenzymes, and small phosphodonors. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the activity of one of the HADs, YniC, toward its preferred substrate was biologically important. We further show that all E. coli HADs have phosphatase activity against small phosphate donors (acetyl phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, phosphoramidate), which resembles the autophosphorylation reaction catalyzed by CheY fold receiver domains of the two-component regulatory systems. Together with the previously reported structural similarity, these results indicate that the HAD superfamily and the receiver domain originate from an ancestral low specificity phosphatase. Clustering of E. coli HADs on the basis of their phosphatase activities (kcat/Km) was incongruent with the sequence-based phylogeny. Thus, many of the secondary activities of HADs might be of no immediate functional importance but comprise a reservoir for evolution of phosphatases with novel specificities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Cloning and Protein Purification—For most HADs analyzed in this work, the genes were amplified by PCR from the E. coli DH5α genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pET15b (Novagen) as previously described (17Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Several HADs (YbjI, YaeD, and YrbI) were cloned from the E. coli K12 W3110 genomic DNA into the archive vector pCA24N (Genobase data base; available on the World Wide Web at ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp). Purification of proteins for screening and biochemical characterization was performed as previously described (18Kuznetsova E. Proudfoot M. Sanders S.A. Reinking J. Savchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Yakunin A.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 263-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NagD was expressed in an insoluble form and was partially refolded from the inclusion bodies by a buffer exchange method using the Spin-Column Protein Folding Screen kit (SFC01-10) and the column PFC02 from ProFoldin Protein Folding Services according to the manufacturer's instructions (available on the World Wide Web at www.profoldin.com).Enzymatic Screens and Assays—General phosphatase screens with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate and natural substrate phosphatase screens with 80 phosphorylated compounds from Sigma (supplemental Table 1) were performed as previously described (18Kuznetsova E. Proudfoot M. Sanders S.A. Reinking J. Savchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Yakunin A.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 263-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-phosphatase activity was assayed by measuring the acetyl-phosphate concentration using the hydroxylamine protocol of Lipmann and Tuttle (19Lipmann F. Tuttle L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The production of fructose in enzymatic reactions was determined using an enzyme-coupled assay with fructose dehydrogenase (F5152; Sigma), essentially as previously described (20Ameyama M. Shinagawa E. Matsushita K. Adachi O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 814-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay was adapted for 96-well microplates (200-μl reaction mixtures). Haloacid dehalogenase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the release of halide ions using the mercuric thiocyanide method (21Iwasaki I. Utsumi S. Hagino K. Ozawa T. Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1956; 29: 860-864Crossref Google Scholar). The assays were adapted to the 96-well format (125 μl) and contained 50 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.0), 10 mm substrate, and 5 μg of protein. Six compounds were used as substrates (R-chloropropionic acid, S-chloropropionic acid, bromoacetic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 2,2-dichloropropionic acid, and 2-bromopropionic acid), and l-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. YL (22Kurihara T. Liu J.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Phosphonatase activity was assayed using phosphonoacetate as a substrate by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate using the Malachite Green reagent as previously described (23Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). β-Phosphoglucomutase activity was determined using a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled assay and 1 mm β-glucose 1-phosphate as substrate (24Zhang G. Dai J. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Tremblay L.W. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9404-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).For Km and Vmax determination, the phosphatase assays contained substrates at concentrations 0.005-2.0 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear curve fitting from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using the GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Mutagenesis and Growth Experiments—The yniC gene was deleted from the chromosome of the E. coli K-12 W3110 strain using a one-step inactivation method described by Datsenko and Wanner (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). The obtained ΔYniC strain contains an unmarked gene deletion, which was verified using PCR. The YniC-overexpressing strain was prepared by subcloning (PCR) of the wild-type yniC into the KpnI/HindIII sites of the arabinose-inducible vector pBAD-33 (26Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3905) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pKC1) and the empty (no insert) vector pBAD-33 (a control) were transformed into the wild-type W3110 strain. Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C on the MOPS-buffered minimal medium containing 0.2% of succinate as a carbon source, and the expression of YniC was induced by the addition of 0.02% arabinose. The culture growth (A600) was determined after 14 h of cultivation.Bioinformatic Analyses—Hierarchical clustering of HADs (based on their substrate profiles) and substrates (based on their HAD spectra) was calculated using cosine correlations, and groups were clustered using the average method (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; available on the World Wide Web at www.R-project.org). For hierarchical clustering of proteins across HAD substrates, we consider each protein as a point in the m-dimensional space, where m designates the total number of HAD substrates. Each protein can then be represented as a vector A = (s1,... sm) of length |A| and unit (normalized) vector A′(s1′ = s1/|A|,.. .sm′ = sm/|A|). We use the cosine angle between normalized vectors as a similarity measure between proteins across substrates. The protein profiles across substrates are clustered into groups using the average linkage method (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; available on the World Wide Web at www.R-project.org). For hierarchical clustering of substrates across proteins, we consider each protein as a point in the n-dimensional space, where n designates the total number of proteins. Each substrate can then be represented as a vector B = (p1,... pn) of length |B| and unit (normalized) vector B′(p1′ = p1/|A|,... pn′ = pn/|B|). We use the cosine angle between normalized vectors B′ as a similarity measure between substrates across proteins. The substrate profiles across proteins are clustered into groups using the average linkage method (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; available on the World Wide Web at www.R-project.org).The distance between the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) profiles of 18 enzymes acting on 26 different substrates (see Table 2) was computed using the square distance approach (see supplemental materials and “Experimental Procedures”). A neighbor-joining tree was constructed from the distance matrix using the NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP package (28Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

References are given in parentheses Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe Enzymatic Activities of the E. coli HADs—HADs share relatively little overall sequence similarity (∼15 to 30% identity), but they can be identified by the presence of three short conserved sequence motifs (3Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). 22 soluble HADs encoded by the E. coli genome were purified to homogeneity (supplemental Fig. 2) and screened for phosphatase, dehalogenase, phosphonatase, and β-phosphoglucomutase activities. 16 previously uncharacterized HADs showed detectable activity with pNPP, a general phosphatase substrate (18Kuznetsova E. Proudfoot M. Sanders S.A. Reinking J. Savchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Yakunin A.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 263-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). All of these HADs required the presence of a divalent metal cation for activity (Mg2+ > Co2+ > Mn2+ > Ni2+) and showed a broad range of activities and affinities to pNPP (Vmax 0.03-4.95 μmol/min mg of protein; Km = 0.92-17.8 mm). Several proteins, YcjU (HAD11), YigB (HAD7), OtsB (HAD17), YedP (HAD19), YaeD (HAD20), and HisB (HAD21), had no activity against pNPP. YcjU (HAD11) has been annotated in sequence data bases as a putative β-phosphoglucomutase, and indeed, we detected this activity using a specific assay with β-glucose-1-P as a substrate (3.81 ± 0.13 μmol/min/mg of protein). Low β-phosphoglucomutase activity (0.02-0.15 μmol/min/mg of protein) was also detected in YihX (HAD4), YqaB (HAD6), YbhA (HAD14), Cof (HAD18), Gph (HAD10), and YaeD (HAD20). Screening of purified E. coli HADs for hydrolytic activity against phosphonoacetate (phosphonatase substrate) or several haloacid dehalogenase substrates (chloroacetate, bromoacetate, chloropropionate, dichloropropionate, bromopropionate, and chlorobenzoate) produced no positive results (data not shown). Thus, most of the soluble E. coli HADs are phosphatases.TABLE 1Phosphatase activity of purified E. coli HADs against the model substrate pNPP and small phosphodonors Phosphatase activity is shown in μmol/min/mg of protein (the mean values are shown; S.D. values for all substrates were 10.95 ± 2.99% of the mean value). Assays were performed in the presence of 2.5 mm Mg2+ and the following concentrations of substrates: 10 mm pNPP, 10 mm acetyl-P, 0.13 mm carbamoyl-P, or 0.13 mm imidodi-P.

The present studies show that CDDO and CDDO-Me block tumor necrosis factorα-induced targeting of NF-κB p65 to the nucleus. CDDO-Me also blocked tumor necrosis factor α-induced phosphorylation of IκBα. In concert with these results, we found that CDDO-Me inhibits IκBα kinaseβ (IKKβ) activity in cells. In support of a direct mechanism, CDDO-Me inhibited recombinant IKKβ activity in vitro. The results also demonstrate that (i) CDDO and CDDO-Me form adducts with IKKβ, but not IKKβ with mutation of Cys-179 to Ala, and (ii) CDDO-Me inhibits IKKβ by a mechanism dependent on oxidation of Cys-179. These findings indicate that CDDO and CDDO-Me directly block IKKβ activity and thereby the NF-κB pathway by interacting with Cys-179 in the IKKβ activation loop."
https://openalex.org/W2094212271,"The reversible condensation of chromosomes during cell division remains a classic problem in cell biology. Condensation requires the condensin complex in certain experimental systems, but not in many others. Anaphase chromosome segregation almost always fails in condensin-depleted cells, leading to the formation of prominent chromatin bridges and cytokinesis failure. Here, live-cell analysis of chicken DT40 cells bearing a conditional knockout of condensin subunit SMC2 revealed that condensin-depleted chromosomes abruptly lose their compact architecture during anaphase and form massive chromatin bridges. The compact chromosome structure can be preserved and anaphase chromosome segregation rescued by preventing the targeting subunit Repo-Man from recruiting protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to chromatin at anaphase onset. This study identifies an activity critical for mitotic chromosome structure that is inactivated by Repo-Man-PP1 during anaphase. This activity, provisionally termed 'regulator of chromosome architecture' (RCA), cooperates with condensin to preserve the characteristic chromosome architecture during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1975059674,"The posttranslational modification sumoylation can have multiple effects on its substrate proteins. We studied a patient with isolated cleft lip and palate and a balanced chromosomal translocation that disrupts the SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier) gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency. In mouse, we found that Sumo1 is expressed in the developing lip and palate and that a Sumo1 hypomorphic allele manifests an incompletely penetrant orofacial clefting phenotype. Products of several genes implicated in clefting are sumoylated, and the Sumo1 hypomorphic allele interacts genetically with a loss-of-function allele for one of these loci. Thus, sumoylation defines a network of genes important for palatogenesis."

In this study, we report the finding that chloroplast stroma m-type thioredoxin is the source of reducing equivalents for reduction of HCF164 in the thylakoid lumen, providing strong evidence that higher plant chloroplasts possess a trans-membrane reducing equivalent transfer system similar to that found in bacteria. To probe the function of HCF164 in the lumen, a screen to identify the reducing equivalent acceptor proteins of HCF164 was carried out by using a resin-immobilized HCF164 single cysteine mutant, leading to the isolation of putative target thylakoid proteins. Among the newly identified target proteins, the reduction of the PSI-N subunit of photosystem I by HCF164 was confirmed both in vitro and in isolated thylakoids. Two components of the cytochrome b6 f complex, the cytochrome f and Rieske FeS proteins, were also identified as novel potential target proteins.

This has allowed the characterization of a wide variety of previously unknown Trx-regulated enzymes in the chloroplast stroma, for example (6Meyer Y. Reichheld J.P. Vignols F. Photosynth.

Bot. 2005; 56: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, our knowledge of the thiol-disulfide redox control system in the thylakoid lumen has been limited so far (19Hisabori T. Motohashi K. Hosoya-Matsuda N. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Romano P.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Meurer et al. identified mutants of Arabidopsis that displayed a high chlorophyll fluorescence phenotype (hcf mutants) under standard photosynthetic conditions (20Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Meurer J. Plucken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), suggesting a defect in photosynthetic electron transport. Among these, the hcf164 mutant was found to be impaired in the stable assembly of the cytochrome b6 f complex within thylakoid membranes (22Lennartz K. Plucken H. Seidler A. Westhoff P. Bechtold N. Meierhoff K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant was shown to lack the Trx-like protein subsequently named HCF164, which was predicted to be localized in the thylakoid lumen. The HCF164 protein contains a membrane-spanning sequence and a thioredoxin-like CXXC motif in the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). The finding that the reduced form of the HCF164 protein possesses insulin reducing activity in vitro (22Lennartz K. Plucken H. Seidler A. Westhoff P. Bechtold N. Meierhoff K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leads to the possibility that, in a similar way to Trx, the HCF164 protein may act as a transducer of reducing equivalents in the thylakoid lumen. To understand the role of HCF164 in the thylakoid lumen, we have carried out a thorough investigation of the biochemical properties of the HCF164 protein. We found that m-type Trx is able to effectively transfer electrons to luminal HCF164 across the thylakoid membranes. A proteomic based screen then allowed us to identify putative thylakoid-localized HCF164 target proteins, one of which was confirmed to undergo HCF164-dependent reduction. The results presented here underline the physiological significance of HCF164 as a transducer of reducing equivalent within the thylakoid lumen. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of HCF164 and PSI-N— The genes for HCF164 and the N subunit of photosystem I (PSI-N) were obtained by PCR amplification from an Arabidopsis cDNA library, using the following oligonucleotides: for the soluble domain of HCF164 (HCF164sol, amino acid residues 116-261 (supplemental Fig. S1)) (At4g37200), 5′-aactgcagcatatggattttgggatttctttgaa-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-cggaattcttatccatggcttaagggat-3′ (EcoRI); for the mature form of PSI-N (amino acid residues 87-171) (At5g64040), 5′-aactgcagcatatgggcgtcattgacgaatacct-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-cggaattcaccatttccagaaaaca-3′ (EcoRI). The restriction sites for the enzyme shown in parentheses are underlined. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET23c (Novagen), and the DNA sequences were confirmed. The recombinant HCF164sol was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified as follows. E. coli cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and 2 mm EDTA and disrupted by French press (5501-M, Ohtake Works, Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant (crude extract) was applied to a QAE-Toyopearl 550c column (Tosoh, Japan). Proteins were then eluted with a 150-500 mm linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and 2 mm EDTA. The peak fractions containing HCF164sol were collected, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to be a final concentration of 0.8 m. The solution was then applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (Tosoh) and eluted with a 0.8-0 m inverse gradient of ammonium sulfate in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and 2 mm EDTA. Recombinant PSI-N was sequestered in inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and thus purified as follows. Cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm EDTA containing a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting inclusion bodies were washed and dissolved as described previously (17Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The supernatant was diluted 50-100-fold with 25 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 6.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 30% glycerol. The insoluble aggregate was removed by centrifugation, and the protein solution was applied to an SP-Toyopearl 650M column (Tosoh). The protein was eluted from the column with a 0-500 mm gradient of NaCl in 25 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 6.9) and 1 mm EDTA. The peak fractions containing PSI-N were collected and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Trx-f and Trx-m—Recombinant Trx-f and Trx-m were expressed in E. coli using the plasmids constructed for spinach Trxs (23Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Trx-f was purified as follows. E. coli cells were suspended with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and disrupted by French press at 4 °C. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was applied to a QAE-Toyopearl 550c column. The desired protein was then eluted with a 0-300 mm linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). The peak fraction containing Trx-f was dialyzed against 25 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.1), applied to a SP-Toyopearl 650M column. and eluted with a 0-250 mm linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.1). Trx-m was purified as described previously without DTT (17Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protease Protection Assay—“Intact thylakoids” from Arabidopsis were prepared as described (24Casazza A.P. Tarantino D. Soave C. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). “Sonicated thylakoids” were prepared by sonicating thylakoid membranes for 3 min at 0 °C, by microtip of the sonifier (Branson Sonifier 250, output 2, duty cycle 30%). Both thylakoid preparations (chlorophyll concentration, 50 μg/ml) were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml thermolysin at 0 °C in 0.1 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 30 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0), and 5 mm CaCl2 (21Meurer J. Plucken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Protease reactions were terminated at the times indicated by addition of EDTA (pH 8.0, final 50 mm). Thylakoids were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final 5%) and washed with ice-cold acetone. The protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Polyclonal anti-HCF164 and anti-PSI-N serum were raised in rabbits against purified HCF164sol or PSI-N protein. Polyclonal anti-maize L-FNR serum was a gift from Toshiharu Hase (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (25Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T.

Orientation of Active Cysteines of HCF164 on Thylakoid Membranes—Intact thylakoids or sonicated thylakoids from Arabidopsis (chlorophyll concentration, 200 μg/ml) were incubated with 5 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), 0.1 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, and 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.1) for 30 min at 25 °C. After incubation, both thylakoid samples were washed twice with the same solution without TCEP, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final 5%), washed with ice-cold acetone, and finally dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, and 10 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) (12Motohashi K.

The protein samples were then analyzed by 13% nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-HCF164 serum. Trx-dependent Reduction Assay of HCF164 and PSI-N in Thylakoids—Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) was grown on MS medium (1× MS salts, 3 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride, 5 μg/ml nicotinic acid, 0.5 μg/ml pyridoxine hydrochloride, and 0.2% gellan gum), in a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 22 °C. Intact thylakoids (chlorophyll concentration, 80 μg/ml), were incubated with or without Trx-f (final 5 μm) or Trx-m (final 5 μm)in the presence or absence of DTT (final 10 μm) in 0.1 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 30 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0) for 60 min at 25 °C. Experiments to measure the DTT concentration- and time-dependent reduction of HCF164 in intact thylakoids were performed under conditions described in the legend of Fig. 2. Following completion of the reaction, the samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final 5%), washed with ice-cold acetone, and finally dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, and 10 mm AMS (12Motohashi K.

Reduced and oxidized proteins were separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting. Insulin Reduction Assay—To check the disulfide reduction activity of the recombinant soluble domain of HCF164 and to compare with that of stromal Trx proteins, we measured the change in turbidity of the insulin solution because of precipitation of free insulin B chain by reduction (14Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 130 μm bovine insulin. The reaction was initiated by adding 330 μm DTT into the assay mixture, and the change in turbidity was monitored at 650 nm at 25 °C. Determination of the Redox Potential of HCF164sol Protein— Wild type HCF164sol (1 μm) was incubated at 25 °C for 3 or 16 h in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100 mm oxidized DTT, and various concentrations of reduced DTT (0.5 μm to 2 mm), under nitrogen atmosphere. To minimize oxidation by air, buffer solutions were thoroughly degassed. After incubation, samples were treated with trichloroacetic acid (final 5%). The protein precipitates were washed with ice-cold acetone and then dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, and 2 mm AMS. Reduced (AMS derivative) and oxidized (nonderivative) forms of HCF164sol were separated by 15% nonreducing SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and quantified by using LAS-3000mini CCD-imaging (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) (27Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33035-33044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant and the standard redox potential were calculated as described (28Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), using a value of -330 mV for the standard redox potential of DTT as a reference (29Singh R. Lamoureux G.V. Lees W.J. Whitesides G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When Trx-f (1 μm) and Trx-m (1 μm) were incubated in the redox equilibrium buffer, the reduced DTT concentrations were varied from 20 μm to 100 mm against 100 mm oxidized DTT. Large Scale Preparation of Arabidopsis Thylakoids for Screening of HCF164 Target Proteins—Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) rosette leaves from 4- to 5-week-old plants were harvested and then rapidly homogenized in a Waring blender in ice-cold 330 mm sorbitol, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.05% BSA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem), and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting chloroplasts were resuspended in 330 mm sorbitol, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6) and centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 5 min. They were then resuspended with 330 mm sorbitol, 2 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaNO3, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm sodium diphosphate, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6) and centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 5 min. The precipitated chloroplasts were resuspended with 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 1% protease inhibitor mixture for plant cell extracts (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml chlorophyll. The broken chloroplast suspension was then centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with 10 mm sodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate-NaOH (pH 7.8) to remove peripheral proteins (30Kieselbach T. Hagman A. Andersson B. Schroder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6710-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thylakoids were obtained as a precipitate of this suspension following centrifugation for 10 min at 7,500 × g, for screening of HCF164 target proteins. Screening of HCF164 Target Proteins in Arabidopsis Thylakoids—HCF164sol (CS)-mutant (149WCEVC153 to 149WCEVS153) was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Arabidopsis thylakoids were solubilized in 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 1% protease inhibitor mixture for plant cell extracts (Sigma) and 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min. The solubilized thylakoid protein fraction was obtained as a supernatant. The detergent-solubilized fraction was then incubated with the HCF164sol (CS)-mutant immobilized resin for 60 min at room temperature. The resin was washed with 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (Buffer A) to remove any non-specifically bound proteins. The resin was then washed with Buffer A plus 500 mm NaCl and with Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% SDS. Each washing step was repeated until the absorbance of the washed solution at 280 nm approached zero. The resin was finally suspended in Buffer A plus 0.1% SDS and 20 mm DTT for 60 min, and the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% (w/v)) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Stained protein bands were identified by N-terminal amino acid analysis using a peptide sequencer and by peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (12Motohashi K.

HCF164-dependent Reduction of the Recombinant PSI-N in Vitro—PSI-N (8 μm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with 50 μm CuCl2 or various concentrations of DTT in the presence or absence of HCF164sol (5 μm). The redox states of PSI-N were assessed by the AMS labeling as described (12Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 17Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol.

PSI-N bands were visualized by Western blotting using anti-PSI-N antibody because the mobility of reduced form of PSI-N was almost same as that of HCF164sol. A Disulfide Bond in the Thioredoxin Domain of HCF164 Faces the Thylakoid Lumen—To probe the redox-related function of HCF164, we initially sought to determine the source of the reducing equivalents supplied to the luminal side of the thylakoid membranes. To achieve this, we first prepared Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) thylakoid membranes and determined their degree of intactness; incubation of isolated thylakoids with the protease thermolysin resulted in the rapid degradation of FNR, which is located on the stroma-exposed surface of thylakoid membranes, whereas the amount of the extrinsic luminal PSI-N protein (32Nielsen V.S. Mant A. Knoetzel J. Moller B.L. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3762-3766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was unaffected (Fig. 1A, left panels). In contrast, following sonication of intact thylakoid membrane samples, both FNR and PSI-N were rapidly degraded by thermolysin (Fig. 1A, right panels), clearly indicating that our thylakoid preparations were intact. Using these thylakoid preparations, we carried out a protease protection assay of HCF164. Although the N-terminal region of HCF164, which is predicted to extend into the stroma, was degraded by protease within 2 min (Fig. 1A, left upper panel), the 19-kDa fragment of HCF164 corresponding to the hydrophilic C-terminal domain, which contains the active cysteine residues, was protected for at least 30 min. In contrast, the largest component of the HCF164 protein was immediately degraded in sonicated thylakoid membranes by thermolysin treatment. Moreover, we determined the orientation of the active cysteines of the thioredoxin domain of HCF164 using the membrane-impermeable reducing reagent, TCEP (34Pelkmans L. Puntener D. Helenius A. Science. 2002; 296: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 35Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36Hsu M.F. Sun S.P. Chen Y.S. Tsai C.R. Huang L.J. Tsao L.T. Kuo S.C. Wang J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 1320-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In intact thylakoids, HCF164 was found to be present in the oxidized form and was not reduced by TCEP (Fig. 1B, Intact). In contrast, HCF164 was easily reduced when thylakoids were disrupted by sonication (Fig. 1B, Sonicated). These results substantiate existing evidence that the large hydrophilic domain of HCF164, which includes the active site Cys motif, is located in the thylakoid lumen, as suggested previously by Lennartz et al. (22Lennartz K. Plucken H. Seidler A. Westhoff P. Bechtold N. Meierhoff K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCF164 Receives Electrons from Trx Located on the Stromal Side—Having characterized the orientation of HCF164 within the membrane, we proceeded to determine the source of the reducing equivalents for reduction of the luminal portion of the HCF164 protein. In chloroplasts, electrons produced by photosynthetic electron transport ultimately accumulate within the stroma, the site of the chloroplast Trxs. In prokaryotic bacteria, the polytopic membrane protein cytochrome c defective A (CcdA) is known to act as a transducer of reducing equivalents, bridging the transfer of electrons from the cytoplasmic reduced form Trx to substrates within the periplasm across the membrane (37Katzen F. Deshmukh M. Daldal F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3960-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); an ortholog of the bacterial CcdA protein is also present in Arabidopsis (38Nakamoto S.S. Hamel P. Merchant S. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to investigate the possibility of a related pathway in thylakoid membranes. To determine the source of reducing equivalents, which could reduce the active cysteines of HCF164 on the luminal side, we monitored the redox state of HCF164 in intact thylakoids treated with an exogenous supply of reductant. The HCF164 protein was found to occur in the oxidized form in freshly prepared intact Arabidopsis leaf thylakoids (Fig. 2A, -Trx without DTT). This oxidized form of HCF164 could be partially reduced by the reduced form of Trx-m (Fig. 2A, Trx-m with DTT) but not by oxidized Trx-m (Fig. 2A, Trx-m without DTT). The reduced forms of Trx-f or 10 μm DTT without Trx were ineffective in reducing HCF164 (Fig. 2A, Trx-f with DTT and -Trx with DTT). Reduction of HCF164 was accomplished by Trx-m even in the presence of low concentrations of DTT but not by Trx-f (Fig. 2B). The reduction rate of HCF164 by Trx-m was fast (t1/2 <10 min) reaching a maximum within 30 min (Fig. 2C). These results clearly indicate that the stromal reduced form Trx-m is able to transfer reducing equivalents across the membrane to the luminal HCF164 protein. Disulfide Reduction Activity and Redox Potential Determination of the HCF164 Protein—To further characterize the biochemical properties of HCF164, we constructed an expression system consisting of the soluble C-terminal domain of the HCF164 protein containing the Trx motif alone (hereafter designated as HCF164sol), lacking both the N-terminal chloroplast signal sequence and the membrane spanning domain (supplemental Fig. S1) (22Lennartz K. Plucken H. Seidler A. Westhoff P. Bechtold N. Meierhoff K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin reduction activity displayed by purified HCF164sol was found to be lower than that measured for the well characterized stromal Trxs Trx-f and Trx-m (Fig. 3). To evaluate the feasibility of a putative electron cascade from stromal Trx to HCF164 in the thylakoid lumen, the redox potential values of HCF164sol and Trxs were determined using a DTTred/DTTox redox buffer. Following equilibration of HCF164 and Trxs with increasing ratios of DTTred/DTTox at 25 °C, the proteins were acid-denatured and treated with the thiol modifier AMS (27Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Ito K.

Because vertically migrating layers of swimming organisms are found in much of the ocean, biologically generated turbulence may affect (i) the transport of inorganic nutrients to the often nutrient-depleted surface layer from underlying nutrient-rich stratified waters to affect biological productivity and (ii) the exchange of atmospheric gases such as CO 2 with the stratified ocean interior, which has no direct communication with the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2022101585,"Evidence is accumulating that lipids play important roles in permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane (MOM) at the early stage of apoptosis. Lamellar phosphatidylcholine (PC) and nonlamellar phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids are the major membrane components of the MOM. Cardiolipin (CL), the characteristic lipid from the mitochondrial inner membrane, is another nonlamellar lipid recently shown to play a role in MOM permeabilization. We investigate the effect of these three key lipids on the gating properties of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the major channel in MOM. We find that PE induces voltage asymmetry in VDAC current-voltage characteristics by promoting channel closure at cis negative applied potentials. Significant asymmetry is also induced by CL. The observed differences in VDAC behavior in PC and PE membranes cannot be explained by differences in the insertion orientation of VDAC in these membranes. Rather, it is clear that the two nonlamellar lipids affect VDAC gating. Using gramicidin A channels as a tool to probe bilayer mechanics, we show that VDAC channels are much more sensitive to the presence of CL than could be expected from the experiments with gramicidin channels. We suggest that this is due to the preferential insertion of VDAC into CL-rich domains. We propose that the specific lipid composition of the mitochondria outer membrane and/or of contact sites might influence MOM permeability by regulating VDAC gating."

In this study we examined the role of H. pylori on cell invasion and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. The relevance of H. pylori cag pathogenicity island-encoded type IV secretion system (T4SS), CagA, and VacA for cell invasion was also investigated. We found that H. pylori induces AGS cell invasion in collagen type I and in Matrigel invasion assays. H. pylori-induced cell invasion requires the direct contact between bacteria and cancer cells. H. pylori-mediated cell invasion was dependent on the activation of the c-Met receptor and on increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. The abrogation of the c-Met receptor using the specific NK4 inhibitor or the silencing of c-Met expression with small interference RNA suppressed both cell invasion and MMP activity. Studies with different H. pylori strains revealed that cell invasion, c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, and increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity were all dependent on the presence of a functional bacterial T4SS, but not on VacA cytotoxicity. Our findings demonstrate that H. pylori strains with a functional T4SS stimulate gastric epithelial cell invasion through a c-Met-dependent signaling pathway that comprises an increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity.

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that colonizes the gastric mucosa of more than half of the human population (1Covacci A. Telford J.L. Del Giudice G. Parsonnet J. Rappuoli R. Science. 1999; 284: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In most individuals the infection induces chronic superficial gastritis, a condition that will remain throughout life. However, in some individuals, more severe outcomes of the infection may develop, such as peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric carcinoma (2Peek R.M. Blaser M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). This diversity of clinical outcomes associated with H. pylori infection is probably a result of the interactions among host, environmental, and bacterial virulence factors (2Peek R.M. Blaser M.J.

One well established H. pylori virulence factor is the presence of a cluster of about 30 genes, known as the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI). The cag PAI encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS), a multimolecular complex that mediates the translocation of bacterial factors into the host cell (17Segal E.D. Cha J. Lo J. Falkow S.

After demonstrating that H. pylori is able to induce cell invasion in this model, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Finally, we also evaluated whether there were differences between strains in their ability to stimulate cell invasion, and assessed the role of the cag PAI-encoded T4SS, CagA, and VacA in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—AGS cells, derived from a human gastric carcinoma, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Brussels, Belgium), 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 international units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.Pharmacological inhibitors PD168393, ZD1839, and LY294002, were obtained from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany), AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, UK), and Sigma, respectively. NK4 was kindly provided by W. Jiang (Dept. of Surgery, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK). The concentrations of inhibitors used were 2 μm, 1 μm, 100 mm, and 100 ng/ml, for PD168393, ZD1839, LY294002, and NK4, respectively. These concentrations were previously shown to inhibit cell invasion induced by stimulators, such as heregulin-β1, EGF, lithocholic acid, and HGF in AGS cells and in other cell lines (26Debruyne P.R.

Drug toxicity was controlled by measuring cell viability with the trypan blue dye exclusion test.Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacteria were grown in tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with 5% sheep blood (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Étoile, France) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C under a microaerophilic atmosphere. Bacterial density was estimated by the absorbance measurement at 600 nm. Heat-killed H. pylori was obtained by boiling during 30 min at 56 °C followed by an incubation for 10 min at 80 °C. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed with H. pylori strain 26695 (ATCC 700392, cag PAI+, vacA s1/m1), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). H. pylori insertion mutants with inactivation of the cagA (60190ΔcagA), cagE (60190ΔcagE) or vacA (60190ΔvacA) genes (14Bebb J.R. Letley D.P. Thomas R.J. Aviles F. Collins H.M. Watson S.A. Hand N.M.

In parallel experiments, H. pylori strain Tx30a (ATCC 51932, cag PAI–, vacA s2/m2) was also used.Preparation of Conditioned Medium—Conditioned medium from H. pylori (CM 26695) was prepared by washing three times in serum-free medium, 1 × 108 bacteria growing in TSA. Bacteria were added to 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 serum and antibiotic-free medium, and incubated on Matrigel-coated filters in the absence of cells at 37 °C, under a microaerophilic atmosphere. Control-conditioned medium (CM control) was prepared similarly, in the absence of bacteria. Conditioned media were collected after 48 h, centrifuged at 3220 × g for 2 min and passed through 0.2-μm pore-size filters (Schleicher & Schüell, Dassel, Germany) prior to test on invasion assays.Infection of Gastric Cells—Prior to infection, 80% confluent AGS monolayers were washed twice in PBS and incubated overnight in serum and antibiotic free medium (Invitrogen). For infection, 48 h colonies of H. pylori were collected and added to cells at, unless otherwise stated, a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Control monolayers were processed similarly in the absence of bacteria.Collagen Invasion Assay—Collagen invasion assays were performed as previously described (29Oliveira M.J. Van Damme J. Lauwaet T. De Corte V. De Bruyne G. Verschraegen G. Vaneechoutte M. Goethals M. Ahmadian M.R. Muller O. Vandekerckhove J. Mareel M. Leroy A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6161-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, collagen gels were prepared in 6-well plates (Becton and Dickinson, Bedford, MA), using a collagen type I solution (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and polymerized overnight at 37 °C. AGS cells (1 × 105) were incubated on top of the gels for 24 h at 37 °C, in the presence or absence (control) of H. pylori, and in some experiments with pharmacological inhibitors. Invasion was scored as the ratio between the number of invasive cells inside the gel and the total number of cells, counted in at least 12 microscopic fields with a computer-assisted inverted microscope. Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion test at the end of each assay.Matrigel Invasion Assay—Prior to each experiment, 24-well Matrigel-coated invasion inserts of 8-μm pore size filters (Becton and Dickinson) were introduced into 24-well plates. For re-hydration, the inner and outer compartments of the system were filled with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-free, and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After rehydration, 5 × 104 cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, in the presence or absence (control) of H. pylori or of H. pylori-conditioned medium, and pharmacological inhibitors. Filters were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, removed from the insert, and mounted in Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Invasive cells were scored in at least 25 microscopic fields (×20 objective), when DAPI-counterstained nuclei passed through the pores of the filter.Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoprecipitation—At the end of the infection period, cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). To immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules, 750 μg of proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20, BD Biosciences-Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA). Immunocomplexes were incubated for 60 min with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), washed and eluted in sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblot analysis, using antibodies directed to the phosphorylated molecules of interest.Immunoblot Analysis—After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS + 0.5% Tween-20 (for detection of phosphorylated proteins) or with 5% nonfat milk in PBS + 0.5% Tween-20 (for overall protein detection) and incubated for 60 min with a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Met antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma), a rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP2 antibody (Labvision Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) or a mouse monoclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Calbiochem). A goat anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a rabbit anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were quantified with the Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad).Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNAs targeting c-Met, MMP-2, or MMP-9 mRNA, previously tested for knockdown efficiency by quantitative RT-PCR, were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. In parallel, non-silencing siRNA duplexes (Sense: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′ and antisense: 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA-3′) were used as negative control. Prior to transfection, 50% confluent AGS monolayers platted onto 6-well plates were washed with PBS and incubated in serum and antibiotic-free medium. For transfection with siRNAs targeting MMP-2 and MMP-9, cells were grown, also until 50% of confluency, on 6-well plates previously coated with a collagen type I solution. Cells were transiently transfected with 80 nm (for c-Met or non-silencing siRNA) or with 50 nm (for MMP-2 and MMP-9) of siRNA, using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). At the end of each transfection, putative cytotoxic effects were evaluated, analyzing cell viability by trypan blue dye exclusion test.Zymography—To detect MMP enzymatic activity, transfected, or non-transfected AGS cells, were cultured for 48 h on top of collagen type I gels, in the presence or absence of H. pylori. 12 μg of protein from conditioned medium of such cultures were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (MMP-2 and MMP-9) or 1 mg/ml β-casein (MMP-3 and MMP-9) as substrates. Zymograms were run in Tris/glycine SDS running buffer under nondenaturing conditions. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice in 2% Triton X-100, to remove SDS. Zymograms were subsequently incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in the appropriated MMP substrate buffer (10 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 for MMP-2 and MMP-9; 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for MMP-3 and MMP-9). Proteolytic activity was visualized as the presence of clear bands against a blue background of Coomassie Blue-stained gelatin or β-casein substrates.Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with Student's t test and were expressed as mean values of at least three independent experiments ± S.D. Differences in data values were considered significant at a p value of less than 0.05.RESULTSH. pylori Stimulates AGS Cell Invasion—To investigate whether H. pylori was capable of inducing invasion of gastric epithelial cells, non-invasive AGS cells were infected with H. pylori and evaluated using two well established invasion assays. H. pylori significantly stimulated the invasion of these cells into both collagen type I gels (Fig. 1A) and Matrigel-coated filters (Fig. 1B).To test whether the proportion of bacteria:cell used in the experiments would influence the cellular phenotype, invasion was assessed using different MOIs (Fig. 1A). Because the highest MOI used (100) did not affect cellular viability, as assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (data not shown), this proportion bacteria:cell was used in all further experiments.Stimulation of AGS Cell Invasion Requires Direct Contact with H. pylori—To investigate whether viable bacteria were necessary for AGS cell invasion, cells were cultured on collagen type I gels or Matrigel-coated filters, with intact or heat-killed H. pylori. On both substrates, heat-killed bacteria were no longer able to stimulate cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether stimulation of invasion occurred by direct contact between H. pylori and the cells or by release of soluble bacterial pro-invasive factors by H. pylori, conditioned medium of H. pylori incubated on Matrigel-coated filters without cells, was collected, filtered, and tested in the Matrigel assay. Conditioned medium from H. pylori induced significantly lower levels of cell invasion than those observed by bacterial direct stimulation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the contact between H. pylori, and cells is necessary to induce an invasive phenotype.H. pylori-mediated AGS Cell Invasion Is Blocked by NK4, a c-Met Inhibitor—To assess the involvement of EGFR, ErbB-2, c-Met, and of the downstream signaling molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in H. pylori-mediated cell invasion, AGS cells were infected with H. pylori in the presence of specific inhibitors for each of these molecules, and assessed for invasion on collagen and Matrigel assays. On collagen type I gels, only NK4, an HGF antagonist that inhibits c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation and activity (30Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), was able to inhibit AGS cell invasion (Fig. 2A). The other inhibitors, although used at concentrations known to block invasion by specific stimulators, such as EGF, Heregulin β1 (Hrgβ1) (Fig. 2A), or lithocholic acid (27Oliveira M.J. Lauwaet T. De Bruyne G. Mareel M. Leroy A.J Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 131: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) had no effect on H. pylori-mediated cell invasion. On Matrigel-coated filters, although there was an inhibitory effect associated with PD168393, a dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor, and ZD1839, a specific EGFR inhibitor, the most striking effect of inhibition of cell invasion was observed with NK4 (Fig. 2B). Identical results to those obtained with H. pylori strain 26695 were also observed with H. pylori strain 60190 (data not shown). In none of the assays LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, was able to block cell invasion stimulated by H. pylori (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the c-Met receptor has an important role in H. pylori-mediated cell invasion.FIGURE 2H. pylori stimulation of AGS cell invasion is blocked by NK4, a c-Met inhibitor.

After infection with H. pylori, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with an antibody against tyrosine-phosphorylated residues (PY-20), and immunoblotted with an anti-c-Met antibody. As observed in Fig. 3A, H. pylori significantly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation level of c-Met. Similar results to those obtained with H. pylori strain 26695 were observed with H. pylori 60190.FIGURE 3H. pylori stimulation of AGS cell invasion occurs through a c-Met-dependent mechanism. AGS cells were infected with H. pylori 26695 for 0, 15, or 60 min (A) or with H. pylori 26695 and NK4 (100 ng/ml) for 60 min (B). AGS cells or AGS cells transfected with non-silencing siRNA (non-silenc. siRNA) or with siRNA to c-Met (siRNA c-Met) were infected with H. pylori 26695 or 60190 for 60 min (C). After infection, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with an antibody against tyrosine-phosphorylated residues (PY-20), and immunoblotted with an anti-c-Met antibody. In parallel, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti c-Met and reblotted with an anti-α-tubulin antibody. Cultures with c-Met siRNA-transfected cells were incubated on Matrigel filters and assessed for invasion (D).

For that, AGS cells were cultured for 60 min with H. pylori and with NK4. NK4 blocked not only H. pylori-mediated AGS cell invasion, but also c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation (Figs. 2, A and B and 3B), suggesting that H. pylori-mediated AGS cell invasion requires phosphorylation of the c-Met receptor. Neither H. pylori nor NK4 affected the expression levels of c-Met.To further confirm that c-Met is directly involved in the stimulation of host cell invasion by H. pylori, we transiently transfected AGS cells with siRNA abrogating c-Met expression (Fig. 3C). c-Met silencing was maximal 48 h after transfection, as confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Therefore, c-Met phosphorylation levels were investigated 48 h after transfection, and invasion assays started 24 h after transfection by incubating AGS cells with H. pylori strains 26695 and 60190 on Matrigel filters for an additional 24-h period. AGS cells transfected with siRNA to c-Met were resistant to both H. pylori-induced c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation and invasion (Fig. 3, C and D). These findings demonstrate that invasion of AGS cells is stimulated by H. pylori through a c-Met-dependent mechanism.H. pylori-mediated Cell Invasion Requires MMP-2 and MMP-9 Activity—To investigate the participation of MMPs in H. pylori-mediated cell invasion, cells were infected with H. pylori strain 60190 for 48 h on collagen type I gels. Supernatants of such cultures were assessed for proteolytic activity on gelatin or β-casein substrates. We observed that AGS cells constitutively secrete MMP-2 and MMP-9, and that supernatants of AGS cells infected with H. pylori showed increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and de novo MMP-3 activity (Fig. 4, A and B).FIGURE 4H. pylori-mediated AGS cell invasion requires MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, downstream c-Met receptor activation. AGS cells transfected or not with siRNA to c-Met (siRNA c-Met) were infected for 48 h with H. pylori 60190, 60190ΔcagA or 60190ΔcagE, on collagen type I gels. Filtered culture supernatants were run on gelatin (A) or β-casein (B) zymograms.

This bacterium is quite remarkable for a human pathogen by the number of glycoside hydrolases found in its genome. The modularity of these enzymes is striking as is the frequent occurrence of modules having amino acid sequence identity with family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), often referred to as F5/8 domains. Here we report the properties of family 32 CBMs from a C. perfringens N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase. Macroarray, UV difference, and isothermal titration calorimetry binding studies indicate a preference for the disaccharide LacNAc (β-d-galactosyl-1,4-β-d-N-acetylglucosamine). The molecular details of the interaction of this CBM with galactose, LacNAc, and the type II blood group H-trisaccharide are revealed by x-ray crystallographic studies at resolutions of 1.49, 2.4, and 2.3 Å, respectively.

Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped anaerobe. As a pathogen of humans, C. perfringens is often associated with gas gangrene, necrotic enteritis, and, most commonly, food poisoning (1Hatheway C.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 66-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rood J.I. Cole S.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 621-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of the genome sequence of C. perfringens (strain 13) (4Shimizu T. Ohshima S. Ohtani K. Hayashi H. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 45: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has revealed at least 54 open reading frames encoding putative glycoside hydrolases falling into 24 known glycoside hydrolase families (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html) (5Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). Many encode intracellular proteins likely involved in the latter stages of sugar metabolism or proteins involved in peptidoglycan remodeling; however, roughly one-half are predicted to be secreted and are likely involved in the early stages of sugar metabolism. Although C. perfringens is most frequently thought of as a “flesh-eater,” its most common niche in humans is the gastrointestinal tract. However, very few, if any, of the secreted glycoside hydrolases have predicted substrate specificities consistent with metabolism of dietary polysaccharides in the human gut making gastric mucins, highly hydrated glycoproteins comprising up to 80% carbohydrate, the most likely target of the secreted C. perfringens enzymes. Indeed, the majority of these enzymes are predicted to have specificities appropriate for the degradation of complex glycans, suggesting that this bacterium is well equipped to attack the diverse sugar structures of the mucins in this environment. Consistent with this is the mucosal necrosis associated with severe enteritis caused by C. perfringens (6Gerding D.N. Johnson S. Rood J.I. McClane B.A. Songer J.G. Titball R.W. The Clostridia Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis. Harcourt Brace & Company, London1997: 117-140Google Scholar), which may be in part due to the arsenal of C. perfringens glycoside hydrolases. In turn, breaking down the mucosal barrier could improve access of other toxins, such as the pore-forming cpe (C. perfringens enterotoxin), to the epithelial layer. Thirteen of the predicted C. perfringens (strain 13) glycoside hydrolases (and notably 13 glycoside hydrolases for each of the sequenced Bacteroides sp. genomes (thetaiotaomicron, fragilis YCH46, and fragilis 25285)) are highly modular and have, in addition to catalytic domains, modules with amino acid sequence identity to family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 3The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. (7Boraston A.B. Notenboom V. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Davies G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CBMs are generally considered to be modules with carbohydrate-binding function, but no catalytic activity, that are found within the modular architectures of glycoside hydrolases (8Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). They are currently classified into 45 families based on amino acid sequence identity (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html.) and loosely grouped into three types, A (crystalline polysaccharide binding), B (polysaccharide chain binding), and C (small sugar binding or “lectin-like”), established by functional properties (8Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Based on limited biochemical evidence, the family 32 CBMs appear to be type C CBMs. The x-ray crystal structures of the Cladobotryum dendroides galactose oxidase and the Micromonospora viridifaciens sialidase (MvGH33) revealed the β-sandwich lectin-like folds of their cognate CBM32 modules (9Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10Gaskell A. Crennell S. Taylor G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Co-crystallizations of MvGH33 with galactose showed the potential of its CBM32 module, here called MvCBM32, to bind galactose (10Gaskell A. Crennell S. Taylor G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11Newstead S.L. Watson J.N. Bennet A.J. Taylor G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which was subsequently verified by functional studies (7Boraston A.B. Notenboom V. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Davies G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the family 32 CBMs, which are often referred to as F5/8 domains, have been generally considered as galactose binding domains. The family 32 CBMs stand out among the CBM families, because they are frequently found appended to enzymes with “exotic” specificities (e.g. sialidases, β-hexosaminidases, mannosidases, and fucosidases) and are found in bacteria capable of causing disease in humans. In contrast, the vast majority of CBMs in other families are found appended to enzymes that are active on plant cell wall polysaccharides. In the context of the plant cell wall hydrolases, the function of CBMs has been repeatedly shown to be to localize the enzyme to an appropriate substrate (8Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). By analogy to the plant cell wall hydrolases, the role of family 32 CBMs is likely to target their parent enzymes to carbohydrate substrates; however, with these CBMs the substrates are likely more complex glycans, such as gastric mucins in the case of C. perfringens and Bacteroides sp. Previous studies of family 32 CBMs have not addressed the possibility that the specificity of these CBMs extend beyond a preference simply for galactose and may actually include specificity for complex glycan chains. Thus, studies of family 32 CBMs from bacterial pathogens enter a new area of carbohydrate-binding module-mediated host-pathogen interactions and will extend our knowledge of this potentially complex family of carbohydrate-binding proteins. To better understand CBM32 structure and function we initiated studies of CpGH84C from C. perfringens (strain ATCC 13124). This enzyme, which comprises four modules defined on the basis of primary structure comparisons (see Fig. 1), was chosen as a model system, because, relative to other family 32 CBM-containing enzymes, it is reasonably small and has a simple modular architecture that is amenable to accurate definition of the modular boundaries. To facilitate structure-function studies, we dissected this protein at the genetic level to recombinantly produce isolated CpCBM32. The experimental results reveal the ability of the CBM to bind to terminal glycotopes commonly found in elaborated O- and complex N-glycans (12Gupta D. Kaltner H. Dong X. Gabius H.J. Brewer C.F. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Robbe C. Capon C. Coddeville B. Michalski J.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), whereas the x-ray crystal structures of CpCBM32 in complex with sugar help uncover the molecular details that confer this binding ability. Structural comparisons with known CBM32s and other C. perfringens CBM32s suggest variations in glycan specificities, but all are based on a key terminal galactose residue. This work provides the first detailed structure-function analysis of a family 32 CBM and will provide a foundation for further studies of CBMs within this family. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, chemicals, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides were purchased from Sigma. Cloning—The DNA fragment encoding the family 32 CBM (Fig. 1) of CpGH84C was amplified by PCR from C. perfringens genomic DNA (Sigma, ATCC 13124) using previously described methods (15Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nucleotides 1873-2301 of the cpgh84c gene, corresponding to the CBM (amino acid residues 625-767), were amplified with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CACCAATCCAAGAACAGTAAAG-3′ (CBMF) and 5′-CTTTTATCCATGAACATTAACCTC-3′ (CBMR). The amplified gene fragment was ligated directly into the pET-150 TOPO Directional Cloning kit (Invitrogen) to generate pCBM32. The polypeptide (called CpCBM32) encoded by pCBM32 comprises a H6 tag fused to the CpCBM32 module by an enterokinase protease cleavage site. Protein Production and Purification—pCBM was transformed into the BL21star (DE3) Escherichia coli expression strain (Invitrogen). A 1.5-liter culture was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), to an optical density of ∼1 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside then grown overnight at 37 °C. The cells were harvested at 4,000 × g and resuspended in 20 ml of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.5 m NaCl. Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 27,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to His-Select resin followed by step elution with binding buffer containing imidazole concentrations between 5 and 500 mm. Samples were run on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and fractions containing the polypeptide of interest were pooled. Proteins were concentrated, and buffer was exchanged in a stirred ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA) using a 5,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Filtron, Northborough, MA). Purity, assessed by SDS-PAGE, was >95%. Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) using calculated molar extinction coefficients (16Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Macroarray Binding Experiments—CpCBM32 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Alexa Fluor 680 was resuspended in Me2SO to a concentration of 10 μg/μl. Negative and positive controls (bovine serum albumin and Clostridium cellulovorans CcCBM17, respectively) and CpCBM32 were buffer-exchanged into 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, by de-salting using a PD-10 column (General Electric). 50 μg of Alexa Fluor 680 was incubated with 1 mg of protein, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Buffer exchange was done into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, by gel-filtration using a PD-10 column to remove any unreacted dye molecules. 1 μl of 0.1 or 1% solutions of various plant polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans, and glycoproteins were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were allowed to dry completely then blocked for 2 h with 10 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Labeled protein (0.4 mg) was allowed to incubate overnight at 13 °C in 10 ml of 1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Blots were washed once with 10 ml of 1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 40 min. Emission of fluorescence was detected at 700 nm using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System from LI-COR Biosciences. Detection was scored based on levels of signal emission (supplemental Fig. S1). UV Difference—Automated UV difference titrations of CpCBM32 were performed as described previously (17Boraston A.B. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14679-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Difference spectra were examined for peak and trough wavelengths, and values at the appropriate wavelengths were extracted for further analysis. The wavelengths for the maximum peak-to-trough differences were determined individually for each sugar solution. The peak-to-trough heights at three wavelength pairs were calculated by subtraction of the trough values from the peak values, and the dilution-corrected data were plotted against total carbohydrate concentration. Data for the three wavelength pairs were analyzed simultaneously with MicroCal Origin (version 7.0) using a one-site binding model accounting for ligand depletion. Experiments were performed at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The data reported are the averages and standard deviations of three independent titrations. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed as described previously (18Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Lammerts van Bueren A. Finn R. Ausio J. Boraston A.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15633-15642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using a VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Sugar solutions were prepared by mass in buffer saved from the final protein dialysis step. Both protein and sugar solutions were filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance as described above. Aliquots of 10 mm LacNAc were titrated into CpCBM32 (350 μm), which gave C values >5 (20Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5.0 mm type II H-trisaccharide were titrated into CpCBM32 (245 μm). In this case, the C value was <1(∼0.3) due to the low binding affinity. Based on the 1:1 binding observed in the crystal structure, the stoichiometry was fixed at 1 in the analysis of this data. Data were fit with a single binding site model. Crystallization and Data Collection—All crystallization experiments were performed using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Prior to crystallization, the H6 tag was removed from CpCBM32 by treatment with enterokinase over a 4-day period. The digested sample was run through a Novagen His-bind Quick 900 cartridge to remove the His tag and any undigested protein from the solution. Samples were concentrated and exchanged as above into 20 mm Tris, pH 8. Cocrystals of CpCBM32 (10.5 mg/ml) with galactose (∼10 mm) were obtained with 0.2 m MgCl2, 25% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethylether, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5. These crystals were cryoprotected with 15% glycerol in mother liquor. 1.5 m sodium/potassium phosphate was used to co-crystallize CpCBM32 (20 mg/ml) LacNAc and the type II blood group H-trisaccharide (α-l-fucosyl-1,2-β-d-galactosyl-1,4-β-d-N-acetylglucosamine). Optimization of this condition determined the ideal NaH2PO4/K2HPO4 concentration to be 1.5 m (at a 1:100 ratio) and the optimal protein concentration to be 5 mg/ml. The cryoprotectant used was 1.45 m Na/K2HPO4 with 27% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ area detector coupled to an MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic “blue” optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700. Data were processed with Crystal Clear/d*trek (21Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar).

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) was able to find one clear rotation/translation solution corresponding to the single molecule in the asymmetric unit. This initial model was corrected, and ligand was added by successive rounds of building using COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Refinement was done using REFMAC (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The final model lacking waters was used as a starting model to solve the structures of the other CpCBM32 sugar complexes. Initial models were corrected, one or more ligands were added, and waters were added as above. Residue numbering conforms to the numbering in the complete CpGH84C enzyme. Final model statistics are given in Table 1. Carbohydrate Binding Properties of CpCBM32 from CpGH84C—Based on its amino acid sequence identity (∼30%) with the family 32 galactose-binding module from the M. viridifaciens sialidase we postulated that the CpCBM32 module in CpGH84C is indeed a carbohydrate-binding protein. This was initially investigated by macroarray binding experiments using arrayed glycoproteins and polysaccharides, which revealed significant binding to asialofetuin, type III porcine gastric mucin, and fetuin with relative binding of asialofetuin > porcine gastric mucin > fetuin (supplemental Fig. S1). Using knowledge of the glycan structures commonly found on these glycoproteins (14Robbe C. Capon C. Coddeville B. Michalski J.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) as a guide, we assessed the binding of various monosaccharides, disaccharides, and trisaccharides to CpCBM32 by qualitative and quantitative UV difference experiments. The addition of d-galactose and GalNAc (N-acetyl-d-galactosamine) to CpCBM32 resulted in large perturbations of the UV difference spectra indicative of the involvement of tryptophan in sugar binding (17Boraston A.B. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14679-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). l-Fucose, d-glucose, d-mannose, and GlcNAc (N-acetyl-d-glucosamine) were also tested but did not influence the UV absorption of CpCBM32 and thus are unlikely primary ligands of CpCBM32. Quantitative studies by UV difference titrations showed an affinity of roughly 1 × 103 m-1 for galactose-based monosaccharides and a preference for β-rather than α-configured O-methylgalactose (Fig. 2B and Table 2). The presence of the acetamido group of GalNAc did not appear to confer any advantage to binding. CpCBM32 preferred lactose and LacNAc over galactose by factors of ∼2.5- and 10-fold, respectively. The increased affinity of LacNAc (cf. lactose) suggested the specific involvement of the 2′-acetamido group of the GlcNAc moiety in binding. Along similar lines, the α-1,2-linked l-fucose of fucosyllactose (α-l-fucosyl-1,2-β-d-galactosyl-1,4-β-d-glucose) substantially reduced the binding affinity to levels below those we could quantify due to limiting quantities of sugar but did not entirely legislate against binding.TABLE 2Binding constants determined by UV difference at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5SugarKam–1 × 10–3d-Galactose0.98 (±0.17)d-GalNAc0.86 (±0.12)Methyl-α-d-galactose0.57 (±0.25)Methyl-β-d-galactose1.31 (±0.08)Lactose2.49 (±0.06)LacNAc9.09 (±2.98) Open table in a new tab The binding to LacNAc and the type II H-trisaccharide was further investigated by ITC (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 3).

Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 27Bachhawat-Sikder K. Thomas C.J. Surolia A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ΔH of binding was temperature-dependent, the analysis of which allowed the approximation of the change in heat capacity (ΔCp)to be -105 (±5) cal/mol/K. Again, this small negative ΔCp is consistent with the majority of protein-carbohydrate interactions. The affinity of CpCBM32 for the type II H-trisaccharide was too low to accurately deconvolute the stoichiometry of binding, so, on the basis of the LacNAc binding data and x-ray crystallography data (see below), this value was fixed at 1 for the analysis (28Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Like with fucosyllactose, the fucose residue of the type II H-trisaccharide is detrimental to binding relative to LacNAc or lactose, although it does not destroy binding. The roughly 1.3 kcal/mol increase in free energy due to the fucose moiety on the H-trisaccharide appears to come by virtue of a substantial enthalpic penalty (∼+9.0 kcal/mol), which is partially offset by a favorable contribution to entropy (∼+25 cal/mol/K) (note: assumption of up to a 25% error in the estimate of stoichiometry due to errors in either the sugar or protein concentration does change the magnitudes of the calculated thermodynamic penalties but does not change their sign and, thus, qualitative interpretation of the data are unaffected).TABLE 3Binding parameters determined by ITC in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5SugarTemperaturenKaΔHΔSΔG°C10–4 × m–1kcal/molcal/mol/Kkcal/molLacNAc250.89 ± 0.01.11 (±0.02)–15.6 (±0.0)–33.6 (±0.5)–5.5 (±0.0)20aOnly single titrations were performed, and errors are those from the data-fitting process.

The fold is that of a β-sandwich comprising a β-sheet of three anti-parallel β-strands opposing a β-sheet of five anti-parallel β-strands (Fig. 3A). The closest structural neighbors are the family 32 CBMs from the fungal Cladobotryum dendroides galactose oxidase (PDB code 1GOF (9Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar)) (here the CBM is referred to as CdCBM32) and the bacterial M. viridifaciens sialidase (PDB code 1EUT (10Gaskell A. Crennell S. Taylor G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) (here the CBM is referred to as MvCBM32; see below for a more detailed comparison). More distantly related are the family 6 and 36 CBMs as well as the Anguilla sp. fucolectin. CpCBM32 heptahedrally coordinates one metal ion through the side chains of Thr-655, Asp-650, and Glu-672 and the backbone carbonyls of Phe-647, Asp-652, Thr-655, and Ala-761 (Fig. 3C). This ion was judged most likely to be calcium on the basis of three observations. Firstly, the atom possessed significant anomalous scattering properties, because it could be easily located in anomalous difference maps, indicating that the ion was not sodium or magnesium. Secondly, when considering ions commonly found associated with carbohydrate-binding proteins, heptahedral coordination mediated entirely by oxygen atoms is most consistent with potassium, calcium, or manganese. Lastly, when modeled as calcium, the B factor of this atom was consistent with the B factors of neighboring atoms in the coordinating side chains. This ion does not appear to play a direct role in binding carbohydrate, because it is quite distant from the carbohydrate binding site. Studies on other CBMs where similar “structurally” relevant ions have been removed have suggested only a stabilizing role for such ions, because apo-CBMs are still competent to bind carbohydrate (29Roske Y.

Trp-661 and Phe-757 create a relatively hydrophobic pocket, which cradles the C6-hydroxymethyl group. Trp-661 “stacks” against the flat, apolar surface created by carbons 3-6 on the B-face of d-galactose with the O4 pointing away from the aromatic residue (Fig. 4). Specificity for the non-reducing end of d-galactose (and presumably GalNAc) is conferred by three potential hydrogen bonds to the axial O4 of the sugar from the terminal δO of Asn-695, a terminal guanido nitrogen of Arg-690, and the ϵN from the imidazole ring of His-658 (Fig. 5). Additional hydrogen bonds are made between the O3 of d-galactose and Arg-690 and Glu-641; the endocyclic oxygen of galactose makes a h"

For example, the receptor for CpG containing bacterial and viral DNA, TLR9, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that the localization of TLR9 is critical for appropriate ligand recognition. Here we have defined which structural features of the TLR9 molecule control its intracellular localization. Both the cytoplasmic and ectodomains of TLR9 contain sufficient information, whereas the transmembrane domain plays no role in intracellular localization. We identify a 14-amino acid stretch that directs TLR9 intracellularly and confers intracellular localization to the normally cell surface-expressed TLR4. Truncation or mutation of the cytoplasmic tail of TLR9 reveals a vesicle localization motif that targets early endosomes. We propose a model whereby modification of the cytoplasmic tail of TLR9 results in trafficking to early endosomes where it encounters CpG DNA.

TLRs comprise a family of approximately 10 paralogs, depending on species, which initiate inflammatory responses to a diverse array of microbial products (1Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev.

Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Examples include bacterial peptidoglycans, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and flagellin, which are recognized by TLRs 2, 4, and 5, respectively, and nucleic acids from bacteria and viruses, which are recognized by TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 (1Takeda K.

TLR9, the focus of the current study, responds to bacterial and viral DNA as well as synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides that contain unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in specific sequence contexts (CpG DNA) (5Takeshita F.

Like all TLRs, TLR9 is a type 1 integral membrane receptor with a ligand-binding ectodomain and a cytoplasmic portion that belongs to the Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) family of signaling domains. The TIR domain of TLR9 interacts with the MyD88 adapter protein, initiating a signaling cascade that results in the activation of NF-κB and mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) (9Subramaniam S.

Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). TLRs recognize their ligands at distinct locations within cells. LPS and peptidoglycan are recognized at the cell surface (11Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A.

Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). In contrast, nucleic acid recognition occurs intracellularly (13Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J.

Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that TLR9, localized in the ER, gains access to incoming endosomes containing CpG DNA by direct fusion of the endosome with the ER. Neutralization of lysosomes inhibits signaling through TLR9, suggesting that trafficking to the lysosome is essential for signal transduction (13Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 15Heil F. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Gellert T. Dietrich H. Lipford G. Takeda K. Akira S. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2987-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TLR9, CpG DNA, and the adapter protein MyD88 have all been localized to vesicles that can be stained for lysosomal markers (5Takeshita F. Leifer C.A. Gursel I. Ishii K.J. Takeshita S. Gursel M. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3555-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 13Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The endosomal location of TLR9 reflects the requirement for phagocytosis and microbial destruction for the release of DNA prior to signaling. In the current study, we hypothesized that TLR9 contains specific motifs that control localization and trafficking. Although transmembrane proteins often contain information in their cytoplasmic tails that dictate their cellular localization (20Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 21Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar), we found that the internal location of TLR9 was mediated by both the cytoplasmic domain and the ectodomain, but not the transmembrane domain. Truncation analysis revealed a region of the cytoplasmic tail required for intracellular retention and a motif that was capable of targeting TLR9 to vesicles. Unexpectedly, the vesicles targeted by this motif were not lysosomes but instead were early endosomes coincident with endocytosed CpG DNA. Cell Culture—HeLa, mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF), HEK293, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum. Antibodies—Anti-Tac (human CD25, IL-2Rα) monoclonal antibody (22Uchiyama T. Nelson D.L. Fleisher T.A. Waldmann T.A. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1398-1403PubMed Google Scholar), used for imaging, was a gift from Dr. Thomas Waldmann, NCI (National Institutes of Health), and was directly labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 using the Molecular Probes monoclonal antibody labeling kit. Anti-IL-2Rα (N-19), used for immunoblotting Tac chimeras, was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Unconjugated anti-TLR4 (HTA125) and TLR9 (eB72-1665) were from eBioscience. LAMP-1 antibody was from Pharmingen, allophycocyaninconjugated secondary antibodies were from Caltag, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology. Plasmids—TLR9 and TLR4 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF259262 and U93091, respectively), tagged at their C termini with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), were generated by PCR and inserted in-frame into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Constructs containing the extracellular domain of Tac fused to the transmembrane (TM) and TIR domains of TLR9 (residues 818-1032) and TLR4 (residues 635-835) were generated by introducing an EcoRV site directly upstream of the TM domain of the TLR by site-directed mutagenesis. The TM, TIR domain, and stop codon were excised at the EcoRV and a downstream restriction site and then ligated in-frame into compatible sites of pCDNA3 containing the extracellular domain of Tac (residues 1-239) (GenBank™ accession number NM_000417; a gift from Dr. Remy Bosselut, NCI). The TLR4-9-GFP (TLR41-633TLR9818-1032) and TLR9-4-GFP (TLR91- 817TLR4634-835) chimeras were generated by inserting the TLR9 (or TLR4) TIR and TM domains into TLR4 (or TLR9)-GFP from which the TIR and TM domains had been excised. TLR91-810TLR4625-835 was generated by PCR as described previously (26Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and put into pFlag-CMV. Truncation mutants were generated by introducing stop codons into the Tac-TIR9 chimera by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the provider's protocol except that the PCR reactions contained 200 ng of template plasmid and were run for 28 cycles (see Fig. 2). TLR4-9-4 (TLR41-678TLR9875-911TLR4710-839) was generated by stitching PCR. All chimeras were verified by sequencing. Rab5-GFP was a gift from Dr. Juan Bonifacino, NICHD (National Institutes of Health). All plasmids for transfection were prepared using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Flow Cytometry—HEK293T (3 × 105) cells were transfected using TransIT (Mirus) in 6-well plates and after 24 h were stained directly for surface expression or fixed, permeabilized, and stained for total expression. Data were collected with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellQuest. Confocal Microscopy—HeLa (3 × 105) cells were transfected using TransIT on coverslips and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained 24 h later. Cells were visualized using either a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope, where images of single 0.8-μm sections were collected, or by a Zeiss AxioImager for non-confocal images. Composite pictures were prepared with Photoshop. Each individual cell image is a representative of at least five different cells collected in at least three different experiments. Larger field images were taken with a ×40 objective from at least three independent experiments. Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were transfected using TransIT and a total of 200 ng DNA/well consisting of NF-κB-luciferase and pSV-β-galactosidase reporter plasmids and either TLR9, TLR9-4 chimera, MD-2 plus TLR4, or MD-2 plus the TLR4-9 chimera. Cells were stimulated for 24 h, lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and assayed for luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Tropix) activity. NF-κB activity (relative light units) was calculated by dividing the luciferase counts by the control β-galactosidase. Salmonella LPS (Sigma) or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 (23Hartmann G. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) were used as stimulants. Paired t tests were used to determine statistical significance. Glycosidase Treatment—Transfected HeLa cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors and sonicated. Sonicates were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) or peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F), both from New England Biolabs, as described (24Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were lysed as described previously (18Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated, and treated with Endo-H (New England Biolabs). All treated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Tac or anti-GFP antibodies. The localization of nucleic acid recognizing TLRs is critical for ligand recognition. To determine what molecular mechanisms control TLR9 intracellular localization, we constructed chimeric proteins in which the ecto- and transmembrane/cytoplasmic (TM-TIR) domains of TLR4 and TLR9 were interchanged. As expected, TLR4, but not TLR9, localized to the cell surface (Fig. 1A). However, no surface expression was detected for TLR9 or the TLR4-9 or TLR9-4 chimeras, suggesting that both the ecto- and TM-TIR domains of TLR9 contain intracellular localization information. A chimera in which the TIR domain of TLR9 was replaced by GFP (TLR9ΔTIR) also failed to localize to the cell surface (Fig. 1A), further supporting the notion that the TM domain and/or the ectodomain of TLR9 contains localization information. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that TLR9-4, TLR4-9, and TLR9ΔTIR, like wild type TLR9, were retained in a reticular compartment, which we previously described to be the ER (Fig. 1B) (19Leifer C.A. Kennedy M.N. Mazzoni A. Lee C. Kruhlak M.J. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As expected, TLR4 was found both at the cell surface and in a Golgi-like compartment (Fig. 1B) (12Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The TLR4-9 chimera failed to respond to LPS, likely because of redirection of the TLR4 ectodomain from the cell surface to intracellular compartments where it could no longer interact with LPS (Fig. 1C). By contrast, the TLR9-4 chimera, containing the TLR4 TM and cytoplasmic tail, did respond to CpG DNA. In this study we focused on molecular structures contained in the cytoplasmic tail that dictate intracellular localization. The studies shown in Fig. 1 suggested that either the TM or the cytoplasmic domain, in addition to the ectodomain, contained intracellular localization motifs. Other studies have suggested that the TM domain controls localization of TLR7 and mouse TLR9 (25Nishiya T. Kajita E. Miwa S. Defranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37107-37117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat.

To determine whether the TM domain of human TLR9 also controls intracellular localization, the ectodomain of CD25 (Tac) was fused to the TM and cytoplasmic tail of TLR9 (Tac-TIR9) (Fig. 2), a strategy that has been used successfully in other systems (24Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Tac is processed in the Golgi to a highly glycosylated form that is resistant to Endo-H digestion, serving as a sensitive biochemical marker for protein export from the ER. A fusion of Tac and the TLR4 TIR domain (Tac-TIR4), readily detected on the cell surface by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 1), contained a high molecular weight Endo-H-resistant band indicative of Golgi processing. Tac-TIR9, which was localized intracellularly and co-localized with wild type TLR9, was completely Endo-H-sensitive (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, truncation of most or all of the cytoplasmic tail resulted in surface expression of Tac-TIR9 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 2). The Tac-TIR9 truncations contained higher molecular weight, Endo-H-resistant glycoforms indicative of trafficking out of the ER and of Golgi processing (Fig. 3B). Because those constructs contained the TLR9 TM domain, we concluded that the human TLR9 transmembrane domain did not mediate intracellular localization. In a previous report, surface expression of mouse FLAG-TLR91-810TLR4625-835 was detected (26Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We generated the same mouse TLR9 chimera along with the analogous untagged human version and detected no mature glycoform, which would indicate surface expression, in HeLa or MEF cells (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). To identify motifs that control localization of TLR9, the Tac-TIR9 fusion protein was truncated progressively from the C terminus (Fig. 2). The cytoplasmic domain of TLR9 contains 196 residues, and removal of the last 131 amino acids (i.e. truncation at amino acid 902, TacTIR9Δ902) had little effect on localization, as this mutant was not detected on the cell surface and remained Endo-H-sensitive (Fig. 4). However, an abrupt transition from internal to surface expression was observed when 14 additional residues were deleted (TacTIR9Δ888) as detected by microscopy (Fig. 4A), flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 5), and glycoform analysis (Fig. 4B). The 14 residues between TacTIR9Δ902 and TacTIR9Δ888 represented a functional intracellular localization motif because they directed internal localization when grafted into the homologous position in the TLR4 cytoplamsic domain (Tac-TIR4-9-4; Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 5). Although there was still surface expression of Tac-TIR4-9-4, the level was significantly reduced compared with Tac-TIR4 (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) = 98 versus MFI = 230, respectively). A chimera in which the 14 residues were grafted into the TIR domain of full-length TLR4 (TLR4-9-4) had less cell surface expression (data not shown) and contained much less of the Endo-H-resistant glycoform (Fig. 5A) compared with wild type TLR4. TLR4-9-4 also lacked response to LPS; however, both TLR4-9 and TLR4-9-4 demonstrated increased constitutive activity when overexpressed, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail retained the ability to transduce signals (Fig. 5B). Together these data indicated that the 14 amino acids between residues 888 and 902 of the TLR9 TIR domain mediated intracellular localization. It is important to note that these results do not rule out other intracellular localization motifs C-terminal to amino acid 902. In fact, a more detailed analysis of cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants revealed several changes in the intracellular staining pattern (Fig. 6A) and glycosylation pattern (Fig. 6B), suggesting there were several, possibly interrelated, localization motifs.FIGURE 514-amino acid region confers intracellular localization to TLR4.

Because several truncations downstream of amino acid 888 displayed some vesicular staining (Fig. 6), we asked which vesicular compartment was targeted by our mutant and whether that compartment was coincident with CpG DNA following its uptake from the medium. TacTIR9Δ898 showed significant targeting to endosomes and some cell surface expression (Fig. 7). Furthermore, co-localization in vesicles with fluorescently labeled CpG DNA was detected when HeLa cells were transfected with TacTIR9Δ898 (Fig. 7A). Unexpectedly, these vesicles were devoid of LAMP-1 (Fig. 7B) but instead contained an early endosome marker, Rab5 (Fig. 7C). Although some studies have indicated that TLR9 co-localizes with CpG DNA in lysosomes (13Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), our data are consistent with studies showing that intact TLR9 co-localizes with CpG DNA in early endosomes prior to reaching lysosomes (18Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). We predicted that there was a motif that targets vesicle localization in the region surrounding amino acid 888. Inspection of the sequence in this region revealed a potential tyrosine-based vesicle localization motif, YXXΦ (residues 888-893, where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid) (21Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Truncation mutants containing the YXXΦ motif were localized intracellularly and in vesicles (TacTIR9Δ898, Tac-TIR9Δ902). However, truncation mutants lacking the YXXΦ motif were redistributed to the cell surface, supporting our hypothesis that the cytoplasmic tail of TLR9 contains a tyrosine-based vesicle-targeting motif. Bacterial DNA, a potent stimulus of TLR9, is contained within microorganisms and becomes accessible for recognition only after lysis in phagolysosomes. It has been shown that TLR9 co-localizes with CpG DNA in cytoplasmic vesicles but resides in the ER prior to exposure to CpG DNA (5Takeshita F. Leifer C.A. Gursel I. Ishii K.J. Takeshita S. Gursel M. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3555-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 13Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 19Leifer C.A. Kennedy M.N. Mazzoni A. Lee C. Kruhlak M.J. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that TLR9 reaches the endocytic pathway through direct fusion of the ER with the CpG DNA containing endosome (18Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). What remains unknown is how the localization and movement of TLR9 is orchestrated. Here we show that both the ecto- and TIR domains of TLR9 contain sufficient information for intracellular localization and trafficking, and we have identified a specific region within the TIR domain that contributes to intracellular localization and to vesicle targeting. By creating C-terminal truncation mutants in the Tac-TIR9 chimera we identified a 14-amino acid stretch between residues tyrosine 888 and tryptophan 902 (Fig. 2) responsible for intracellular localization. The region contains a tyrosine-based vesicletargeting motif, YNEL. Truncation of this motif leads to a loss in vesicular localization and redistribution to the cell surface. Recent data from other laboratories support the idea that the transmembrane domain of mouse TLR9 controls intracellular localization (26Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 27Kajita E. Nishiya T. Miwa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have been unable to reproduce these data. Neither FLAG-tagged mouse nor the untagged human TLR9-4 chimera (TLR91-817TLR4634-835) was detected on the cell surface in HEK293, HEK293T, MEF, or HeLa cells (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4 and data not shown). We failed to detect surface expression or mature glycoforms even if the chimera junction, like the previously described chimera, was seven amino acids upstream of the TM domain (TLR91-810TLR4625-835). Furthermore, we generated a soluble TLR9 ectodomain and found that it was also retained in the ER, 4C. A. Leifer, personal observation. suggesting that sequences in the ectodomain associate with chaperones or other luminal proteins to effect TLR9 ER localization. In our hands, a chimera containing the TM and cytoplasmic tail of TLR9 was localized like wild type. However, when most or all of the cytoplasmic tail was truncated from this mutant, the chimera was redistributed to the cell surface (Fig. 3) ruling out any role for the transmembrane domain in TLR9 localization. Finally, the region that we identified in the cytoplasmic tail could confer, at least partially, intracellular retention to the normally surface-expressed TLR4 in the context of either the Tac fusion or the full-length wild type TLR4. The redistribution of the TLR4-9-4 chimera to a mostly intracellular form eliminated the ability of TLR4 to recognize LPS. The three-dimensional structure of the TLR9 TIR domain can be inferred by homology with the known structures of the TLR1, TLR2, and IL-1 receptor-associated protein TIR domains (28Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Khan J.A. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31664-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 highlights the 888-902 region (blue) on the predicted TIR domain structure of TLR9. This region lies on the surface in the first α-helix and the loop that connects the first helix with the second β-strand. Contiguous with this region is the BB loop, which contains a proline residue that is essential for signal transduction in most TLRs. In TLR2 this conserved proline is required for the binding of the TLR2-TIR domain to MyD88 (28Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, the proline is dispensable for TLR4 binding to MyD88 and MAL (30Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Ludidi P.L. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41443-41451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). If the TLR9 BB loop interacts with MyD88, as in TLR2, then the recruitment of MyD88 to TLR9 might influence the intracellular localization of TLR9 by interfering with its ability to interact with cytoplasmic localization adapter molecules. If the BB loop is not involved in TLR9-TIR binding to MyD88, as in TLR4, other adapter protein binding or receptor oligomerization may change the structure of the cytoplasmic tail in the region containing the BB loop and thus influence the ability of cytoplasmic localization adapter molecules to bind. Although TLR9 is in the ER prior to stimulation and found in lysosomes with CpG DNA at later time points, how TLR9 traffics is not clear. One mechanism by which this might occur is the direct fusion of TLR9-containing ER with early endosomes that contain CpG DNA (18Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a CpG DNA-dependent signal upstream may induce the trafficking of TLR9 to the endosomal compartment. Previous results suggest that the TLR9 TIR domain may be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to CpG stimulation (31Sanjuan M.A. Rao N. Lai K.T. Gu Y. Sun S. Fuchs A. Fung-Leung W.P. Colonna M. Karlsson L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but we have been unable to detect phosphorylation of tyrosine 888.4 Tyrosine 888 of TLR9 is not conserved in other intracellularly localized TLRs (TLRs 3, 7, and 8). Therefore, it is not clear whether tyrosine 888 plays a structural role in the formation of the localization site or serves a recognition function specific for TLR9. Although the surface receptor that would induce TLR-independent CpG DNA signaling events is unknown, surface recognition of CpG DNA by plasmacytoid dendritic cells has recently been shown to involve CXCL16 (32Gursel M. Gursel I. Mostowski H.S. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In summary, our data support a model in which a tyrosinebased localization motif in the cytoplasmic tail of TLR9 is involved in trafficking of TLR9 to early endosomes where CpG DNA signaling initiates through TLR9. Further studies are needed to identify which cellular proteins interact with the tyrosine motif and control TLR9 localization and trafficking. How this trafficking relates to the release of DNA following uptake of pathogens remains to be determined. We thank Drs. Remy Bosselut and Juan Bonifacino for plasmids used in this study.

Here, we identified several cis-acting sites, TAATTG, TAGTTG, and TAATTA as NOBOX DNA binding elements (NBEs) using a library of randomly generated oligonucleotides by cyclic amplification of sequence target assay and mutation analyses. We show that NOBOX preferentially binds to the NOBOX binding elements with high affinity. In addition, we found that promoter regions of mouse Pou5f1 and Gdf9 contain one (–426) and three NOBOX binding elements (–786, –967, and –1259), respectively. NOBOX binds to these putative NOBOX binding elements with high affinity and augmented transcriptional activity of luciferase reporter driven by mouse Pou5f1 and Gdf9 promoters containing the NOBOX binding elements.

Early ovarian folliculogenesis begins with the breakdown of germ cell clusters and the formation of primordial follicles, the reservoir of oocytes during reproductive lifespan of mammals. In mice, formation of primordial follicles begins soon after birth. Primordial follicles are the smallest ovarian follicle units and continuously recruited to grow into primary follicles. During early folliculogenesis, transcription of numerous oocyte-specific genes such as zona pellucida (Zp) 2The abbreviations used are: Zp, zona pellucida protein; NOBOX, newborn ovary homeobox protein; POU5f1, POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1; Gdf9, growth differentiation factor 9; POU, Pit-Oct-Unc family; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAST, cyclic amplification of sequence target analysis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NX, Nobox; NXHD, Nobox homeodomain; NXNT, Nobox N terminus; NXCT, Nobox C terminus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; NBE, NOBOX DNA binding element; mNBE, mutant NOBOX DNA binding element; GAL4DBD, GAL4 DNA binding domain; UAS, upstream activation sequence; PGC, primordial germ cell; DE, distal enhancer; PE, proximal enhancer; TNAP, Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase. 2The abbreviations used are: Zp, zona pellucida protein; NOBOX, newborn ovary homeobox protein; POU5f1, POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1; Gdf9, growth differentiation factor 9; POU, Pit-Oct-Unc family; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAST, cyclic amplification of sequence target analysis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NX, Nobox; NXHD, Nobox homeodomain; NXNT, Nobox N terminus; NXCT, Nobox C terminus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; NBE, NOBOX DNA binding element; mNBE, mutant NOBOX DNA binding element; GAL4DBD, GAL4 DNA binding domain; UAS, upstream activation sequence; PGC, primordial germ cell; DE, distal enhancer; PE, proximal enhancer; TNAP, Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase. 1, 2, and 3 (Zp1, Zp2, and Zp3), growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), and Pou5f1 (Oct4) commences (1Dean J.

We recently reported a novel homeobox containing germ cell-specific transcription factor NOBOX (6Rajkovic A. Pangas S.A. Ballow D. Suzumori N. Matzuk M.M.

Nobox transcripts are detectable as early as E15.5 in the embryonic ovaries and beyond (6Rajkovic A. Pangas S.A. Ballow D. Suzumori N. Matzuk M.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1157-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Nobox mRNA and protein are preferentially expressed in oocytes of germ cell cysts and in primordial and growing oocytes throughout different stages of folliculogenesis (6Rajkovic A. Pangas S.A.

Ballow D. Suzumori N. Matzuk M.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1157-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Newborn ovary histology in Nobox knock-out and wild-type female mice is grossly similar, but differs significantly at the molecular level. Numerous genes preferentially expressed in the oocytes, including Gdf9 and Oct4 are down-regulated in oocytes that lack Nobox. However, it is unknown whether NOBOX directly or indirectly regulates transcription of these oocyte-specific genes during development of the ovarian follicle.In the present study, we identified DNA sequences that NOBOX binds and show that NOBOX can transactivate luciferase reporters via the NOBOX DNA binding element (NBE). In addition, we describe identification of NBEs in promoters of mouse Oct4 and Gdf9. These observations suggest that NOBOX directly regulates the expression of oocyte-specific genes, Oct4 and Gdf9, during early folliculogenesis in the mouse ovary.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of GST-NXHD—To create the pET41b-Nobox homeodomain protein (GST-NXHD) and bacterial expression construct, the insert was amplified by PCR using primers containing EcoRI and HindIII sites, and cloned into pET41b-EcoRI/HindIII (Novagen, Madison, WI). We verified the sequences of the resulting GST-NXHD fusion constructs to ensure that no mutations have been introduced during cloning. For creating GST-NXHD (N185Q) mutation proteins, the GST-NXHD construct vector was mutated using QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and its mutated sequences were verified. We transformed BL21-pLysS Escherichia coli (Stratagene) with GST-NXHD and GST-NXHD(N185Q) constructs and expressed them by inoculating Luria-Bertani media containing 20 μgml–1 kanamycin with overnight culture (1:20 dilution) at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. Protein expression was induced at 30 °C with 2 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to A600 of 1.0. We stored cell pellets at –80 °C, thawed and lysed them with BugBuster lysis buffer (Novagen). We purified the GST-NXHD and GST-NXHD (N185Q) fusion proteins with GST bind resin (Novagen), dialyzed them three times in 1 liter of phosphate-buffered saline and quantified them. Purified proteins were stored at –80 °C until use.Tissue Extract—Ovaries from wild-type and Nobox-null newborn mice were collected and homogenized in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA. Homogenized ovary tissues were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifuging, the supernatant was transferred into new tubes. Samples were stored at –80 °C until use.Plasmids—The pGL3-promoter vector with SV40 promoter (Promega) was used for constructing luciferase reporter vectors carrying 3xNBE and 3xmNBE. The pGL3-basic vector lacked SV40 promoter (Promega) was used to subclone amplified Oct4 and Gdf9 promoters. Oct4 or Gdf9 NBEs were mutated using QuickChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit. Overexpression vector carrying the mouse Nobox were constructed by cloning the full-length of Nobox cDNA into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The pBIND vector (Promega) was used to construct plasmids carrying the full-length or truncated of Nobox cDNAs. Full-length and partial NOBOX cDNAs were fused after GAL4DBD in-frame and verified by sequencing. The expression of the constructs in mammalian cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-GAL4DBD monoclonal antibody (SantaCruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed in 20-μl reaction mixtures at room temperature at a final concentration of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5 μg/ml poly(dI)-poly(dC), and 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. EMSA probes were prepared by end-filling annealed primers with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase (Invitrogen). Binding reactions were conducted by incubating 32P-labeled probes (250,000 cpm/reaction) with 50 ng of purified proteins or 1 μg of ovarian extract in the absence and presence of polyclonal anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) or polyclonal anti-NOBOX antibody (6Rajkovic A. Pangas S.A. Ballow D. Suzumori N. Matzuk M.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1157-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For competition assay, purified proteins were incubated at room temperature with cold competitors for 15 min before addition of the 32P-labeled probe.Cyclic Amplification of Sequence Target (CAST) Analysis—The CAST assay was carried out essentially as previously described with some modifications (9Kim D.W. Kempf H. Chen R.E. Lassar A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27532-27539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purified GST-NXHD proteins and GST-bind resin (Novagen) were used for the CAST assay. Binding reactions for CAST were performed in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris. pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5% sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). 0.5 pmol of short double-stranded DNA containing a 15-bp random sequence flanked by 20-bp fixed sequences, CAST oligonucleotides (Table 1), was incubated with 100 ng of purified GST-NXHD protein for 20 min at room temperature. Unbound DNAs were washed away with binding reaction buffer. Bound DNAs were amplified by PCR for the next round of CAST. A total of five cycles of CAST were performed. Final PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The inserted DNAs were sequenced and scored to get the consensus sequences.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides for CAST, EMSA and PCRNameSequencesCAST-oligo5′-GAG TCC AGC GAA TTC TGT CG- (N) 15-CG ACA GAA TTC GCT GGA CTC-3′CAST-Left5′-GAG TCC AGC GAA TTC TGT CG-3′CAST-Right5′-GTT GAC ACT CTC GAG GAC TC-3′NBE(TAATTG)5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′AAATTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT AAA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′CAATTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT CAA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′GAATTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT GAA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TTATTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TTA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TCATTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TCA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TGATTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TGA TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TATTTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAT TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TACTTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAC TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAGTTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAG TTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAAATG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA ATG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAACTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA CTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAAGTG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA GTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAATAG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TAG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAATCG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TCG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAATGG5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TGG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAATTT5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TTT GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAATTA5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TTA GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′TAATTC5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA TTC GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′Nk×2.1(CAATTG)5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT CAA GTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′Nk×3.1(TAAGTA)5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA GTA GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′Nk×3.2(TAAGTG)5′-ACG AGC TAC CTT ACT TAA GTG GAC GTT GAA CGC GTA CTG T-3′3×NBE5′-ACG AGG TAC CTT ACT TAA TTG GAC GTG TCT TAA TTG GAC GTA GCC TTA ATT GGA CGA CGT TGA ACG CGT ACT GT-3′3×mNBE5′-ACG AGG TAC CTT ACT TAG GCG GAC GTG TCT TAG GCG GAC GTA GCC TTA GGC GGA CGA CGT TGA ACG CGT ACT GT-3′Gdf9-P1-Left5′-GTG TAG GTC AGA AGA CGA GCT GTA-3′Gdf9-P1-Right5′-AGG ACA TCA CCT TTA ACT TTG AGC-3′Gdf9-C1-Left5′-TTT TAG TCA GCT CAA ATG GGA CAA-3′Gdf9-C1-Right5′-GTG CAC CTC GTA GCT ATC ATG TCT-3′Oct4-P1-Left5′-CTA AAC TCT GGA GGA CTG GAG GT-3′Oct4-P1-Right5′-ACA CCT CAC AAA CCA GTT GCT-3′Oct4-C1-Left5′-GTA TGA GGC TAC AGG GAC ACC TTT-3′Oct4-C1-Right5′-GCT CCA GGT TCT CTT GTC TAC CTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection, FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 h before harvest. For each transfection, 200 ng of reporter construct, 200 ng of the indicated expression plasmid, and 20 ng of pRT-TK normalization plasmid were used per single well of a 12-well plate. Dual luciferse assays were carried out with total cell extracts as recommended by Promega. All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate, and results were normalized to the expression of the Renilla luciferase.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Mouse newborn ovaries were collected and fixed directly by adding 27 μl of 37% formaldehyde to 1 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). The fixed ovaries were washed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline two times, homogenized into 4 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitors) and prepared for immunoprecipitation using the modified protocol of ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The samples were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and incubated with either 10 μlof goat anti-Nobox antibody or IgG at 4 °C overnight. Chromatin samples immunoprecipitated by salmon sperm DNA/protein beads were washed two times with 1 ml of low salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), once with 1 ml of high salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), once with 1 ml of LiCl immune complex wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, IGE-PAL-CA630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and two times with 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were eluted from the antibody by adding 500 μl of elution buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). The complex DNA cross-links were reversed by adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and heating at 65 °C for 4 h followed by adding 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) for 1 h at 45°C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Ethanol-precipitated DNA pellets were re-dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer. The supernatant of an immunoprecipitation reaction done in the absence of anti-NOBOX antibody was purified and used as a control. PCR analysis was carried out using primers corresponding to promoter regions of the Oct4 and Gdf9 genes. The sequences of the PCR primers are shown in Table 1. After 33 cycles of amplification (all primer sets), PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels and analyzed.RESULTSWe determined a consensus DNA binding sequence for NOBOX using the CAST assay as previously described (10Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 11Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We used a predicted homeodomain portion of NOBOX (aa 134–214) fused to GST-NXHD. DNA sequences that bound GST-NXHD went through five cycles of CAST. The 38 selected sequences for GST-NXHD were aligned (Fig. 1A) and scored (Fig. 1B). The most frequently observed sequences are shown in Fig. 1B based on the percentage occurrence of each base at each position from 58 to 97%. CAST assay revealed a consensus sequence, TAATTG (Fig. 1B), as the NBE.We next confirmed the interaction between NBE and GST-NXHD using EMSA. Using a competitive binding assay (Fig. 2A), GST-NXHD protein bound to the labeled probe (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The bound complex was competed out by 10-fold and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled cold competitors containing TAATTG (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). To further confirm the identity of these shifted bands, anti-GST antibody was added to the binding reaction in the absence or presence of GST-NXHD or GST protein. As shown in Fig. 2B, the anti-GST antibody further shifted the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2B, lane 4). A number of homeoproteins including Msx-1, Nkx2.1, Nkx3.1, and Nkx3.2 contain a conserved asparagine residue (N) in the homeodomain (Fig. 2C). This conserved asparagine residue is critical for interaction of DNA base pairs and various homeodomains (12Fraenkel E. Pabo C.O. Nat. Struct.

A missense mutation of this asparagine (N) to glutamine (Q) has been shown to reduce DNA binding activity in many homeoproteins (9Kim D.W. Kempf H. Chen R.E. Lassar A.B. J. Biol.

A point mutation of NOBOX (N185Q) was generated and used to investigate whether GST-NXHD (N185Q) can bind to the NBE sequences in vitro. Purified GST-NXHD (N185Q) was incubated with 32P-labeled NBE probe and binding was analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2D, GST-NXHD (N185Q) failed to interact with the 32P-labeled NBE probe, but GST-NXHD formed complexes with the NBE probe. These results suggest that the homeodomain is critical for DNA binding activity.FIGURE 2NOBOX binds to the NBE with high affinity. A, 32P-labeled NBE probes containing TAATTG were incubated with purified recombinant GST-NXHD. A 10-fold or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled TAATTG sequence was used as competitor.

Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but slightly different from the binding sites of other homeoproteins such as CAAGTG for TITF1 (19Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO. J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), TAAGTA for NKX3-1 (20Steadman D.J. Giuffrida D. Gelmann E.P. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2000; 28: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and TAAGTG for BAPX1 (9Kim D.W. Kempf H. Chen R.E. Lassar A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27532-27539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We examined whether NOBOX can also bind to these consensus sequences. Increasing amounts of purified GST-NXHD protein incubated with 32P-labeled probes containing these related sequences, TAATTG, CAAGTG, TAAGTA, or TAAGTG were analyzed using EMSA. At high concentration (100 ng), GST-NXHD protein bound to these related sequences with low affinity compared with the NBE (Fig. 3A). In contrast, NOBOX bound to the NBE with high affinity relative to other related sequences at low concentration (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that NOBOX preferentially binds to the NBE sequence. To examine the effect of variation of each base pair of the NBE sequence, we incubated GST-NXHD with a labeled NBE probe (TAATTG) and added a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides, which are different from NBE sequence by a single base pair substitution in each position. We found that the DNA-protein complex was competed out by two NBE-related sequences, TAGTTG and TAATTA, containing G in the 3rd position or A in the 6th position, respectively (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the binding specificity for the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th position is invariant. The variation of 3rd position was not expected, however, the variation of 6th position was consistent with the result of CAST assay, because the occurrence of the A at the 6th position is 37% (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that TAGTTG and TAATTA are other consensus sequences for NOBOX DNA binding (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3NOBOX binds to the NBE and NBE-related sequences in vitro. A, 10 ng (lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14), 50 ng (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15), or 100 ng (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16) of purified GST-NXHD proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled probes containing TAATTG (lanes 1–4), CAAGTG (lanes 5–8), TAAGTA (lanes 9–12), or TAAGTG (lanes 13–16). NBE oligonucleotide sequence is shown in Table 1. B, purified GST-NXHD proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled probes containing TAATTG in the either the absence (lane 2) or the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either the NBE or sequences different from the NBE sequence at each position.

To identify these shifted bands, anti-NOBOX antibody or pre-immune serum was added to the binding reaction. As shown in Fig. 4, the NBE-protein complex formed using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing TAATTG incubated with ovarian extract from wild-type newborn mice, but not from Nobox-null mice. Anti-NOBOX antibody shifted the DNA-protein complex (lane 3 in Fig. 4). We obtained similar results using NBE-related sequence, TAATTA.FIGURE 4Wild-type newborn ovarian extracts bind NBE.

TAATTG containing NBE oligonucleotide sequence is shown in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether NOBOX can regulate the expression of NBE-driven reporter gene in vivo, we constructed two luciferase reporter vectors containing either three NBE (TAATTG), 3xNBE-pGL3, or mutant NBE (TAGGCG), 3xmNBE-pGL3 upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. These reporter vectors were co-transfected with either empty vector (pCDNA3.1) or NOBOX expression vector (pCDNA3.1-NX) into HEK293 cells. The relative luciferase activity of reporter constructs containing three copies of TAATTG was increased by 4-fold with NOBOX overexpression (Fig. 5A). However, the level of transcriptional activation of reporter constructs containing three copies of mutated NBE (TAGGCG) was not affected by NOBOX overexpression. These data suggest that NOBOX can transactivate reporter genes through the NBE.FIGURE 5NOBOX transactivates through the NBE and the C terminus of NOBOX contains transactivational activity. A, the pCDNA3 or pCDNA3-NX was co-transfected with either 3xNBE-pGL3 or 3xmNBE-pGL3 luciferase reporter vector into HEK293 cells. Cell extracts were collected after 48 h of transfection and analyzed for luciferase activity. The black box indicates the wild-type 3xNBE (TAATTG) and the white box indicates the mutated 3xmNBE (TAGGCG). Oligonucleotide sequence is shown in Table 1.

GAL4DBD represents GAL4 DNA binding domain. C, the full-length and truncated NOBOX proteins fused with GAL4DBD were transfected into HEK293 cells and cellular proteins were extracted in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blot analysis with anti-GAL4DBD monoclonal antibody. D, GAL4DBD vector containing the full-length and truncated NOBOX was co-transfected with 5xUAS-TATA-luciferase reporter vector into HEK293 cells.

These constructs were co-transfected with 5xUAS-TATA-luciferase vector into HEK293 cells. The relative fold increase of luciferase activity is shown in Fig. 5D. GAL4-CT containing the C terminus of NOBOX significantly increased the luciferase activity. In contrast, the luciferase activity was not affected by GAL4-NT and GAL4-HD containing the N terminus and the homeodomain of NOBOX, respectively. Therefore, the C terminus possesses the activation domain of NOBOX.We showed previously that Nobox deficiency disrupts the expression of several oocyte-specific genes, including Gdf9 and Oct4. Gdf9 is expressed early in the oocyte (3Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rajkovic A. Pangas S.A.

Injection of recombinant plant 14-3-3 proteins into oocytes shifted the activation curve of KAT1 by +11 mV and increased the τon. KAT1 was also modulated by 14-3-3 proteins of Xenopus oocytes. Titration of the endogenous 14-3-3 proteins by injection of the peptide Raf 621p resulted in a strong decrease in KAT1 current (∼70% at –150 mV). The mutation K56E performed on plant protein 14-3-3 in a highly conserved recognition site prevented channel activation. Because the maximal conductance of KAT1 was unaffected by 14-3-3, we can exclude that they act by increasing the number of channels, thus ruling out any effect of these proteins on channel trafficking and/or insertion into the oocyte membrane. 14-3-3 proteins also increased KAT1 current in inside-out patches, suggesting a direct interaction with the channel.

Voltage-dependent (Kv) potassium channels mediate an inward K+ current (IKin) at the plasma membrane of plant cells. IKin serves several functions: controlling membrane voltage, nutrient uptake, and osmotic regulation. In guard cells onset of this current typically leads to K+ accumulation triggering stomatal opening (1Schroeder J.I. Hedrich R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1984; 338: 427-430Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 2MacRobbie E.A. Philos Trans. R. Soc. London B Biol. Sci. 1998; 1374: 1475-1488Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Thiel G.

The molecular characterization of guard cell IKin started in 1992 with the cloning of KAT1 (4Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1992; 258: 1654-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the first Kv channel subunit from Arabidopsis thaliana, and still is a subject of intensive research. One unsolved problem in this field is the rationale for the existence of a large number of K+ channel genes with apparently similar characteristics. Five genes coding for inward K+ channel subunits have so far been found to be expressed in guard cells, KAT1, KAT2, AKT1, AKT3/2, and AtKC1 (6Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Dietrich P. Roelfsema M.R. Ache P. Reintanz B. Deeken R. Godde M. Felle H. Steinmeyer R. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When heterologously expressed, none of these genes alone forms a channel that fully matches the properties of native IKin with respect to pH, Ca2+ dependence, and block by Cs+ (7Brüggemann L. Dietrich P. Dreyer I. Hedrich R. Planta. 1999; 207: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This suggests that the native channel might be composed of different subunits and/or that additional regulatory proteins contribute to native IKin current. KAT1 can form heteromultimers with each of the four other K+ channel subunits expressed in guard cells (8Dreyer I. Antunes S. Hoshi T. Muller-Rober B. Palme K. Pongs O. Reintanz B. Hedrich R.

At least in the case of KAT1 and KAT2, two very similar proteins (displaying 85% identity in their transmembrane region), the heteromeric channel does not have properties distinguishable from the homomeric channels. It is relevant that the C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of the two channels display the lowest level of sequence similarities; these regions are typically regulatory domains in Kv channels and often provide specific interaction sites with regulatory proteins (11Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, MA2001: 201-236Google Scholar). Known protein partners of plant Kv channels are β subunits (12Tang H. Vasconcelos A.C. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1545-1553PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinases, and phosphatases (13Chérel I. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent contributions have now extended information on the regulatory effect of 14-3-3 proteins. These are a family of highly conserved proteins with molecular mass of 30 kDa, expressed in all eukaryotic organisms. They exist in a number of isoforms and form homo- and heterodimers. 14-3-3 proteins play a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes, such as cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, and mitogenic signal transduction (14Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The common feature of 14-3-3s is their ability to bind phosphorylated consensus motifs on target proteins (15Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 16Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J.

In plants it has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins accomplish peculiar functions, such as regulation of ion transport, through interaction with the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (17Aducci P. Camoni L. Marra M. Visconti S. IUBMB Life. 2002; 53: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, increasing evidence suggests that besides the H+-ATPase 14-3-3s can also regulate K+ channels. In fact, they have been shown to interact with plant K+ outward rectifiers (18Saalbach G. Schwerdel M. Natura G. Buschmann P. Christov V. Dahse I.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and K+ inward rectifiers (20van den Wijngaard P.W. Sinnige M.P. Roobeek I. Reumer A. Schoonheim P.J. Mol J.N. Wang M. de Boer A.H. Plant J. 2005; 41: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The effect of 14-3-3 proteins on K+ inward rectifiers has so far only been reported for native channels. Because these studies have not yet exploited the question of subunit specificity, we have tested the possibility that 14-3-3 proteins interact with the guard cell subunit KAT1. Here we show that the homotetrameric KAT1 channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes is modulated by 14-3-3 proteins via a direct interaction with the channel protein and that this interaction changes the voltage-dependent properties and the activation kinetics of the channel. We also show that KAT1 is regulated by the interaction with endogenous 14-3-3 proteins present in the oocyte. Expression of KAT1 in Oocytes—KAT1 cDNA was cloned into pSGEM vector (a modified version of pGEM-HE). cRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and injected (25 ng/oocyte) into Xenopus laevis oocytes prepared according to standard methods (22Véry A.A. Gaymard F. Bosseux C. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.B. Plant J. 1995; 7: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed 2–4 days after injection. The average diameter of the oocytes (stage IV and V) was considered to be 1 mm, and on this basis we have calculated the final concentration of injected 14-3-3 proteins and peptides when mentioned in the text. Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) under control of pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.4–0.8 MΩ in 50 mm KCl. Experiments were performed at room temperature in a standard bath solution containing (mm): 50 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, at a rate of 2 ml min–1. Mannitol was used to adjust the osmolarity of the solution to 215 mosmol. The standard clamp protocol consisted of a holding voltage of –40 mV and steps from –60 to –180 mV. Current/voltage relations report the experimentally measured voltages, which can slightly deviate from command voltages. Patch clamp recordings were made using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) with borosilicate pipettes coated with paraffin wax. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with pCLAMP 5.5 software (Axon Instruments). Linear leak subtraction was performed manually after acquisition. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). The external solution contained (mm): 100 KCl, 2 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES (N-methyl-d-glucosamine), pH 7.2. The internal solution contained (mm): 100 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 ATP (disodium salt), 10 EGTA/KOH, pH 7.2, and 10 HEPES (N-methyl-d-glucosamine), pH 7.2. Data Analysis—Activation curves were fitted by a Boltzmann equation as shown in Equation 1po=1/{1+exp[(V−V1/2)/s]}(Eq. 1) where po is fractional activation (equivalent to the channel open probability normalized to the maximum open probability), V is voltage, V½ is the half-activation voltage, and s the inverse slope coefficient (23DiFrancesco D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 367-376Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4E the tail current values are plotted as absolute. Escherichia coli Strains—E. coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid propagation, and strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS was used for protein expression. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani liquid medium or agar plates (15 g/liter). Ampicillin was used at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Expression and Purification of Recombinant 14-3-3 Proteins—The maize 14-3-3 isoform GF14-6 was expressed in E. coli as GST fusion protein as already described (24Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). K56E GF14-6 mutant was produced and expressed as previously described (25Visconti S. Camoni L. Fullone M.R. Lalle M. Marra M. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For production of His-tagged GF14-6, a cDNA fragment was removed from pGEX-2TK, using a 5′-NcoI restriction site and a 3′-EcoRI restriction site, and inserted into NcoI-EcoRI-cut pET-32B vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), previously deprived of the thioredoxin coding region by NdeI digestion. Transformation of E. coli was performed according to standard methods. Induction of protein expression was performed by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to liquid cultures. After 3 h of induction, cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.75% N-lauryl sarcosine and sonicated until a clear, non-viscous solution was obtained (26Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g), and the soluble fraction was used for protein purification. His-GF14-6 was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm imidazole; after extensive washing, protein was eluted by addition of increasing concentrations (50, 100, 200, 400 mm) of imidazole to the above described buffer. Fractions containing the purified fusion protein were extensively dialyzed against 5 mm bis-tris propane-Hepes, pH 7, in 10% (v/v) glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Raf 621p—Raf 621p is 15 amino acids long (LPKINRSASpEPSLHR), corresponding to amino acids 613–627 of Raf 1 (15Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Serine 621 is phosphorylated. The sequence highlighted in bold mimics the mode I recognition site of 14-3-3 proteins (16Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Isolation of Oocyte Membranes—Membrane fractions were obtained according to De Jong et al. with minor modifications (27De Jong J.C. Van Der Vliet W.A. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 40 control or KAT1-expressing oocytes were homogenized in 800 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin and centrifuged two times for 10 min at 3000 × g at 4 °C to remove yolk proteins. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. SDS-PAGE and Overlay Assay—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) in a Mini Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). The system used for expression of GF14-6 proteins produces a glutathione S-transferase-fused 14-3-3 containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and a thrombin site between the two polypeptides. The 32P-labeled GF14-6 was obtained as described (24Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specific activity of the labeled protein was 3 MBq/mg. The overlay assay was carried out according to Ref. 24Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Briefly, 20 μg of membrane fractions from KAT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, using a semidry LKB apparatus (2 h, 0.8 mA cm–2). The membrane was blocked with 5% fatty acid-free milk in 25 mm Hepes-OH, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5 (buffer H) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing 2% fatty acid-free milk, 3 μg of 32P-labeled GF14-6 (corresponding to 9 kBq/ml). After incubation, the membrane was washed three times with buffer H, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at –80 °C. The overlay experiment was performed three times, and similar results were obtained. Recombinant 14-3-3 Proteins Increase the Activity of KAT1 Channels Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—Fig. 1A shows the current traces recorded from KAT1 channels expressed in a Xenopus oocyte. Clamping the oocyte with a voltage step protocol ranging from –60 mV (holding potential) to –150 mV, elicited the slowly activating, inward K+ currents IKAT1 typical of this channel (5Schachtman D. Schroeder J.I. Lucas W.J. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. Science. 1992; 258: 1654-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The measured current values were stable over time; when monitored over a period of >30 min they varied by <1% (not shown). To examine the effect of 14-3-3 proteins on KAT1 currents the same oocyte was removed from the voltage clamp apparatus and injected with 46 nl of a buffer containing 4 mg/ml of purified recombinant 14-3-3 proteins from maize GF14-6 (final concentration in the oocyte ∼1 μm). The oocyte was kept 10 min at room temperature to recover from the injection and to allow 14-3-3 diffusion and challenged with the same voltage protocol used prior to injection. Fig. 1A shows a strong increase in KAT1 current after 14-3-3 injection. The steady state current/voltage (I/V) 2The abbreviation used is: I/V, current/voltage. relationship of the currents from Fig. 1A are shown in 1B. Fig. 1C shows the mean I/V relationship from 10 oocytes from three different batches. The increase in current induced by 14-3-3 is voltage dependent; at –110 mV the current is increased by 200% (control, –0.36 ± 0.02 μA; 14-3-3, –1.1 ± 0.24 μA), whereas at –140 mV is increased by 100% (control, –5.1 ± 0.7 μA; 14-3-3, –10.3 ± 2.3 μA). To test the specificity of the 14-3-3 effect on IKAT1 we performed several control experiments, summarized in Fig. 2. The effect of injection of 14-3-3 on IKAT1, at the reference voltage of –120 mV, is compared with that of heat-denatured 14-3-3 proteins, buffer only, and 14-3-3 proteins bearing the K56E mutation. This mutation, lysine 56 replaced by glutamic acid, is known to disrupt the interaction with target proteins, as shown with the plant proton pump (25Visconti S. Camoni L. Fullone M.R. Lalle M. Marra M. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In our experiments, K56E 14-3-3 proteins as well as heat-denatured wild-type proteins and resuspension buffer did not enhance IKAT1, indicating that the effect observed after 14-3-3 injection is specific and not related to injection artifacts. Because 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to modulate the endogenous Cl– channels in Xenopus oocytes (29Chan H.C. Wu W.L. So S.C. Chung Y.W. Tsang L.L. Wang X.F. Yan Y.C. Luk S.C. Siu S.S. Tsui S.K. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we tested whether the increase in inward current was entirely due to a stimulation of KAT1 channels. Fig. 3 shows that addition of 5 mm Cs+, a well known blocker of KAT1 channels (5Schachtman D. Schroeder J.I. Lucas W.J. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. Science. 1992; 258: 1654-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) with no known effect on Cl– channels, completely blocked the inward current after 14-3-3 stimulation. This shows that the stimulated current is KAT1 specific and is not due to a nonspecific effect on endogenous channels of the oocyte. 14-3-3 Proteins Activate KAT1 Channels by Shifting the Activation Curve—KAT1 is a voltage-gated channel, and its open probability strictly depends on voltage. The increase in current observed after injection of the 14-3-3 proteins can, in principle, result from a change in conductance or from a change in open probability. An increase in conductance due to an increase in the number of active channels at the plasma membrane is a means by which 14-3-3 proteins regulate ion channels in plants (19Booij P.P. Roberts M.R. Vogelzang S.A. Kraayenhof R. de Boer A.H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and animal cells; in particular, for animal channels it has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins modulate protein trafficking (30O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 31Yuan H. Michelsen K. Schwappach B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 638-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has also been shown that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the gating of animal and plant channels by shifting the activation curve, that is the plot of open probability over voltage (20van den Wijngaard P.W. Sinnige M.P. Roobeek I. Reumer A. Schoonheim P.J. Mol J.N. Wang M. de Boer A.H. Plant J. 2005; 41: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To discriminate between these two possible modes of action, it was necessary to check whether the maximal value of IKAT1 was affected by the 14-3-3 proteins. Therefore we had to measure the current of the fully activated channel, in the case of KAT1 at about –200 mV. Such negative voltages can be deleterious for the stability of the membrane; furthermore, they can trigger random activation of endogenous currents. Because the speed of IKAT1 activation increases at negative voltages (33Moroni A. Bardella L. Thiel G. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we made use of a protocol (shown in Fig. 4A) that progressively reduces the length of the voltage steps at negative potentials; in this case we obtained all the essential kinetic information without any unnecessary long and potentially deleterious polarization of the membrane. Fig. 4B shows a control experiment in which the full activation of KAT1 was achieved. The amplitude of the tail current from the last preconditioning voltage (–196 mV) is the same as that from the preconditioning voltage of –186 mV. This indicates that KAT1 channels had reached full open probability at –186 mV and that our protocol that steps at –200 mV serves the purpose of measuring the current at full activation. Fig. 4C shows exemplary current traces recorded from the same oocyte before and after injection of 14-3-3. 14-3-3 proteins increased IKAT1 at the test voltage of –150 mV but had no effect on the amount of current measured at the fully activating voltage of –200 mV. This is also shown by the current/voltage relationships of Fig. 4D, where the control and 14-3-3-treated curves converge to the same value at negative potentials. These data indicate that 14-3-3 proteins do not act by increasing the maximal conductance but rather by changing the voltage dependence of gating. To check the effect of 14-3-3 proteins on gating, we analyzed the channel open probability, plotting the initial value of the tail currents (changed in sign) over the preconditioning voltages (Fig. 4E). By fitting a Boltzmann curve to the data we obtained in control conditions a value for the midpoint of the open probability curve (V½) of –155 mV and for the inverse slope factor coefficient (s) of –13 mV. The rather negative V½ value was in the range reported previously for KAT1 in oocytes (33Moroni A. Bardella L. Thiel G. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Bruggemann L. Dietrich P. Becker D. Dreyer I.I. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3298-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After 14-3-3 protein injection, the V½ shifted by 12 mV to –143 mV and the inverse slope factor coefficient was –14 mV. The maximal current value obtained by the Boltzmann fit was 3.57 μA in both cases, again confirming that 14-3-3 did not affect the maximal conductance but only the open probability. Averaging normalized open probability curves (Fig. 4F)(n = 15 oocytes from seven independent experiments) shows that 14-3-3 shifted the V½ by 11 mV, from –146 to –135 mV while s was unchanged (–13 mV). The increase in current observed in response to 14-3-3 protein injection can hence be explained by a positive shift of the activation curve of the channel. The findings that 14-3-3 proteins act directly on a channel protein by altering its voltage dependence is in agreement with that reported for the native inward rectifier from radicle protoplasts (20van den Wijngaard P.W. Sinnige M.P. Roobeek I. Reumer A. Schoonheim P.J. Mol J.N. Wang M. de Boer A.H. Plant J. 2005; 41: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Also in this case, an elevation of 14-3-3 protein concentration on the cytosolic side of the membrane resulted in a positive shift in the activation curve of the channel by ∼9 mV. To further test whether a positive shift of 11 mV in the channel open probability is sufficient to explain the reported increase in KAT1 current in response to elevation of 14-3-3 proteins, we used the aforementioned Boltzmann parameters V½ and s to reconstruct the measured current/voltage relation. As shown in Equation 2, the cell current (I) isI=i×N×Po(Eq. 2) where i is the single channel current amplitude of KAT1, N the number of channels in the membrane, and Po the open probability. The curves in Fig. 1C were calculated using a unitary KAT1 channel conductance of 10 pS (36Zei P.C. Aldrich R.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 679-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with a reversal voltage at –18 mV and the respective values V½ and s from the Boltzmann fit reported in Fig. 4F. The curves were jointly fitted to the mean current/voltage relations obtained before and after injection of 14-3-3 proteins into oocytes (Fig. 1C); only the parameter N was used as a fitting variable. A very good agreement between data and calculation was obtained with an N of 1.3 106 channels. This means that the entire increase in current observed in response to 14-3-3 injection can be explained on the basis of a shift in the voltage dependence; an increase in the number of channels as a consequence of a 14-3-3 effect on channel trafficking was not needed to reproduce the data. We then checked whether the shift in the activation curve was accompanied by a change in channel kinetics. As expected, following 14-3-3 treatment IKAT1 activation was accelerated. Fig. 5A shows as an example current traces recorded at –130 mV before and after injection of 14-3-3. Traces have been normalized to show, qualitatively, current acceleration due to 14-3-3. Fig. 5B shows the time constant of activation (τon) plotted against voltage. The τon were estimated by fitting a single exponential function to current activation kinetics. At –130 mV mean τon (n = 6) was 486 ± 39 and 363 ± 18 ms for control and 14-3-3s, respectively. No apparent effect was observed on the τoff, obtained from the deactivation kinetics. The acceleration of activation kinetics together with the positive shift of the activation curve confirms that 14-3-3 proteins act by modifying the kinetic properties of IKAT1. 14-3-3 Proteins Act on KAT1 in a Membrane-delimited Way—To test whether KAT1 is modulated by 14-3-3 proteins independently of regulatory cellular pathways, we recorded IKAT1 from inside-out macropatches. In this way we could access the cytosolic side of the channel and at the same time remove the channel from the cytosolic environment. In excised patches IKAT1 undergoes a fast run down process, which shifts the voltage dependence of the channel (37Tang X.D. Hoshi T. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3089-3098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Run down of the KAT1 channel could be recovered by the addition of 3 mm ATP to the bath solution as described by Hoshi (37Tang X.D. Hoshi T. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3089-3098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this condition we were able to record KAT1 macrocurrents that were stable for the length of the experiment (several minutes) and allowed testing of the effect of 14-3-3 proteins (1 μm final concentration). Fig. 6A shows that addition of 14-3-3 increased IKAT1, as also shown by the steady state I/V relationship in Fig. 6B. A similar stimulation was observed in three of four patches; the mean I/V relationship of the positive responding patches is reported in Fig. 6C. The occurrence of a run down process in excised patches already indicates that KAT1 is regulated by cytoplasmic factors. Tang and Hoshi (37Tang X.D. Hoshi T. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3089-3098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that a protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation is responsible for the shift in the voltage-dependent gating observed on patch excision. In contrast, nonspecific alkaline phosphatase accelerated the run down time course. Among others, we can probably add 14-3-3 proteins as factors that seem to modulate the channel in a membrane-delimited pathway, given that the channel is in its active phosphorylated form. Endogenous 14-3-3 Modulate KAT1 Channels—Working with KAT1 channels expressed in oocytes we observed that the position of the activation curve along the voltage axis can vary greatly between experiments. The measured values of V½ varied in the range –150 to –120 mV. This variability is suggestive of an endogenous regulation of the channel, and therefore we tested the possibility that endogenous 14-3-3 proteins could modulate KAT1. To examine this possibility we compared currents from KAT1-expressing oocytes before (control) and after the injection of peptide Raf 621p (Fig. 7A). This phosphorylated peptide mimics the mode I recognition site of 14-3-3 proteins (16Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). When provided in large excess, it presumably titrates the endogenous 14-3-3 (see the use of this peptide in Refs. 15Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 20van den Wijngaard P.W. Sinnige M.P. Roobeek I. Reumer A. Schoonheim P.J. Mol J.N. Wang M. de Boer A.H. Plant J. 2005; 41: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. (Stuttg.). 2000; 1: 11-16Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The injection of this peptide strongly decreased the level of IKAT1 in oocytes (70% ± 6 at –150 mV, n = 4); in control experiments (data not shown) heat-inactivated Raf 621p decreased the current at –150 mV of 38% ± 4(n = 4). This is presumably because it is not possible to efficiently inactivate this short peptide by heating. As is apparent from the single experiment and the mean I/V curves of Fig. 7, B and C, the peptide acts by shifting the voltage dependence of the channel to more negative values. For this reason it is difficult to reach full activation of the channel in the Raf 621p-injected oocytes. Only in one experiment (not shown) was it possible to measure the current at full activation, and the measured shift in the activation curve was –12 mV. We can conclude that endogenous 14-3-3s modulate KAT1 channel in oocytes and presumably influence the position of the activation curve of this channel. This finding could partly explain the strong run down phenomenon observed in excised patches of this channel. KAT1 Interacts in Vitro with the 14-3-3 Proteins—To test whether the KAT1 protein interacts directly with the 14-3-3 proteins, we have performed overlay experiments with radioactive 14-3-3s on total protein extract obtained from oocytes injected with KAT1 mRNA and tested for KAT1 expression 3 days from injection. Membrane fraction from control or KAT1-expressing oocytes was purified, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with recombinant 32P-labeled 14-3-3 isoform from maize GF14-6. Autoradiography shows (Fig. 8) that the radioactive probe in the crude membrane fraction purified from KAT1-expressing oocytes recognizes only a single band of ∼80 kDa (lane 3), corresponding to the expected KAT1 molecular mass, whereas no signal is detected in control membrane purified from oocytes not expressing KAT1 (lane 2). As expected, the 14-3-3 probe efficiently recognizes the H+-ATPase in the maize plasma membrane fraction loaded as positive control (lane 1). Control experiments included the addition of Raf 621p peptide to inhibit the interaction of 14-3-3s with KAT1 and the substitution of wild-type 14-3-3 with the non-functional K56E 14-3-3 mutant. In both cases we obtained no interaction (data not shown). Recombinant 14-3-3 proteins from maize activate KAT1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The 14-3-3-induced increase in current is due to a positive shift in the voltage dependence of the channel and not to an increase in the number of channels. This effect is disrupted by mutation K56E in the canonical interaction site of maize 14-3-3s. Excised patch experiments and in vitro data suggest a direct interaction between KAT1 and the 14-3-3 proteins. Endogenous 14-3-3 from Xenopus oocytes can control the activation curve of this channel and represent a possible source of variability in this well known expression system for ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2088850898,"Models predict that dynamic shear ruptures during earthquake faulting occur as either sliding cracks, where a large section of the interface slides behind a fast-moving rupture front, or self-healing slip pulses, where the fault relocks shortly behind the rupture front. We report experimental visualizations of crack-like, pulse-like, and mixed rupture modes propagating along frictionally held, “incoherent” interfaces separating identical solids, and we describe the conditions under which those modes develop. A combination of simultaneously performed measurements via dynamic photoelasticity and laser interferometry reveals the rupture mode type, the exact point of rupture initiation, the sliding velocity history, and the rupture propagation speed."

https://openalex.org/W2020014357,"We found recently that, in yeast cells, the heterologous expression of Bax induces a loss of plating efficiency different from that induced by acute stress because it is associated with the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity (Camougrand, N., Grelaud-Coq, A., Marza, E., Priault, M., Bessoule, J. J., and Manon, S. (2003) Mol. Microbiol. 47, 495-506). Bax effects were neither dependent on the presence of the yeast metacaspase Yca1p and the apoptosis-inducing factor homolog nor associated with the appearance of typical apoptotic markers such as metacaspase activation, annexin V binding, and DNA cleavage. Yeast cells expressing Bax instead displayed autophagic features, including increased accumulation of Atg8p, activation of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase, and the presence of autophagosomes and autophagic bodies. However, the inactivation of autophagy did not prevent and actually slightly accelerated Bax-induced loss of plating efficiency. On the other hand, Bax expression induced a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, which retained, however, some level of organization in wild-type cells. However, when expressed in cells inactivated for the gene UTH1, previously shown to be involved in mitophagy, Bax induced a complete disorganization of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, although mitochondrially targeted green fluorescent protein was slowly degraded in the wild-type strain, it remained unaffected in the mutant. Furthermore, the slow loss of plating efficiency in the mutant strain correlated with a loss of plasma membrane integrity. These data suggest that Bax-induced loss of growth capacity is associated with maintenance of plasma membrane integrity dependent on UTH1, suggesting that selective degradation of altered mitochondria is required for a regulated loss of growth capacity. We found recently that, in yeast cells, the heterologous expression of Bax induces a loss of plating efficiency different from that induced by acute stress because it is associated with the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity (Camougrand, N., Grelaud-Coq, A., Marza, E., Priault, M., Bessoule, J.

Recent data have provided evidence for the existence of different forms of programmed cell death. In addition to the long time established existence of apoptosis in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (1Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), apoptotic markers associated with loss of viability have been observed in various organisms, including Dictyostelium discoideum (2Arnoult D. Tatischeff I. Estaquier J. Girard M. Sureau F. Tissier J.P. Grodet A. Dellinger M. Traincard F. Kahn A. Ameisen J.C. Petit P.X. Mol. Biol.

However, apoptosis might not be the only process leading to programmed cell death. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process normally responsible for cell survival under starvation conditions, has been observed frequently as accompanying the loss of growth capacity in mammalian cells (8Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 9Levine B. Yuan J. J. Clin.

Shimizu S. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mammalian cells, data have suggested a co-regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, which could both participate in cell death (12Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 13Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). These observations support the occurrence of cell death associated with autophagy, although certain authors consider autophagy to be a cellular attempt to survive apoptotic cell death (10Codogno P. Meijer A.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 14Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8518-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The simpler eukaryotic models D. discoideum and Podospora anserina have provided the opportunity to demonstrate that autophagy inactivation stimulates rather than inhibits the kinetics of physiological programmed cell death (18Kosta A.

Balguerie A. Clavé C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that, if a low level of autophagy is actually responsible for better survival (including apoptosis-deficient mammalian cells), an abnormally high level of autophagy might be responsible for cell death (9Levine B. Yuan J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 13Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Up to now, the deregulation events responsible for uncontrolled autophagic activity have not been characterized. The actual role of autophagy in programmed cell death thus remains unclear, and investigators have proposed to describe “programmed cell death with autophagy” rather than “autophagic programmed cell death” (21Golstein P. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1490-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Kroemer G. El-Deiry W.S. Golstein P. Peter M.E. Vaux D. Vandenabeele P. Zhivotovsky B. Blagosklonny M.V. Malorni W. Knight R.A. Piacentini M. Nagata S. Melino G. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The yeast S. cerevisiae is the organism in which autophagy has been best genetically characterized (23Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Kamada Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 73-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, proteins involved in autophagy (encoded by ATG genes) are widely conserved in mammals and plants, suggesting that their function is part of the basic processes of life (26Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar, 27Thompson A.R. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This situation contrasts with apoptosis, for which key regulators, including proteins of the Bcl-2 family, are lacking in yeast cells. This absence has made yeast a useful tool to investigate the function of some of these proteins because, when expressed in yeast, they conserve their molecular effects at the level of mitochondria, making it possible to test their function independently of each other (28Priault M. Camougrand N. Kinnally K.W. Vallette F.M. Manon S. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This utilization of yeast as a “living test tube” has provided new information concerning the molecular aspects of pro-apoptotic Bax protein function, further confirmed by experiments in mammalian cells (29Priault M.

In yeast, the pro-apoptotic Bax protein can be translocated to the outer mitochondrial membrane to form a high conductance channel (33Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and to allow cytochrome c release (32Arokium H. Camougrand N.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Other Bcl-2 family members such as anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3) domain-only truncated Bid also retain their regulatory effect over Bax function (29Priault M. Cartron P.F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Arokium H. Camougrand N. Vallette F.M. Manon S. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The expression of the human pro-apoptotic Bax protein in yeast induces growth arrest and loss of plating efficiency (35Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Schaeffer J. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Priault M. Chaudhuri B. Clow A. Camougrand N. Manon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This observation supports the hypothesis that a primitive form of apoptosis exists in yeast (38Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Madeo F. Herker E. Wissing S. Jungwirth H. Eisenberg T. Frohlich K.U. Curr. Opin.

However, the correlation between Bax-induced release of cytochrome c and Bax-induced loss of plating efficiency is unclear. Indeed, the expression of Bax-c-myc induces a loss of plating efficiency in a cytochrome c-less mutant, although more slowly than in the parental strain (35Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Schaeffer J. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in a strain in which cytochrome c had been replaced with the larger and unreleased cytochrome c-GFP 4The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; mtGFP, mitochondrially targeted green fluorescent protein; PI, propidium iodide; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. 4The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; mtGFP, mitochondrially targeted green fluorescent protein; PI, propidium iodide; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. fusion protein (41Roucou X. Prescott M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For this reason, the existence of Bax-induced cytochrome c release is not sufficient to assert that Bax induces apoptosis in yeast, so further evidence is needed. We previously identified Uth1p, a protein that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane and that participates in selective mitochondrial autophagy (also called mitophagy) (42Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39068-39074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). One of the phenotypes of a mutant strain carrying an inactivation of UTH1 is a delayed loss of plating efficiency following Bax expression (43Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that autophagy (and more precisely, mitophagy) is part of the Bax effects in yeast. In this study, our aim was to investigate the role(s) of apoptosis, autophagy, and mitophagy as a consequence of Bax expression in yeast. Strains and Plasmids—The construction of plasmids pCM189/Bax-c-myc and pCM184/Bax-c-myc, expressing c-myc-tagged human Bax under the control of a Tet-Off promoter (repressed by the addition of doxycycline), has been described previously (35Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Schaeffer J. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mutant Δuth1 was constructed from the wild-type strain W303-1A by disrupting UTH1 with TRP1 (43Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutants Δyca1, Δaif1, and Δatg5 (constructed from the wild-type strain BY4742 by disrupting the respective genes with kanMX4) and mutants Δatg4, Δatg5, Δatg7, Δatg8, Δatg15, and Δatg16 (similarly constructed from BY4741) were provided by EUROSCARF. The Δatg5 mutant was also constructed by transformation of W303-1A with the PCR-amplified atg5::kanMX4 cassette and selection for Geneticin resistance. Bax repression was obtained by including 10 μg/ml doxycycline in the appropriate culture medium. Bax expression was triggered by three washes, followed by resuspension in fresh medium without doxycycline. Western blotting showed that the Bax expression level reached a plateau after ∼8 h, followed by immediate growth arrest and loss of plating efficiency (see Fig. 1). The URA3 plasmid pCLbGFP, encoding GFP fused to the mitochondrial presequence of citrate synthase under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter, was described by Okamoto et al. (44Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Its HIS3 counterpart pNC-GFP was constructed by swapping the PCR-amplified GAL1/10-mtGFP cassette from pCLbGFP with pRS313. Replacement of PHO8 with pho8Δ60 was done by transforming the cells with a HindIII fragment from plasmid pTN9 and by selecting the colonies as described by Noda et al. (45Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmids pDP34/Bcl-2 and pFL39/Bcl-xL, expressing full-length human Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively, under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter, has been described previously (36Priault M. Chaudhuri B. Clow A. Camougrand N. Manon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 46Clow A. Greenhalf W. Chaudhuri B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Culture Media—Cells were grown aerobically in YNB medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.2% Drop-Mix, and 0.01% auxotrophic requirements, pH 5.5) supplemented with 2% dl-lactate as a carbon source. For mtGFP expression, 0.5% galactose was added to the medium overnight. Doxycycline (solubilized in ethanol; Sigma) was added at 10 μg/ml except where indicated. The nitrogen starvation medium was deprived of amino acids and ammonium sulfate. Plating Efficiency—Cells were routinely grown in the presence of 10 μg/ml doxycycline for Bax repression. At time 0, they were harvested, washed three times with water, and resuspended at a cell concentration of 106 cells/ml in fresh medium without doxycycline (to induce Bax expression). They were counted at different time intervals and plated onto YPD plates (500 cells/plate) supplemented with doxycycline to repress Bax expression. The number of colonies was counted after 48 h at 28 °C. Alternatively, serial dilutions were plated, and the number of living cells in the culture was estimated by counting the colonies that had grown after 48 h. Data are presented as the percentage of living cells at time t divided by living cells at time 0. Flow Cytometry—Caspase activity was measured on whole cells with the CaspACE™ kit (Promega Corp.) as described by Madeo et al. (6Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Labeling with propidium iodide (PI) was done by incubating the cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) in 50 mm citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 μg/ml PI for 15 min in the dark. Annexin V/PI co-labeling was done with the Apo-Alert™ kit (Clontech) on intact cells or zymolyase-treated cells (spheroplasts) as described by Madeo et al. (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). TUNEL assay was performed on cells permeabilized and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C with a tetramethylrhodamine red in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence was measured in a Galaxy flow cytometer (Partec). At least 30,000 cells were counted per run, and all experiments were reproduced independently at least five times. Plasma Membrane Permeability—In addition to the PI assay (see above), plasma membrane permeability was measured as the capacity of the cells to accumulate erythrosin B (47Bonneu M. Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 28 °C for 45 min in the presence of 75 μm erythrosin B and observed under a light microscope. Cells with altered plasma membrane properties accumulated erythrosin B and were pink, whereas unaltered cells remained white. Parallel experiments with PI accumulation and erythrosin B staining gave similar results. In Vitro Assays—DEVDase activity was measured in cell extracts (prepared by incubating zymolyase-treated cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 to solubilize cell membranes) using the Enz-Check™ caspase-3 kit (Molecular Probes) in a Xenius spectrofluorometer (SAFAS S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured as described previously (42Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39068-39074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) in 1% toluene and 4% ethanol-treated cells in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). Western blotting was performed on cell extracts prepared as described previously (42Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39068-39074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted on ProBlott™ (Applied Biosystems) with primary antibodies directed against yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (mouse monoclonal, 1:5000; Molecular Probes), human Bax (clone N20, rabbit polyclonal, 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), yeast Atg8p (goat polyclonal, 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), human Bcl-2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000; Calbiochem), and human Bcl-x (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and were used at a 1:5000 dilution. Peroxidase activity was revealed with ECL Plus™ (Amersham Biosciences). Different exposure times were used for quantification of the blots with Image J software. Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy—When used, the yeast vacuolar membrane autofluorescent probe FM4-64 (N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)4-(p-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide; 40 μm) was added 4 h prior to observation. Cells were observed with a Leica Microsystems DM-LB epifluorescence microscope. For electron microscopy, yeast pellets were placed on the surface of Formvar-coated copper electron microscope grids (400 mesh). Each loop was quickly submerged in liquid propane (-180 °C) and transferred to a precooled solution of 4% osmium tetroxide in dry acetone at -82 °C for 48 h for substitution/fixation. Samples were gradually warmed up to room temperature and washed with dry acetone. Specimens were stained for 1 h in 1% uranyl acetate in acetone at 4 °C, rinsed, and infiltrated with Araldite (epoxy resin; Fluka). Ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate and viewed with a Philips Tecnai 12 Biotwin (120 kV) electron microscope. Bax-induced Loss of Plating Efficiency in Yeast Is Not Associated with Apoptotic Markers—We reported previously that, in addition to immediate growth inhibition, the expression of Bax in yeast is followed by a loss of plating efficiency, i.e. Bax-expressing cells are not able to restart growth even after Bax expression has been stopped (Fig. 1, B and C) (35Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Schaeffer J. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Priault M. Chaudhuri B. Clow A. Camougrand N. Manon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This loss of growth capacity occurs without any alteration of the plasma membrane permeability properties as measured with the widely used DNA-binding probe PI, which penetrates altered cells only. In contrast with the loss of plating efficiency induced by ethanol treatment, heat shock, or acute oxidative stress (Fig. 2A), Bax-induced loss of plating efficiency was not associated with any increase in PI permeability, even after long Bax expression (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that Bax-induced loss of growth capacity is a regulated event, unlike the one induced by acute stress, which is associated with a dramatic loss of membrane integrity. To investigate the putative roles of apoptosis in Bax effects, Bax was expressed in two strains with impairment of the apoptotic program: one lacking metacaspase (Δyca1 strain) and the other lacking the apoptosis-inducing factor homolog (Δaif1 strain). Of note, the identification of a metacaspase encoded by the gene YCA1, which is activated by different stimuli (6Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), remains the most compelling argument supporting the existence of a primitive form of apoptosis in yeast. The inactivation of YCA1 also leads to a decrease in the kinetics of the loss of growth capacity induced by hydrogen peroxide and other stimuli (6Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S.

A. 2005; 102: 17326-17331Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Compared with wild-type cells, the absence of the metacaspase did not change the extent and kinetics of Bax-induced loss of plating efficiency (Fig. 3A), thus confirming data from a recent study (51Guscetti F. Nath N. Denko N. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 464-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the absence of the apoptosis-inducing factor homolog, encoded by the gene AIF1, stimulated rather than inhibited the kinetics of Bax-induced loss of plating efficiency (Fig. 3A). Measurement of DEVDase activity in cell extracts did not reveal any activity (data not shown). Measurement of caspase activity with the permeant substrate valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethyl ketone-fluorescein isothiocyanate in whole cells showed a basal signal in control cells, which decreased following Bax expression (Fig. 3B). Measurement of phosphatidylserine exposure with annexin V was also done in both intact whole cells (Fig. 3C) and spheroplasts (data not shown): no annexin V-positive cells appeared in control or Bax-expressing cells. As positive controls, significant increases in both caspase activity and annexin V binding were found in aged cells (data not shown), as described by Laun et al. (52Laun P. Pichova A. Madeo F. Fuchs J. Ellinger A. Kohlwein S. Dawes I. Frohlich K.U. Breitenbach M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no degradation of DNA following Bax expression could be evidenced by TUNEL assay, this degradation was observed in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 3D). These data unequivocally show that typical characteristics of apoptosis cannot be evidenced in yeast following Bax expression under conditions in which Bax hampers the capacity of yeast to grow after Bax expression has been stopped. Finally, in the absence of Yca1p or Aif1p, Bax-induced loss of plating efficiency was still associated with maintenance of plasma membrane integrity (Fig. 3E), showing that the apoptotic program is not responsible for this maintenance. Bax Expression Induces the Appearance of Autophagic Characteristics—We reported previously that the kinetics of loss of plating efficiency following Bax expression are slower in a yeast mutant inactivated for the gene UTH1 than in its wild-type counterpart (43Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The product of this gene was shown to be involved in mitochondrial autophagy (42Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol.

Because a possible death function of autophagy has been suggested in mammalian cells unable to achieve apoptosis (12Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B.

Bixler D. Birth Defects Orig. Artic Ser. 1975; 11: 397-401PubMed Google Scholar). The disease was initially attributed to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations (2Chun K. Siegel-Bartelt J. Chitayat D. Phillips J. Ray P.N. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 77: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Miller's group discovered a correlation between six allelic variants of the POR gene (encoding CYPOR, EC 1.6.2.4) and disordered steroidogenesis observed in patients with and without ABS (3Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W. Okuhara K. Verge C.F. Jabs E.W. Mendonca B.B. Fujieda K. Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The variants were A287P, R457H, V492E, C569Y, V608F, and an intron 6 splice variant resulting in a premature stop codon. The wild-type human CYPOR cDNA and mutants, created by site-directed mutagenesis, were expressed in Escherichia coli. The resultant proteins were assayed for their respective NADPH-cytochrome c and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase activities. The authors concluded that deleterious POR mutations correlated well with the decreased lanosterol demethylase (CYP51) activity that had previously been observed in ABS patients, and that severe POR mutations were sufficient to cause the ABS phenotype, even in the absence of FGFR2 mutations. Retardation of somite and limb bud formation, which was observed previously in embryonic lethal CYPOR knock-out mice (4Shen A.L. O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol.

The authors also hypothesized that POR mutations were more common than the relatively low incidence of ABS suggested and that milder mutations could result in disordered steroidogenesis or increased sensitivity to drugs and environmental toxins. By their analysis of patients with congenital adrenal hypoplasia, Arlt et al. (6Arlt W. Walker E.A. Draper N. Ivison H.E. Ride J.P. Hammer F. Chalder S.M. Borucka-Mankiewicz M. Hauffa B.P.

(3Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W. Okuhara K. Verge C.F. Jabs E.W. Mendonca B.B. Fujieda K. Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Type I ABS patients with FGFR2 mutations, those with the most severe skeletal abnormalities but normal genitalia, were distinguished from Type II ABS patients with POR mutations who exhibited less severe skeletal abnormalities, but ambiguous genitalia. Among Japanese patients, several new POR variants were discovered, including the premature deletion mutations I444fsX449 and L565fsX574 (7Adachi M. Tachibana K. Asakura Y. Yamamoto T. Hanaki K. Oka A. Am. J. Med. Genet A. 2004; 128: 333-339Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the indel, L612_W620delinsR, a silent G5G mutation that could affect splicing, and Y578C (8Fukami M. Horikawa R.

Pandey A.V. Agrawal V. Reardon W. Lapunzina P.D. Mowat D. Jabs E.W. Van Vliet G. Sack J. Flück C.E. Miller W.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 729-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). An additional 11 new POR variants were discovered: A115V, T142A, Q153R, M263V, Y459H, A503V, G539R, L565P, R616X, V631I, and F646del. Four POR variants that the authors found in the BioVentures Web data base (P228L, R316W, G413S, and G504R) were also analyzed. Most recently, Homma et al. (10Homma K. Hasegawa T. Nagai T. Adachi M. Horikawa R. Fujiwara I. Tajima T. Takeda R. Fukami M. Ogata T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 91: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) described the POR mutations Q201X, A462_S463insIA, and E580Q. Rat and human CYPORs share ∼95% amino acid sequence identity. Human POR mutations were, therefore, interpreted in previous papers using the crystal structure of the soluble diflavin catalytic domain of rat CYPOR (11Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The active site of the enzyme is arranged around the interface of the FMN-, FAD-, and NADPH-binding domains. FAD is oriented with its si-face stacked against the surface of a highly conserved β-barrel structure, as observed among the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family of flavoprotein oxidoreductases (12Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), to which CYPOR belongs. Following displacement of the C-terminal shielding residue (Trp-677), the FAD re-face is exposed to the nicotinamide ring of NADPH, through stacking interactions that facilitate hydride ion transfer, the initial step of the catalytic cycle (13Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The NADPH-binding domain, a typical Rossmann fold (14Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), positions the NADPH and FAD for optimal electron transfer. Following the two-electron reduction of FAD to the dihydroquinone redox state (FADH2), electrons are sequentially transferred to FMN, which cycles between the partially reduced semiquinone (FMNH·) and fully reduced dihydroquinone (FMNH2) redox states during catalysis. The flavin isoalloxazine rings are oriented with their dimethylbenzene rings 3.85 Å apart at an angle of ∼140° as dictated by the interface between the FAD- and FMN-binding domains of the protein (11Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The structure of the protein influences the thermodynamics of flavin redox reactions by modulating midpoint potentials of the flavin cofactors through hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions (15Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2725-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic domain of the enzyme, CYPOR also contains an N-terminal hydrophobic domain (∼6 kDa) that directs membrane-binding and microsomal localization and plays a role in protein-protein interactions with cytochromes P450 and cytochrome b5 (17Black S.D.

The site of interaction between CYPOR and the various CYPs has been studied extensively and has been shown to consist primarily of complementary charged surfaces on the component proteins (11Wang M.

With so many molecular interactions required for CYPOR functionality, it is not surprising that the various mutations/polymorphisms in the POR gene, distributed across the CYPOR structure, would result in loss of function via different mechanisms. In this report, we have characterized the deleterious nature of the ABS-related mutations, Y459H and V492E, using bacterially expressed human CYPOR. These mutations were chosen to be studied first due to the severe phenotype described and because of their direct role(s) in FAD binding, as predicted from the structure of rat CYPOR (Fig. 1). Based on sequence alignment, residue Tyr-459 of the human enzyme corresponds to Tyr-456 in the rat sequence. The phenol side chain atoms of Tyr-456 form hydrogen bonds to the FAD ribityl moiety, through the hydroxyl group, and the benzene ring forms π-π interactions with the si-face of the FAD isoalloxazine ring. Rat Val-489, corresponding to human Val-492, forms a backbone hydrogen bond through an amide nitrogen to the FAD pyrophosphate oxygens. The extent to which FAD binding is affected by these mutations and potential rescue of function are described herein. Subcloning and Mutagenesis—Standard PCR techniques were used to amplify human CYPOR cDNA for subcloning into pET28a, for Δ66 expression, and pOR263, for holoenzyme expression. Clones were mutagenized using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene to correct inherent polymorphisms (P228L and A503V) and to construct the ABS mutants, Y459H and V492E. (See supplemental material for detailed methodology). Protein Expression and Purification—Soluble Δ66 CYPOR proteins were expressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3) cultured in modified Terrific Broth containing 100 μm riboflavin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin. Following 24 h of induction by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. Cells were lysed by sonification (5 × 2-min. cycles) in the presence of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. The soluble fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g and then applied to nickel-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), washed extensively, and eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The purity of the eluted protein fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pure fractions were pooled and concentrated (Centriprep 30, Millipore, Billerica, MA), quantified spectroscopically when appropriate by flavin absorbance (ϵ454 nm = 21.4 mm-1cm-1) (27Oprian D.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8935-8944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stored under liquid N2. Membrane-bound CYPOR proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21, cultured in modified Terrific Broth containing 100 μm riboflavin and 125 μm ampicillin. Cell harvest and lysis were the same as above for soluble proteins. Following lysis by sonification, the membrane fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellets were homogenized in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, using a Dounce homogenizer. 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to solubilize the homogenate over 12 h at 4 °C, and was maintained at this concentration for all subsequent purification steps. The detergent-solubilized protein fraction was separated from the insoluble debris by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was then applied to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), washed extensively with buffer containing 5 mm adenosine, and then eluted with 15 mm 2′,3′-AMP mixed isomers. Protein purity and concentration were determined as described for soluble CYPOR. Aliquots were stored under liquid N2. Micro BCA protein quantitation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Each assay was performed in triplicate using multiple dilutions. Concentration values are reported as averages ± S.D. Flavin Content Analysis—Samples were diluted to 10 μm in water prior to denaturation by boiling for 5 min to release protein-bound flavins. The boiled samples were quickly chilled on ice prior to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove aggregated protein. 20 μl of sample was then separated by HPLC using a Waters Corp. (Milford, MA) analytical HPLC system, equipped with a 2487 absorbance detector. A Nova-Pak C18, 60-Å, 4-μm (3.9 × 150 mm) column was fitted with a guard column packed with Nova-Pak C18 Guard-Pak inserts. The column was equilibrated with the mobile phase buffer (filtered and degassed), consisting of 10 mm (NH4)2HPO4 adjusted to pH 5.5 with H3PO4 and acetonitrile in the ratio of 10:1.2 (v/v), as reported by Pietta and Calatroni (28Pietta P. Calatroni A. Rava A. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 229: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1.00 ml/min, and flavins were monitored at 473 nm with ϵFAD = 10.1 mm-1cm-1 and ϵFMN = 8.0 mm-1cm-1. Extinction coefficients were determined by measurement of standards contained in the mobile phase buffer. Integration and analysis was done with the Millennium 32 Chromatography Manager provided by Waters Corp. Flavin Reconstitution—Protein samples (∼200 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, were incubated in small volumes (∼100 μl) with 5-fold molar excess of either FAD or FMN, or both, prepared in the same buffer at 4 °C for 4-12 h. All samples were protected from light exposure. Subsequent separation of free and protein-bound flavins was achieved by G-25 column chromatography (10 cm × 0.5 cm). Spectroscopic Analysis—UV-visible absorbance spectra (λ = 250-900 nm) were recorded using an Agilent 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA). CD spectra were recorded in the far UV (λ = 180-300 nm) and near UV-visible (λ = 300-600 nm) regions using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD). Far UV measurements were made of 7 μm protein samples contained in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, in a quartz cylindrical cuvette with a path length of 0.2 mm. Near UV-visible measurements were made of 50 μm protein samples contained in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, in a quartz cylindrical cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Kinetic Analysis—NADPH-cytochrome c reduction was measured as described by Masters et al. (29Masters B.S.S. Williams Jr., C.H. Kamin H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 565-573Crossref Scopus (623) Google Scholar) with little modification (see supplemental material for detailed methodology). In cases where FAD or FMN was added directly to the reaction mixture, each was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μm. NADPH-cytochrome P450 4A4 PGE1 ω-hydroxylation was measured as described by Aitken et al. (30Aitken A.E. Roman L.J. Loughran P.A. de la Garza M. Masters B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with little modification (see supplemental material for detailed methodology). Soluble Human CYPOR Expression and Purification—Wild-type human CYPOR was bacterially expressed and purified as a soluble (Δ66) protein. The rationale behind the use of the truncated construct was first to obtain high yields of purified enzyme, independent of NADPH affinity-based 2′5′-ADP Sepharose 4B purification, by utilizing an N-terminal polyhistidine fusion tag. Secondly, previous studies of structure-function relationships in the catalytic/redox domain of CYPOR have relied on similarly truncated isoforms (Ref. 11Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar and references therein). For the wild-type Δ66 enzyme, 15 mg of purified protein was produced per liter of culture. The purified protein was greenish-brown in color (Fig. 2, inset), attributed to the spectral contribution of oxidized FAD (yellow) and air-stable FMN semiquinone (blue-gray). The purified enzyme exhibited the predicted molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of 72 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1). Δ66 Y459H and V492E were distinctively blue-gray while bound to Ni-Sepharose. Upon elution, the Y459H protein quickly became oxidized to yellow, while the V492E remained blue-gray (Fig. 2, inset). UV-visible spectra were immediately collected as shown in Fig. 2. The blue-gray color of the V492E sample corresponded well with the observed semiquinone character of the spectrum, with a distinct peak at 350 nm and a much broader peak centered ∼590 nm. Purified protein quantities were lower for the mutants than for the wild-type Δ66 protein with the Y459H yielding 3 mg/liter and V492E, 9 mg/liter. SDS-PAGE analysis of the Δ66 mutants showed that V492E was indistinguishable from wild type, but that Y459H was highly fragmented, with only a fraction of the total giving the predicted 72-kDa molecular mass (supplemental Fig. S1). The compromised stability of the Y459H Δ66 protein prevented further characterization but suggested that this particular mutation may have caused local misfolding that exposed the protein to degradation, despite the presence of protease inhibitors during purification. Flavin Content of Soluble Proteins—CYPOR protein concentration was determined as a function of oxidized flavin concentration at 454 nm (ϵ = 21.4 mm-1cm-1) (27Oprian D.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8935-8944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and absolute protein concentration was measured by the micro BCA assay. Both methods yielded similar results for the wild-type Δ66 sample, suggesting complete cofactor incorporation (Table 1). Concentrations based on absorbance were 2-fold lower than the corresponding values obtained by micro BCA for V492E Δ66. This suggested that V492E, as purified, was deficient in either one or both of the two flavin cofactors. To determine which of the flavins was deficient, HPLC-based analysis of flavin content was performed (Fig. 3). FAD and FMN standards had characteristic retention times of 1.5 and 2 min, respectively. The wild-type Δ66 protein exhibited the full complement of both FAD and FMN at a 1:1 ratio. The FAD content of V492E was compromised, compared with wild-type, with a protein: FAD:FMN ratio of ∼1:0.1:0.9.TABLE 1Comparative protein quantitation by flavin absorbance and micro BCA assay Samples containing 2 μm total flavin concentration were prepared by dilution of oxidized stocks and verified spectroscopically by absorbance at 454 nm.

Far UV CD spectra (supplemental Fig. S2) suggested that the V492E mutation had little effect on the protein secondary structure. This was surprising, in light of the structural role of FAD in bridging the FAD-binding β-barrel and C-terminal NADPH-binding domain of the rat enzyme through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (11Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The absence of FAD was again apparent in near UV-visible CD spectra of the V492E sample when compared with that of the wild-type CYPOR (Fig. 4). The wild-type enzyme had negative CD bands centered around 360 and 450 nm, indicative of both the conformation of the cofactors (31Bewley M.C. Davis C.A. Marohnic C.C. Taormina D. Barber M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13145-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the polarity of the microenvironment in which they were bound (32Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The spectrum of wild-type CYPOR appeared to be additive of the component spectra of protein-bound FAD, with positive character ∼360 nm and negative character around 450 nm, and protein-bound FMN, with strongly negative character around 360 nm and weakly negative character ∼450 nm. The V492E spectrum had strong negative bands ∼375 nm, indicative of protein-bound FMN, but lacked the negative band observed in the wild-type ∼450 nm, again suggesting the absence of a contribution from FAD. NADPH-Cytochrome c Reduction by Soluble CYPORs—Wild-type and V492E Δ66 proteins were assayed for the ability to catalyze NADPH-cytochrome c reduction (Table 2). Wild-type Δ66 CYPOR exhibited a kcat/KmNADPH = 220 min-1 μm-1. The V492E Δ66 mutant retained 8% of the wild-type turnover number with no apparent effect on KmNADPH. The data obtained for the Δ66 ABS mutants differed substantially from previous data (9Huang N. Pandey A.V. Agrawal V. Reardon W. Lapunzina P.D. Mowat D. Jabs E.W. Van Vliet G. Sack J. Flück C.E. Miller W.L. Am. J. Hum.

The Δ27 Y459H and V492E mutants retained only 1 and 2% of the kcat for wild-type Δ27 (contrasted in Table 2). The KmNADPH value for wild-type Δ27 was reported as 0.22 μm, whereas Y459H and V492E were each >50 μm, but interestingly, had sufficient NADPH affinity to allow 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B purification (9Huang N. Pandey A.V. Agrawal V. Reardon W. Lapunzina P.D. Mowat D. Jabs E.W. Van Vliet G. Sack J. Flück C.E. Miller W.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 729-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the KmNADPH values obtained for V492E Δ66, which was statistically identical to that of wild-type Δ66 (∼3 μm). The differences in these observations between laboratories can be explained by the varying extent of truncation used, as well as by the purification methods utilized, each of which favors a different subpopulation within a heterogeneous mixture of expressed protein. The nickel-Sepharose purification favors molecules with intact N termini, whereas 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B favors molecules with intact C-terminal NADPH-binding domains. The purity, degree of fragmentation, and flavin content of the Δ27 proteins was not addressed but might further explain the observed variations.TABLE 2NADPH:cytochrome c reductase assay-derived kinetic parameters for CYPOR variantsEnzymekcatKmNADPHkcat/Kmmin–1μmmin–1 μm–1Wild-type Δ66(6.6 ± 0.1) × 1023.0 ± 0.1(2.2 ± 0.2) × 102Wild-type Δ66 + FAD(5.9 ± 0.1) × 1023.3 ± 0.1(1.8 ± 0.1) × 102Wild-type Δ66 + FMN(6.6 ± 0.9) × 1022.9 ± 0.1(2.3 ± 0.6) × 102Wild-type Δ66 + FAD + FMN(6.3 ± 0.2) × 1023.4 ± 0.2(1.9 ± 0.3) × 102V492E Δ66(5.5 ± 0.9) × 1012.8 ± 1.5(2.0 ± 0.2) × 101V492E Δ66 + FAD(5.3 ± 0.1) × 10215.8 ± 0.5(3.4 ± 0.1) × 101V492E Δ66 + FMN(1.6 ± 0.1) × 1029.6 ± 1.0(1.7 ± 0.1) × 101V492E Δ66 + FAD + FMN(5.8 ± 0.1) × 10215.3 ± 0.6(3.8 ± 0.1) × 101Wild-type holo(5.0 ± 0.1) × 1021.1 ± 0.1(4.6 ± 0.7) × 102Wild-type holo + FAD(4.9 ± 0.1) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(4.9 ± 0.9) × 102Wild-type holo + FMN(4.6 ± 0.1) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(4.6 ± 0.8) × 102Wild-type holo + FAD + FMN(4.7 ± 0.1) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(4.7 ± 0.8) × 102Y459H holo(1.3 ± 0.1) × 102 fast1.6 ± 0.3fast(8.1 ± 3.2) × 101 fast(8.0 ± 1.0) × 101 slow3.2 ± 0.8slow(2.5 ± 1.5) × 101 slowY459H holo + FAD(3.4 ± 0.5) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(3.4 ± 1.2) × 102Y459H holo + FMN(1.8 ± 0.1) × 102 fast2.1 ± 0.1fast(8.6 ± 1.3) × 101 fast(6.5 ± 0.5) × 102 slow3.6 ± 1.2slow(1.8 ± 1.2) × 101 slowY459H holo + FAD + FMN(3.4 ± 0.5) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(3.4 ± 1.2) × 102V492E holo(1.9 ± 0.1) × 1017.9 ± 1.3(2.4 ± 0.7) × 100V492E holo + FAD(2.6 ± 0.1) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(2.6 ± 0.5) × 102V492E holo + FMN(4.1 ± 0.2) × 1015.9 ± 1.0(7.0 ± 2.2) × 100V492E holo + FAD + FMN(2.9 ± 0.1) × 1021.0 ± 0.1(2.9 ± 0.6) × 102Wild-type Δ27aValues reported by Huang et al.

First, flavin cofactors were added directly to the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase assay to determine whether catalytic function could be rescued (Table 2). Indeed, Δ66 V492E showed a ∼10-fold increase in kcat when 2.5 μm FAD was added. The increased turnover was accompanied by an increased KmNADPH, on the order of ∼5-fold. Addition of FMN increased the kcat and KmNADPH ∼3-fold in the case of V492E, suggesting that some productive binding of FMN did occur. FAD binding was also measured directly using spectroscopic and physical methods. A 10-fold molar excess of FAD was added to each of the purified Δ66 proteins.

The Drosophila Brahma (SWI/SNF) complex subunits BRM and SNR1 are highly conserved with direct counterparts in yeast (SWI2/SNF2 and SNF5) and mammals (BRG1/hBRM and INI1/hSNF5). BRM encodes the catalytic ATPase required for chromatin remodeling and SNR1 is a regulatory subunit. Importantly, SNR1 mediates ATP-independent repression functions of the complex in cooperation with histone deacetylases and direct contacts with gene-specific repressors. SNR1 and INI1, as components of their respective SWI/SNF complexes, are important for developmental growth control and patterning, with direct function as a tumor suppressor. To identify direct regulatory targets of the Brm complex, we performed oligonucleotide-based transcriptome microarray analyses using RNA isolated from mutant fly strains harboring dominant-negative alleles of snr1 and brm. Steady-state RNA isolated from early pupae was examined, as this developmental stage critically requires Brm complex function. We found the hormone-responsive Ecdysone-induced genes (Eig) were strongly misregulated and that the Brm complex is directly associated with the promoter regions of these genes in vivo. Our results reveal that the Brm complex assists in coordinating hormone-dependent transcription regulation of the Eig genes.

Our results reveal that the Brm complex assists in coordinating hormone-dependent transcription regulation of the Eig genes. The metazoan SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are large (1.2 MDa, 8-11 subunits) multimeric assemblies that act to modify nucleosome structure, allowing for activation or repression of gene transcription (1Smith C.L. Horowitz-Scherer R. Flanagan J.F. Woodcock C.L. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Prevailing models suggest that the SWI/SNF complexes are recruited to specific in vivo targets through interactions with DNA-binding transcription factors, where the ATP-dependent activities of the complex assist in gene regulation through changes in DNA-histone contacts (3Peterson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the affected nucleosomes can be covalently modified to maintain active or repressed transcription through cooperation with histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase complexes (5Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Whole genome analyses of yeast and mammalian SWI/SNF complex mutants revealed that the expression of ∼5% of all genes was affected by removal of the complex (6Sudarsanam P. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O.

Importantly, whereas there was a detectable reduction in the expression of a small subset of genes, more transcripts were induced upon loss of the gene encoding the core ATPase (SNF2/SWI2), suggesting that the complex had direct roles in both gene activation and repression. In fact, both epigenetic functions of the yeast complex appear to rely on the ATPase activity of SNF2/SWI2 (8Martens J.A. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Removal of murine INI1 with an inverting allele leads to rapid (∼11 weeks) onset of rhabdoid tumors and T cell lymphomas with complete penetrance (38Roberts C.W. Leroux M.M. Fleming M.D. Orkin S.H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas a conditional allele of snr1 leads to significantly increased growth (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); thus, SNR1/INI1 can be classified as a tumor/growth suppressor. Recently, we found that SNR1 functions to mediate aspects of Brm complex transcriptional repression in specific cells through shielding ATP-dependent gene activation, a mechanism that requires the coordinated activities of a tissue-specific transcription repressor and histone deacetylase activity (39Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Dingwall A.K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of conditional dominant-negative mutant alleles of snr1 and brm, we showed that cell-type or tissue-specific regulation of Brm complex activities may play an essential role in regulating key developmental growth and patterning processes (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Dingwall A.K.

This regulation involves epigenetic coregulators, such as transcription factors or enzymes that lead to modification of histones, including histone acetyltransferases or deacetylases to prevent inappropriate expression of critical target genes (23Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Dingwall A.K. Genetics. 2004; 168: 199-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Dingwall A.K. Dev.

The dominant-negative mutant alleles produce proteins that are stable and incorporated into Brm complexes, where the mutant phenotypes arise from loss of subunit function and reflect important contributions of the affected subunit to whole complex activities on in vivo target genes.

In the latter case, a loss-of-function mutation in ash2, a member of the Drosophila Trithorax Group (Trx-G) of homeotic (HOM) gene activators, caused widespread disruptions in gene expression that generally correlated with the ash2 mutant phenotypes (46Beltran S. Blanco E. Serras F. Perez-Villamil B. Guigo R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Corominas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3293-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To help identify bona fide in vivo targets of Brm complex regulation we generated transcriptome profiles associated with loss of specific Brm complex functions at critical points in development. Whereas our results reveal that ∼3-5% of both individual and functionally related groups of genes are significantly impacted, global gene expression is largely unaffected. We identified the hormone-regulated genes as significant in vivo targets of Brm complex regulation. Cultured cell studies further suggested that the ecdysone-regulated genes, normally expressed late in development around the larval-pupal transition, were directly regulated by the Brm complex, which appears to function as a gene-specific corepressor in the absence of hormone. Moreover, we found that the Brm chromatin remodeling complex can potentially influence gene expression through coregulation in localized genomic regions. Genetic Manipulations and Strains—Fly strains and manipulations used in this study have been previously described (15Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Nanchal R. Cavalli G. Muchardt C. Dingwall A.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell.

Flies (snr1E1 and wild type OregonR) were reared at either 18 or 29 °C (permissive or restrictive temperatures for snr1E1 function), as indicated. Expression of the UASGAL4-BrmK804R transgene, herein referred to as UASBrmK804R (47Elfring L.K. Daniel C. Papoulas O. Deuring R. Sarte M. Moseley S. Beek S.J. Waldrip W.R. Daubresse G. DePace A. Kennison J.A. Tamkun J.W. Genetics. 1998; 148: 251-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was controlled using the P(GawB)69B-GAL4 driver (48Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crosses were carried out at 18 °C and appropriately staged pupae selected for RNA analysis. Temperature shift experiments with staged early pupae were performed as described (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using 100 pupae of each genotype reared at 18 °C, then shifted to 29 °C for 24 h prior to RNA isolation. RNA Analyses—Appropriately staged wild type, homozygous snr1E1 and P(GawB)69B-UASBrmK804R pupae (0-24 h after puparium formation) raised at 18 or 29 °C were collected and total RNA prepared using the RNAqueous (Ambion, Inc., Woodlands, TX) extraction system according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA samples were quantified and analyzed on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Equal amounts of RNA were treated with DNase prior to reverse transcription using murine mammary tumor virus reverse transcriptase (RETROscript, Ambion). PCR oligo-primers (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC) were selected using the ABI Prism/Primer Express program (ABI, Foster City, CA). Sequences are available upon request. Real time PCR were performed using iQ™ SYBR® Green and a Bio-Rad iCycler (Bio-Rad). Results were analyzed using the Genex Macros software (Bio-Rad). Semi-quantitative RT 2The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; EcR, ecdysone receptor. -PCR were carried out using standard protocols with HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), as appropriate for each primer pair. Gene Expression Array Analyses—The microarray experiments conducted in this report utilized the Affymetrix Drosophila GeneChip© for the analysis of gene expression patterns (44De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The aRNA amplification and labeling reactions (4 μg of RNA per sample) for these experiments were carried out according to the GeneChip© Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix publication 701021 Rev. 3). The Gene-Chips were hybridized at 45 °C for 16 h with constant rotation (60 rpm), then washed and stained on the Affymetrix Fluidics Station according to the EukGE-WS2v4 protocol. After washing and staining, fluorescent images were scanned at 2-μm resolution using the Gene Array Scanner. Affymetrix software (MicroArray Suite 5.0) was used to process the raw images into Cel image files, which were loaded into GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and normalized using the robust multiarray averaging method (49Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8407) Google Scholar). This robust multiarray averaging normalization was performed on two replicate samples for each condition, and the entire group of arrays was normalized together. The overall correlation between the expression levels for all genes on each array was extremely high (R > 0.99) for all five sets of replicate arrays (supplemental Table 1). Despite this high degree of reproducibility in replicate arrays, three different methods were used to establish empirical criteria for a gene to be called “changed” in expression in our data (supplemental Tables 2-4). A complete description of the statistical analyses is included as supplementary data. First, we calculated the thresholds for Type I errors seen in replicate arrays by analyzing the distribution of log2 ratios for all the genes in these arrays, and determining the fraction that exceeded an absolute value of 1.0. In the replicate array comparisons, a log2 difference of 1.0 was more than 2 S.D. beyond the 99.9th percentile confidence level (99% confidence level). At this confidence level, no false positives would be expected if the differences in expression were relatively minor and normally distributed. Indeed, none of these comparisons between replicate arrays showed any false positive changes at the 2-fold level. Next, we calculated the expected frequency of Type II errors based on spike-in control data (supplemental Fig. 1). These calculations revealed no Type I or Type II errors were likely included in the changed gene expression data set that we report. Third, overall concordance estimates between the replicate array comparisons were calculated, indicating very clear 99.9% confidence level cutoffs. As these cutoffs approximately equaled a 2-fold change for the comparisons between experimental and control samples, we determined the fraction of genes showing changes in expression of 2-fold or greater in any of the experimental conditions compared with baseline. All comparative data are presented as log2 ratios of the change in the experimental versus baseline condition. Changes in expression of genes that belong to the same functional classes were examined based on current curated Gene Ontology databases available from the NetAffx server. Cell Culture—Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells were cultured in standard medium. Hormone induction was achieved by addition of 20-hydroxyecdysone (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 μm for 24 h. Approximately 106 cells were used for RNA isolation and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. RNAi, Flow Cytometry, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation— Knockdown of snr1 and brm in cultured S2 cells was performed using RNAi. Double-stranded RNA was prepared using genespecific primers with added T7 polymerase priming sites and the RETROscript kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. dsRNA was added to cultured S2 cells and incubated for 5 days prior to assay or addition of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Knockdown efficiency was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot using SNR1 and BRM antibodies (15Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Nanchal R. Cavalli G. Muchardt C. Dingwall A.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following RNAi, cells were centrifuged and resusupended in a buffer containing propidium iodide, then analyzed by flow cytometry using a high speed BD Biosciences FACSAria cell sorter. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit according to standard manufacturer's protocols (Upstate Inc., Charlottesville, VA) for rabbit anti-SNR1 and anti-BRM antibodies (15Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Nanchal R. Cavalli G. Muchardt C. Dingwall A.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and primers corresponding to the divergent promoter regions of Eig71Ef-g (f5′-cagctttatataagttggaaacaagga-3′; r5′-tcgtagtatatcgccctgtattt-3′); and Eig71Eh-i (f5′-caacaaggaagcgaggtctt-3′; r5′-gaacgtgtcccgtggtattt-3′). Transcriptome Analysis of Brm Complex Mutants—To identify cellular targets of snr1 and brm function in an unbiased fashion, we examined steady-state gene expression levels of all known and predicted Drosophila genes using RNA isolated from wild type and both snr1E1 and UAS-BrmK804R mutant flies. Both snr1E1 and UASBrmK804R function as antimorphic dominant-negative alleles, as they produce defective products that elicit specific phenotypes as a consequence of stable incorporation into Brm complexes (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 47Elfring L.K. Daniel C. Papoulas O. Deuring R. Sarte M. Moseley S. Beek S.J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 51Papoulas O. Daubresse G. Armstrong J.A. Jin J. Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5728-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Homozygous snr1E1 and flies ubiquitously expressing UASBrmK804R raised at 18 °C are generally viable with discernible and highly penetrant mutant phenotypes. The major temperature-sensitive developmental phase for snr1E1 is at the larval/pupal transition (±24 h), whereas snr1E1 homozygotes (derived from heterozygous parents) raised continuously at 29 °C show late pupal lethality (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, at the developmental time period and conditions examined, all experimental flies are viable and all snr1E1 mutant phenotypes are fully rescued with a wild type snr1 transgene (15Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Nanchal R. Cavalli G. Muchardt C. Dingwall A.K. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, any significant gene expression changes are a consequence of specific mutant genotype and temperature of incubation and are not likely to result from differences in genetic background or general loss of viability (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 47Elfring L.K. Daniel C. Papoulas O. Deuring R. Sarte M. Moseley S. Beek S.J. Waldrip W.R. Daubresse G. DePace A. Kennison J.A. Tamkun J.W. Genetics. 1998; 148: 251-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from temperature and stage-matched wild type OregonR and mutant (snr1E1 and UASBrmK804R) pupae (0-24 h after puparium formation), labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Drosophila GeneChip® oligo arrays containing 14,010 gene probe sets. Using the highly conservative robust multiarray averaging-normalized average expression as a guide, we found that only 0.7-1.4% (total of 299) of the genes showed mean changes in expression for any of the mutant versus wild type comparisons (Fig. 1). Similar to swi/snf mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Sudarsanam P. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winston F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3364-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 52Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), more genes appeared to increase in expression rather than decrease in snr1E1 relative to wild type at the 29 °C restrictive temperature (Fig. 1); although, at 18 °C approximately the same number of genes showed increased or reduced expression. More genes also showed 2-fold increased expression in snr1E1 at 29 °C relative to 18 °C, than showed 2-fold decreased expression. This contrasted with wild type Drosophila, in which more genes show reduced expression at elevated temperatures than are increased. Importantly, these data show that snr1E1 and UASBrmK804R do not strongly impact global steady-state gene expression under conditions that give rise to clear mutant phenotypes. The microarray data trends were verified by examining a subset of the affected and unaffected genes by semi-quantitative PCR analyses using the same RNA preparations. Consistent results were found when the gene chip array data were compared with the semi-quantitative PCR data (supplemental Fig. 2 and Ref. 23Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Dingwall A.K. Genetics. 2004; 168: 199-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Overall, 22 of the 24 genes tested by this method showed similar patterns of increase or decrease relative to the array data under the conditions tested. Inspection of the genes that were most increased or decreased in any of the three main comparisons between the mutant and wild type strains revealed a number of interesting findings (supplemental Tables 5-7). We focused on the largest changes observed in the UASBrmK804R mutant background (supplemental Table 5), as well as those in the snr1E1 mutant at both 18 and 29 °C (supplemental Tables 6 and 7). SNR1 function is important in restricting cell growth, with adult snr1E1 flies (-/- > +/-) raised at 18 °C exhibiting significantly increased growth (biomass and cell number) and highly penetrant wing patterning defects (16Marenda D.R. Zraly C.B. Feng Y. Egan S. Dingwall A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The growth defect is manifest at both growth temperatures by late larval development (23Zraly C.B. Marenda D.R. Dingwall A.K. Genetics. 2004; 168: 199-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), 24-48 h prior to the experimental time point used for expression analyses in this study. Of the 30 genes showing the largest increase or decrease in expression in the snr1E1 compared with wild type at 18 °C, the majority also showed similar 2-fold increases or decreases in expression at 29 °C; similar trends were observed among the decreased genes at the two temperatures. Consistent with snr1 involvement in growth regulation, many of the genes showing increased expression in the mutant have predicted or known functions in apoptosis, hormone binding and signaling, cellular immunity, or contribute to cell structure. Less is known regarding the genes showing decreased expression, although many have predicted or known functions in intracellular protein transport and cell cycle regulation.

Because of its apoptotic property, its production is highly controlled. It depends upon the A3 splicing site utilization. A key control of site A3 activity is the ESS2 splicing silencer, which is located within the long stem-loop structure 3 (SLS3), far downstream from site A3. Here, by enzymatic footprints, we demonstrate the presence of several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1-binding sites on SLS3 and show the importance of the C-terminal Gly domain of hnRNP A1 in the formation of stable complexes containing several hnRNP A1 molecules bound on SLS3. Mutations in each of the UAG triplets in ESS2 strongly reduce the overall hnRNP A1 binding, showing the central role of ESS2 in hnRNP A1 assembly on SLS2-SLS3. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct interaction of ESS2 with the RNA recognition motifs domains of hnRNP A1. This interaction has limited effect on the RNA two-dimensional structure. The SR proteins SC35 and SRp40 were found previously to be strong activators of site A3 utilization. By enzymatic and chemical footprints, we delineate their respective binding sites on SLS2 and SLS3 and find a strong similarity between the hnRNP A1-, SC35-, and SRp40-binding sites. The strongest SC35-binding site only has a modest contribution to site A3 activation. Hence, the main role of SR proteins at site A3 is to counteract hnRNP A1 binding on ESS2 and ESE2.

Part of the transcripts has to be transported to the cytoplasm in an unspliced form and is used as mRNAs for the production of the viral, Gag, Gag-Pol, and Env protein precursors and as genomic RNAs for new virion assembly. Another part of the transcripts has to be spliced for production of the Tat, Rev, Nef, Vif, and Vpr proteins. Because of the presence of four splicing donor sites (5′ ss) 4The abbreviations used are: ss, splicing site; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; SLS3, stem-loop structure 3; ESS, exonic splicing silencer; ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlated spectroscopy; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonu-cleoprotein; WT, wild type; mut, mutant; RRM, RNA recognition motifs. 4The abbreviations used are: ss, splicing site; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; SLS3, stem-loop structure 3; ESS, exonic splicing silencer; ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlated spectroscopy; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonu-cleoprotein; WT, wild type; mut, mutant; RRM, RNA recognition motifs. and eight splicing acceptor sites (3′ ss) in HIV-1 RNA, the splicing machinery of infected cells generates at least 40 distinct mRNAs from a unique RNA primary transcript (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative abundance of these mRNAs depends greatly on the relative efficiencies of the 3′ ss, which are suboptimal (2Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Dyhr-Mikkelsen H. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24060-24066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During the early phase of cell infection, the five 3′ ss (A3, A4c, A4a, A4b, and A5) located in a small central part of the viral RNA are used for production of the tat, rev, and nef mRNAs (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the tat mRNAs are spliced at site A3. The rev mRNAs are spliced at sites A4a, A4b, or A4c, and most of the nef mRNAs are spliced at site A5 (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stoltzfus C.M. Madsen J.M. Curr. HIV Res. 2006; 4: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Tat protein plays a key role in virus multiplication as it is needed for production of full-length HIV-1 transcripts (13Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, because of the apoptotic activity of this protein on both the infected cells and the neighboring cells (13Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), virus HIV-1 strongly controls its production. In both lymphoid and nonlymphoid infected cells, the steady-state level of the doubly spliced tat mRNAs is considerably lower than levels of doubly spliced rev mRNAs and singly spliced env/vpu mRNAs (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This seems to be due to the poor efficiency of the A3 splicing site as compared with the other downstream 3′ ss (2Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Amendt B.A. Si Z.H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Si Z.

Virol. 1999; 73: 9764-9772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite its low efficiency, site A3 has the most optimized polypyrimidine tracts compared with the competitor sites (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Si Z. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is the presence of both an upstream (ESS2p) (17Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and a downstream (ESS2) exon-splicing silencer acting on site A3 (9Si Z. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The proximal ESS2p element binds protein hnRNP H generating a steric hindrance at site A3 (17Jacquenet S. Mereau A.

In contrast, ESS2 is located far downstream from site A3 (69 nucleotides) (2Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Si Z. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It inhibits an early step of spliceosome assembly (3Amendt B.A. Si Z.H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and binding of proteins hnRNP A/B is responsible for the inhibition (18Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism through which the binding of protein hnRNP A1 on ESS2 can limit the utilization of site A3, which is located 69 nucleotides upstream, remains unknown. This long distance activity may be linked to the peculiar secondary structure of the HIV-1 RNA region containing ESS2. Indeed, ESS2 is located in a long irregular stem-loop structure (SLS3) highly conserved in HIV-1 isolates (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As protein hnRNP A1 contains a Gly domain allowing its oligomerization (19Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the presence of several hnRNP A1-binding sites in SLS3 may favor its oligomerization along the RNA. Such findings would explain why, when inserted in a foreign context, at a distance from the 3′ ss similar to the one in the authentic HIV-1 context, the ESS2-dependent inhibition was reduced as compared with the authentic one (9Si Z. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ESS2 context effect in HIV-1 RNA might also be due to the presence of neighboring SR-binding sites, which are required for the activity of site A3. They may be buried upon protein hnRNP A/B binding on ESS2 (20Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, an overexpression of the SR proteins SC35 or SRp40 in HeLa cells and in infected T lymphocytes strongly increases site A3 utilization at the expense of site A1, A2, A4a-c, and A5 utilizations (21Ropers D.

Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A steric hindrance hypothesis limiting the access of SR protein is as much realistic, as an SC35-binding site (ESE2) was recently identified in the vicinity of ESS2 (20Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K.

Enzymatic footprints were used to try to identify the protein hnRNP A1 and SC35-binding sites in a short HIV-1 RNA fragment containing the ESS2 element (20Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, as the hnRNP A1 protein used in these assays was a GST-hnRNP A1 fusion protein, the hnRNP A1-binding sites were not precisely delineated. In addition, the short RNA fragment used in the experiment could not form the SLS3 structure. Hence, the importance of the RNA secondary structure on the binding of proteins hnRNP A1 and SC35 was not investigated. Finally, binding of the two proteins was only studied on a short portion of the site A3 downstream region. Therefore, for a better understanding of how proteins hnRNP A1, SC35, and SRp40 modulate site A3 utilization, it was of high importance to identify how these proteins interact with the two stem-loop structures SLS2 and SLS3 of HIV-1 RNA. The SLS2 stem-loop contains the A3 splicing site and the ESS2p inhibitor (17Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); the downstream SLS3 stem-loop contains the ESS2 inhibitor and the ESE2 activator (2Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It was also interesting to compare the binding property on SLS3 of the entire hnRNP A1 protein to that of its N-terminal domain (protein UP1). Indeed, both the Gly and UP1 domains of protein hnRNP A1 were proposed to contribute to the RNA-binding property (23Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, the UP1 domain, containing the two RNA recognition motifs (RRM), is expected to be responsible for the RNA binding specificity (23Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The Gly domain would account for both protein multimerization and a reinforcement of the RNA-protein interaction (19Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here, we used enzymatic and chemical footprints to delineate the binding sites of proteins UP1, hnRNP A1, SC35, and SRp40 on SLS2 and SLS3. Gel-shift assay experiments were performed to compare the affinities of the identified protein-binding sites, and their influences on splicing efficiency were tested in vitro after site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, NMR approaches were used to identify the nucleotides of ESS2 contacting the UP1 domain. This is the first NMR study of a UP1-RNA complex; only the three-dimensional structure of a UP1-DNA complex had been studied previously (24Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Altogether, the data presented demonstrate the presence of several binding sites for proteins hnRNP A1, SC35, and SRp40 on SLS3 and the SLS2-SLS3 linking region and the existence of strong overlapping between the binding sites of these three proteins. The 5′ strand of the internal loop II in SLS3 is characterized as the strongest SC35-binding site. However, despite the close distance between loop II and site A3, binding of protein SC35 to this loop is found to have only a modest activation effect on splicing at site A3. Our data demonstrate a crucial role of ESS2 in the stable association of several hnRNP A1 molecules on SLS3. Both the UP1 and Gly domains of hnRNP A1 play a role in the formation of this multimolecular complex, and formation of this complex can explain the strong inhibitory property of ESS2 compared with the other hnRNP A1-binding sites detected in SLS3. Initiation by ESS2 of the assembly of a stable complex containing several hnRNP A1 molecules also explains the high importance of the SC35- and SRp40-binding sites that overlap ESS2, in the mechanism of activation of site A3. Based on the present data, a model explaining the long distance effect of ESS2 and the specific activation effects of proteins SC35 and SRp40 is proposed. Plasmid Construction—The previously described pLD-L3-U1 plasmid (17Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used for WT L3-U1 RNA production. This RNA contains the two HIV-1 BRU regions extending from positions 1 to 384 and 5172 to 5637 fused together. A first series of pLD-L3-U1 plasmid derivatives carrying one or two deletions (ΔESS2p, Δ5′loopII, ΔESS2, or Δ3′loopII) in the SLS2 and/or SLS3 coding region, and a second series of pLD-L3-U1 plasmid derivatives with dinucleotide substitutions in the sequence coding the RNA segment from position 5420 to 5447 were produced by site-directed mutagenesis, using the PCR approach (see the sequences of the oligonucleotides used in supplemental Table 1). PCR-amplified DNA fragments were obtained in conditions described previously (17Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), using the WT pLD-L3-U1 plasmid or one of its derivatives as the template and one of the oligonucleotide pairs described in supplemental Table 1 as primers. RNA Production—For enzymatic and chemical footprinting assays, the A3M WT or variant RNAs were produced by SP6 RNA polymerase transcription using PCR-amplified DNA fragments from a WT or variant pLD-L3-U1 plasmid as the matrix and the O-SP6 and O-548 oligonucleotides as the primers (supplemental Table 1). SP6 in vitro transcriptions were performed as described previously (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For gel-shift experiments, radiolabeled RNA transcripts corresponding to the WT or variant HIV-1 RNA regions from position 5339 to 5515 or from position 5367 to 5466, respectively, were transcribed in vitro with the SP6 RNA polymerase, in conditions described previously (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified DNAs (primers pairs O-SP6 and 548 or 1989 and 2658, see supplemental Table 1) were used as the matrices. For splicing assays, uniformly labeled capped transcripts were transcribed by the T7 RNA polymerase in conditions described previously (17Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). WT and variant pLD-L3-U1 plasmids (Δ5′loopII, ΔESS2, ΔESS2p, ΔESS2pΔ5′loopII, ΔESS2Δ5′loopII, and the 48-74 series) were cleaved by the Pst I nuclease prior to transcription. For NMR analysis, RNAs (NLN1, NLN2, NLN3, NLN4, NLN7, NLN8, or NLN9) were transcribed in vitro with the T7 RNA polymerase, using a DNA template containing a 2′OMe-G at position 2, as described previously (25Kao C. Zheng M. Rudisser S. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 1268-1272Google Scholar). After polyacrylamide gel purification, electroelution, and ethanol precipitation, the RNA was dialyzed against the NMR buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) and was refolded by a 2-min heating at 95 °C, followed by a slow cooling at room temperature. Proteins Production and Purification—hnRNP A1 protein without any additional tag sequence was produced and purified as described previously (10Marchand V. Mereau A. Jacquenet S. Thomas D. Mougin A. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Branlant C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), by using plasmid pET11a-hnRNP A1. A gene coding the UP1 domain was generated by insertion of three successive stop codons (positions 674, 677, and 680) in the hnRNP A1 open reading frame of a recombinant pGEX plasmid encoding a GST-hnRNP A1 fusion protein (generous gift of A. Mereau). Escherichia coli BL21 cells were then used for production of the recombinant UP1 protein. Details on its production and purification are given in the Supplemental Material. For SR protein assays, we used recombinant SR proteins SC35 and SRp40 expressed in baculovirus, as described previously (26Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 468-483Google Scholar) (generous gift of Dr J. Stevenin, Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). RNA and RNP Enzymatic and Chemical Footprinting Assays—The A3M WT or variants RNA transcribed by the SP6 RNA polymerase were refolded by a 5-min incubation at 65 °C, followed by a slow cooling at room temperature. The RNP complexes were formed in 3.6 μl of buffer D (0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 as described previously (10Marchand V. Mereau A. Jacquenet S. Thomas D. Mougin A. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Branlant C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The [protein]/[RNA] molar ratios used ranged from 2 to 100 for assays with hnRNP A1, UP1, SC35, and SRp40. About 3.4 pmol of the A3M WT or mutated RNA were used for each enzymatic assay, and the RNA concentration was fixed to 230 ng/μl by addition of a yeast tRNA mixture. T1 (Roche Applied Science) and T2 (Invitrogen) RNase digestions were performed with 2.5 units/μg of RNA. V1 RNase (Kemotex) digestions were made with 2.5 × 10-3 units/μg of RNA. Incubations were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped as described previously (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Kethoxal modifications were performed as described previously (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For comparison, the free RNA was digested (T1, T2, and V1 RNases) or modified (Kethoxal) in the same conditions. Positions of enzymatic cleavages and chemical modifications were identified by extension of the 5′-end-labeled O-548 primer (supplemental Table 1), by using the avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, as described previously (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR experiments in H2O, RNAs were dried and dissolved in 5% D2O, 95% H2O. Experiments involving nonexchangeable resonances were performed on RNAs dissolved in 100% D2O. RNA sample concentrations were kept below 1 mm to avoid significant duplex formation. Formation of unique species for each transcript was assayed by native electrophoresis. 1H-1H and 1H-15N NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-600 with a z-gradient TXI cryoprobe or on a Bruker DRX-500 with an xyz-gradient TXI probe. The one- and two-dimensional spectra in 5% D2O, 95% H2O were recorded at 277 K for assignment. The two-dimensional NOESY spectra were recorded with 50- or 300-ms mixing times. A combination of Watergate and Jump and Return sequences was used for water suppression (27Collin D. van Heijenoort C. Boiziau C. Toulme J.J. Guittet E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNAs were submitted to temperature titration from 277 to 308 K, and NOESY experiments used for assignment were recorded at 277 K. 15N HSQC spectra were acquired on 15N-labeled NLN8 samples at 293 K in NMR buffer to confirm the assignments and in buffer D lacking glycerol to map the interactions with UP1 as described later. To confirm the assignment and directly monitor Watson-Crick base pair formation, HNN-COSY experiments were recorded at 288 K on 15N-labeled NLN8 (28Dingley A.J. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8293-8297Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar). 15N HSQCs recorded on 15N-labeled UP1 in buffer D lacking glycerol were recorded at 293 K and titrations with NLN8 RNAs were performed as described later. Proton and nitrogen chemical shifts were calibrated against trimethylsilylpropionic acid. The two-dimensional spectra were collected in a phase-sensitive mode via the STATES-TPPI method and processed accordingly using the GIFA software (29Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). RNA NMR Assignment and Analysis—Standard methods were used to deduce the secondary structure and global folding from the assignment of the exchangeable protons (30Varani G. Aboul-ela F. Allain F.H. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 1996; 29: 51-127Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Initial assignments were based on standard NOESY walk analysis. The base-paired NH resonances from the predicted Watson-Crick pairs and those corresponding to unpaired but protected residues were assigned by analyzing NOESY spectra recorded in H2O. The well established patterns of NOE and chemical shifts predicted for Watson-Crick pairs and the strong NOEs involving the exchangeable resonances provided unambiguous assignments for all slowly exchanging NH resonances. Formation of Watson-Crick base pair was further evidenced from HNN-COSY experiments yielding to observation of a direct coupling across the hydrogen bonding. Based on NOESY correlations between imino protons and between amino and imino protons, which are showing whether a nucleotide is base-paired or not, the folding of RNAs was deduced from NMR experiments in H2O and confirmed by preliminary assignment of aromatic to anomeric sequential NOEs when needed. NMR Titration Experiments—For UP1 protein titration by NLN8 RNA, 100 μl of 15N UP1 at a 0.075 mm concentration in buffer D lacking glycerol was used. Two molar equivalents of RNA were lyophilized and dissolved in 100 μl of the same buffer. For titration, aliquots of this solution were added stepwise to the labeled UP1 protein, and 15N HSQCs were recorded at 293 K. The [RNA]/[UP1] ratios used were of 0:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1. For NLN8 RNA titration by UP1 protein, the same strategy was used except that in addition to 15N HSQC, HNN-COSY experiments were recorded at 288 K to assay directly the base pairing of NLN8 upon UP1 binding. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed on 3.4 pmol of cold RNA mixed with 25 fmol of 32P uniformly labeled transcript or on only 25 fmol of 32P uniformly labeled transcript. RNP complexes were formed in buffer D by 15 min of incubation on ice (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The [protein]/[RNA] molar ratios used ranged from 0 to 640. For competition experiments with cold RNAs, the 15 min of incubation of the labeled RNA with protein hnRNP A1 or SC35 was followed by a 15-min incubation with cold competitor RNA (0-80 pmol). The free RNA and RNP complexes were fractionated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels (38:2 (w/w) acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and Tris borate buffer (1 mm EDTA, 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3). The free and bound RNAs were visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Splicing Assays—Assays were performed on 10 fmol of 32P uniformly labeled RNA using HeLa cell nuclear extract (CIL Biotech) with or without addition of recombinant SC35 protein (25-400 ng) in the conditions described previously (21Ropers D. Ayadi L. Gattoni R. Jacquenet S. Damier L. Branlant C. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29963-29973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Incubation was for 2 h at 4°C.The splicing products were fractionated by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Splicing efficiency was estimated with a Typhoon PhosphorImager, using the ImageQuant software. Taking into account the measured radioactivity and the number of uracil residues per molecule, M/P ratios (molar ratio of mature RNA versus residual precursor) were determined for each transcript. The factor of splicing activation by SC35 was estimated by dividing the M/P ratio obtained in the presence of the recombinant SC35 by that obtained in its absence (fold of activation). Several hnRNP A1-binding Sites in SLS3—Protein hnRNP A1 frequently binds cooperatively to several close binding sites (10Marchand V. Mereau A. Jacquenet S. Thomas D. Mougin A. Gattoni R. Stevenin J.

For a better understanding of how it modulates site A3 utilization, we first delineated its binding sites on the previously identified (8Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A.

To this end, enzymatic footprinting experiments were performed on complexes formed between protein hnRNP A1 and the A3M RNA containing these two stem-loops (Fig. 1). According to gel-shift assays, a protein hnRNP A1 molar excess of 5 (protein concentration of 0.8 μm) compared with A3M RNA was sufficient for total con"
https://openalex.org/W1975717636,"Missense mutations in the collagen triple helix that replace one Gly residue in the (Gly-X-Y)n repeating pattern by a larger amino acid have been shown to delay triple helix folding. One hypothesis is that such mutations interfere with the C- to N-terminal directional propagation and that the identity of the residues immediately N-terminal to the mutation site may determine the delay time and the degree of clinical severity. Model peptides are designed to clarify the role of tripeptide sequences N-terminal to the mutation site, with respect to length, stability, and nucleation propensity, to complete triple helix folding. Two sets of peptides with different N-terminal sequences, one with the natural sequence α1(I) 886-900, which is just adjacent to the Gly901 mutation, and one with a GPO(GAO)3 sequence, which occurs at α1(I) 865-879, are studied by CD and NMR. Placement of the five tripeptides of the natural α1(I) collagen sequence N-terminal to the Gly to Ala mutation site results in a peptide that is folded only C-terminal to the mutation site. In contrast, the presence of the Hyp-rich sequence GPO(GAO)3 N-terminal to the mutation allows complete refolding in the presence of the mutation. The completely folded peptide contains an ordered central region with unusual hydrogen bonding while maintaining standard triple helix structure at the N- and C-terminal ends. These peptide results suggest that the location and sequences of downstream regions favorable for renucleation could be the key factor in the completion of a triple helix N-terminal to a mutation.

Abnormalities in protein folding are known to play a role in many diseases, including those arising from mutations in the collagen triple helix (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The best characterized collagen disease is osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), 5The abbreviations used are: OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; Hyp, hydroxyproline (three-letter code); O, hydroxyproline (single-letter code); MRE, mean residue ellipticity. 5The abbreviations used are: OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; Hyp, hydroxyproline (three-letter code); O, hydroxyproline (single-letter code); MRE, mean residue ellipticity. or brittle bone disease, in which there is defective mineralization of bones in type I collagen (2Bachinger H.P.

Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 293-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Such Gly mutations are found all along the collagen chain, suggesting that the loss of a Gly at any site in the triple helix has pathological consequences. The phenotype of the disease varies widely, depending on the type of amino acid substitution and the site of the mutation (5Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 6Byers P.H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is evidence of abnormal folding of collagen in OI and other collagen diseases, which may relate to the pathology (7Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol.

Folding of the triple helix is a complex, multistep process that includes association of three chains to form the supercoiled polyproline II triple helical structure (8Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Collagen is synthesized in a procollagen form, with N- and C-terminal globular propeptides flanking the (Gly-X-Y)n central domain (9McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J.

Posttranslational hydroxylation of Pro and Lys residues in the Y positions and further glycosylation of Hyl occur while the chains are unfolded (11Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royes P.M.

Trimerization occurs through the association of three C-terminal propeptides, and then nucleation of the triple helix takes place at the (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-rich sequence found at the C terminus of the (Gly-X-Y)n region. After nucleation of the three chains, the triple helix propagates in a zipper-like fashion from the C to the N terminus, with a rate-limiting step of cis-trans isomerization of Pro and Hyp (13Bachinger H.P.

All OI collagens show increased levels of lysyl hydroxylation and glycosylation N-terminal to the mutation site (4Byers P.H. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 293-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Prockop D.J. Trans. Am. Clin. Climatol. Assoc. 1988; 100: 70-80Google Scholar). This has been suggested to result from delayed folding, since posttanslational enzymatic modifications can occur only on the unfolded chain. Thus, the appearance of increased amounts N-terminal to the Gly substitution site suggests that the mutation delays triple helix formation at the site, extending the time during which collagens can be modified by enzymes that act only on the unfolded state. In order to study details of the folding mechanism, biophysical studies, including NMR and CD, have been applied to collagen model peptides (17Baum J. Brodsky B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Peptides that satisfy the stringent (Gly-X-Y)n sequence constraint and have a high content of imino acids will form stable triple helices in solution and have been used to model folding of the triple helix (17Baum J. Brodsky B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Brodsky B. Ramshaw J.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). One system that has been well characterized is peptide T1-892, which contains a C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4 sequence modeling the nucleation domain of the Type I sequence and an N-terminal sequence of residues 892-909 from the α1(I) chain of type I collagen (GPAGPAGPVGPAGARGPA) (20Buevich A.V. Dai Q.H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Yang W. Battineni M.L. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6930-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptide T1-892 includes the site of a Gly to Ser mutation at position 901, leading to a mild form of OI. NMR and CD studies have indicated that T1-892 forms a rigid, uniform triple helix along the entire length of the peptide. Substitution of Gly to Ala or Gly to Ser to model the OI mutation results in the formation of a peptide that is folded at the C-terminal end and unfolded at the mutation site and N-terminal to it (23Liu X.Y. Kim S. Dai Q.H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15528-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it has been suggested that that the mutation interrupts the C- to N-terminal folding of the triple helix in the peptide. In OI collagens, however, full-length triple helical molecules are formed, indicating that triple helix can be present on both sides of the substitution site. To better model OI collagen, peptide studies were initiated to develop models that could fold on both sides of the mutation. The sequences N-terminal to the mutation were varied with respect to length, stability, and nucleation propensity to better understand the requirements for completion of a triple helix. The presence of five tripeptides N-terminal to the mutation with a Gly-Ala-Hyp-rich sequence was necessary and sufficient to lead to a fully trimeric conformation, with triple helix formed both N- and C-terminal to the substitution site. This GAO-rich sequence promotes stability and was shown to act as an effective nucleus for triple helix formation. In contrast, the presence of five tripeptide units of the natural α1(I) collagen sequence N-terminal to the α1(901) OI mutation does not lead to complete peptide folding, suggesting that the triple helix may not continue past a mutation with the expected zipper-like C to N folding. Peptides—Peptides were purchased from SynPep (Dublin, CA) and Alta Bioscience (Birmingham, UK). Peptides were purified on a C-18 column by high pressure liquid chromatography, and their identity was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples T1-886, T1-886(G16A), T1-865, and T1-865(G16A) were prepared at a pH of 2.5 and a concentration of 7 mm. Concentration was confirmed by UV spectroscopy. Samples T1-892 and T1-892(GAO)3 were prepared at a concentration of 9 mm. All NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) spectra were recorded at 0 °C with a sweep width of 6000 Hz in the 1H dimension and 1800 Hz in the 15N dimension. Temperatures were calibrated with methanol (+0.1 °C). All of the pulse sequences employed enhanced sensitivity pulsed field gradient techniques (24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). The {1H-15N} NOE relaxation measurements were performed in the presence and absence of 1H saturation at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 °C (25Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). The NMR folding experiments were performed as previously described (20Buevich A.V. Dai Q.H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The sample was denatured outside of the NMR spectrometer by heating for 10 min at 50 °C and then immersed in an ice water bath at 0 °C for 30 s to quickly reduce the temperature to 0 °C. The sample was then transferred to the spectrometer, which was precooled at 0 °C. The total dead time for sample transfer was 1 min. A series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra was acquired every 3.5 min at 0 °C. For each two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, 32 t1 increments were acquired with two scans per increment. Each folding experiment was performed three times per peptide, and the intensities were averaged. The kinetics of folding were monitored by measuring cross-peak volumes as a function of time. All two-dimensional data were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station with the Felix 97 software package (MSI, San Diego, CA). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an Aviv model 62DS spectrophotometer. Cuvettes of 1-mm path length were used, and the temperature of the cells was controlled using a Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller. Samples were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.0, and pre-equilibrated at 4 °C for 2-4 days prior to recording spectra. Wavelength scans were collected with a 2-s averaging time, from 260 to 210 nm at 0.5-nm steps at 5 °C. For temperature-induced denaturation, the ellipticity was monitored at 225 nm. Peptides were equilibrated for 2 min with steps of 0.3 °C, giving an average heating rate 0.1 °C/min (26Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The melting temperature, Tm, was defined as the temperature at which the fraction folded (F) is equal to 0.5. For this monomer to trimer system, F was calculated as follows, F=(θobserved-θmonomer)/(θtrimer-θmonomer)(Eq. 1) where θobserved represents the observed ellipticity, θtrimer is the trimer signal, and θmonomer is the monomer signal. The CD folding experiments were carried out by heating the sample to 70 °C for 15 min and then rapidly quenching in an ice water bath and placing in a pre-equilibrated CD cell at 5 °C (21Xu Y. Bhate M. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8143-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The dead time was on the order of 25 s. The ellipticity at 225 nm was monitored, with a time constant of 2 s and time interval of 10 s. The half time of refolding, t½, was determined as the time for the fraction folded to reach 0.5. Peptides were designed to consider the effects of length, imino acid content, and nucleation propensity on the completion of folding in the presence of a Gly mutation (Fig. 1, a and b). Study of Peptides with Natural Sequences N-terminal to a Gly Mutation—Peptide T1-886 contains a (GPO)4 C-terminal nucleation sequence and seven tripeptide units taken from the α1(I) sequence (residues 886-906) of collagen. A homologous peptide T1-886(G16A) was synthesized with a Gly to Ala mutation at position 16, with five tripeptide units N-terminal to the mutation site (Fig. 1b). CD spectroscopy was used to characterize the conformation and thermal stability of T1-886 and T1-886(G16A) (Fig. 2). Peptide T1-886 gave a characteristic triple helix CD spectrum at low temperature with a maximum near 224 nm and a minimum at 198 nm (Fig. 2, inset). A sharp thermal transition with a Tm of 25 °C is observed as the temperature is increased. Peptide T1-886(G16A), which contains a Gly to Ala substitution at position 16, shows a significant drop in mean residue ellipticity (MRE) at 225 nm from 5194 degrees cm2 dmol-1 to 1988 degrees cm2 dmol-1 and a substantial decrease in melting temperature from 25 to 7 °C, indicating a large destabilization of the peptide and loss of triple helix content. The reduced ellipticity and stability could arise from an alternate conformation in the central region of the peptide or could be due to interruption of the folding at the mutation site and the formation of a partially folded triple helix. NMR studies were carried out on 15N-labeled peptides T1-886 and T1-886(G16A) in order to ascertain the conformation of individual residues. The NMR spectrum of peptide T1-886 contains both monomer and trimer resonances for all labeled positions, Gly28, Ala18, and Gly7, consistent with the trimer form being in equilibrium with the monomer form of the peptide (Fig. 3). The appearance of three trimer peaks and positive {1H-15N} NOEs (Table 1) for Gly7 and Ala18 is consistent with the nonrepetitive environment surrounding Gly7 and Ala18 and the formation of a rigid triple helix along the peptide chain. As seen previously, in addition to the monomer resonance, a single trimer resonance with positive {1H-15N} NOE is seen for the rigid C-terminal repetitive (GPO)4 triple helical environment at Gly28 (27Buevich A.V. Silva T. Brodsky B. Baum J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46890-46895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HSQC spectrum of T1-886(G16A) shows distinct monomer and trimer peaks only for resonances that are C-terminal to the substitution site, suggesting that the Gly to Ala mutation disrupts the triple helical conformation. The C-terminal Gly28 has a trimer resonance with a positive NOE value, indicating that the C-terminal end forms a rigid triple helix. Residues Gly7 at the N-terminal end and Ala16 at the mutation site show only monomer resonances with characteristic negative {1H-15N} NOEs, indicative of very flexible residues. T1-886(G16A) is only partially folded with no triple helix N-terminal to the mutation site.TABLE 1{1H-15N} NOE relaxation values for trimer residues recorded at 0 °CPeptideResidue{1H-15N} NOET1-886Gly280.51Ala180.70Gly70.61T1-886(G16A)Gly280.58Ala16—a—, trimer resonances were not observed for these residuesGly7—a—, trimer resonances were not observed for these residuesT1-865Gly280.59Ala180.59Gly70.49T1-865(G16A)Gly280.60Ala160.52Gly70.44T1-892Gly250.45Gly130.57Gly100.48Ala60.32T1-892(GAO)3Gly250.47Gly130.58Gly100.57Ala60.42a —, trimer resonances were not observed for these residues Open table in a new tab CD and NMR studies on T1-886-(G16A) show that using five tripeptides of native sequences adjacent to the mutation site to increase the length N-terminal to the substitution site is not sufficient to reinitiate folding after the mutation site. Computational analysis suggests that further increasing the length alone will not promote N-terminal refolding because of the inherent instability of the N-terminal triplets adjacent to 886, GPVGPAGKS (28Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These sequences do not have high stability or propensity to nucleate. However, at 865-879 there is a sequence of triplets, GPO(GAO)3GPV, with high imino acid content and high nucleation propensity (Fig. 1). It is possible that this GPO(GAO)3 sequence could serve as a good renucleation sequence N-terminal to the Gly to Ala mutation site, and peptides were designed to test this hypothesis. Sequences with High Imino Acid Content at the N Terminus Allow Folding after a Gly Mutation—Peptides T1-865 and T1-865(G16A) were designed similarly to T1-886 but now include the GPO(GAO)3GPV sequence from positions 865-879 of the collagen sequence N-terminal to the substitution site (Fig. 1). CD experiments indicate that T1-865 forms a highly stable triple helix with an MRE at 225 nm of 4460 degrees cm2 dmol-1 and a melting temperature of 35 °C (Fig. 4). Peptide T1-865(G16A) with a Gly to Ala substitution at position 16 has a very similar MRE of 4037 degrees cm2 dmol-1 but a significantly reduced Tm of 15 °C relative to T1-865. NMR of peptide T1-865(G16A) 15N-labeled at different positions is used to examine the conformation of residues in different parts of the molecule. In the HSQC spectrum, both trimer and monomer resonances are seen for all labeled residues Gly7 and Gly28, consisting of the N- and C-terminal residues, and for Gly16, which is the site of the Gly to Ala mutation (Fig. 5). In addition to the monomer resonances, residues Gly7 and Gly28 show only a single trimer resonance and positive {1H-15N} NOEs, suggesting that they are both in a rigid repetitive triple helical environment consisting of (GPO)4 at the C-terminal end and GPO(GAO)3 at the N-terminal end (Table 1). Three trimer peaks with positive {1H-15N} NOEs are observed at Ala16, indicating that the environment surrounding the mutation site is different for the three chains but rigid on the nanosecond-picosecond time scale. A large downfield chemical shift perturbation is seen for one of the Ala resonances (9.5 ppm) relative to the other two trimer resonances. Based on the NMR data, placement of the GPO(GAO)3 sequence at the N-terminal end of the peptide allows formation of a rigid triple helix at both the C- and N-terminal ends of the peptide as well as the formation of an ordered trimer in the central mutation region. The effect of the N-terminal GPO-(GAO)3 nucleation sequence on the directionality of triple helix folding can be seen in the real time NMR folding experiments of peptides T1-886, T1-886(G16A), T1-865, and T1-865(G16A) (Fig. 6, a-d). Comparison of the folding of native peptides T1-886 and T1-865 shows that T1-886 folds from the C- to N-terminal direction, whereas T1-865 appears to fold as a cooperative unit. Substitution of Gly to Ala in T1-886 results in a peptide that is only partially folded at the C-terminal end but has folding rates at the C-terminal (GPO)4 end that are similar to those seen in the native peptide. Substitution of Gly to Ala in T1-865(G16A), which contains the GPO(GAO)3 imino acid-rich N-terminal sequence, results in the loss of cooperative folding that is observed in the parent T1-865 peptide but does show folding around the mutation site. However, relative to the C-terminal folding, folding at the mutation site and N-terminal to it appears to be slowed down. Evidence That GPO(GAO)3 Is a Nucleation Domain—A peptide T1-892(GAO)3 was designed to investigate whether the sequence GPO(GAO)3 can function as a nucleation domain when located at the C terminus (Fig. 1c). CD data indicate that T1-892(GAO)3 has an MRE of 4750 degrees cm2 dmol-1, similar to T1-892, indicating the formation of triple helix (22Yang W. Battineni M.L. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6930-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Tm of T1-892(GAO)3 is 14 °C, lower than the Tm of 20 °C seen for T1-892. HSQC spectra of T1-892(GAO)3 are typical of spectra obtained for folded trimers, and {1H-15N} NOE data indicate that the peptide forms a rigid triple helix along the entire peptide chain (Table 1). Real time NMR folding experiments indicate that the C-terminal Gly25 residue folds faster than the N-terminal Gly7 residue, indicating that T1-892(GAO)3 folds in a directional manner from the C- to N-terminal direction (data not shown), similar to folding of T1-892 (20Buevich A.V. Dai Q.H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Buevich A.V. Silva T. Brodsky B. Baum J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46890-46895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ability of T1-892(GAO)3 to form a stable triple helix that folds from the C to N-terminal direction indicates that GPO(GAO)3 can function as a C-terminal nucleation domain. To further compare the nucleation ability of GPO(GAO)3 with (GPO)4 the folding kinetics of T1-892 and T1-892(GAO)3 were compared at two concentrations by CD (Fig. 7). At 1.5 mg/ml, T1-892(GAO)3 folds significantly more slowly (t½ = 81.8 min) than T1-892 (t½ = 19.2 min), indicating that GPO(GAO)3 is a less efficient nucleation domain than (GPO)4. The difference between the folding rates of the two peptides becomes less significant at higher concentration (Fig. 7). To investigate the molecular basis of the more efficient nucleation capacity of (GPO)4 compared with GPO(GOA)3, NMR dynamics experiments were used to assess the flexibility of residue Gly25 in the monomer and trimer forms of T1-892 and T1-892(GAO)3 as a function of temperature (Fig. 8). The all-trans monomer Gly25 residues are more flexible than the trimer Gly25 residues as seen by the negative {1H-15N} NOE values for the monomer and the positive values for the trimer. Substitution of GPO(GAO)3 in the C-terminal end results in more negative NOEs at position Gly25 with a more distinct effect at higher temperatures. The more negative NOEs in T1-892(GAO)3 indicate that the lower imino acid content of GPO(GAO)3 relative to (GPO)4 in T1-892 results in more flexibility and mobility in the nucleation domain. Redesign of sequences has allowed refolding of a triple helix on the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal side of a Gly substitution in the context of an OI mutation site. Peptides that contain the natural collagen sequence found directly N-terminal to the α1(I) 901 mutation site did not generate refolding around the Gly to Ala mutation. Substitution of the N-terminal imino acid-poor sequence with a more stable imino acid-rich GPO(GAO)3 sequence found further downstream of the mutation results in a stable triple helix that folds around the Gly to Ala mutation site, with rigid triple helical N- and C-terminal regions. Further studies will be performed to understand whether the naturally occurring heterotrimers have similar features to the homotrimer models studied here. Although the presence of a Gly substitution prevents a continuous triple helix, the NMR data indicate that the central region around the substitution site is ordered. The NMR data on T1-865(G16A) indicate the presence of three distinct trimer resonances at the mutation site, indicating that the three chains are in different environments. The high values of the NOEs indicate that each residue adopts a specific ordered conformation at the mutation site. The 1H chemical shift for one of the Ala NH resonances at the mutation site is highly downfield shifted (∼9.5 ppm). This unusual downfield shift is also seen in the NMR spectra of a different peptide model of OI, (POG)10 with a Gly to Ala substitution (31Buevich A. Baum J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Details of the structural perturbations at the mutation site of the (POG)10 peptide with a Gly to Ala substitution have been described by an x-ray crystal structure (32Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 893-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 34Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the breaking of the repeating (Gly-X-Y)n sequence by the Gly to Ala substitution results in an alteration of the conformation with a local untwisting of the triple helix. At the substitution site, direct interchain hydrogen bonds are replaced with interstitial water bridges between the peptide chains. The significant downfield NMR chemical shifts observed for peptide T1-895(G16A) and for peptide (POG)10 with the Gly to Ala substitution may reflect similar unusual hydrogen bonding patterns to the interstitial water bridges seen in the x-ray structure of the (POG)10 Gly to Ala peptide. The success in complete folding around a mutation site in our peptide systems depended on having the sequence GPO(GAO)3 adjacent to the mutation. Further peptide designs show that the GPO(GAO)3 sequence is a good C-terminal nucleation domain, although less efficient than (GPO)4, particularly at low concentrations. The nature of a renucleation sequence has not been defined in collagen, but it is proposed that a good renucleation sequence may be similar to a good nucleation sequence that allows folding to be initiated. Factors that promote nucleation have been shown to relate to high imino acid content and high stability (9McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Experiments performed on a set of host-guest peptides with different tripeptide sequences have shown that GPO sequences fold faster than GAO sequences, but both are good nucleation sequences (35Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that nucleation propensity may also be related to the dynamics of the monomer state with a highly constrained monomer state related to the efficiency of folding (36Xu Y.J. Hyde T. Wang X. Bhate M. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8696-8703Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The CD and NMR results on peptides T1-892 and T1-892(GAO)3 indicate that imino acid-rich sequences of the form (GPO)4 or GPO(GAO)3 can act as nucleation domains when placed at the C-terminal end of the peptide. The observation that the GPO(GAO)3 sequence, which occurs at α1(I) 865-876 but not the natural sequence α1(I) 886-900 placed adjacent to the Gly901 mutation site allows complete folding on both sides of the mutation has implications for considering the folding of OI collagens with a Gly substitution. It was previously suggested that the sequence of the triplet located N-terminal to the mutation site is important for renucleation and completion of collagen triple helix formation (2Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Liu X.Y. Kim S. Dai Q.H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15528-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Wenstrup R.J. Shrago-Howe A.W. Lever L.W. Phillips C.L. Byers P.H. Cohn D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The implication is that if renucleation occurs, it will take place adjacent to the mutation site and continue in a unidirectional propagation (Fig. 9a). The fact that the sequence that was directly adjacent to the mutation did not result in refolding suggests that renucleation sequences further downstream from the mutation rather than sequences immediately adjacent to it may be required for folding to resume in collagen. The stable and imino acid-rich GPO(GAO)3 sequence found further downstream in the collagen sequence may act as a second nucleation domain, allowing folding to restart in collagen. The discontinuity in folding at the mutation site suggests that alternate folding mechanisms may be required to explain OI collagen folding. Assuming that a renucleation site must be encountered in order to restart folding downstream of the mutation, then reverse folding will be required as well in order to form a complete triple helix around the mutation site (Fig. 9b). To investigate the nature of reverse folding, a set of peptides with N-terminal (GPO)4 nucleation domains was previously designed (27Buevich A.V. Silva T. Brodsky B. Baum J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46890-46895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One peptide, T1′-892n, is similar in design to peptide T1-892(GAO)3 and contains a (GPO)4 nucleation domain N-terminal to the imino acid-poor 892 sequence. NMR and CD studies have shown that the peptide forms a stable rigid triple helix along the entire chain but that the directional nature of the folding is lost when nucleation takes place at the N terminus. To further investigate the details of folding at the N terminus, a second peptide, T1′-892-G10S, was designed to model the effect of an OI mutation N-terminal to a nucleation domain and contains a Gly to Ser replacement at position 10. This peptide folds up to the Gly to Ser mutation site from the N-terminal end, indicating that formation of a triple helix N-terminal to a mutation site is possible in the presence of a strong (GPO)4 nucleating sequence at the N-terminal end (27Buevich A.V. Silva T. Brodsky B. Baum J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46890-46895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reverse N- to C-terminal folding has also been observed in peptides that contain disulfide bonds or foldons at the N-terminal ends (38Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K. Schulthess T. Engel J. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7747-7750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Barth D Kyrielis O Frank S. Renner C. Moroder L. Chemistry. 2003; 9: 3703-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The existence of internal renucleation sites and the possibility of folding up to the mutation site from either the N- or C-terminal end supports the potential for a bidirectional mechanism to complete the folding of collagens with OI mutations. Crystal structure and NMR data of OI peptides support the existence of water-mediated hydrogen bonds at the interruption site, and the recruitment of these waters during the bidirectional folding may contribute to the folding delay that is observed in OI collagens. Examination of the collagen sequence shows that there are a number of regions that contain two sequential (GXO-GXO) triplets that may serve as internal renucleation sites. With the discontinuity in the folding and the lack of a unidirectional zipper-like folding model, the distance from the mutation site to the next renucleation site may also play a role in the observed folding delay in OI collagens and the degree of clinical severity."
https://openalex.org/W2021001573,"Organic cation transporters (OCTs) are involved in the renal elimination of many cationic drugs and toxins. A hypothetical three-dimensional structure of OCT2 based on a homology model that used the Escherichia coli glycerol 3-phosphate transporter as a template has been described (Zhang, X., Shirahatti, N. V., Mahadevan, D., and Wright, S. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 34813-34822). To further define OCT structure, the accessibility to hydrophilic thiol-reactive reagents of the 13 cysteine residues contained in the human ortholog of OCT2 was examined. Maleimide-PEO2-biotin precipitated (surface biotinylation followed by Western blotting) and reduced tetraethylammonium transport by OCT2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, effects that were largely reversed by co-exposure to substrates and transport inhibitors, suggesting interaction with cysteines that are near to or part of a substrate-binding surface. Cysteines at amino acid position 437, 451, 470, and 474 were identified from the model as being located in transmembrane helices that participate in forming the hydrophilic cleft, the proposed region of substrate-protein interaction. To determine which residues are exposed to the solvent, a mutant with all four of these cysteines converted to alanine, along with four variants of this mutant each with an individual cysteine restored, were created. Maleimide-PEO2-biotin was only effective at precipitating and reducing transport by wild-type OCT2 and the mutant with cysteine 474 restored. Additionally, the smaller thiol-reactive reagent, methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate, reduced transport by wild-type OCT2 and the mutant with cysteine 474 restored. These data demonstrate that cysteine 474 of OCT2 is exposed to the aqueous milieu of the cleft and contributes to forming a pathway for organic cation transport. Organic cation transporters (OCTs) are involved in the renal elimination of many cationic drugs and toxins. A hypothetical three-dimensional structure of OCT2 based on a homology model that used the Escherichia coli glycerol 3-phosphate transporter as a template has been described (Zhang, X., Shirahatti, N. V., Mahadevan, D., and Wright, S. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 34813-34822). To further define OCT structure, the accessibility to hydrophilic thiol-reactive reagents of the 13 cysteine residues contained in the human ortholog of OCT2 was examined. Maleimide-PEO2-biotin precipitated (surface biotinylation followed by Western blotting) and reduced tetraethylammonium transport by OCT2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, effects that were largely reversed by co-exposure to substrates and transport inhibitors, suggesting interaction with cysteines that are near to or part of a substrate-binding surface. Cysteines at amino acid position 437, 451, 470, and 474 were identified from the model as being located in transmembrane helices that participate in forming the hydrophilic cleft, the proposed region of substrate-protein interaction.

Additionally, the smaller thiol-reactive reagent, methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate, reduced transport by wild-type OCT2 and the mutant with cysteine 474 restored. These data demonstrate that cysteine 474 of OCT2 is exposed to the aqueous milieu of the cleft and contributes to forming a pathway for organic cation transport. Renal excretion, accomplished by active proximal tubular secretion, is the principal pathway for elimination of a diverse array of potentially toxic organic compounds, including clinically important therapeutics, environmental toxins, and endogenous metabolites (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1649-1654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Many of these compounds fall into the chemical class commonly referred to as “organic cations” (OCs), 2The abbreviations used are: OC, organic cation; OCT, organic cation transporter; hOCT2, human OCT2; rOCT1, rat OCT1; rbOCT2, rabbit OCT2; TMH, transmembrane helix; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; TEA, tetraethylammonium; TMA, tetramethylammonium; TpropA, tetrapropylammonium; TBA, tetrabutylammonium; TPA, tetrapentylammonium; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; maleimide-PEO2-biotin, ((+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate; GlpT, glycerol 3-phosphate transporter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which includes a diverse array of primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary amines that have a net positive charge on the amine nitrogen at physiological pH. Transport proteins of the renal proximal tubule epithelium mediate OC secretion, thus performing a critical role in detoxification (see reviews in Refs. 2Koepsell H. Annu. Rev.

Three homologous OC transporters (OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3) have been cloned and shown to be expressed in the peritubular (i.e. basolateral) membrane of proximal tubule cells where they mediate OC uptake (8Karbach U. Kricke J. Meyer-Wentrup F. Gorboulev V. Volk C. Loffing-Cueni D. Kaissling B. Bachmann S. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F679-F687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Motohashi H. Sakurai Y.

The OCTs are a potential site of harmful drug-drug interactions because they are multispecific, handling OCs of diverse structure and chemistry. Consequently, understanding the structure of the OCT substrate-binding surface is a critical tool for predicting the interaction of OCs with these transport proteins. The OCTs are members of a larger family of solute carriers (SLC22A), which includes the OCTNs (OCTN1-3) and OATs (OAT1-5). SLC22A family members have common structural features, including 12 putative transmembrane-spanning helices (TMHs), intracellular C and N termini, a large extracellular loop between TMHs 1 and 2, and a large intracellular loop between TMHs 6 and 7. These and other structural features further place SLC22A transport proteins into the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). The elucidation of high-resolution crystal structures of two MFS transporters, the Escherichia coli lactose permease (LacY (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar)) and glycerol 3-phosphate transporter (GlpT (12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar)), led to the contention that all MFS transporters share a common structural fold with similar topological organization of α-helices (13Vardy E. Arkin I.T. Gottschalk K.E. Kaback H.R. Schuldiner S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This realization has permitted the application of homology modeling to develop hypothetical three-dimensional structures of several MFS transport proteins, including the rat ortholog of OCT1 (rOCT1 (14Popp C. Gorboulev V. Muller T. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) and rabbit ortholog of OCT2 (rbOCT2 (15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). Using these models others have focused on the organization and alignment of residues within the 12 TMHs, resulting in the identification of a large hydrophilic cleft centrally located within the protein that is proposed to contain the substrate-binding surface, as is the case for both LacY (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and GlpT (12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These OCT homology models were suggested to be valid because mutation of several residues (e.g. Glu-447 and Asp-474 in rbOCT2) lining the hydrophilic cleft had effects on substrate affinity and selectivity (14Popp C. Gorboulev V. Muller T. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Despite several compelling features of the current models of OCT structure, the very low sequence identity between the OCTs and GlpT and LacY (∼15%) casts substantial doubt on the precise alignment between “target” and “template” in the homology modeling process. For example, the long extracellular loop (a structure unique to SLC22A family members) and long cytoplasmic loop (a structure shared by all MFS transporters) were omitted from the rOCT1 and rbOCT2 sequences (14Popp C. Gorboulev V. Muller T. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J.

Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Vardy et al. (13Vardy E. Arkin I.T. Gottschalk K.E. Kaback H.R. Schuldiner S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) present data suggesting that the accuracy of homology modeling of MFS transporters is significantly enhanced when based on a “manually optimized alignment,” i.e. when the sequence alignment is based on several criteria including experimental data. Thus, although the general organization of α-helices within the postulated three-dimensional structures of rOCT1 and rbOCT2 is probably reasonably accurate, experimental validation of the relative location of amino acid residues within these hypothetical structures is required if the models are to serve as the basis for predicting substrate-transporter interactions. In the present study, the three-dimensional model of the human ortholog of OCT2 (hOCT2) was used to make inferences about the relative positions of the thirteen cysteine residues contained within the transport protein, i.e. are they exposed to the external solvent compartment or embedded in the membrane. Based on their relative position in the model, three populations of cysteine residues were identified in hOCT2, i.e. six residues in the long extracellular loop, three residues in TMHs peripheral to the hydrophilic cleft, and four residues in TMHs that form the cleft. Of the 13 residues, only the cleft cysteine at position 474 of TMH 11 was accessible to both of the thiol-reactive reagents used. These findings are discussed in relation to the proposed three-dimensional structure of hOCT2. Chemicals—[3H]Tetraethylammonium (54 Ci/mmol) was synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. ((+)-Biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine (maleimide-PEO2-biotin) was obtained from Pierce Biotechnology. [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) and sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemical. Tetrapentylammonium (TPA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), tetrapropylammonium (TpropA), tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetramethylammonium (TMA), and Ham's F12 Kaighn's modification medium were obtained from Sigma. Platinum® High Fidelity DNA polymerase, zeocin, hygromycin, Flp recombinase expression plasmid (pOG44), and the mammalian expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His TOPO were obtained from Invitrogen. TOPO Cloning of hOCT2 and Site-directed Mutagenesis— The open reading frame for hOCT2 (contained in pcDNA3.1) containing a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (amino acid sequence, GKPIPNPLLGLDST; nucleotide sequence, GGT AAG CCT ATC CCT AAC CCT CTC CTC GGT CTC GAT TCT ACG) was amplified using Platinum® High Fidelity DNA polymerase and sequence-specific primers with the following PCR conditions: 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3.5 min. A final elongation step of 7 min was included after the last cycle. The PCR product was gel-purified and cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His TOPO mammalian expression vector. Mutations of the V5-tagged hOCT2 sequence were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA was prepared using standard methods (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA), and sequences were confirmed with an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA analyzer at the University of Arizona sequencing facility. Cell Culture and Stable Expression of hOCT2—Wild-type hOCT2 contained in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector was stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells and maintained as described previously (18Suhre W.M. Ekins S. Chang C. Swaan P.W. Wright S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CHO cells containing a single integrated Flp recombination target (FRT) site were acquired from Invitrogen (CHO Flp-In) and were used for stable expression of the hOCT2 mutant constructs. Prior to transfection, CHO Flp-In cells were grown in Ham's F12 Kaighn's modification medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and zeocin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were split every 3 days. 5 × 106 cells were transfected by electroporation (BTX ECM 630, San Diego, 260 volts and time constant of ∼25 ms) with 10 μg of salmon sperm, 18 μg of pOG44, and 2 μg of pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His TOPO containing the mutant constructs of hOCT2. Cells were seeded in a T-75 flask following transfection and maintained under selection pressure with hygromycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were used for experiments ∼21 days after electroporation. Cell Surface Biotinylation with Maleimide-PEO2-biotin— The method described here is a minor modification of that described by Pelis et al. (19Pelis R.M. Suhre W.M. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1118-F1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All solutions were kept ice-cold throughout the procedure, and long incubations were conducted on ice with gentle shaking. Cells plated to confluence in a 12-well plate were initially washed three times with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing calcium and magnesium (PBS/CM (in mm): 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 8 Na2HPO4, 1.5 KH2PO4, 0.1 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.0 with HCl) followed by a single incubation in maleimide-PEO2-biotin diluted in PBS/CM. The concentration and time of exposure to maleimide-PEO2-biotin is described under “Results.” In some cases, the cells were pre-exposed to the quaternary ammonium compounds TMA (10.5 mm), TEA (1 mm), TpropA (400 μm), TBA (390 μm), or TPA (210 μm) for 2 min followed by inclusion of these compounds in the biotinylation reaction. The quaternary ammonium compounds were used at concentrations 20-fold higher than their reported IC50 values for inhibition of TEA transport by hOCT2 (18Suhre W.M. Ekins S. Chang C. Swaan P.W. Wright S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After biotinylation, the cells were rinsed twice briefly with 3 ml of PBS/CM followed by a 20-min incubation in the same solution. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (in μm: 200 4-(2-aminoethyl)-bezenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.16 aprotinin, 4 leupeptin, 8 bestatin, 3 pepstatin A, 2.8 E-64; Sigma) for 1 h and centrifuged at 15,800 × g (4 °C) for 30 min to remove insoluble material. 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant mixing. After extensive washing with the above lysis buffer, 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the proteins were eluted from the beads at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoreactivity corresponding to the V5-tagged hOCT2 constructs was detected as described previously (19Pelis R.M. Suhre W.M. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1118-F1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—CHO cells grown on coverslips in 12-well plates were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.0 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). All subsequent washes were performed in triplicate at room temperature in PBS. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 20 min, washed, and incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS (final concentration of 2 μg/ml). The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in the dark with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) diluted to 2 μg/ml in PBS. The cells were washed before staining the nuclei with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml in PBS; Sigma) for 10 min. Cells were washed again and the coverslips mounted onto microscope slides. A confocal microscope (Nikon PCM 2000 scan head fitted to a Nikon E800 microscope) was used for detection of immunoreactivity in CHO cells. Transport Experiments—CHO cells grown to confluence in 12-well plates were rinsed twice with Waymouth's buffer (WB (in mm): 135 NaCl, 28 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, and 13 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) at room temperature followed by incubation in either WB or WB containing maleimide-PEO2-biotin, MTSET, or MTSES. The concentration and time of exposure to maleimide-PEO2-biotin is described under “Results.” Cells were treated with 1 mm MTSET or 5 mm MTSES for 5 min. The dose and time of exposure to MTSET and MTSES were similar to that used to examine cysteine accessibility in the creatine transporter, CreaT (20Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32649-32654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed three times with 2 ml of WB to remove any excess maleimide-PEO2-biotin, MTSET, or MTSES that had not reacted with reactive thiol groups. Control cells not treated with the thiol-reactive reagents were handled in a similar manner. To determine whether the presence of TPA in the binding surface prevented the reduction in transport elicited by maleimide-PEO2-biotin (see “Results”), the cells were pre-exposed to 210 μm TPA for 2 min followed by inclusion of TPA in the biotinylation reaction. Prior to conducting transport in these experiments, the cells were rinsed four times with 2 ml of WB over a 20-min period to remove any residual TPA and/or maleimide-PEO2-biotin. Uptake of 1 μCi/ml [3H]TEA (14 nm) diluted in WB was conducted in the presence and absence of 2 mm unlabeled TEA (∼40-fold higher than the Michaelis constant for hOCT2-mediated TEA transport) to determine the amount of [3H]TEA transport specifically mediated by hOCT2. The cells were then solubilized in 400 μl of 0.5N NaOH with 1% SDS (v/v), and the resulting lysate was neutralized with 200 μl of 1 n HCl. Accumulated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman model LS3801). Individual transport observations were performed in duplicate for each experiment, and observations were confirmed at least three times in separate experiments using cells of a different passage. Statistics—All data are expressed as means ± S.D., with calculations of standard errors based on the number of separate experiments conducted on cells at a different passage number. One-way analysis of variance was used to test the effect of multiple treatments and was followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for pairwise comparisons. Paired comparison of sample means was done using unpaired Student's t test. All statistical analyses were performed with ProStat 3.81c (Poly Software International, Inc., Pearl River, NY) and were deemed significant when p < 0.05. Interaction of Maleimide-PEO2-biotin with Wild-type hOCT2—Fig. 1 shows the secondary structure model of hOCT2 based upon the homology model of rbOCT2 (15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), emphasizing the placement within the sequence of 13 cysteine residues contained within this transport protein. There are six residues in the long extracellular loop and one or two cysteines in TMHs 3, 6, 9, 10, and 11. There are no cysteine residues present in any of the predicted short extracellular loops or intracellular loops. The presence of cysteines in the hOCT2 sequence led to the initial hypothesis that the membrane-impermeable, thiol-reactive reagent maleimide-PEO2-biotin would interact with one or more of these cysteine residues. With a fixed concentration of maleimide-PEO2-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in the biotinylation reaction, immunoreactivity on Western blots corresponding to biotinylated hOCT2 expressed at the plasma membrane of CHO cells increased with increasing time of exposure to the thiol-reactive reagent, with only a slight increase in immunoreactivity with an exposure time longer than 20 min (supplemental Fig. 1A). The relative molecular mass of hOCT2 was ∼85 kDa, a profile similar to that of rbOCT2 (19Pelis R.M. Suhre W.M. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1118-F1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The precipitation of hOCT2 also increased in a concentration-dependent manner, with only a modest increase in precipitated immunoreactivity produced by exposure to maleimide-PEO2-biotin above 0.1 mg/ml (supplemental Fig. 1B). The effectiveness of maleimide-PEO2-biotin to precipitate hOCT2 shows that the cysteine-modifying reagent interacts with this transport protein. To determine the effect on hOCT2-mediated transport activity of covalent modification of cysteine residues, TEA uptake was measured after exposure of CHO cells expressing hOCT2 to maleimide-PEO2-biotin. Uptake of [3H]TEA by cells expressing hOCT2 increased with time in a near linear manner for 30 s, with more than 95% of transport blocked by the addition of 2 mm unlabeled TEA to the transport reaction (supplemental Fig. 2, inset). At a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, maleimide-PEO2-biotin reduced TEA transport in a time-dependent manner with a 70% reduction in transport at 20 min (supplemental Fig. 2A). Using a fixed exposure time of 20 min, there was a concentration-dependent decrease in TEA transport with a maximum effect at 0.5 mg/ml (80% reduction in TEA uptake) (supplemental Fig. 2B). Subsequent biotinylation and transport experiments were conducted by exposing the cells for 20 min to 0.5 mg/ml maleimide-PEO2-biotin. Protection of Biotinylation and Transport by Quaternary Ammonium Compounds—The quaternary ammonium compounds, TMA, TEA, TpropA, TBA, and TPA all interact with OCT2, as shown by the ability of each of these compounds to inhibit OCT2-mediated transport of radiolabeled TEA (and other organic cations) (18Suhre W.M. Ekins S. Chang C. Swaan P.W. Wright S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of a substrate/inhibitor within the binding surface/region influences the ability of maleimide-PEO2-biotin to access one or more of the reactive thiols within the hOCT2 sequence, we tested the effect of exposing cells to these quaternary ammonium compounds on precipitation of transport protein. The addition of TMA, TEA, TpropA, TBA, or TPA to the biotinylation reaction almost completely prevented the precipitation of hOCT2 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, exposure to TPA ameliorated the reduced level of TEA transport elicited by exposure of hOCT2-expressing cells to maleimide-PEO2-biotin (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that maleimide-PEO2-biotin interacts with one or more cysteine residues that are near to or part of the binding surface for the quaternary ammonium compounds. Fig. 3 shows the postulated secondary and tertiary structures of hOCT2 generated from a homology model that used the high-resolution crystal structure of GlpT as a template (15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Between the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein sits a large hydrophilic cleft that is proposed to contain the binding surface for organic cations (15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TMHs 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 of OCT2 (Fig. 3A, blue) form the hydrophilic cleft, whereas the other TMHs (i.e. 3, 6, 9, and 12 (green)) are peripheral, are not exposed to solvent, and likely assist in anchoring the protein in the membrane. In TMHs 10 and 11, Glu-488 and Asp-475 (Glu-447 and Asp-474 in the rabbit ortholog) (Fig. 3, B and C, red) are oriented toward the hydrophilic cleft; site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that these residues exert a profound influence on substrate affinity and selectivity (14Popp C. Gorboulev V. Muller T. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using the homology model of rbOCT2, Zhang et al. (15Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) incorporated several residues known to influence substrate binding (e.g. Glu-447 and Asp-474) to develop a 5-Å docking surface within the cleft (Fig. 3D). The model of the docking surface did surprisingly well in predicting the interaction of the transport protein with 14 different compounds, including high affinity organic cations and low affinity organic anions. As noted earlier, of the 13 cysteine residues found in hOCT2, six are found in the long extracellular loop (“loop” cysteines (yellow triangles)). Of the remaining seven cysteines, three are present in the peripheral TMHs (“peripheral” cysteines (orange circles)), whereas four are distributed in the cleft (“cleft” cysteines (yellow circles)), i.e. within TMHs 10 and 11, at amino acid positions 437, 451, 470, and 474 (Fig. 3C). We hypothesized that maleimide-PEO2-biotin interacts with one or more of the four residues in TMHs 10 and 11 (Fig. 3D). Cysteine Accessibility in the Hydrophilic Cleft of hOCT2— Five mutants were created: a quadruple mutant in which all four of the cleft cysteines were converted to alanines and four variants of the quadruple mutant in which one of the cleft cysteines was restored at each individual position (Cys-437, Cys-451, Cys-470, and Cys-474). All of the mutant transporters were expressed in the plasma membrane and displayed considerable transport activity, albeit at a reduced level compared with the wild-type transport protein (TEA uptake 3-6-fold lower than wild type) (Fig. 4). Of the mutant transporters, only the mutant containing Cys-474 exhibited TEA transport activity that was sensitive to maleimide-PEO2-biotin (Fig. 5A). Indeed, biotinylation experiments showed that only wild-type hOCT2 and the Cys-474 add-back mutant could be precipitated with maleimide-PEO2-biotin. As noted previously for wild-type hOCT2, the reduction caused by maleimide-PEO2-biotin of TEA transport by the Cys-474 add-back mutant was prevented by co-treatment with TPA (Fig. 5B). Precipitation of the quadruple mutant and the Cys-437, Cys-451, and Cys-470 add-back mutants was rescued following permeabilization of the plasma membrane with 0.1% saponin (supplemental Fig. 3). This observation confirms that maleimide-PEO2-biotin does not readily permeate the plasma membrane under the experimental procedures used. The precipitation of the transport protein following permeabilization probably reflects the interaction of maleimide-PEO2-biotin with one or more of the cl"

Although OL excitotoxicity is mainly mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) and is Ca2+-dependent, the molecular basis for AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ influx in OLs remains largely unclear. Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs is inversely correlated with the abundance of the AMPAR subunit glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2). Here we report that GluR2-containing and GluR2-lacking AMPARs are co-expressed in individual OLs and that a subset of AMPARs on each OL are Ca2+-permeable and mediate OL excitotoxicity. Virus-mediated overexpression of GluR2 reduces OL excitotoxicity, whereas expression of its unedited form GluR2(Q) enhances the excitotoxicity. These findings indicate that GluR2 critically controls OL excitotoxicity. During OL excitotoxicity, the transcriptional factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is transiently phosphorylated and subsequently down-regulated. Virus-mediated expression of a constitutively active form of CREB, both in cultured OLs in vitro and in developing cerebral white matter in vivo, up-regulates GluR2, inhibits Ca2+ permeability, and protects OLs from excitotoxicity. Overall, these data suggest that targeting GluR2-lacking AMPARs or CREB may be a useful strategy for treating nervous system disorders associated with OL excitotoxicity.

Unlike neuronal excitotoxicity that is mediated predominantly by glutamate receptors (GluRs) of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type, excitotoxicity in developing OLs is mainly mediated by non-NMDA-type GluRs (9Patneau D.K.

A. 2003; 100: 6801-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the molecular basis for AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ permeability in pre-OLs remains largely unclear. AMPARs are multimeric proteins formed by various combinations of GluR1-4 subunits (11Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs is determined by receptor composition. In particular, the GluR2 subunit critically regulates Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs; AMPARs containing GluR2 have very limited Ca2+ permeability compared with GluR2-lacking channels in various systems (12Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neu-ron. 1992; 8: 189-198Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 13Jonas P. Burnashev N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 987-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of GluR2 in pre-OL excitotoxicity remains unknown. Excitotoxic signals and Ca2+ influx can lead to activation of cAMP-response element-dependent transcription (14Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Activation of the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is involved in cell survival-related gene expression (14Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether CREB can be a survival factor in AMPAR-mediated excitotoxic injury to pre-OLs. In this study, we first report that individual pre-OLs express both GluR2-containing and GluR2-lacking AMPARs, and that pre-OL excitotoxicity is mediated by the subset of AMPARs that are GluR2-lacking and Ca2+-permeable. We next demonstrate a novel effect of excitotoxicity resulting in transient phosphorylation and subsequent down-regulation of CREB in pre-OLs. Furthermore, virus-mediated expression of either edited GluR2 or constitutively active CREB in pre-OLs increases GluR2 levels, blocks Ca2+ permeability, and protects the cells from excitotoxicity. In addition, CREB regulates GluR2 expression in pre-OLs in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that GluR-mediated Ca2+ permeability in pre-OLs is a result of the differential assembly of GluR subunits that produce different discretely functioning channels within a single cell, and that targeting GluR2-lacking AMPARs or CREB may be a useful strategy for treating nervous system disorders associated with pre-OL excitotoxicity. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which excitotoxicity develops in pre-OLs is important for improved understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral white matter disorders. Previous studies have shown a critical role of GluR2 in excitotoxicity in neurons as well as in non-neural cells with expressed recombinant GluRs. This study indicates that GluR2-lacking AMPARs and CREB regulate Ca2+ permeability and pre-OL excitotoxicity, and provides new insights into excitotoxic mechanisms of pre-OL injury. Another interesting and novel finding from this study is the CREB regulation of GluR2 expression. Expression of constitutively active CREB in cultured pre-OLs or in the developing cerebral white matter results in up-regulation of GluR2 and inhibition of Ca2+ permeability. The data illustrate a new mechanism regulating Ca2+ permeability in pre-OLs and in the cerebral white matter. Cell Culture—Highly enriched pre-OLs were obtained from newborn Sprague-Dawley rat brains as described previously (7Deng W. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6801-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Rosenberg P.A. Dai W. Gan X.D. Ali S. Fu J. Back S.A. Sanchez R.M. Segal M.M. Follett P.L. Jensen F.E. Volpe J.J. J. Neurosci.

A. 2004; 101: 7751-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In brief, forebrains were dissected; the meninges were removed, and the brains were dissociated by gentle trituration. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon), and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The mixed glial cells from two brains were plated in a 75-cm2 flask pre-coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml) and were allowed to grow for 10 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 3 days. After confluency, loosely attached microglia were depleted by gentle shaking for 1 h on a horizontal rotary platform. The cells, collected by further vigorous shaking for 18 h, were mainly OL precursor cells. Contaminating cells (principally astrocytes and microglia) were further depleted by placing the cells on uncoated dishes for 30 min. The precursors that did not adhere were recovered from the medium. These cells were then maintained in a chemically defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing d-glucose (25 mm), l-glutamine (4 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), human apotransferrin (50 μg/ml), bovine pancreatic insulin (5 μg/ml), sodium selenium (30 nm), hydrocortisone (10 nm), d-biotin (10 nm), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-AA (10 ng/ml), and basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml) for 6 days with fresh medium change every 2 days. All experiments were performed with cultures maintained in the chemically defined medium without the supplemental growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor + basic fibroblast growth factor). Cultures were routinely characterized by immunocytochemical detection of the expression of developmental stage-specific OL markers, A2B5 (progenitors), O4 (later-stage precursors), O1 (immature OLs), and myelin basic protein (MBP) (mature OLs). A representative pre-OL culture had the following composition: 95% A2B5+, 90% O4+, 4% O1+, and 1% MBP+. All cultures contained less than 2% of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes and essentially nondetectable CD11+ microglia. Oxygen-glucose Deprivation (OGD)—Cultures were switched to the same medium that was deoxygenated and lacked glucose (Invitrogen) and transferred to an anaerobic chamber filled with 95% N2 plus 5% CO2 at 37 °C (7Deng W.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7751-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Pharmacological agents were applied 10 min before exposure of the cells to OGD for 2 h. Cell death was assessed 24 h later, as described previously (7Deng W. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6801-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Deng W. Wang H. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7751-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocking nonspecific binding with 2% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated for 1 h with a primary antibody, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 30 min with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:100) for A2B5, O4, or O1, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for MBP, GFAP, or anti-GluRs. For the staining of intracellular antigens (MBP and GFAP), cells were first permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Cells were mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Scientific Associates, Inc.) and viewed with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. Cobalt (Co2+) Staining—Co2+ uptake evoked by AMPA plus the AMPAR desensitization blocker cyclothiazide (CTZ) was used to assess AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ permeability (16Sanchez R.M. Koh S. Rio C. Wang C. Lamperti E.D. Sharma D. Corfas G. Jensen F.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8154-8163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were exposed to 5 mm CoCl2 in uptake buffer (139 mm sucrose, 57.5 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,1 mm CaCl2, 12 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) stimulated with AMPA (100 μm) + CTZ (50 μm) for 20 min at room temperature. Cultures were then washed twice in uptake buffer containing EDTA (2 mm) to remove extracellular Co2+. The intracellular Co2+ was precipitated with 0.55% (NH4)2S in uptake buffer for 10 min. Cultures were then washed with three changes of uptake buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and the Co2+ staining was enhanced by a silver intensification with 0.066% AgNO3 in development buffer (292 mm sucrose, 15.5 mm hydroquinone, and 42 mm citric acid) (16Sanchez R.M. Koh S. Rio C. Wang C. Lamperti E.D. Sharma D. Corfas G. Jensen F.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8154-8163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation was performed at 55 °C, and the solution was changed at 15-min intervals for 45 min. The reaction was terminated by rinsing in warm development buffer. In experiments where the AMPAR blocker 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) was used, NBQX (50 μm) was added in uptake buffer 10 min before adding AMPA and CTZ. In some experiments, cells were then permeabilized and immunocytochemically labeled with the OL precursor marker A2B5 and/or anti-GluRs. GluR2 Immunodepletion and Western Blots—To deplete GluR2 from pre-OL lysates, immunoprecipitation was performed (17Wenthold R.J. Petralia R.S. Blahos II, J. Niedzielski A.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A highly specific anti-GluR2 antibody (2 μg; Chemicon) was incubated with 10 μl of packed resin of protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h. The resin was then washed and mixed overnight with 90 μl of pre-OL lysates. The mixture was centrifuged briefly, and the unbound fraction was collected. The same volumes of the unbound fractions, as well as the untreated lysates that served as controls, were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody against GluR1/2/3/4 (anti-GluR1, 2, and 4, Chemicon; anti-GluR3, Zymed Laboratories Inc.; specificity, no cross-reaction of each antibody to other GluR subunits) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Pierce). Infection of Cultured Cells with Recombinant Virus—Vector construction for herpes simplex virus (HSV) carrying GluRs or LacZ has been described elsewhere (18Neve R.L. Howe J.R. Hong S. Kalb R.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GluR or LacZ cDNAs were inserted into the HSVPrpUC amplicon, packaged with helper 5dl1.2, purified on a sucrose gradient, pelleted, and resuspended in 10% sucrose. Average titer of the virus stocks was 2.0 × 107 infectious units/ml, and transgene expression was regulated by the HSV constitutively active promoter IE 4/5. Adenovirus carrying VP16-CREB, a fusion protein between HSV VP16 (amino acids 363-490) and CREB (amino acids 88-341), was constructed and produced as described previously (19Barco A. Alarcon J.M. Kandel E.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 689-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The final concentration for adenoviral infection was 1010 infectious units/ml. Pre-OLs were exposed to HSV in regular culture medium for 4 h or adenovirus for 30 min. Following a complete change of the medium, the cultures were maintained for an additional 24 h before any experiments were performed. The viral vector preparations used at the specific concentrations in this study had diminished toxicity, because they contained no detectable wild-type virus, were purified of cellular debris, and had increased ratios of amplicon (virus particles that carry the transgene) to helper virus (virus particles necessary to package amplicon). Stereotactic Intracerebral Injections—To investigate whether CREB might regulate GluR2 expression in vivo, we performed stereotactic, intracerebral injections of the virus carrying constitutively active VP16-CREB into the pericallosal white matter of developing Long-Evans rats at P6 using our protocol described previously (6Follett P.L. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9235-9241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, by the use of aseptic surgical technique, a scalp incision was made in the skull surface, and a burr hole was placed above the desired injection location. The rat was placed in a stereotactic apparatus, and a pulled-glass micropipette attached to a nanoinjector (Drummond Scientific) was lowered with a micromanipulator to the pericallosal white matter, 1 mm lateral to the midline and 1 mm posterior to bregma. Virus particles were infused with a volume of 0.5 μl at 0.1 μl/min. After injection, the scalp wound was sutured, and the pup recovered on a heated blanket to maintain temperature at 33-34 °C and then was returned to its dam. Rats were sacrificed 24 h after intracerebral injection. Coronal brain slices (300 μm) from decapitated P7 rat pups were collected in oxygenrich rat artificial cerebral spinal fluid at 4 °C, stabilized, and then maintained at 22 °C. Slices were then used to perform Co2+ staining and immunocytochemistry in situ using methods as described above for cultured cells. Data Analysis—All experiments were performed in triplicate, and all data represent the mean ± S.E. values of at least three independent experiments. Statistical differences were assessed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. Student's t test was used when only two independent groups were compared. Statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05. AMPAR Heterogeneity in pre-OLs: Co-existence of GluR2-containing and GluR2-lacking AMPARs on a Single Cell—The GluR2 subunit dictates the Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs (11Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar, 12Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neu-ron. 1992; 8: 189-198Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 13Jonas P. Burnashev N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 987-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although we and others have reported previously the presence of functional Ca2+-permeable AMPARs on pre-OLs (6Follett P.L. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9235-9241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Deng W. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6801-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Rosenberg P.A. Dai W. Gan X.D. Ali S. Fu J. Back S.A. Sanchez R.M. Segal M.M. Follett P.L. Jensen F.E. Volpe J.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it was not known whether this was a property of all or just a fraction of AMPARs. We first examined GluR2 expression on pre-OLs, as GluR2-lacking AMPARs are associated with Ca2+ permeability. Interestingly, we found that each individual pre-OL, as identified by the precursor marker A2B5, expresses GluR2 (Fig. 1A). As pre-OLs are highly vulnerable to Ca2+-mediated excitotoxic injury, we determined whether GluR2-lacking AMPARs might also be present on the same cells expressing GluR2-containing AMPARs. We performed Co2+ staining on pre-OLs stimulated with AMPA (100 μm) plus the AMPAR desensitization blocker CTZ (50 μm) for 20 min. Co2+ is a divalent ion that enters the cell via Ca2+-permeable AMPARs and can be used to assay for GluR2-lacking AMPARs (16Sanchez R.M. Koh S. Rio C. Wang C. Lamperti E.D. Sharma D. Corfas G. Jensen F.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8154-8163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found each individual pre-OL was positive for Co2+ staining (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the AMPAR antagonist NBQX (50 μm) blocked Co2+ staining (Fig. 1A). NBQX rather than more selective channel blockers such as Joro spider toxin was used to block the Co2+ uptake, because channel blockers allowed fractional Ca2+ entry and thus failed to fully block divalent permeability (7Deng W. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6801-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These results indicate that individual pre-OLs co-express GluR2-lacking and GluR2-containing AMPARs. To corroborate this finding with an alternative biochemical approach, immunoblotting of pre-OL total cell lysates versus the cell lysates after GluR2 immunodepletion with a highly specific anti-GluR2 antibody was performed (Fig. 1B). The presence of GluR2-free AMPARs was demonstrated by the detection of GluR1/3/4 subunits in the GluR2-immunodepleted cell lysates in which GluR2 levels were virtually nondetectable (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggest that differential assembly of receptor subunits in individual pre-OLs results in both Ca2+-permeable and Ca2+-impermeable AMPARs within a single cell. GluR2-lacking AMPARs Mediate Pre-OL Excitotoxicity—To determine whether pre-OL excitotoxicity was specifically mediated by Ca2+-permeable AMPARs lacking GluR2, we examined the effect of virus-mediated GluR2 overexpression on Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs and on OGD-induced pre-OL excitotoxicity. Unlike other AMPAR subunits, GluR2 undergoes RNA editing that alters a genetically coded glutamine into an arginine located in the pore region of the molecule (11Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar, 12Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neu-ron. 1992; 8: 189-198Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 13Jonas P. Burnashev N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 987-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The Gln/Arg change makes AMPARs that contain the GluR2 subunit virtually impermeable to Ca2+ (11Hollmann M.

Thus, a selective increase in edited GluR2 could have important functional consequences. We infected pre-OLs with a recombinant herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector encoding edited GluR2 (HSV-GluR2). For comparison, we also infected sister cultures with viral vectors encoding GluR1 (HSV-GluR1), which served as a receptor subunit control, LacZ (HSV-LacZ), which encodes β-galactosidase and served as a control protein, or the unedited form of GluR2 (HSV-GluR2(Q)), which forms channels that retain permeability to Ca2+. These HSV vectors mediated transgene expression in ∼80% of the cells, as determined by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining of the HSV-LacZ-infected cultures (data not shown). Although GluR2 was overexpressed in ∼80% of the cells (Fig. 2A), in the HSV-GluR2-infected cultures the expression of GluR1 (Fig. 2A) and other AMPAR subunits (data not shown) was not changed, indicating that the viral gene transfer did not affect expression of other GluR subunits. To examine the effect of virus-mediated GluR2 overexpression on Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs, we performed Co2+ staining on the infected cultures stimulated by AMPA (100 μm) plus CTZ (50 μm), with nonstimulated cultures as the basal condition (Fig. 2B). Expression of HSV-GluR2 virtually abolished AMPA-evoked Co2+ uptake compared with that of the control vector HSV-LacZ or the receptor subunit control HSV-GluR1 (Fig. 2B). We also examined the effect of HSV-GluRs on OGD (2 h)-induced pre-OL death, which we have shown previously to occur by AMPAR-mediated toxicity (7Deng W. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6801-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Deng W. Wang H. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Jensen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7751-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HSV-LacZ was found to be slightly toxic as compared with the nonviral control (Fig. 2C). Expression of HSV-GluR2 markedly decreased OGD-induced toxicity, whereas replacing endogenous GluR2 with its unedited form, GluR2(Q), which converts GluR2-containing Ca2+-impermeable AMPARs to Ca2+-permeable receptors, increased pre-OL vulnerability to OGD (p < 0.001). Expression of HSV-GluR1 also significantly decreased cell survival in the OGD paradigm from 37.9 ± 4.95% to 15.2 ± 3.45% (p < 0.01). Because GluR1 is Ca2+-permeable, increased GluR1 expression on the cells by HSV gene transfer is expected to enhance Ca2+ permeability and cell death. Taken together, these results indicate that expression of the GluR2 subunit critically regulates pre-OL excitotoxicity. CREB Is Transiently Phosphorylated and Subsequently Down-regulated during Pre-OL Excitotoxicity—Excitotoxic signals and Ca2+ influx have been linked to activation of the nuclear factor CREB (14Lonze B.E.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether CREB Ser-133 phosphorylation was regulated by the AMPAR agonist kainate or OGD in pre-OLs. Pre-OLs were treated with kainate or exposed to OGD and harvested at selected time points before cell death was apparent. Cell extracts were then immunoblotted with a phospho-specific antibody (anti-p-CREB) that recognizes the 43-kDa CREB protein only when the Ser-133 amino acid residue is phosphorylated (14Lonze B.E.

LRR is composed of 20-29 amino acid residues rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Recently, the three-dimensional structures of several LRR proteins such as human ribonuclease inhibitor, light chain1 of dynein, plague virulence protein, YopM, etc. have been determined (4Evdokimov A.G.

This specific structure has been thought to be a conformation ideal for binding to other proteins (5Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Small leucine-rich proteoglycans/proteins (SLRPs) are an evolutionally conserved family of secreted proteins that are synthesized as a small core protein containing 6-20 LRR motifs and post-translationally modified with glycosaminoglycan chain(s), N-glycosylation, and/or tyrosine sulfation (10Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SLRP family members play important roles in collagen fibrillogenesis, cellular proliferation, cell differentiation, and migration in various tissues (11Iozzo R.V. Crit.

They are divided into several subclasses depending on numbers of exons, interspaced amino acids within the N-terminal cysteine cluster, and LRR motifs. Decorin (DCN), a prototype member of the SLRP family, belongs to class I and is composed of a characteristic N-terminal cysteine cluster (CX3CXCX6C), a central region containing 10 LRR motifs, and a C-terminal cysteine cluster. DCN is ubiquitously expressed, and it has been extensively characterized as a collagen-binding protein (13Keene D.R. San Antonio J.D. Mayne R. McQuillan D.J. Sarris G. Santoro S.A. Iozzo R.V. J.

At present, 15 SLRP members have been cloned and partially characterized, and most are located in clusters on human and mouse chromosome (24Tasheva E.S. Klocke B. Conrad G.W. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 758-772PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present a new member of the SLRP family identified by a bioinformatics approach using DCN as a query protein sequence. Because this protein appears to be specifically expressed in kidney, it is named as “nephrocan (NPN)”. Its gene structure, mRNA expression pattern, distribution, cellular localization, effects on TGF-β activity, and potential functions are described in this study. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from Clontech and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing a high concentration of glucose (4.5 mg/ml), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Molecular Cloning of Mouse Nephrocan cDNA—To identify a new member of the SLRP family, we first obtained the oreochromis niloticus (nile tilapia) ortholog of DCN (GenBank™ accession number; AF247822) as a query protein sequence and performed a BLAST search of the mouse genome. The candidate sequences were then obtained, and the PSORT II program was used to predict the subcellular localization. This computational screening identified a probable extracellular molecule, NPN, that has a signal peptide sequence but lacks a transmembrane domain. Next we searched its tissue distribution based on the expressed sequence tags (EST) data base sequences. According to that computational information, NPN mRNA was expressed in kidney (EST sequence numbers CA468708.1, AW611331.1, and BX512695.1), aorta (BB224812.1 and BB223005.1), pancreas (BM055738.1), and 8-day-old embryos (AV311419.1). The cDNA derived from kidney was therefore used as a template. The cDNAs containing the coding sequence of NPN were isolated by RT-PCR using Hotstar TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). The sequences of the primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCAATGCACCCGCTTTGGGCTTTTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ATCTATTTCATAATCGTCATCGTCGTC-3′. The PCR product was then ligated into the pcDNA3.1-V5/His-TOPO mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), sequenced at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DNA Sequencing Facility, and the DNA sequence was 100% identical with the one deposited in the public source (NCBI reference sequence number NM_025684). The coding sequence of NPN was then subcloned into pcDNA3 fused with hemagglutinin (HA) tag vector (kindly provided by Dr. H. Ichijo, University of Tokyo, Japan) and the pcDNA3.1-V5/His-TOPO mammalian expression vector and sequenced (pcDNA3-NPN-HA and pcDNA3.1-NPN-V5/His). The sequences including 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were also amplified with the forward primer, 5′-TGCTTGCTACTTGCAAAC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCCTAAGTTTCAGACTAAAACACAAC-3′. The PCR product was ligated into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Tissue Distribution Determined by RT-PCR and Real Time PCR—RT-PCR was performed using the mouse MTC panel I (BD Biosciences) containing cDNA of heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, testis, 7-, 11-, 15-, and 17-day-old embryo as templates. The sequences of primers for NPN were designed as follows: forward primer, 5′-CAGAATCTGCTGTTGTCTATCCCTC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CACACTTGTGCTTAAGACAGTGGAC-3′. RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control primers provided with the MTC panel I was also performed with the same templates. The PCR conditions were as follows: 15 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 95 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C for 38 cycles (NPN) or for 22 cycles (GAPDH). The PCR products amplified by NPN or by GAPDH primers were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. To quantitatively analyze the expression levels of NPN, aliquots of cDNA of mouse MTC panel I were also used as templates for NPN (ABI assay number Mm00481816_m1) or GAPDH (ABI assay number 4308313). Real time PCR was performed in triplicate using the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The mean fold changes in the expression of NPN relative to that of GAPDH were calculated using the values of the expression of either mouse heart or 7-day-old embryo cDNA as a calibrator by means of 2-ΔΔCT method as described previously (25Atsawasuwan P. Mochida Y. Parisuthiman D. Yamauchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Generation and Characterization of Anti-NPN Antibody—A polyclonal NPN antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence in the 4th LRR region of NPN, i.e. 112SALPANLEVLKLNDNAIC129 (Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX). Both preimmune serum and anti-NPN polyclonal antibody were then further affinity-purified with ImmunoPure (A Plus) IgG purification kit (Pierce) and used for Western blot analyses. The heart, lung, liver, brain, and kidney tissues obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley mice (8-12 weeks) were pulverized and then extracted with 6 m guanidine-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 days at 4 °C, and the supernatants were separated from the insoluble residues by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 30 min, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. Aliquots of dried samples were dissolved in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1.5% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged, and the protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by a platereader using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The samples with equal amounts of proteins were then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-NPN antibody, preimmune serum, or anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) as described below. Purification of NPN-V5/His Fusion Protein—pcDNA3.1-NPN-V5/His vector was transfected into 293 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for 3-4 weeks to select stably transfected clones. Positive clones derived from G418-resistant cells were then isolated by cloning rings and further grown in the same conditions. Equal numbers of cells in each clone were plated onto 6-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105cells/well and cultured for 3 days. Cultured media were then collected and subjected to Western blot analyses with anti-V5 antibody to assess the NPN-V5/His protein levels synthesized by the clones. The clone that synthesized the highest level of NPN-V5/His protein was further cultured for 6 days, and the cultured medium was collected. NPN-V5/His fusion protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), and purified proteins were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and kept at -20 °C until use. To determine the purity of NPN-V5/His protein, aliquots of the dried samples were dissolved in distilled water, and protein concentration was measured using a DC protein assay kit (∼50 ng/μl), solubilized in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE. The samples were analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and Western blotting using anti-NPN antibody or anti-V5 antibody as described below. Immunohistochemistry—To determine the distribution of NPN within kidney, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of nondiseased control adult mouse kidney or liver were deparaffinized with xylene and graded ethanol and treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) for 10 min. The sections were then incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, followed by incubation with anti-NPN antibody (diluted in 1:200) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) several times, sections were further incubated with biotinylated IgG for 20 min and subsequently with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase for 20 min. Following several washes with PBS, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine nickel substrate (Vector Laboratories Inc.) was applied, and the sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma). To verify the specificity of the anti-NPN antibody, the effect of the synthetic peptide used for immunization on the immunoreactivity was evaluated. The anti-NPN antibody with or without the synthetic peptide was incubated overnight at 4 °C and subjected to immunostaining in the same manner as describe above. Purified preimmune serum described above was used as a negative control. The immunoreactivities of specimens visualized were photographed under a light microscope (Nikon-FXA) at a magnification of ×20. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—To examine the subcellular localization of NPN, 293 cells were plated onto 6-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well, and on the following day, the cells were transfected with an empty pcDNA3.1-V5/His A vector (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1-NPN-V5/His vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After 72 h, the cultured medium was collected, and the transfected cells were washed with PBS and lysed with the lysis buffer. The cultured medium and the lysate were then incubated with anti-V5 antibody. After addition of protein A-Sepharose 4B conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), the samples were incubated for an additional 30 min, and the beads were washed twice with the lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS sample buffer in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore), reacted with anti-V5 antibody, and detected by alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). As for Smad3 phosphorylation, 293 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) with or without purified NPN-V5/His fusion protein and incubated for 24 h. Cell lysate was used for Western blotting with anti-phospho-Smad3 antibody (BIOSOURCE). Equal protein loading was confirmed using anti-actin antibody (Sigma). Three independent experiments were performed, and the results were essentially identical. N-Glycosylation Analysis—To examine whether or not NPN is N-glycosylated, 293 cells were plated onto 6-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and transfected with the pcDNA3.1-NPN-V5/His vector. After 72 h, the cultured medium was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody, and the immunocomplex was collected using protein A-Sepharose beads. Aliquots of the samples were then treated with N-glycosidase F enzyme (Prozyme Inc., San Leandro, CA) for 24 h at 37 °C, subjected to Western blot analysis in the same manner as described above, and compared with the untreated samples. Luciferase Assay—293 cells were transiently transfected with a combination of the following vectors: 3TP luciferase reporter plasmid vector, Renilla expression vector pRL-TK, NPN expression vectors (pcDNA3-NPN-HA or pcDNA3.1-NPN-V5/His). Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml human TGF-β1, and the luciferase activities in the cell lysates were determined using the dual reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly luciferase activities were then normalized to the Renilla luciferase activities under the control of thymidine kinase promoter. Furthermore, after the transfection of 3TP luciferase and Renilla vectors, TGF-β1 was added together with purified NPN-V5/His fusion protein (∼50 ng/μl), and the luciferase activities were measured in the same manner. All of the luciferase experiments were performed in triplicate. NPN Belongs to a New Class of the SLRP Family—Based on the predicted amino acid sequences, NPN is a 512-amino acid-long protein and shares some structural characteristics with other SLRP members, i.e. it has a putative signal peptide sequence, a characteristic cysteine cluster (CX3CXCX7C) in the N terminus (Fig. 1A), 17 LRR motifs (Fig. 1B), and 3 exons (Fig. 1C). However, NPN has several features distinct from other SLRP members, including four cysteine residues in the C-terminal flanking domain, five potential N-glycosylation sites, and a polyacidic amino acid tail (DDDDDDYEID) at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). Characterization of the LRR motif was based on the general consensus sequence (2Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J.

In both types of LRR motifs, “z” is frequently a gap; “x” indicates variable residues; “a” is valine, leucine, or isoleucine; and I is isoleucine or leucine. In NPN, of 17 LRR motifs, there are 11 type T and 6 type S present (Fig. 1B). Based on these criteria (27Matsushima N. Ohyanagi T. Tanaka T. Kretsinger R.H. Proteins. 2000; 38: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), class I and II SLRPs have 12 LRR motifs composed of four tandem STT “super-motifs,”, i.e. (STT)4. Class III SLRPs, including epiphycan and osteoglycin, have 7 LRRs composed of (ST)T(ST)2. Chondroadherin, a representative of class IV member, contains 10 type T LRRs. Although the conserved asparagine residues of LRR1 and LRR2 in NPN are substituted with serine (LRR1) and glutamic acid (LRR2), the organization of LRRs in NPN is unique, i.e. (STT)2ST(STT)3. The NPN gene is localized on mouse chromosome locus 10 in silico and spans over 1.4 kbp (Fig. 1C). Phylogenetic tree analysis of NPN together with the known SLRP members was performed using the ClustalW server and ClustalX program (28Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The mouse protein sequences used in this study were obtained from the public data base deposited as NCBI reference sequences. These results indicate that NPN belongs to a new class of the SLRP family (2Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J.

Proteins. 2000; 38: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tissue Distribution of NPN—To determine the tissue distribution of NPN mRNA expression, both RT-PCR and real time PCR analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, the band amplified using NPN-specific primers was clearly detected in adult kidney and, to a much lesser extent, in heart, lung, and skeletal muscle. The expression was undetectable in all other tissues. Using the cDNA of mouse embryos at various stages, its expression was found to be transiently up-regulated at day 11 and decreased thereafter. To quantify the levels of NPN mRNA expression among the tissues tested, real time PCR analysis was performed. The results also demonstrated that the expression level in kidney was the highest (∼6-fold of that in heart) among the tissues tested in adult mice, and that during the embryonic development, the expression was highest at day 11 (∼2-fold of that in embryonic day 7), a time critical for kidney development (29Vainio S. Lin Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The results were further confirmed by analyzing another set of mouse MTC panel I (data not shown). Localization of NPN Protein—To determine the tissue distribution of NPN protein, an anti-NPN antibody was generated, and its specificity was characterized. To confirm the NPN-V5/His protein was purified, the protein was stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Fig. 3A, lane 2), and a single band was observed at the expected molecular weight size. The same protein was further analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NPN antibody and anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3), and it was immunoreactive to both antibodies. Because the epitope for the former resides in the N-terminal region of NPN, and the V5 tag was fused to the C terminus of NPN, these results demonstrate that the full-length NPN-V5/His protein was successfully purified (Fig. 3A) and that anti-NPN antibody recognizes NPN. The tissue distribution of NPN was then examined by Western blot analysis with this antibody using the protein lysates derived from heart, lung, liver, brain, and kidney. The purified NPN-V5/His fusion protein was used as a positive control. The results demonstrated that the endogenous NPN protein (an ∼70-kDa band in Fig. 3B) was detected in kidney and, to a lesser extent, in heart and lung but not in liver and brain (Fig. 3B, left panel, lanes 1-5). The immunoreactive bands were observed as a doublet in kidney possibly because of the varied extent of post-translational modifications, the presence of a splicing variant, or protein processing/degradation (Fig. 3B, left panel, lane 5). This tissue distribution was consistent with its mRNA expression pattern (Fig. 2). The purified NPN-V5/His fusion protein (pNPN) was detected at a slightly higher molecular weight position likely because of the presence of V5/His tag (∼5 kDa) (Fig. 3B, left panel, lane 6). When Western blot analysis was done with either preimmune serum or anti-V5 antibody, there were no immunoreactive bands corresponding to the expected sizes in the tissue lysates (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 7-12, and right panel, lanes 13-17). An intense immunoreactive band was detected for NPN-V5/His fusion protein when incubated with anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3B, right panel, lane 18). Using anti-NPN antibody we further examined the distribution of NPN protein in adult mouse kidney. As shown in Fig. 4, the epithelial cells, but not fibroblasts, of distal tubules and collecting ducts were extensively stained, and proximal epithelial cells were slightly stained. There was no significant staining in glomeruli (Fig. 4, A and C). In the presence of the synthetic peptide together with anti-NPN antibody, the structures described above were not immunostained, confirming the specific immunolocalization of NPN (Fig. 4, B and D). Preimmune serum was also used as a negative control, and no immunoreactivities were observed (Fig. 4E). No immunore-activities were observed in liver where NPN gene expression was not detected (Fig. 4F). NPN Is a Secreted Glycoprotein—Because many SLRP family members were secreted as proteoglycans with various types of glycosaminoglycan chains, i.e. chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) or keratan sulfate (10Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar), we next determined whether NPN is secreted in the extracellular space as predicted by the PSORT II program and post-translationally modified. As shown in Fig. 5, NPN was detected only in the cultured medium fraction but not in the cell lysate, demonstrating that NPN is a secreted protein (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). The treatment with chondroitinase ABC or endo-β-galactosidase did not change the migration position of the NPN band on the gel, indicating the absence of glycosaminoglycan chains in NPN (data not shown). However, when treated with N-glycosidase F, the NPN band was shifted from ∼80 to ∼66 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 4) confirming the presence of N-glycosylation in NPN as the amino acid sequence suggested (Fig. 1A). NPN Inhibits TGF-β/Smad Signaling—It has been reported that several SLRP members, including DCN, interact with a number of growth factors such as TGF-β (22Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M.

Because we have identified the NPN gene based on the structural similarity to DCN, we investigated the possible regulatory function of NPN in TGF-β signaling. First, the effects of NPN on TGF-β-responsive luciferase promoter (3TP) activity were analyzed by overexpression or exogenous addition of NPN. As shown in Fig. 6A, overexpression of NPN inhibited 3TP promoter activity in 293 cells, and moreover, as shown in Fig. 6B, exogenous addition of NPN protein inhibited the activity in a"

Histones, the building blocks of chromatin in eukaryotic cells, are subject to several posttranslational modifications including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation (1Vaquero A. Loyola A. Reinberg D. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; 2003: RE4Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These histone modifications play a central role in modulating chromatin structure and function (2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar, 3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). Of particular interest in recent years, histone methylation is known to impact several cellular processes such as chromatin organization, genomic imprinting, and transcriptional regulation (4Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 5Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This modification occurs on five lysine (K) residues of histone H3 and one lysine residue of histone H4 that can be methylated in three different modes, i.e. mono-, di-, or trimethylation. Generally, methylated H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 residues are thought to be activation marks, whereas methylated H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20 residues represent repressive marks (4Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 7Sims R.J. Nishioka III, K. Reinberg D. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Arginine residues can also be methylated to generally lead to transcriptional activation (5Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar).Although other histone modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation have been known to be reversible, histone methylation was considered irreversible. However, recent discoveries of several histone demethylases that can reverse methylated lysine and arginine residues have altered our views of histone demethylation (8Cuthbert G.L. Daujat S.

Importantly, it has been shown that nucleosomal demethylation by BHC110-containing complexes requires the SANT-domain-containing protein CoREST, reflecting an essential role for this protein in histone demethylation in vivo (21Lee M.G. Wynder C. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 437: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 22Shi Y.J. Matson C. Lan F. Iwase S. Baba T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 857-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Strikingly, association of BHC110 with androgen receptor has been reported to change the enzyme specificity toward demethylating histone H3 lysine 9 (23Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Muller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R. Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar).In the present study, we isolated the two Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologs of BHC110, termed SWIRM1 and SWIRM2. Our in vivo characterization of these proteins suggests a role for SWIRM proteins in regulating transcription of diverse class of protein coding genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAffinity Purification of SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 Complexes—FLAG-SWIRM1 and FLAG-SWIRM2 complexes were purified from whole cell extracts isolated from S. pombe strains expressing either FLAG-SWIRM1 or FLAG-SWIRM2 using anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma). In brief, S. pombe cells were harvested and disrupted using glass beads. After centrifugation, anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads were incubated with whole cell extracts for 3-5 h, washed extensively with BC500 (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma). The FLAG affinity eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by colloidal blue staining. The proteins were identified by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectroscopy.Fission Yeast Strains—S. pombe strains carrying deletion either for SWIRM1 or SWIRM2 gene or expressing SWIRM1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or SWIRM2-GFP were constructed using a PCR-based module method (24Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever III, A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 mutant strains were created by first replacing one of the two endogenous allele of a diploid strain with a kanamycin marker cassette followed by tetrad analysis of azygotic asci to recover haploid cells containing the disrupted SWIRM allele.Microscopy Analysis—To visualize the SWIRM1-GFP and SWIRM2-GFP proteins in live cells, freshly growing cells were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 10 min, and subjected to microscopy.ChIP-chip Analysis—ChIP-chip experiments were performed as described (25Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Briefly, soluble chromatin fractions, prepared from strains expressing either FLAG-SWIRM1 or FLAG-SWIRM2, were incubated overnight with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody agarose (Sigma), which was preblocked with 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. DNA recovered from the immunoprecipitated fractions and whole cell extracts were amplified by random priming PCR. Cy5-labeled ChIP DNA was combined with equal amount of Cy3-labeled whole cell extract DNA and hybridized onto an Agilent 44K S. pombe 60-mer array. ChIP-chip data were analyzed as described previously (25Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Verification of the enrichment at the act1 gene was performed by multiplex PCR using the following oligonucleotides: dg223, 5′-TGGTAATACGTACTAGCTCTCG-3′ and 5′-AACTAATTCATGGTGATTGATG-3′; act1, 5′-GAAGTACCCCATTGAGCACGG-3′ and 5′-CAATTTCACGTTCGGCGGTAG-3′.Detection of Sense and Antisense Transcripts by Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNAs were purified using the Epicentre MasterPure yeast RNA purification kit and for each reaction 250 ng of RNA were subjected to strand-specific RT-PCR (Onestep RT-PCR kit, Qiagen). Sense or antisense transcripts were detected by adding during the first-strand cDNA synthesis one primer complementary to either the forward or the reverse transcripts, respectively. The second primer was then added before the PCR reaction. To confirm that there was no DNA contamination in our RNA samples, we performed the same reactions without the reverse transcription step, and PCRs were performed for 27 cycles (-RT). For the detection of antisense transcripts, PCRs were performed for 27 cycles. For the sense transcripts, PCRs were performed for 19 cycles for act1, 22 for cut6, 24 for zer1 and hrp1, and 27 for sfc3. The primers used include act1-FW (5′-GAAGTACCCCATTGAGCACGG-3′), act1-RV (5′-CAATTTCACGTTCGGCGGTAG-3′), cut6-FW (5′-ATCAGTATGTCGAAGTACCTG), cut6-RV (5′-TGCTTGTCCAGCAAGTTTCAT-3′), zer1-FW (5′-GTTTGCTACTGCTCCATATGA-3′), zer1-RV (5′-AGCTTGTGCTAACTTGATACC-3′), sfc3-FW (5′-TTGAAGATGAAGATGCCACTG-3′), sfc3-RV (5′-GCGAAGGTATCCATTATTGTG-3′), hrp1-FW (5′-AAGATGACTCGAGAAGATACG-3′), hrp1-RV (5′-TCTTGGGCATCATACTTATCG-3′).RESULTSSWIRM2 but Not SWIRM1 Is an Essential Gene—Analysis of the S. pombe genome using human BHC110/LSD1 as queries revealed the presence of two uncharacterized open reading frames with close homology to the human histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1).

One of the two endogenous alleles was replaced with kan+ marker gene in diploid cells, and haploid cells were recovered following tetrad analysis of azygotic asci (Fig. 1B). This analysis revealed that while SWIRM1 deletion results in decreased growth, SWIRM2 is an essential gene (Fig. 1B). Moreover, analysis of SWIRM1-deleted cells revealed abnormal protrusions and mutlinuclei phenotype associated with aberrant elongation (Fig. 1C), which is similar to phenotypes displayed by cells carrying mutations in components of Clr6 HDAC complex (31Nakayama J. Xiao G. Noma K. Malikzay A. Bjerling P. Ekwall K. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2776-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, microscopic examination of cells expressing SWIRM1 or SWIRM2 proteins fused to GFP confirmed the nuclear localization of both proteins (Fig. 1D).Isolation of Multiprotein Complexes Containing SWIRM1 and SWIRM2—To isolate SWIRM1- and SWIRM2-containing complexes, we constructed strains expressing FLAG-SWIRM1 and FLAG-SWIRM2. FLAG-SWIRM1 and FLAG-SWIRM2 were isolated using affinity chromatography, and the affinity eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Colloidal Blue staining. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins are associated together as FLAG-SWIRM1 affinity eluate contains SWIRM2 and vice versa (Fig. 2). Moreover, we found an RNA recognition motif-containing protein, SPBPJ758.01, as a common subunit associated with both SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 affinity eluates. Additionally, two related plant homeodomain-containing proteins (SPAC 30D11.08C and SPCC 4G3.07c) were identified to interact with SWIRM2 and SWIRM1, respectively. Interestingly, the SWIRM2 affinity eluate also contains sequences corresponding to the chromatin remodeling protein Hrp1 (32Alen C. Kent N.A. Jones H.S. O'Sullivan J. Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results indicate that unlike its human homolog BHC110, S. pombe SWIRM proteins do not form a stable complex with histone deacetylases. Moreover, our data suggest that SWIRM1 is present in at least one kind of complex without SWIRM2 and vice versa. Finally, while human BHC110-containing complexes display histone H3 lysine 4 demethylation activity, repeated analysis of S. pombe SWIRM1/2-containing complexes failed to detect any histone demethylase activity (data not shown and supplemental Fig. 2). This represents analysis of SWIRM complexes for demethylation of dimethyl-histone H3 at lysines 4, 9, 27, 36, and 79. Additionally, recombinant SWIRM1 protein produced in bacteria failed to demethylate dimethyl-histone H3 at lysines 4, 9, and 36 (data not shown).FIGURE 2Isolation of SWIRM1- and SWIRM2-containing complexes. FLAG-SWIRM1 and FLAG-SWIRM2 proteins were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The FLAG affinity eluate was analyzed following SDS-PAGE using colloidal blue staining.

This analysis revealed a remarkably similar co-localization pattern of SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins at nearly all genomic loci, consistent with the presence of these two proteins in a same multiprotein complex (Fig. 3, A-D). Indeed, analysis of 175 loci that displayed high enrichment (>2-fold) for either SWIRM1 or SWIRM2 localization indicated that a majority of loci (94) are occupied by both SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 2). The 81 loci having little enrichment (<2-fold) for one of the SWIRM proteins tend also to have low enrichment for the other protein, suggesting that these loci are probably occupied by both proteins as well. Moreover, a detailed analysis of promoter regions for SWIRM1 and SWRIM2 occupancy revealed their co-localization near the start site of transcription, consistent with a role for these proteins in transcriptional regulation (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 2).FIGURE 3SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 co-localize throughout the euchromatin domains of the S. pombe genome. A, chromosomal distribution profiles of SWIRM1 (blue) and SWIRM2 (red) proteins across S. pombe chromosomes. Schematic representations of three S. pombe chromosomes, denoting major heterochromatin regions indicated in red are shown (top). ChIP enrichment ratios were determined by dividing normalized Cy5-labeled ChIP signal against Cy3-labeled whole cell extract signal (y axis). Chromosome positions correspond to the fully assembled virtual contigs in Sanger Center S. pombe Genome Data Base (x axis). B, enlargement of chromosomal loci where SWIRM1 (blue) and SWIRM2 (red) are enriched. Annotated genes near the SWIRM proteins localization regions are indicated at the bottom. C, SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 are enriched at the act1 gene. Conventional ChIP experiments using anti-FLAG antibodies were performed from a FLAG-SWIRM1, a FLAG-SWIRM2, or a non-tagged (Control(-)) strain. ChIP and whole cell extract (WCE) DNA samples were analyzed by multiplex PCR on the act1 gene and heterochromatin repeats (dg). D, SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins bind to a large common set of chromosomal loci. Loci with at least two consecutive probe features having enrichment equal or greater than 2 for either SWIRM protein were considered SWIRM binding regions. SWIRM binding regions were considered to be bound by both SWIRM1 and SWIRM2, if those regions contain at least one probe with enrichment equal or greater than 2 for the other SWIRM protein and vice versa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional analysis of genes associated with SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 revealed a wide spectrum of cellular functions including mitochondrial metabolism, translation, intracellular protein transport, and transcriptional regulation (supplemental Table 1). Taken together, these results indicate that SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins regulate a common set of genes involved in many biological pathways, which thus could explain the essential requirement of SWIRM2 for the viability of S. pombe.Localization of the SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 Proteins Does Not Generally Coincide with Peaks of Histone H3 Lysine 4 Dimethylation—Since the human homolog of SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 protein, BHC110, is a histone H3 K4 demethylase that specifically removes dimethylation on lysines (13Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 21Lee M.G. Wynder C. Cooch N.

Cell. 2005; 19: 857-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), we asked whether the SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins display a similar distribution as that of dimethyl-H3K4. Previous genome-wide analysis revealed broad but varied distributions of dimethyl-H3K4 across S. pombe euchromatic regions, with a higher enrichment of dimethyl-H3K4 toward the 5′ end of genes (25Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, overlaid distribution maps between those of the SWIRM proteins and dimethyl-H3K4 showed that SWIRM binding peaks do not generally overlap with dimethyl-H3K4 peaks (supplemental Fig. 2). However, for some genes a partial overlap is observed (supplemental Fig. 2).SWIRM1 Is Required for Optimal Transcription of Its Target Genes—To assess the role of the SWIRM proteins in transcriptional regulation we compared the transcript levels for SWIRM1 target genes in the wild type cells and SWIRM1 deletion strains. Remarkably, absence of SWIRM1 results in a specific and profound decrease in transcriptional levels of the SWIRM1 target genes (Fig. 4, A and B). While deletion of SWIRM1 results in a specific decrease in transcription of sense strand, we observed a general increase in the levels of antisense transcripts in cells lacking SWIRM1. This effect was not specific to genes targeted by SWIRM1 and was also observed in non-SWIRM1 targets (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these results point to a specific role for SWIRM1 in expression of its target genes and a global role for this protein in suppression of antisense transcripts.FIGURE 4SWIRM1 is required for the local activation of sense transcription and the global repression of antisense transcription. A, total RNAs were purified from wild-type (WT) and SWIRM1Δ strains. The levels of sense and antisense transcripts were examined by strand-specific RT-PCR for three SWIRM target genes (top panel) and two non-SWIRM target genes (bottom panel). Panels on right (-RT) show the absence of DNA contamination in the RNA samples. B, the quality of the RNA samples used in A and the relative quantity of RNA between the two strains are shown on an agarose gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report the characterization of two S. pombe SWIRM domain-containing proteins, SWIRM1 and SWIRM2, with close homology to histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase, BHC110. Interestingly, unlike the human protein the S. pombe proteins are not in a stable association with histone deacetylase subunits, and furthermore, we were not able to detect a demethylase activity toward either histones or nucleosomes. However, the isolation of native complexes containing SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins indicated that the proteins are in a stable complex, pointing to a similar function for both proteins. This contention is further verified as our analysis of their chromatin occupancy revealed their association with a similar set of genes.Our in vivo analysis indicated that while SWIRM2 is an essential gene, deletion of SWIRM1 leads to growth inhibition. Although both proteins seem to associate with a similar set of polypeptides, affinity purification of SWIRM2 led to the identification of HRP1 as a SWIRM2-associated protein. It is possible that SWIRM2 forms a distinct complex with HRP1 that does not contain SWIRM1 and that this complex may perform essential functions, which are abrogated upon SWIRM2 deletion. Moreover, we find additional subunits that contain plant homeodomain reminiscent of the BHC80 subunit in human complexes (17Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R.

Commun. 2004; 322: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of notable exception is the absence of SWIRM-associated subunits containing the SANT domain. The SANT domain-containing subunit CoREST is a critical component of enzymatic activities embedded in human BHC110-containing complexes (21Lee M.G. Wynder C. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 437: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar).Interestingly, genome-wide ChIP analysis of SWIRM1 and SWIRM2 proteins did not identify either centromeric or telomeric regions as sites where there is an enrichment of SWIRM proteins. These results are consistent with the notion that the SWIRM proteins may not play a role in heterochromatin-related gene silencing. Indeed, consistent with this contention, we find SWIRM proteins predominantly at transcription start sites, reflecting a role for these proteins in regulation of transcription. Moreover, in the absence of SWIRM1 we have found a profound decrease in transcription of SWIRM1 target genes, pointing to a role for SWIRM1 in regulation of transcription. Surprisingly, lack of SWIRM1 led to a strong increase in the level of the antisense transcripts correspond"
https://openalex.org/W2043644657,"The constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptor and viral oncogene ORF74, encoded by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8), binds a broad range of chemokines, including CXCL1 (agonist), CXCL8 (neutral ligand), and CXCL10 (inverse agonist). Although chemokines interact with the extracellular N terminus and loops of the receptor, we demonstrate that helix 8 (Hx8) in the intracellular carboxyl tail (C-tail) of ORF74 directs chemokine binding. Partial deletion of the C-tail resulted in a phenotype with reduced constitutive activity but intact regulation by ligands. Complete deletion of the C-tail, including Hx8, resulted in an inactive phenotype that lacks CXCL8 binding sites and has an increased number of binding sites for CXCL10. Similar effects were obtained with the single R7.61322W or Q7.62323P mutations in Hx8. We propose that the conserved charged or polar side chain at position 7.61 has a specific role in stabilizing the end of transmembrane domain 7 (TM7). Disruption of Hx8 by deletion or mutation distorts an H-bonding network, involving highly conserved amino acids within TM2, TM7, and Hx8, that is crucial for positioning of the TM domains, coupling to Gαq, and CXCL8 binding. Thus, Hx8 appears to exert a key role in receptor stabilization through the conserved residue R7.61, directing the ligand binding profile of ORF74 and likely also that of other class A G-protein-coupled receptors. The constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptor and viral oncogene ORF74, encoded by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8), binds a broad range of chemokines, including CXCL1 (agonist), CXCL8 (neutral ligand), and CXCL10 (inverse agonist).

Although for most viral GPCRs, their role in viral pathogenesis still has to be elucidated, for the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded receptor ORF74, a clear link to Kaposi sarcoma has been established (1Jensen K.K. Manfra D.J. Grisotto M.G. Martin A.P. Vassileva G. Kelley K. Schwartz T.W. Lira S.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3686-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Due to their homology with human chemokine receptors and the acquisition of additional properties, such as constitutive activity and promiscuous G-protein coupling and chemokine binding, viral GPCRs provide unique insight in the molecular mechanisms of chemokine receptor function. ORF74 shares homology with the CXC chemokine receptor family and with CXCR2 in particular (see Ref. 2Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar for an overview of chemokine receptors and nomenclature). In general, human chemokine receptors bind only a subset of chemokines. Interestingly, ORF74 binds a broad range of chemokines with unique pharmacology. Several CXCR2 ligands act as agonist (e.g. CXCL1/GROα (growth-related oncogene α)), partial agonist, neutral ligand (e.g. CXCL8/IL-8 (interleukin-8)), or inverse agonist. Both CXCR3 and CXCR4 ligands, CXCL10/IP-10 (γ-interferon-inducible protein-10) and CXCL12/SDF-1α (stromal cell-derived factor 1-α), respectively, act as inverse agonists (3Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previously, it was demonstrated that both CXCL1 and CXCL10 bind with high affinity either to a common conformation of ORF74 or to readily interconvertible states, not available for the neutral ligand CXCL8 (3Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also, for other class A GPCRs known to bind more than one ligand, e.g. the tachykinin NK1 receptor (4Holst B. Hastrup H. Raffetseder U. Martini L. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19793-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and chemokine receptors CXCR2 (5Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and US28 (7Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), binding modes appear clearly distinct for the different ligands. This phenomenon is associated with the inability of some of these ligands to displace each other and/or a clear difference in the apparent number of binding sites (Bmax), suggesting that these ligands bind to distinct receptor populations (8Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). For chemokine receptors, the binding mode is defined by interaction of chemokines with the extracellular N terminus and loops of their cognate receptors (9Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hebert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ho H.H. Du D. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31327-31332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as by the activation state of the receptor (6Cox M.A. Jenh C.-H. Gonsiorek W. Fine J. Narula S.K. Zavodny P.J. Hipkin R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that also the intracellular side of the receptor, more particularly Hx8 in the C-tail of ORF74, directs chemokine binding. Mutational analysis and receptor modeling studies show that disruption of the intracellular Hx8 distorts the H-binding network crucial for positioning of the transmembrane domains and interaction with Gαq, thereby inducing differential chemokine binding to ORF74. Thus, positioning of Hx8 of ORF74 appears to be a key determinant in directing chemokine binding. Materials—Cell culture media, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen, and fetal bovine serum was purchased from Integro B.V. (Dieren, The Netherlands). myo-[2-3H]Inositol (17 Ci/mmol) and 125I-labeled CXCL1, CXCL8, and CXCL10 (2,200 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Chemokines were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). DNA Constructs—The cDNA of the HHV-8-encoded ORF74 (GenBank™ accession number U71368 with a silent G → T mutation at position 927) was a gift from T. Schwartz and inserted in pcDEF3 (a gift from J.

ORF74 C-tail deletion mutants were constructed using PCR. Constructs were tagged at the N terminus with the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope using PCR or subcloning. pEGFP-N1 constructs containing cDNA encoding ORF74-WT, Δ12, and Δ24 have been described before (12Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). pSG5-ORF74-R322W and -Q323P were previously described (13Liu C. Sandford G. Fei G. Nicholas J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2460-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The NF-κB reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown at 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of ORF74 construct or empty vector (mock transfection) per million cells using DEAE-dextran. ELISA—COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding HA-tagged ORF74 constructs or empty vector (mock transfection). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After blocking with 1% skim milk in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.6), cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (a gift from J. van Minnen) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, cells were incubated with substrate buffer containing 2 mm o-phenylenediamine (Sigma), 35 mm citric acid, 66 mm Na2HPO4, 0.015% H2O2 (pH 5.6). The reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4, and absorption at 490 nm was determined. Confocal Imaging—Transfected COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips. After 48 h, confocal images were collected at a wavelength of 488 nm and processed as described previously (14Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J.F. Broers J.L.V. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C Activation—Twenty-four h after transfection, COS-7 cells were labeled overnight in Earle's inositol-free minimal essential medium supplemented with myo-[2-3H]-inositol (2 μCi/ml). Cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm LiCl and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and incubated for 2 h in the same medium in the presence or absence of indicated chemokines (100 nm). Inositol phosphates were isolated as described previously (15Verzijl D. Fitzsimons C.P. Van Dijk M. Stewart J.P. Timmerman H. Smit M.J. Leurs R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3343-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and counted by liquid scintillation. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc (5 μg/106 cells) and indicated ORF74 constructs (2 μg/106 cells). Transfected cells were seeded in 96-well white plates (Costar) in serum-free culture medium and incubated with the indicated chemokines (100 nm) for 48 h, after which NF-κB-driven luciferase expression was measured by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 25 μl of luciferase assay reagent (0.83 mm ATP, 0.83 mm d-luciferin, 18.7 mm MgCl2, 0.78 μm Na2H2P2O7, 38.9 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.39% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2.6 μm dithiothreitol). Luminescence was measured for 3 s in a Wallac Victor2. Binding Experiments—Transfected COS-7 cells were seeded in 48-well plates. After 48 h, binding was performed on whole cells for 4 h at 4°C using 125I-labeled chemokines (∼100 pm) in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) in the presence or absence of unlabeled chemokine. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Subsequently, cells were lysed and counted in a Wallac Compugamma counter. Total protein per well was determined with lysed cells using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Construction of the ORF74 Receptor Model—A model of the ORF74 receptor was constructed by homology modeling using the crystal structure of rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1U19) (16Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.-N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) as template. The following amino acids were aligned: N55-N1.5065 (the superscripts represent the residue numbering in the rhodopsin structure and ORF74 sequence, respectively, and 1.50 is the standardized numbering for GPCRs according to Ballesteros and Weinstein (17Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2465) Google Scholar), based on the most conserved amino acid in each TM helix). The first number refers to the helix in which the amino acid is located, and the second number indicates the position relative to the most conserved amino acid at position 50 in that helix, i.e. N1.50, D2.50, R3.50, W4.50, P5.50, P6.50, and P7.50), N73-D2.4083, R135-R3.50143, P215-P5.50223, P267-P6.50266, and P303-P7.50311. The absence of W4.50 in the ORF74 receptor makes the orientation of TM4 arbitrary. The amino acids at the intracellular C-terminal domain are numbered relative to P303-P7.50311. Thus, the highly conserved Phe side chain in Hx8 is F313-F7.60321. A detailed description of the procedure to obtain the molecular models of wild type and mutant receptors has been reported elsewhere (18Jongejan A. Bruysters M. J. A. B. Haaksma E. Bakker R.A. Pardo L. Leurs R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Deletion of C-tail Does Not Affect ORF74 Expression—ORF74-WT and C-tail deletion mutants of ORF74 (Δ12 and Δ24 amino acids) were constructed (Fig. 1A). The constructs were also tagged at the N terminus with the HA epitope or C-terminally fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (12Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All constructs were expressed at the cell surface to a similar degree as wild type (WT) ORF74 in COS-7 cells, as assessed by ELISA with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B). Confocal microscopic images of cells expressing ORF74-WT-EGFP, Δ12-EGFP, and Δ24-EGFP confirmed that these receptors show similar expression patterns (Fig. 1C). Gαq-mediated Signaling Is Modulated by Deletion of the C-tail of ORF74—ORF74 activates phospholipase C (PLC) in the absence of ligands through activation of Gαq proteins (19Arvanitakis L.

ORF74-Δ12 was less efficient than WT in constitutive activation of PLC, whereas ORF74-Δ24 lacked all constitutive activity (Fig. 2A). The level of activation of ORF74-Δ12 by the agonist CXCL1 was comparable with WT. In contrast, ORF74-Δ24 did not respond to CXCL1. The inverse agonist CXCL10 inhibited basal signaling of ORF74-WT and Δ12, whereas Δ24 was unaffected by incubation with CXCL10 as expected since ORF74-Δ24 did not display constitutive activity. Similar results were obtained when ORF74-mediated NF-κB activation was measured using a NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the C-tail of ORF74 is important for Gαq-mediated signal transduction. C-tail Directs Chemokine Binding Profile of ORF74—The observed reduction in constitutive signaling could be a consequence of the expression of improperly folded receptors, which cannot be discriminated from functional receptors by the ELISA and confocal microscopy experiments shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, binding experiments with the radiolabeled neutral ligand CXCL8 were performed. 125I-CXCL8 binding to ORF74-Δ12 was reduced when compared with WT (Fig. 3A). Moreover, ORF74-Δ24 did not bind 125I-CXCL8 at all. Similar experiments were performed with the radiolabeled inverse agonist CXCL10. Surprisingly, a gradual increase in 125I-CXCL10 binding was observed upon deletion of C-terminal amino acids when compared with WT (Fig. 3A). ORF74-Δ24, which did not bind 125I-CXCL8, showed the most pronounced increase in 125I-CXCL10 binding. Binding with the radiolabeled agonist CXCL1 was unaffected for ORF74-Δ12 or Δ24 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the affinity of all tested chemokines for the deletion mutants did not change significantly when compared with ORF74-WT, as determined with homologous displacement curves (Fig. 3, C-E). Interestingly, different numbers of binding sites were obtained for the radiolabeled chemokines. For CXCL8, the observed Bmax varied between ∼300 (WT) and 0 (Δ24) fmol/mg of protein. The Bmax values for CXCL1 and CXCL10 were about 10-fold higher in the 1-5 pmol/mg of protein range. Notably, Bmax values for CXCL1 were consistently higher than for CXCL10. Therefore, it appears that the C-tail of ORF74 influences the chemokine binding profile of ORF74. Chemokine Binding Profile of ORF74 Correlates with Proper Gαq Interaction—We previously showed that several residues of the C-tail distal to the seventh transmembrane domain affect functional G-protein coupling (13Liu C. Sandford G. Fei G. Nicholas J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2460-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In particular, the ORF74-R322W mutant (R7.61322W, according to the standardized GPCR numbering (17Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2465) Google Scholar), see “Experimental Procedures”) was unable to couple functionally to Gαq in the absence of ligands in HEK293 cells. Another mutant, ORF74-Q323P (Q7.62323P), was unable to constitutively activate both Gαq- and Gαi-mediated signaling pathways in HEK293 cells (13Liu C. Sandford G. Fei G. Nicholas J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2460-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In this study, we further analyzed the effect of these mutations on signaling and chemokine binding properties. Both ORF74-R322W and -Q323P mutants were unable to constitutively activate PLC in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4A), consistent with their inability to constitutively activate Gαq. However, ORF74-R322W activated PLC-mediated signaling when incubated with the agonist CXCL1, whereas ORF74-Q323P did not activate PLC in the presence of CXCL1. The inverse agonist CXCL10 inhibited constitutive signaling of WT, and signaling of the constitutively inactive mutants was unaffected by CXCL10 as expected. Next, we investigated activation of NF-κB by both point mutants. ORF74-R322W and ORF74-Q323P did not constitutively activate NF-κB in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4B). However, both mutants could be stimulated with CXCL1 in this assay, although activation of NF-κB by ORF74-Q323P was only marginal. As expected, no effect on signaling of the inactive mutants was observed for the inverse agonist CXCL10 (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, binding experiments with radiolabeled CXCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL1 were performed. Similar to ORF74-Δ12, ORF74-R322W displayed a reduced number of CXCL8 binding sites, whereas the number of CXCL10 binding sites was increased when compared with WT (Fig. 5A). As seen for ORF74-Δ24, ORF74-Q323P did not bind CXCL8 at all, although it showed more binding sites for CXCL10 when compared with WT (Fig. 5A). All receptors had a comparable number of binding sites for CXCL1 (Fig. 5B). The observed changes in the amount of CXCL8 and CXCL10 binding could not be explained by a change in affinity of the ligands for the mutants (Fig. 5, C-E) but was a result of a change in the number of binding sites. Summarizing, the ability of the C-tail of ORF74 to functionally interact with Gαq correlates with its chemokine binding profile.FIGURE 5Chemokine binding profile of ORF74-R322W and -Q323P. COS-7 cells were transfected with indicated ORF74 constructs. A, binding experiments with 125I-labeled CXCL8 (black bars) and CXCL10 (white bars) were performed in the absence (total binding) or presence (unspecific binding) of unlabeled homologous chemokine (100 nm). B, binding experiments with 125I-CXCL1 were performed in the absence (total binding) or presence (unspecific binding) of unlabeled CXCL1 (100 nm). Data are presented as specific binding (total binding - unspecific binding) in cpm. C-E, homologous displacement curves were generated in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokine. Data are presented as the percentage of total binding of each construct. The pIC50 values for CXCL8 were 8.6 and 8.5 for ORF74-WT and -R322W, respectively. The pIC50 value for Q323P could not be determined since this mutant did not bind 125I-CXCL8. For CXCL10, the pIC50 values were 8.6, 8.3, and 8.4 for ORF74-WT, -R322W, and -Q323P, respectively. For CXCL1, the pIC50 values were 8.3, 8.0, and 8.2, respectively, for WT, R322W, and Q323P. Representative experiments performed in triplicate are shown. The experiments were repeated at least two times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ORF74 C-tail Directs the Number of Binding Sites Accessible to Each Individual Ligand—Both CXCL1 and CXCL10 bind with high affinity to a common conformation of the receptor or to readily interconvertible states, not available for CXCL8 (3Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the change in the number of binding sites for CXCL8 and CXCL10 could be explained by a change in the number of receptor states that are accessible for these ligands. To this end, heterologous displacement experiments were performed with the mutants that showed the most extreme differences in chemokine binding when compared with ORF74-WT, i.e. Δ24 and Q323P. Interestingly, although CXCL8 and CXCL10 could not effectively displace 125I-CXCL1 from ORF74-WT, CXCL10 could displace part of the bound 125I-CXCL1 from the constitutively inactive mutants ORF74-Δ24 and -Q323P (Fig. 6A). All chemokines could effectively displace 125I-CXCL8 from ORF74-WT (Fig. 6B). Heterologous displacement of 125I-CXCL8 from the ORF74-Δ24 and -Q323P mutants could not be performed since they do not bind CXCL8. CXCL8 could not effectively displace 125I-CXCL10 from ORF74-WT, -Δ24, or -Q323P (Fig. 6C). In contrast, CXCL1 could displace 125I-CXCL10 effectively from all mutants (Fig. 6C), even from ORF74-Δ24 and -Q323P, which showed an increase in total 125I-CXCL10 binding (Figs. 3A and 5A, respectively). Summarizing, the binding sites of 125I-CXCL1 and 125I-CXCL10 are not available for CXCL8. Furthermore, the number of 125I-CXCL1 binding sites that are accessible for CXCL10 differs between ORF74-WT and both mutants, indicating a shift in receptor states for the mutants. ORF74 Model Predicts a Key Role for Hx8 in Receptor Stabilization—To explain the observed changes in chemokine binding properties upon alteration of the C-tail, a receptor model based on the crystal structure of rhodopsin (16Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.-N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) was constructed. The membrane-proximal residues of the C-tail are part of the predicted Hx8 of ORF74 (Fig. 1A, underlined). Fig. 7, A and B, show TM7 (blue, up to C7.55316), Hx8 that expands parallel to the membrane (dark red, from L7.59320 to Q7.69330), and the following C-tail that changes direction to cover Hx8 (S7.70331-T7.81342). The ORF74-Δ12 mutant lacks the C-tail up to Hx8, whereas ORF74-Δ24 does no longer possess Hx8 (Fig. 7, A and B). The stability of α-helices is achieved by the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of residue i to the N-H amide atoms of residue i+4 in the following turn of the helix. Notably, the backbone carbonyl oxygens of residues at positions S7.54315 and C7.55316 do not possess their backbone N-H counterparts because they are located at the bottom of TM7 (Fig. 7B). Instead, the polar head group of R7.61322 stabilizes these free, helix-ending carbonyls through hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 7B). The transition from TM7, perpendicular to the membrane, to Hx8, parallel to the membrane, is accomplished through the non-helical amino acids at positions L7.56317-S7.58319. S7.58319 contains the first backbone carbonyl engaged in the intramolecular hydrogen bond network that stabilizes Hx8 (Fig. 7A). The electronic nature of the carbonyl oxygen allows the formation of a hydrogen bond with both the N-H group of the residue in the following turn of the helix and the side chain of Q7.62323 in ORF74 (Fig. 7A). When Q7.62323 is mutated to Pro (ORF74-Q323P), this interaction cannot take place (Fig. 7C). Fig. 7D shows the interaction of Y7.53314 in TM7 with F7.60321 in Hx8 and with D2.4083 in TM2. The residues Y7.53 and F7.60 are highly conserved in the rhodopsin family of GCPRs (92 and 68%, respectively) and form the NPXXYX5,6F motif (22Fritze O. Filipek S. Kuksa V. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2290-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The Asp (D2.4083) at the intracellular boundary of TM2 is conserved among chemokine receptors and has previously been shown to affect signaling of ORF74 (23Ho H.H. Ganeshalingam N. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of Y7.53314 forms hydrogen bonds with the Oδ group and the carbonyl oxygen (via a water molecule) D2.4083 in TM2 (Fig. 7D). The recent x-ray structure of rhodopsin, the prototype of class A receptors, revealed the presence of a highly conserved amphipathic eight helix (24Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). Based on this x-ray structure, it has been predicted that Hx8 interacts with the N-terminal helix of Gα and Gβγ subunits (25Lu Z.-L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), implying its involvement in G-protein coupling. Although for some GPCRs, Hx8 appears dispensable for signaling (26Waldhoer M. Casarosa P. Rosenkilde M.M. Smit M.J. Leurs R. Whistler J.L. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19473-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the importance of Hx8 in G-protein interaction has been shown, e.g. for the oxytocin receptor (27Hoare S.

Moreover, the N-terminal portion of Hx8 of the protease-activated receptor PAR1 was found to be involved in coupling to Gαq, through a network of H-bond and ionic interactions, connecting Hx8 to the conserved NPXXYX5,6F motif on TM7 and also to the adjacent intracellular loop 1 (32Swift S. Leger A.J. Talavera J. Zhang L. Bohm A. Kuliopulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4109-4116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Hx8 of ORF74 is an important determinant for constitutive activity, and more importantly, chemokine binding, using functional, binding, and computational approaches. Deletion of up to 12 amino acids of the C-tail resulted in reduced constitutive activation of PLC and NF-κB but not of agonist activation by CXCL1 (Fig. 2). Deletion of the entire C-tail including Hx8, however, resulted in a completely inactive receptor. The gradual loss of constitutive activity of ORF74-Δ12 and Δ24 was accompanied by a striking reduction in binding sites for CXCL8 and an increase in binding sites for CXCL10 (Fig. 3A). We therefore hypothesized that impaired coupling to Gαq caused the change in the chemokine binding pattern of ORF74. To test this hypothesis, we used ORF74-mutants (R322W and Q323P) in"
https://openalex.org/W2029865947,"The KRAB transcriptional repressor domain, commonly found in zinc finger proteins, acts by inducing the formation of heterochromatin. We previously exploited this property to achieve drug-regulated transgenesis and knock down by combining doxycycline-controllable KRAB-containing fusion proteins and lentiviral vectors. Here, we asked whether KRAB-induced repression is widespread or limited to specific regions of the genome. For this, we transduced cells with a lentiviral vector expressing a target reporter and a KRAB-containing transcriptional repressor from a bicistronic mRNA. We found that ∼1.4% of the resulting proviruses escaped repression. However, this phenotype could be reverted by expressing the KRAB-containing protein in trans. Accordingly, the irrepressible proviruses all contained, in the DNA sequence encoding the KRAB-containing effector or its upstream internal ribosomal entry site, mutations or deletions likely resulting from errors or recombination during reverse transcription. These results indicate that KRAB-induced transcriptional repression is robust and active over a variety of genomic contexts that include at least the wide range of sites targeted by lentiviral integration."

PITPs catalyze such energy-independent transfer of either phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) or phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) between membrane bilayers in vitro, with PtdIns representing the preferred ligand in the transfer reactions (1Cleves A.E.

Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). PITPs themselves are highly conserved across the eukaryotic kingdom and fall into two distinct classes based upon primary sequence and structural fold (reviewed in Ref. 2Phillips S.E. Vincent P. Rizzieri K. Schaaf G. Gaucher E.A. Bankaitis V.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). These two classes are defined as the Sec14p-like PITPs and the unrelated metazoan PITPs. Deficiencies in metazoan PITP functions are either cell-lethal in mammals or, in the case of PITP-α isoform, result in neurodegenerative, glucose homeostatic, and intestinal malabsorbtion diseases in mice (3Alb J.G. Cortese Jr., J.D. Phillips S.E. Albin R.L. Nagy T.R. Hamilton B.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33501-33518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sec14p domain proteins are also of medical interest, since inherited disorders, such as vitamin E-responsive ataxia, ataxia/dystonia in the jittery mouse, etc., are associated with individual defects in them (4Yokota T.

Moreover, the developmental switch from yeast to mycelial growth modes, a morphogenetic program whose execution is essential for the pathogenesis of dimorphic yeast, is also regulated by Sec14p isoforms (6Carmen-Lopez M. Nicaud J.-M. Skinner H.B. Vergnolle C. Kader J.C. Bankaitis V.A. Gaillardin C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 113-127Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Monteoliva L. Sanchez M. Pla J. Gil C. Nombela C. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The preponderance of evidence indicates that PITPs integrate the action of specific phospholipid metabolic reactions with regulation of specific membrane trafficking processes.The largest and most widely distributed PITP class is represented by the Sec14p-like proteins, so named on the basis of the founding member of the family, the yeast Sec14p PITP. The Sec14p-like PITP class consists of nearly 300 members, and it is appropriate to consider this large group of proteins as the Sec14p superfamily (2Phillips S.E. Vincent P. Rizzieri K. Schaaf G. Gaucher E.A. Bankaitis V.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). The Sec14p lipid binding domain is employed in a binding strategy for a diverse set of hydrophobic ligands (e.g. phospholipids, phosphoinositides, sterol precursors, retinal, and tocopherols) and can be expressed either as a free standing domain or as one that is integrated into multidomain modules. The simple budding yeast S. cerevisiae expresses six Sec14ps, and this protein class is more highly expanded in higher eukaryotes (e.g. at least 31 members in Arabidopsis) (8Vincent P. Chua M. Nogue F. Fairbrother A. Mekheel H. Xu Y. Allen N. Bibikova T.N. Gilroy S. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).The available Sec14p crystal structure for Sec14p identifies a novel fold that forms a hydrophobic pocket of sufficient volume to accommodate a single molecule of PtdIns or PtdCho (Fig. 1) (9Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The crystallizing unit is an apo-Sec14p loaded with two molecules of the detergent β-octyl glucoside. This particular structure is interpreted to describe a transitional Sec14p conformer that exists only transiently on the membrane surface as Sec14p undergoes phospholipid exchange. Although an understanding of how Sec14p functions at the molecular level is incomplete, the structural model spawned several hypotheses regarding intramolecular dynamic aspects of Sec14p function (9Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). First, an unusual surface helix (A10/T4) is identified as an attractive candidate for the structural element that “gates” the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1A). Second, a string motif that contains a series of four tightly wound 310 helices wraps up the Sec14p fold and is suggested to play an important role in regulating conformational changes that accompany the phospholipid exchange reaction (Fig. 1B).How Sec14p actually binds its phospholipid substrates remains an important and unanswered question. The available model provides considerable insight into how Sec14p might bind target membranes and individual phospholipids. With regard to substrate binding in the soluble Sec14p-phospholipid complex, bound phospholipid is predicted to orient with the acyl-chains packed into the hydrophobic interior of the pocket, whereas the phospholipid headgroup is disposed toward solvent. Although this hypothetical “headgroup-out” disposition of the bound phospholipid is both an attractive and an intuitive one, solution of a phospholipid-bound Sec14p structure is required to resolve this question, and no such information is yet available. Resolution of this issue is important, since it speaks to one of several potential mechanisms for how Sec14p (and Sec14p-like proteins) may regulate phospholipid metabolism. The uncertainty surrounding whether the intuitive orientation of phospholipid within the Sec14p pocket is indeed the correct one is emphasized by structural analyses of phospholipid-bound metazoan PITPs. These proteins bind phospholipid substrates in the reverse “headgroup-in” orientation (10Yoder M.D. Thomas L.M. Tremblay J.M. Oliver R.L. Yarbrough L.R. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. J. Biol.

We demonstrate that motion of PtdCho within the Sec14p binding pocket, while anisotropic and highly restricted, nonetheless exhibits a progressive increase in the mobility of the sn-2 acyl chain as distance from the headgroup/backbone region increases. Moreover, we show that the C5 region of the sn-2 acyl chain is highly shielded from solvent, whereas the distal region of the acyl chain is less so. Finally, we describe evidence for a polar protic microenvironment at position C5 of the sn-2 acyl chain that becomes increasingly aprotic as one moves away from the headgroup/backbone region of the bound phospholipid and returns to a more polar/protic environment at the distal end of the chain. These collective data are most consistent with a headgroup-out orientation of Sec14p-bound PtdCho and further indicate that the Sec14p phospholipid binding pocket provides a hydrophobic matching to accommodate the PtdCho molecule. We propose this polarity gradient is a primary thermodynamic factor that drives the ability of Sec14p to abstract a phospholipid from a membrane bilayer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Sec14p—Recombinant His6-Sec14p was purified from Escherichia coli essentially as previously described (9Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sec14p expression in E. coli strain KK2186 (Δ(lac-pro) supE thi strA sbcB-15 endA/F′(traD36 lacIQ lacZΔ15)) was driven by a derivative of the pQE31 plasmid (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and induced with isopropyl β-thiogalactoside (1 mm final concentration). Bacterial cultures were incubated for an additional 5 h with shaking at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme was added, and the suspension was incubated at 25 °C for an additional 10 min. Cells were disrupted by collision with 0.1-mm diameter glass beads in a cooled bead beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Cell lysates were subsequently clarified by differential centrifugation series at 1000 × g, 14,000 × g, and 100,000 × g, respectively. The clarified supernatant was applied to Talon™ Sepharose resin (Clontech), the resin was washed extensively with lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (0–200 mm) reconstituted in lysis buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against lysis buffer at 4 °C, and a second round of affinity purification and dialysis was subsequently performed. Protein purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of gels. Sec14p purity exceeded 95%, and purified protein exhibited robust PtdIns and PtdCho transfer activity.Preparation of EPR Samples—Nitroxide-labeled PtdCho species, 1-acyl-2-(n-(4,4-dimethyloxazolidine-N-oxyl)stearoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (n-doxyl-PtdCho), with the spin label positioned at n = 5, 7, 10, 12, and 16, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) (Fig. 2) as chloroform solutions. Organic solvents for calibrating high field EPR spectra for polarity and hydrogen-bonding effects included methanol, isopropyl alcohol, and hexane (Sigma). All solvents were analytical grade or higher and were used as received. Nickel(II) ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (NiEDDA) was synthesized as described (12Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). NiEDDA 200 mm stock solution was prepared in lysis buffer. 5-Doxyl-stearic acid (5-doxyl-SA) was purchased from TCI America (Portland, OR). Solutions of 5-doxyl-SA were typically prepared at concentrations ≤1 mm (i.e. below the critical micellar concentration). A solution of 5-doxyl-PtdCho in isopropyl alcohol was prepared at 0.1 mm concentration.FIGURE 2Structure of lipids and selected spin probes used in this work: PtdCho (a), PtdIns (b), 5-doxyl-PtdCho (c), 10-doxyl-PtdCho (d), 16-doxyl-PtdCho (e).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Preparation of n-Doxyl-PtdCho Dispersions and n-Doxyl-PtdCho Binding to Sec14p—Multilamellar aqueous dispersions of n-doxyl-PtdCho (20% by weight) were prepared as described (13Smirnova T.I. Smirnov A.I. Clarkson R.B. Belford R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5060-5072Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that spin-labeled lipids form bilayers when dispersed in water and exhibit similar phase behavior as biological lipids (14Chen S.C. Sturtevant J.M. Conklin K. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).To load Sec14p with n-doxyl-PtdCho, a 95 μm protein solution was mixed with a small molar excess of 100% spin-labeled multilamellar liposomes and incubated at room temperature for at least 2 h. As an assay for completeness of binding, we monitored binding of n-doxyl-PtdCho to Sec14p by X-band EPR until no further changes in the signal amplitude were observed. This assay relies on our observation that the EPR signal from an isolated spin label typically exhibits much narrower features and is easily distinguished from EPR spectra originating from n-doxylPtdCho liposomes (see “Results”).EPR Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis—Continuous wave (CW) X-band (9.0–9.5 GHz) EPR spectra were acquired with a Century Series Varian E-109 (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA) EPR spectrometer and digitized to 2000 data points/spectrum. Typical spectrometer settings were as follows: microwave power 2 milliwatts, field modulation frequency 100 kHz, and amplitude less than 1 G to avoid overmodulation. Specific ranges of magnetic field scans are indicated in the figures. Variable temperature EPR spectra were obtained using a nitrogen flow system connected to a Varian variable temperature controller. Sample temperature was measured with a VWR International (West Chester, PA) digital thermometer equipped with a stainless steel microprobe positioned in the cavity just above the sample. The VWR thermometer has a resolution of 0.001 °C and accuracy of ±0.05 °C. In all experiments, temperature was controlled better than ±0.5 °C.High field (HF) EPR spectra were acquired with a 130 GHz EPR spectrometer constructed and installed in the Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Field-swept echo-detected EPR spectra from spin-labeled samples were recorded at a temperature of 25 K using a two-pulse sequence. Typically, π /2 pulses of 50 ns in length were separated by a 350-ns delay, and the repetition rate was set to 500 Hz. For detecting low temperature rigid limit HF EPR spectra, we employed an echo-detected field-swept mode over the conventional continuous wave scheme for several reasons. First, the pulse detection eliminates signals originating from spin-labeled n-doxyl-PtdCho bilayers (i.e. phospholipids aggregated in a solution and not bound to Sec14p), because spins of the former molecules have much shorter phase memory T2 relaxation time due to strong magnetic interactions with the neighboring spins. Second, low temperature echo-detected HF EPR spectra do not have microwave phase distortions, allowing for more accurate line shape and g-factor analysis.For HF EPR, spin-labeled samples were drawn by capillary action into clear fused quartz tubes (inner diameter = 0.5 mm, outer diameter = 0.6 mm; VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ), sealed with a Critoseal clay (purchased from Fisher), and loaded into precooled cryostat at 25 K. Temperature of the EPR resonator and the sample was controlled by an ITC-4 temperature controller coupled to a flow cryostat (all supplied by Oxford Instruments, Concord, MA).Saturation recovery (SR) pulsed EPR experiments were conducted at 4 °C with a Bruker Biospin (Billerica, MA) X-band ElexSys 680 EPR spectrometer installed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (Tallahassee, FL). The SR measurements were performed using a 0.16-μs pump pulse and an amplifier output of 10 watts. Shot repetition time was 204 μs. Each SR curve was digitized to 1024 points. Data were acquired at the field position corresponding to the maximum EPR intensity (mI = 0 hydrogen hyperfine transition). Reference signal was acquired at the 50-G shift in the lower field. Data on NiEDDA accessibility to 5-doxyl-SA in a water/ethanol mixture were provided by Dr. J. Widomska (National Biomedical EPR Center, Milwaukee, WI).Lorentzian line broadening induced by NiEDDA was measured from CW X-band spectra using a one-parameter model (13Smirnova T.I. Smirnov A.I. Clarkson R.B. Belford R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5060-5072Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Smirnov A.I. Belford R.L. J. Magn. Reson.

In brief, first derivative EPR spectra measured in the presence of NiEDDA were least squares fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to a convolution of the corresponding experimental spectra recorded in the absence of paramagnetic relaxant and a Lorentzian broadening function. A modification of this approach for elucidating very small broadening effects has been described (17Smirnova T.I. Smirnov A.I. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 7212-7215Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar).RESULTSBinding of n-Doxyl-PtdCho to Sec14p—Binding of n-doxyl-PtdCho to Sec14p was monitored from changes in EPR spectra collected at room temperature. Fig. 3A (dots) shows a typical room temperature EPR signal obtained for 5-doxyl-PtdCho liposomes. For all n-doxyl-PtdCho species studied, the signal appeared as a single line of ∼25–27 G peak-to-peak width. Such a spectrum is characteristic of strong dipole-dipole and exchange interactions.FIGURE 3Room temperature X-band CW EPR spectra from 5-doxyl-PtdCho. A, in a form of multilamellar lipid dispersion (field modulation amplitude 8G) (B, solid line) after mixing with 95 μm Sec14p in ∼1:1 molar ratio. Least squares fit of the spectrum (A) to a Lorentzian function is shown as a dashed line (B). C, signal from 5-doxyl-PtdCho incorporated into the Sec14p binding pocket obtained by the spectral subtraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The single line EPR spectrum of spin-labeled lipids is well modeled by a Lorentzian function as illustrated for 5-doxyl-PtdCho in Fig. 3A; least squares simulations are shown as a solid line that very closely follows the experimental spectrum. The spectrum in Fig. 3A also demonstrates that the EPR signals from nonaggregated n-doxyl-PtdCho (i.e. n-doxyl-PtdCho resident in the aqueous buffer) are too weak to be detected under these conditions. This is expected, because the critical micelle concentration for n-doxyl-PtdCho is in the nanomolar range, resulting in a concentration of n-doxyl-PtdCho monomers in aqueous buffer that is well below the typical sensitivity of X-band EPR spectrometers.When Sec14p loads with a phospholipid from a membrane bilayer, the bound phospholipid becomes encapsulated in the protein cavity. Such a loading event effectively eliminates spin-spin interactions for the bound n-doxyl-PtdCho and produces significant line shape changes. Fig. 3B (solid line) depicts a typical EPR spectrum observed in experiments where Sec14p was mixed with multilamellar 5-doxyl-PtdCho bilayers and allowed to equilibrate for ∼2 h. A sharp decrease in spin-spin interactions was observed for Sec14p-bound 5-doxyl-PtdCho as reported by the line narrowing. This line narrowing results in a significant (∼6-fold) increase in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the corresponding EPR spectrum as compared with the initial signal from liposomal 5-doxyl-PtdCho. The presence of the signal from aggregated lipids is particularly noticeable from broad wings that extend far away from characteristic features (i.e. outside the dashed lines in Fig. 3B). Thus, the signal from Sec14p-bound 5-doxyl-PtdCho dominates the first derivative EPR spectrum observed in CW experiments, thereby simplifying initial analyses of local spin label dynamics. In time domain experiments, such as saturation recovery and echo-detected field-swept HF EPR, little if any contribution from the liposomal 5-doxyl-PtdCho is recorded, because the latter spin species have much shorter electronic relaxation times. However, for accurate line shape least squares simulation analyses, the contribution from the remaining liposomal 5-doxyl-PtdCho (dashed line) is subtracted from the experimental spectrum (Fig. 3B, solid line), yielding the Sec14p-bound 5-doxyl-PtdCho spectrum (Fig. 3C). In this particular experiment, the fraction of liposomal 5-doxyl-PtdCho molecules was determined to be ∼30%.Local Dynamics of n-Doxyl-PtdCho Incorporated into the Sec14p Phospholipid Binding Pocket—The data described above demonstrate that Sec14p loads with n-doxyl-PtdCho and that the bound n-doxyl-PtdCho becomes sequestered within the protein cavity. Since CW EPR spectra of spin-labeled phospholipids are sensitive to rotational motion of the nitroxide moiety, this method was used to investigate the flexibility of the n-doxyl-PtdCho acyl chain within the Sec14p lipid binding pocket. A series of room temperature (22 °C) CW X-band spectra from n-doxyl-PtdCho (where n = 5, 7, 10, 12, and 16) bound to Sec14p are shown in Fig. 4. For all label positions analyzed, the contribution of liposomal n-doxyl-PtdCho registered only as a broad line most readily observed at the wings. This component was subtracted from experimental spectra and will not be discussed further. Instead, we focus on the dominant EPR spectrum that originates from n-doxyl-PtdCho sequestered within the Sec14p cavity.FIGURE 4Room temperature X-band CW EPR spectra from Sec14p-bound n-doxyl-PtdCho. Spectra are corrected for the background signal as illustrated in Fig. 2 and are intensity-normalized using double integration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All EPR spectra depicted in Fig. 4 report an intermediate to slow motional regime and anisotropic rotation of the nitroxide spin label. The absence of any abnormal broadening and/or substantial drop in intensity of these spectra indicative of spin-spin interactions is consistent with a Sec14p molecule loading with a single n-doxyl-PtdCho molecule. A particularly informative parameter of such spectra is the peak-to-peak width ΔHp-p (mI = 0) of the central nitrogen hyperfine component (where mI = 0 is the nitrogen spin quantum number). When tumbling of a spin label falls into an intermediate to slow motional regime, this width is approximately proportional to the rotational correlation time τc. In studies of local dynamics of protein side chains, an inverse of this width ΔHp−p−1 (mI=0) is typically reported as a “mobility” parameter (18Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This parameter reliably estimates mobility of spin-labeled amino acid side chains in proteins, and a smaller mobility parameter indicates slower rotation and a longer rotational correlation time τc. Other useful parameters for characterizing rotational tumbling of a nitroxide are the effective hyperfine splitting constants Aout and Ain as defined in Fig. 4. A plot of the mobility parameter,ΔHp−p−1 (mI=0), as well as Aout and Ain, all indicate a progressive increase in spin label local mobility as the nitroxide label is moved toward the headgroup-distal end of the sn-2 acyl chain from position C5 to C12 (Fig. 5). At position C16, however, motion of the label becomes more restricted, very much like at position C5. We used the definition of McConnell and Hubbell to calculate the effective order parameter (Seff) to describe the anisotropy of spin label motion (19McConnell H.M. Hubbell W.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 20Griffith O.H. Jost P.C. Berliner L.J. Spin Labeling: Theory and Applications.

Lipids. 2003; 124: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the values of ΔA and A0 vary by a few percent with the position of the label along the sn-2 acyl chain of Sec14p-bound n-doxyl-PtdCho, we found it convenient to fix A0 and ΔA for all n-doxyl-PtdCho isomers to those values observed for 5-doxyl-PtdCho in isopropyl alcohol. In doing so, we introduced less than 3% error into the Seff calculations. Effective order parameters Seff calculated from room temperature X-band EPR spectra of Sec14p-bound n-doxyl-PtdCho are reported in Fig. 6 and are compared with Seff values measured for n-doxyl-PtdCho in either a fluid dimyristoyl-PtdCho membrane bilayer environment (T = 27 °C) or in a crystalline bilayer environment (T = 5 °C).FIGURE 5Empirical motional characteristics of nitroxide spin label as determined from room temperature T = 22 °C X-band CW EPR spectra of n-doxyl-PtdCho bound to Sec14p as function of the label position along the sn-2 acyl chain.

Here we demonstrate that PrP-(23–98), an N-terminal portion of PrP, is converted to aggregates upon incubation with NADPH and copper ions. Other pyridine nucleotides possessing a phosphate group on the adenine-linked ribose moiety (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 3′-phosphate, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and NADP) were also effective in promoting aggregation, but NADH and NAD had no effect. The aggregation was attenuated by the metal chelator EDTA or by modification of histidyl residues with diethyl pyrocarbonate. The aggregates are amyloid-like as judged by the binding of thioflavin T, a fluorescent probe for amyloid, but do not exhibit fibrillar structures according to electron micrography. Interestingly the aggregates were resistant to proteinase K digestion. Likewise NADPH and zinc ions caused aggregation of PrP-(23–98), but the resulting aggregates were susceptible to degradation by proteinase K. Upon incubation with NADPH and copper ions, the full-length molecule PrP-(23–231) also formed proteinase K-resistant amyloid-like aggregates.

Residues 60–91 consist of four repeats of an octapeptide sequence, PHGGGWGQ, and selectively bind copper ions over other divalent metal ions (1Daggett V. Curr. Opin.

In fact, affinity-purified PrP preparations from mouse and human brain were shown to bind three and seven copper atoms per molecule, respectively (7Brown D.R. Clive C. Haswell S.J. J.

PrP purified from cultured cells was found to contain one to four copper atoms depending on the availability of copper in the culture medium (7Brown D.R. Clive C. Haswell S.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In light of these results, it is probable that native PrP in vivo exists in the copper-bound form.Among the substances able to bind PrP, copper ions can modulate the pathogenesis of prion disease (9Pattison I.H.

Copper also promotes the conversion in vitro of aged recombinant mouse PrP, in which Asn-187 is altered to an Asp residue (15Qin K. Yang D.S. Yang Y. Chishti M.A. Meng L.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Yip C.M.

Copper may also help recover the infectivity and PK resistance of partially denatured PrPSc (16McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol.

These results highlight the multi-faceted nature of copper in the pathogenesis of prion disease.Based on the current understanding of prion formation, prion initiation (i.e. de novo generation of PrPSc from cellular PrP isoform (PrPC) without template) and prion propagation (i.e. conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in the presence of PrPSc template) are two distinct processes. Prion propagation likely does not require the N-terminal domain because its removal from PrPSc by limited protease digestion did not significantly alter infectivity titers (17McKinley M.P.

However, the N-terminal domain is likely important for efficient formation of protease-resistant PrP as demonstrated by a cell-free experiment in which de novo generation of protease-resistant PrP was examined by mixing a source of protease-sensitive PrP with protease-resistant PrP isolated from the tissue of an infected animal (22Lawson V.A.

Moreover several types of familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are characterized by increased numbers of the octarepeat in the N-terminal domain (13Goldfarb L.G. Brown P. McCombie W.R. Goldgaber D. Swergold G.D. Wills P.R. Cervenakova L. Baron H. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Gajdusek D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10926-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Campbell T.A. Palmer M.S. Will R.G. Gibb W.R. Luthert P.J. Collinge J. Neurology. 1996; 46: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a recent in vitro study indicates that the number of repeats in the sequence is critical in the self-association of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins with octarepeat sequences (24Leliveld S.R. Dame R.T. Wuite G.J. Stitz L. Korth C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3268-3275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Likewise insertion of octarepeats increases the rate of protease-resistant PrP formation (25Moore R.A. Herzog C. Errett J. Kocisko D.A. Arnold K.M. Hayes S.F. Priola S.A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain plays a key role in prion initiation. Contrary to these observations, other experiments suggest that in vitro prion initiation does not require the octarepeat region because when fibrils produced with a recombinant N-terminally truncated mouse prion protein (MoPrP-(89–230)) were inoculated intracerebrally into transgenic mice expressing the same protein the mice developed neurological dysfunction (26Legname G.

A better understanding of the role of the N-terminal region of PrP in prion initiation and propagation will require further studies.Although many studies describe the in vitro conversion of the C-terminal domain into amyloid fibrils (26Legname G.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2154-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), there have been few studies aimed at investigating the formation of amyloid fibrils with the N-terminal domain. Human PrP-(23–144) (HuPrP-(23–144)), containing the Y145Stop variant of Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, has recently been tested for amyloid formation (33Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8190-8196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). HuPrP-(23–144) spontaneously polymerized into highly ordered, PK-resistant fibrils. The truncated proteins HuPrP-(23–124), HuPrP-(23–126), HuPrP-(23–134), and HuPrP-(23–137) did not develop these characteristics (33Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that residues 138–141 are required for this conversion. In the present study we focused on the in vitro conversion of a recombinant PrP encompassing residues 23–98 (PrP-(23–98)). PrP-(23–98) contains four highly conserved copper-binding octarepeats (residues 60–91, PHGGGWGQ) and one partial repeat (residues 92–98, GGGTHNQ) that can bind another copper atom (6Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Antholine W.E. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6794-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We found that PrP-(23–98) spontaneously aggregated upon incubation with NADPH and copper or zinc ions and that the aggregates formed with NADPH and copper were resistant to proteolysis by PK. The same phenomena were observed with the full-length recombinant PrP encompassing residues 23–231 (PrP-(23–231)). The data presented here suggest that the aggregation observed in this study may be involved in prion initiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibody SAF 32 recognizing the octarepeat region of PrP and mouse monoclonal antibody SAF 84 recognizing epitope 160–170 of hamster PrP were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. Both antibodies react with human and mouse PrP.Preparation of PrP-(23–98) and PrP-(23–231)—The expression and purification of human recombinant PrP-(23–98) and mouse recombinant PrP-(23–231) were performed as described previously (35Shiraishi N. Nishikimi M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Shiraishi N. Inai Y. Bi W. Nishikimi M. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentration of PrP-(23–98) and PrP-(23–231) was determined by absorbance at 280 nm and using the molar extinction coefficients of 36,700 and 62,160 m–1 cm–1, respectively (37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar). Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-modified PrP-(23–98) was prepared as follows. Mixtures containing 50 mm Mes (pH 7.2), 50 μm PrP-(23–98), and 1 mm DEPC were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h followed by dialysis at 4 °C for ∼18 h against 5 mm Mes (pH 7.2). The number of modified histidyl residues was estimated at three based on a molar extinction coefficient at 240 nm of 3,200 m–1 cm–1 for the modified compound (38Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar).Aggregation Assay—Mixtures (120 μl) containing 50 mm Mes (pH 7.2) and 10 μm PrP-(23–98) or 2 μm PrP-(23–231) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 s in the presence of metal ions (1–40 μm). Pyridine nucleotide (10–500 μm) was then added to induce aggregation. Aggregation was followed by measuring turbidity at 550 nm. EDTA, l-histidine, or glycine was included in the initial mixtures when tested in this assay.To evaluate aggregate formation, samples were centrifuged at 18,800 × g for 10 min, and the concentration of protein in the resulting supernatants was determined using a Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). The pellets were washed three times with 50 mm Mes buffer (pH 7.2), suspended in 100 mm Mes buffer (pH 7.2) containing 6 m urea, and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The amount of copper and NADPH in the dissolved samples was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AA-6800, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and a spectrophotometer (with a molar extinction coefficient at 340 nm of 6,300 m–1 cm–1), respectively.Thioflavin T (ThT) Fluorescence Measurement—Mixtures (500 μl) containing 50 mm Mes (pH 7.2), 20 μm PrP-(23–98), 80 μm CuCl2 or 80 μm ZnSO4, and 500 μm NADPH with or without EDTA (500 μm) were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and then ThT (final concentration of 20 μm) was added. The fluorescence spectrum was recorded on a spectrofluorometer (RF-5300PC, Shimadzu) with excitation at 450 nm, excitation bandwidth of 5 nm, and emission bandwidth of 10 nm.Electron Microscopy—Negative staining was performed on collodion-coated 400-mesh copper grids. Samples were adsorbed for 30 s, stained with freshly filtered 3% uranyl acetate, dried, and then viewed in a JEOL JEM 1220 electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV at a standard magnification of 50,000.PK Resistance Assay—The degradation of preformed aggregates was monitored by measuring turbidity at 550 nm. In some experiments, mixtures (120 μl) containing 50 mm Mes (pH 7.2), 500 μm NADPH, 40 or 10 μm CuCl2, and 10 μm PrP-(23–98) or 2 μm PrP-(23–231) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and then one-half of each sample was incubated with PK (weight ratio of PK to PrP, 1:10) (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of EDTA (500 μm). Digestion was terminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) to a final concentration of 1 mm. Digested samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody (0.2 μg/ml antibody SAF 32 or 0.2 μg/ml antibody SAF 84) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h with shaking at room temperature. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (Chemicon International) (diluted 1:5,000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were developed using Western blot detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and the results were recorded with a charge-coupled device camera (Lumino Capture AF-650, ATTO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).The aggregates of PrP-(23–98) formed with NADPH and copper ions were dialyzed at 4 °C for ∼18 h against two changes of 5 mm Mes buffer (pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 18,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were suspended in a solution containing 2% Sarkosyl and 2% SDS and dissolved by sonication in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. After the sample was centrifuged at 18,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the amount of copper and NADPH in the resulting supernatant was measured. The supernatant was diluted with water, and the diluted sample (containing 0.06% Sarkosyl and 0.06% SDS) was digested with PK as described above. PK resistance was assessed by visualization of undigested protein by Western blot.RESULTSNADPH and Copper Ions Cause Aggregation of PrP-(23–98)—It has been reported that metal ions, such as copper, zinc, and manganese, modulate aggregation of a synthetic peptide comprising residues 106–126 of PrP (39Jobling M.F. Huang X. Stewart L.R. Barnham K.J. Curtain C. Volitakis I. Perugini M. White A.R. Cherny R.A. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Collins S.J. Bush A.I. Cappai R.

Chem. 2004; 385: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the N-terminal domain of the PrP protein has the potential to aggregate in the presence of metal ions, we tested the ability of copper ions to aggregate PrP-(23–98), an N-terminal region of PrP. When PrP-(23–98) (10 μm) was incubated with 40 μm CuCl2 in 50 mm Mes buffer (pH 7.2) at 25 °C for 5 min, only a slight increase in turbidity at 550 nm was observed (Fig. 1A, cross). Unexpectedly further addition of NADPH (500 μm) to the mixture caused marked aggregation (Fig. 1A, solid circle). Because incubation of PrP-(23–98) with NADPH caused only a slight increase in turbidity (Fig. 1A, open circle) and because the metal chelator EDTA prevented the aggregation (data not shown), it is clear that the combination of NADPH and copper ions is important for this process. The aggregates formed were large enough to be collected by centrifugation (Fig. 1B). Maximal aggregation was observed at pH 6.2 (Fig. 1C), indicating that the protonation to histidine residues inhibits the binding of copper. The aggregates formed in the presence of NADPH and copper ions were amyloid-like as judged by enhancement of ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1D). Electron microscopy of negatively stained aggregates revealed the presence of round particles (Fig. 1E). Together these results indicate that the combination of copper and NADPH converts PrP-(23–98) into an amyloid-like form of the protein.It has been reported that PrP interacts with metal ions other than copper (2Lehmann S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Whittal R.M. Ball H.L. Cohen F.E. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Baldwin M.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 4Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether zinc or manganese ions initiate aggregation under the same conditions as in Fig. 1. Zinc induced aggregation of PrP-(23–98), whereas manganese had no effect (Fig. 2A). Similarly the aggregates formed in the presence of NADPH and zinc ions also seemed amyloid-like as judged by binding of ThT (Fig. 2B), and round particles were observed by electron microscopy (data not shown). Dose-response experiments for copper and zinc ions showed that the rate of aggregation plateaued at a lower concentration of copper (5–10 μm) than for zinc (>40 μm) (Fig. 2C). To examine the structural requirement for NADPH, we tested other pyridine nucleotides for the aggregation of PrP-(23–98). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 3′-phospate (an analogue of NADPH with a phosphate group bound to 3′-OH of the adenine-linked ribose moiety) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) were equally effective; NADP was also effective but to a lesser extent. However, NADH and NAD had no effect (Fig. 2D). Other compounds containing a phosphate group, such as α-d-glucose 1-phosphate and AMP, did not induce aggregation (data not shown). Thus, the phosphate group on the adenine-linked ribose moiety is essential for the observed effect, and the reduced state of the pyridine moiety is not an absolute requirement.FIGURE 2Effect of various metal ions and pyridine nucleotides on the aggregation of PrP-(23–98). A, effect of different metals. The reaction conditions were the same as in Fig. 1A except different metal ions were used at concentrations of 40 μm. Nil indicates the incubation of PrP-(23–98) only.

When NADPH was added at 50 μm, the precipitated aggregates contained 0.93 ± 0.03 mol of NADPH and 1.93 ± 0.05 mol of copper/mol of protein. Even when the NADPH concentration was increased 10-fold, the aggregates contained the same amount of NADPH and copper (0.94 ± 0.02 mol of NADPH and 1.99 ± 0.02 mol of copper/mol of protein). It is clear that NADPH and copper strongly bind to PrP-(23–98) in the aggregates.Participation of Histidine Residues of PrP-(23–98) in Aggregation—To investigate the participation of histidine residues of PrP-(23–98) in the binding of copper, we examined the effect of chemical modification of the protein with DEPC, which covalently binds to the histidine residues in the octarepeat region, rendering the binding of metal ions inefficient (42Qin K. Yang Y. Mastrangelo P. Westaway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1981-1990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The aggregation of PrP-(23–98) induced by NADPH and copper or zinc ions was attenuated by treatment with DEPC (Fig. 3A). Furthermore l-histidine markedly inhibited the aggregation of PrP-(23–98) (Fig. 3B) as was the case for copper binding to the octarepeat region (43Garnett A.P. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The effect of glycine was negligible. These results indicate that the octarepeat region participates in binding of copper to PrP-(23–98).FIGURE 3The role of histidine residues of PrP-(23–98) in aggregation.

The still life on the cover of this week's issue of Science is not a photograph but a computer-generated rendering of five famous mathematical surfaces. The result, created by Richard Palais of the University of California, Irvine, and graphic artist Luc Benard, is a virtuoso display of modern computer-graphics technology. (Notice how the glassy surfaces are reflected in one another and in the glass-covered, wood-grained tabletop.)

The image is the first-place winner in the illustration category of the 2006 Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge. Indeed, it is a prime example of why Science and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have jointly sponsored the visualization challenge every year since 2003. It is beautiful. It can capture the imagination of nonscientists. But it also represents a powerful new tool for research. As Benard and Palais wrote in their application, “Mathematicians have always needed to ‘see’ the complex concepts they work with in order to reason with them effectively. In the past, they conjured up mental images as best they could, but the wonders of computer graphics provide them with far more detailed pictures to think with.” Or, as Felice Frankel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the challenge judges, put it, “The science community needs to discuss the enormous contribution good visual translations can bring to both communication and advancing the thinking behind the science. Critically thinking about what makes an honest and successful representation and raising our standards can only be beneficial for the science community as a whole.”

The visualization challenge is intended to showcase and encourage this kind of work. This year, we invited submissions in five categories: photography, illustration, informational graphics, noninteractive multimedia, and interactive multimedia. Entries were screened by a committee from NSF and Science . Then an independent panel of experts in scientific visualization reviewed the finalists and selected the best, which appear in these pages.

We urge you and your colleagues to contribute to the next competition, details of which will be available at [www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/scivis/index.jsp][2], and to join us in congratulating the winners and all the other entrants.

Susan Mason of NSF organized this year's challenge, Rhitu Chatterjee of Science 's news staff wrote the text accompanying the images in the following pages, and Science 's online editors Stewart Wills and Tara Marathe put together a special Web presentation at [www.sciencemag.org/sciext/vis2006][3].
