https://openalex.org/W2100979625,"Seafloor spreading centres show a regular along-axis segmentation thought to be produced by a segmented magma supply in the passively upwelling mantle. On the other hand, continental rifts are segmented by large offset normal faults, and many lack magmatism. It is unclear how, when and where the ubiquitous segmented melt zones are emplaced during the continental rupture process. Between 14 September and 4 October 2005, 163 earthquakes (magnitudes greater than 3.9) and a volcanic eruption occurred within the approximately 60-km-long Dabbahu magmatic segment of the Afar rift, a nascent seafloor spreading centre in stretched continental lithosphere. Here we present a three-dimensional deformation field for the Dabbahu rifting episode derived from satellite radar data, which shows that the entire segment ruptured, making it the largest to have occurred on land in the era of satellite geodesy. Simple elastic modelling shows that the magmatic segment opened by up to 8 m, yet seismic rupture can account for only 8 per cent of the observed deformation. Magma was injected along a dyke between depths of 2 and 9 km, corresponding to a total intrusion volume of approximately 2.5 km3. Much of the magma appears to have originated from shallow chambers beneath Dabbahu and Gabho volcanoes at the northern end of the segment, where an explosive fissural eruption occurred on 26 September 2005. Although comparable in magnitude to the ten year (1975-84) Krafla events in Iceland, seismic data suggest that most of the Dabbahu dyke intrusion occurred in less than a week. Thus, magma intrusion via dyking, rather than segmented normal faulting, maintains and probably initiated the along-axis segmentation along this sector of the Nubia-Arabia plate boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1976505472,"The transcription factor KLF2 has long been thought to play a critical role in controlling survival and quiescence of mature T cells, since KLF2-deficient T cells develop in the thymus but fail to populate peripheral lymph organs. A new study offers an alternative explanation for this phenotype, consistent with an entirely different function for KLF2 as a regulator of thymocyte and T-cell migration. Proteins of the KLF (Krüppel-like transcription factor) family are involved in many aspects of vertebrate development and are implicated in a number of disease states. This newly discovered role for KLF2 is similar to some other KLFs that are essential for terminal differentiation of various cell types. The transcription factor KLF2 has been thought to control survival of T lymphocytes, as KLF2-deficient T cells develop in the thymus, but fail to populate the peripheral lymphoid organs. But this report shows that the phenotype results from an unexpected role of KLF2 in regulating the expression of lymphocyte trafficking molecules. Mammalian Kruppel-like transcription factors are implicated in regulating terminal differentiation of several tissue types1,2,3. Deficiency in Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 2 (also known as LKLF) leads to a massive loss of the peripheral T-cell pool4, suggesting KLF2 regulates T-cell quiescence and survival4,5,6,7. Here we show, however, that KLF2 is essential for T-cell trafficking. KLF2-deficient (Klf2-/-) thymocytes show impaired expression of several receptors required for thymocyte emigration and peripheral trafficking, including the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor S1P1, CD62L and β7 integrin. Furthermore, KLF2 both binds and transactivates the promoter for S1P1—a receptor that is critical for thymocyte egress and recirculation through peripheral lymphoid organs. Our findings suggest that KLF2 serves to license mature T cells for trafficking from the thymus and recirculation through secondary lymphoid tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2087111038,"Brassinosteroids, the steroid hormones of plants, are perceived at the plasma membrane by a leucine-rich repeat receptor serine/threonine kinase called BRI1. We report a BRI1-interacting protein, BKI1, which is a negative regulator of brassinosteroid signaling. Brassinosteroids cause the rapid dissociation of BKI1–yellow fluorescent protein from the plasma membrane in a process that is dependent on BRI1-kinase. BKI1 is a substrate of BRI1 kinase and limits the interaction of BRI1 with its proposed coreceptor, BAK1, suggesting that BKI1 prevents the activation of BRI1."
https://openalex.org/W1972432707,"Activation of NF-κB and autophagy are two processes involved in the regulation of cell death, but the possible cross-talk between these two signaling pathways is largely unknown. Here, we show that NF-κB activation mediates repression of autophagy in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-treated Ewing sarcoma cells. This repression is associated with an NF-κB-dependent activation of the autophagy inhibitor mTOR. In contrast, in cells lacking NF-κB activation, TNFα treatment up-regulates the expression of the autophagy-promoting protein Beclin 1 and subsequently induces the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. Both of these responses are dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and can be mimicked in NF-κB-competent cells by the addition of H2O2. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of beclin 1 and atg7 expression, two autophagy-related genes, reduced TNFα- and reactive oxygen species-induced apoptosis in cells lacking NF-κB activation and in NF-κB-competent cells, respectively. These findings demonstrate that autophagy may amplify apoptosis when associated with a death signaling pathway. They are also evidence that inhibition of autophagy is a novel mechanism of the antiapoptotic function of NF-κB activation. We suggest that stimulation of autophagy may be a potential way bypassing the resistance of cancer cells to anti-cancer agents that activate NF-κB.

Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Typically, in unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to inhibitory κB proteins (IκB). In response to a variety of stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines, oncogenes, and viruses, the proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB allows the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and its binding to the promoter region of target genes involved in the control of different cellular responses, including apoptosis (6Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar, 7Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 8Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In many cancer cells, the constitutive activation of NF-κB activity lowers cell sensitivity to apoptosis and consequently favors neoplastic cell survival (9Bours V. Dejardin E. Goujon-Letawe F. Merville M.P. Castronovo V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Several anti-tumor drugs appear to enhance NF-κB activity, which renders them less effective (10Orlowski R.Z. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has emerged that autophagy is another mechanism involved in the control of death in cancer cells (11Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar, 12Alva A.S. Gultekin S.H. Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a vacuolar lysosomal degradation pathway for organelles and cytoplasmic macromolecules (13Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 14Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of autophagy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have led to the identification of a family of genes named ATG (autophagy-related gene) involved in the control of autophagy (15Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 16Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H.

Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The formation of autophagosomes requires two conjugation systems (Atg5–Atg12 and Atg8 lipidation) (18Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (19Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). This kinase interacts with the tumor suppressor protein Beclin 1, the mammalian orthologue of the yeast Atg 6 (20Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). The relation between autophagy and cell death is complex, since autophagy can be involved in either cell death or survival depending on the cellular context (12Alva A.S. Gultekin S.H. Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Kroemer G. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev.

The survival function of autophagy has been demonstrated under different physiological situations, such as interruption of maternal nutrient supply in newborn mice (23Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar) or cell deprivation of growth factors and of nutrients (24Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T.

Autophagy is also implicated in the cell death process during development (26Martin D.N. Baehrecke E.H. Development. 2004; 131: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and in response to several cytotoxic stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 27Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). In some situations, both apoptosis and autophagy can occur concomitantly in the same cells, suggesting the involvement of common regulatory mechanisms (28Jaattela M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2746-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In fact, several members of both extrinsic (29Mills K.R. Reginato M. Debnath J. Queenan B. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Brenner D.A. Herman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) apoptotic pathways can promote activation of autophagy. In particular, death receptor ligands, such as TNFα (30Jia L. Dourmashkin R.R. Allen P.D. Gray A.B. Newland A.C. Kelsey S.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and Trail (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) (29Mills K.R. Reginato M. Debnath J. Queenan B. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, some participants in apoptosis signaling, such as the receptor-interacting proteins RIP (32Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) and FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) (33Pyo J.O. Jang M.H. Kwon Y.K. Lee H.J. Jun J.I. Woo H.N. Cho D.H. Choi B.

Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), have recently been implicated in autophagy. The precise network that controls the cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy remains to be elucidated. In particular, it has not yet been investigated whether NF-κB, one of the major regulators of apoptosis, also controls autophagy. Here, we examined whether NF-κB activation modulates the autophagic capacity of cells. We compared the autophagic capacity of NF-κB competent cells with that of cells carrying a repressor of NF-κB activation after treatment with TNFα. We found that whereas TNFα induced autophagy in cells lacking NF-κB activity, it did not activate this process in NF-κB-competent cells. We also demonstrate that in the absence of NF-κB activation, TNFα-induced autophagy is dependent on ROS production and participates in the TNFα-induced apoptotic signaling pathway. Reagents—Hoechst 33258 dye, benzon nuclease, 3-methyladenine, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), hydrogen peroxide, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and N-butyl-α-phenyl-nitrone (BNP) were from Sigma. l-[14C]valine (5.47 GBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Z-VAD-fmk and recombinant human TNFα (TNFα was used in cells at a concentration of 2000 units/ml) were from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against the following proteins were used: Atg5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Atg 7 (kindly provided by Dr. W. A. Dunn, Jr., University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL), Beclin 1 and actin (BD Biosciences), phospho-4-EBP1, 4-EBP1, phospho-p70 S6 kinase, p70 S6 kinase, Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) LC3 (kindly provided by Dr. Eiki Kominami (Jutendo University, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori, National Institute of Genetics (Mishima, Japan)), and PARP (Alexis, Illkirch, France). Cells—EW7 cells transfected with an empty pcDNA vector (EW7PC cells) or with the IκBα (A32/36)-encoding vector (EW7MAD cells) were previously described (34Javelaud D. Wietzerbin J. Delattre O. Besancon F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The generation of promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) expressing either the Migr-eGFP vector (NB4/GFP cells) or the IκBα (A32/36)-encoding Migr-eGFP (NB4/GFP-MAD) was previously described (35Mathieu J. Giraudier S. Lanotte M. Besancon F. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7145-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of these cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum. The human breast cancer MCF7 cell line (from ATCC) were grown at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum. Monodansylcadaverine Staining—MDC was used to evaluate the abundance of autophagic vacuoles in cells as previously reported (36Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). A 10 mm stock solution of MDC was prepared in Me2SO. Following treatment, cells were stained with MDC at a final concentration of 10 μm, for 10 min at 37 °C, and then collected and fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Cells were washed and then examined by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioplan microscope). For each condition, the percentage of cells with characteristic MDC staining dots indicative of autophagy was assessed. Analysis of Degradation of Long Lived Proteins—Ewing sarcoma-derived cell lines were incubated with 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]l-valine in complete medium (RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum) for 24 h at 37 °C (37Pattingre S. Petiot A. Codogno P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At the end of the radiolabeling period, unincorporated radioisotopes were removed by washing the cells three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in complete medium supplemented with 10 mm unlabeled valine for 1 h (prechase period). After this time, the medium was replaced by either nutrient-free medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin) or complete medium plus 10 mm unlabeled valine in the presence and absence of 10 mm 3-MA and TNFα for a 4–8-h incubation (chase period). Radiolabeled proteins from the medium and adherent cells were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid at the final concentration of 10% (v/v), separated from soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 20 min, and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2 n NaOH. The rate of protein degradation was calculated by determining the ratio of radioactivity in acid-soluble proteins obtained from cells and medium to radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins obtained from cells and medium. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 1.6% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sörensen phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), washed, and fixed again in aqueous 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in Epon, and processed for electron microscopy with a Zeiss EM 902 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV, in ultrathin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Detection of Apoptosis—Apoptotic cell death was determined by quantification of apoptotic nuclei (i.e. fragmentation and condensation of nuclei) following Hoechst 33258 staining. A total of 500 nuclei were counted for each sample. Apoptosis was also evaluated by determination of caspase 3 activity, which was assessed by the appearance of PARP1 cleaved product revealed by Western blotting analysis. DNA fragmentation was quantified using a cell death detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Applied Science), which was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of RNA and Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). First-strand cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA using random primers and Superscript™III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The sequences of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers, specific to the chosen candidate and housekeeping genes, were designed using Primer3 software (available on the World Wide Web at frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi). The primers are for Beclin 1 (forward, 5′-GGCTGAGAGACTGGATCAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGCGTCTGGGCATAACG-3′; GenBank™ NM003766; nucleotides 787–913) and β-actin (forward, 5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3′; GenBank™ BC016045; nucleotides 555–845). Real time quantitative PCR was performed in a LightCycler® (Roche Applied Science) thermal cycler. An 80-fold dilution of each cDNA was amplified in a 10-μl volume, using the Fast Start DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I master mix (Roche Applied Science), with 500 nm final concentrations of each primer. The amplification specificity was checked by melting curve analysis and gel-agarose electrophoresis of PCR products. Threshold cycle Ct, which correlates inversely with the target mRNA levels, was calculated using the second derivative maximum algorithm provided by the Light-Cycler software. For each cDNA, the Beclin 1 mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. Results are expressed as ratio of normalized Beclin 1 mRNA level of treated cells to those of untreated cells. Transfection and RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against beclin 1, atg7, and p65 and control siRNA were synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). The siRNA sequences against beclin-1, atg7, and p65 were previously described in Refs. 25Boya P. Gonzalez-Polo R.A. Casares N. Perfettini J.L. Dessen P. Larochette N. Metivier D. Meley D. Souquere S.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, respectively. Cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with siRNA at 200 nm final concentration by using oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were then incubated for 8 h at 37°C prior to the addition of 5% fetal calf serum and then left for another 48–92 h. At the end of these treatments, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting analysis or apoptosis assays. Transient transfections with GFP-LC3 plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) were carried out by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Since the level of transfection in Ewing sarcoma cells only reaches 15% of the total amount of cells, 2 × 106 cells were transfected for each assay and then subjected to fluorescence microscopy analysis. For each condition, at least 150 GFP-LC3-transfected cells (GFP-expressing cells) were observed, and the percentage of transfected cells presenting punctate GFP-LC3 staining, which is indicative of autophagy structures, was determined. Western Blot Analysis—Cellular extracts were prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, treated with benzon nuclease for 5 min at room temperature, and boiled for 3 min. Fractions (30 μg) of cellular extract proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris/glycine buffer system based on the method of Laemmli. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a Protean nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Protein loading was assessed by Ponceau staining of membranes. Blots were then incubated with primary antibodies using the manufacturer's protocol followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunostained proteins were visualized on x-ray film using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative autoradiograms are shown. Inhibition of NF-κB Activation Triggers Autophagy in TNFα-treated Ewing Sarcoma Cells—To evaluate the relation between NF-κB activation status and autophagy, we compared the autophagic activity after TNFα treatment in cells lacking NF-κB activity (EW7MAD1) and NF-κB-competent (EW7PC) Ewing sarcoma cells. The formation of autophagic vacuoles was first assessed by staining with MDC, which accumulates in acidic cell compartments enriched in lipids (36Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to a punctate staining pattern when autophagy is stimulated (36Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, both control cells (EW7PC) and cells expressing the repressor of NF-κB activation (EW7MAD1) presented diffuse staining in the absence of TNFα. TNFα treatment of cells lacking NF-κB activity resulted in the appearance of punctate structures 4 h after treatment. In addition, the number and size of these punctate structures were significantly increased following 8 h of TNFα treatment, suggesting that TNFα induces the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in these cells. Conversely, the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles by TNFα is impaired in NF-κB-competent cells (EW7PC), as revealed by the paucity of punctate structures observed in these cells. To verify that EW7PC cells are not defective in stimulation of autophagic activity, MDC staining was also performed following incubation of these cells in nutrient-free medium, a condition known to stimulate autophagy (14Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, EW7PC cells as well as EW7MAD1 cells were both able to induce autophagy (Fig. 1A). The redistribution of LC3 from diffuse cytosolic staining to punctate staining is a reliable marker of autophagosome formation (40Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). This can be examined either by transfection of cells using GFP-LC3 expression plasmids, which result in the formation of punctate fluorescence structures in conditions of autophagy stimulation, or by examining the appearance of the phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form of LC3 (LC3-II), which is associated with autophagosomal membranes. After cell transfection with GFP-LC3, TNFα caused the appearance of a punctate fluorescence pattern in EW7MAD1 but not in EW7PC cells (Fig. 1B), confirming again that TNFα induces an increase in autophagic structures only in the absence of NF-κB activation. Accordingly, TNFα induces a time-dependent accumulation of the LC3-II form in EW7MAD1 cells (Fig. 1C), whereas the level of LC3 II was not significantly modified in TNFα-treated EW7PC cells as compared with untreated cells. Interestingly, accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in TNFα-treated cells lacking NF-κB activity correlated with their susceptibility to apoptosis (Fig. 1B, right). Transmission electron microscopy experiments were also used to visualize autophagic vacuoles in cells (Fig. 1D, a–d). Quantitation of electron micrographs reveals an increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles after 4-h TNFα treatment of cells lacking NF-κB activity as compared with EW7PC cells. The presence of autophagosomes containing mitochondrion (Fig. 1D, e) and degraded cytoplasmic materials was confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1D, f). To verify that the increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles in TNFα-treated EW7MAD1 cells represents an activation of autophagic activity rather than inhibition of autophagic vacuoles/lysosome fusion, we further measured the degradation of long lived proteins in the presence and the absence of the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of 3-MA-sensitive proteolysis of long lived proteins was increased in a time-dependent manner after TNFα treatment in EW7MAD1 cells but not in EW7PC cells. Thus, the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles observed in TNFα-treated EW7MAD1 cells results from the activation of autophagy but not from the impairment of lysosomal delivery of LC3-positive vacuoles. It is worth nothing that 3-MA-sensitive proteolysis is increased in both cell lines incubated in nutrient-free medium, confirming again that both cell lines are competent for induction of autophagy. Overall, these findings demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB activity results in induction of autophagy in TNFα-treated EW7MAD1 cells. Such autophagic hallmarks were also observed in another clone of Ewing sarcoma cells expressing a repressor of NF-κB activation, EW7MAD2 cells after TNFα treatment (data not shown). The NF-κB-dependent Repression of Autophagy Occurs Also in NB4 and MCF7 Cells—To investigate whether the NF-κB-dependent regulation of autophagy observed in Ewing sarcoma may extend to other cell lines, we examined the autophagic capacity of two additional cell lines, the promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) and the human breast cells (MCF7), in the presence and absence NF-κB activation. Autophagy was evaluated by either MDC staining or detection of the accumulation of the LC3-II form by Western blotting. We first compared the autophagic activity in TNFα-treated NB4 cells (NB4/GFP) and in TNFα-treated NB4 cells expressing a repressor of NF-κB activation (NB4/GFP-MAD). As shown by MDC staining (Fig. 3A), TNFα induced a great accumulation of autophagic vacuoles only in cells lacking NF-κB activity (NB4/GFP-MAD) but not in NB4/GFP. Accordingly, TNFα treatment resulted in an increased level of the LC3-II form only in the absence of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3C). As in Ewing sarcoma cells, this accumulation of autophagic vacuoles observed in TNFα-treated NB4/GFP-MAD cells correlated with their susceptibility to apoptosis induced by TNFα (Fig. 3B). We also examined the autophagy capacity of MCF7 cells following siRNA knockdown of p65 protein, a member of the NF-κB complex. The complete reduction of p65 expression by using specific siRNA (39Zhou A. Scoggin S. Gaynor R.B. Williams N.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E, inset) sensitized MCF7 cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3E) and triggered accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in these cells as revealed by MDC staining (Fig. 3, D and E). Accordingly, TNFα induced an accumulation of LC3II form only in MCF7 treated with siRNA against p65 (Fig. 3F). Overall, these data indicate that inhibition of NF-κB in both NB4 and MCF7 cells induces autophagy in response to TNFα. ROS Are Involved in TNFα-induced Autophagy in Cells Lacking NF-κB Activity—We have previously shown that inhibition of NF-κB activity results in an increase in ROS production in TNFα-treated Ewing sarcoma cells (41Djavaheri-Mergny M. Javelaud D. Wietzerbin J. Besancon F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore questioned whether TNFα-induced ROS production is involved in stimulation of autophagy. To this aim, we treated EW7MAD1 cells with BHA, a ROS scavenger, prior to the addition of TNFα. Autophagy was evaluated by MDC or GFP-LC3 staining. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with this antioxidant reduced the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles induced by TNFα in EW7MAD1 cells. Similar results were found by using another ROS scavenger, BNP (Fig. 4A). This indicates that the production of ROS is required for the induction of autophagy in TNFα-treated EW7MAD1 cells. To confirm more precisely the role of ROS in induction of autophagy, we further examined the effect of the H2O2 addition on the modulation of autophagic activity in NF-κB-competent cells. As revealed by MDC staining, treatment with H2O2 induced an accumulation of acidic vacuoles in EW7PC cells. The appearance of autophagic vacuoles was inhibited in the presence of both BHA and BNP (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were found in GFP-LC3-transfected cells, showing that both TNFα and H2O2 promote an increase in the number of autoph"

Oxysterols bind LXRs with high affinity in vitro and are implicated as ligands for the receptor. We showed previously that accumulation of selected dietary sterols, in particular stigmasterol, is associated with activation of LXR in vivo. In the course of the defining of structural features of stigmasterol that confer LXR agonist activity, we determined that the presence of an unsaturated bond in the side chain of the sterol was necessary and sufficient for activity, with the C-24 unsaturated cholesterol precursor sterols desmosterol and zymosterol exerting the largest effects. Desmosterol failed to increase expression of the LXR target gene, ABCA1, in LXRα/β-deficient mouse fibroblasts, but was fully active in cells lacking cholesterol 24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxylase; thus, the effect of desmosterol was LXR-dependent and did not require conversion to a side chain oxysterol. Desmosterol bound to purified LXRα and LXRβ in vitro and supported the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator 1. Desmosterol also inhibited processing of the sterol response element-binding protein-2 and reduced expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. These observations are consistent with specific intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway regulating lipid homeostasis through both the LXR and sterol response element-binding protein pathways.

To function as a transcription factor, LXR must heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXRs) and then bind to LXR-response elements in target genes. The LXR-response elements consist of two direct hexanucleotide repeats separated by four nucleotides (DR4 element) (3Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The binding of LXR or RXR ligands results in a conformational change in the heterodimer and recruitment of nuclear receptor coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), resulting in the activation of gene transcription (16Wiebel F.F. Steffensen K.R. Treuter E. Feltkamp D. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1105-1118PubMed Google Scholar). Several compounds have been identified that are potent LXR agonists, including various oxysterols (17Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Position-specific monooxidation of the sterol side chain leads to high affinity binding and activation of LXR (19Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the LXRα:RXR heterodimer is consistent with an important role for the hydroxyl group at the 22, 24, or 27 positions in the cholesterol side chain in ligand binding (20Svensson S.

Accordingly it has been speculated that naturally occurring oxysterols, such as 20(S)-, 22(R)-, 24(S)-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol and 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol are endogenous LXR ligands (17Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

Previously, we showed that the accumulation of noncholesterol sterols increased the expression of the LXR target gene Abca1 in the adrenal glands of mice (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Studies in a cultured adrenal cell line (Y1-BS1) revealed that expression of ABCA1 and of an LXR-reporter construct was stimulated by the dietary plant sterol, stigmasterol, but not by sitosterol (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Stigmasterol has a ring structure identical to cholesterol, but contains a double bond between C-22 and C-23 and an ethyl group attached to C-24 in the side chain. Unlike the oxysterols that activate LXR, stigmasterol does not have a hydroxyl group in the side chain. Stigmasterol also interferes with the processing of sterol response element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a central regulatory factor in cholesterol metabolism (25Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is transported to the Golgi complex in association with the SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP). When cells are replete with cholesterol, the SCAP-SREBP complex associates with INSIG, an ER resident protein, resulting in retention of the complex. Reduction of cellular cholesterol is associated with a dissociation of SCAP and SREBP from INSIG, and the SCAP-SREBP complex is transported to the Golgi complex where SREBP is proteolytically cleaved to release the transcriptionally active form of the protein. To further characterize the mechanism by which stigmasterol activates LXR and suppresses the SREBP pathway, we investigated the relative ability of other structurally related sterols with modified side chains to activate LXR and suppress SREBP cleavage. Unsaturation within the side chain was associated with LXR activation and desmosterol, a late intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, was identified as a potent activator of LXR in cells. Materials—The ent-desmosterol was prepared as described previously (26Westover E.J. Covey D.F.

Lipid Chemistries—The levels of neutral sterols in cells were measured as follows: after 24 h of sterol treatment, cells were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then rinsed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and collected by lysis in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. Ten-microliter aliquots of cell lysates were used to assay protein concentration by BCA (Pierce) and neutral sterols by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. A total of 200 μl of cell lysate was added to 1 ml of 33% KOH (in ethanol) containing 10 μg of epicoprostanol as internal standard. After saponification at 70 °C for 1 h, 1 ml of water and 2 ml of petroleum ether were added to each sample. Samples were vigorously vortexed, centrifuged, and the organic phases were collected and dried under nitrogen. Sterols were derivatized using trimethylsilane (Pierce) and assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as described (36Wilund K.R. Yu L. Xu F. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H.

Gradient elution was performed on a Luna C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (1 × 150-mm, 3 μm particle size; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and a temperature of 25 °C. The gradient began at 85% B for 1 min, then increased from 85% B to 100% B over 5 min, maintained at 100% B for 10.5 min, and then re-equilibrated to the starting conditions for 5 min. The HPLC was coupled to a 4000 QTrap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an electrospray ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated in selected reaction monitoring mode with transitions optimized for each sterol of interest. The ionization voltage was 5500 V, curtain, nebulizing, and turbo gas was 15, 80, and 20 p.s.i., respectively; collision energy and declustering potential were optimized for each selected reaction monitoring transition and ranged from 10–40 to 50–120 V, respectively. The curtain, collision, and turbo gases were nitrogen when air was used for the nebulizing gas. Selected reaction monitoring transitions were optimized for each analyte and consisted of either the [M + NH4]+ or [M + H]+ adduct ion and loss of one or two waters, [M + H-H2O]+ or [M + H-2H2O]+, respectively. Ionization characteristics of sterols are source and platform dependent; parameters must be optimized for each instrument. Example product ion mass spectra are shown at lipidmaps.org. Quantitation was performed with stable-isotope dilution using d3–25-hydroxycholesterol (27,27,27-d3, cholest-5-en-3β,25-diol; 99%) as the surrogate and d7–7-oxocholesterol (25,26,26,26,27,27,27-d7, 7-oxo-cholest-5-en-3β-ol, 99%) as the internal standard (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). All solvents were HPLC grade or better. Promoter Reporter Assay for LXR Activity—Activation of LXR was measured using a reporter assay as described (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-7 cells were grown to 50–60% confluence in 6-well plates, transfected with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA including 0.2 μg of pCMX-Gal4-LXRα, 0.8 μg of pMH100X4-TK-luc, and 0.5 μg of pCMX-β-galactosidase using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), then incubated in medium A containing 10 μm compactin and 50 μm melavonate supplemented with 5% NCLPPS. Sterols (cholesterol, sitosterol, desmosterol, or lanosterol) were added in ethanol to a final concentration of 25 μm. The synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 was added in Me2SO to a final concentration of 1 μm. Cells were grown in the presence or absence of arachidonate (0, 100, or 200 μm) for 16 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity as described (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from wild type and Lxrα/β–/– MEF cells using RNA Stat-60 kit (Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) and real-time PCR was performed as described (38Liang G.

Immunoblot Analysis—Membrane and nuclear fractions were prepared from CHO-7, SRD-12B, SRD-13A, SRD-14 cells, and from wild type and Lxrα/β–/– MEF cells as described (40Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-C Extra Nitrocellulose filters (catalog number RPN303E, Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted using antibodies against ABCA1, LDLR, HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), SREBP-2, and calnexin. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), and visualized using the SuperSignal substrate system (Pierce). Competition Binding Assay—Purification of His6-hLXRα(LBD) and His6-hLXRβ(LBD), competition binding assay, and generation of Ki values were carried out exactly as described (19Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Briefly, in each well of a 96-well plate, 600 ng of His6-hLXRα(LBD) or 250 ng of His6-hLXRβ(LBD) were mixed with 0.2 mg of scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 μl of SPA buffer to immobilize the purified protein on SPA beads. [3H]24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol was added to a final concentration of 25 nm. Unlabeled 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, desmosterol, and cholesterol serially diluted in SPA buffer were then added at final concentrations ranging from 3 nm to 50 μm. The plates were shaken at room temperature for 3 h. The radioactivity that remained on the beads in each well was measured with a Packard Top-count scintillation counter. Values from wells void of competitor represented 100% binding. S.E. values are averages generated from triplicate wells of each competitor concentration. GST Pulldown Assays—cDNA encoding the nuclear boxes of human SRC-1 (amino acids 595–771) was cloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-SRC-1 fusion protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Promega) and affinity purified onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-Labeled human LXRα and human LXRβ proteins were generated by the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). GST pulldown assays were performed as previously described (41Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A total of 2 μg of GST-SRC-1 fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Bound GST protein was then incubated with labeled LXRα or LXRβ for 4 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 1 or 10 μm desmosterol or 1 μm T0901317. After washing with binding buffer five times, beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. Bands for bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—Numerical data are reported as mean ± S.E. Stigmasterol Increases ABCA1 Expression and Enhances the Formation of SCAP-INSIG-1 Complexes in CHO Cells—Stigmasterol disrupts cholesterol homeostasis by activating LXR and suppressing the SREBP pathway (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To further define the action of stigmasterol on these pathways, we examined the effect of stigmasterol on expression of the LXR target gene ABCA1, and on the interaction between SCAP and INSIG-1 in CHO-7 cells. Stigmasterol treatment increased ABCA1 protein levels 4–5-fold, whereas sitosterol did not increase ABCA1 expression (Fig. 1A). Addition of arachidonate, an LXR antagonist (42Ou J. Tu H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), abolished the effect of stigmasterol on ABCA1 levels, which is consistent with stigmasterol increasing ABCA1 expression by activating LXR. To probe the mechanism by which stigmasterol suppresses SREBP cleavage (24Yang C. Yu L. Li W. Xu F. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we used Blue Native gel electrophoresis to examine the effect of stigmasterol on the interaction between SCAP and INSIG-1 (Fig. 1B). SRD-13A cells, which fail to express SCAP, were co-transfected with SCAP and INSIG-1. In the absence of added sterols, no SCAP-INSIG-1 complex was observed and all INSIG-1 appeared in an unbound form. In cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol, a potent suppressor of the SREBP pathway, the amount of INSIG-1 in the unbound form was reduced, and a SCAP-INSIG-1 complex was detected. Stigmasterol also promoted the formation of a SCAP-INSIG-1 complex, whereas sitosterol did not. These findings suggest that stigmasterol suppresses the SREBP pathway by promoting the formation of SCAP-INSIG-1 complexes in the ER. Sterols with Unsaturated Side Chains Up-regulate ABCA1 in CHO-7 Cells—Sitosterol and stigmasterol differ only by the presence of a double bond at C-22 in the side chain of stigmasterol. To determine whether the effect of stigmasterol on ABCA1 expression is conferred by the Δ22 moiety, we compared the effects of two other Δ22 sterols (22-dehydrocholesterol and brassicasterol) and their structural homologs with saturated side chains (cholesterol and campesterol) on ABCA1 levels in cultured CHO-7 cells (Fig. 2A). The Δ22 sterols (22-dehydrocholesterol and stigmasterol) increased ABCA1 expression more than the homologs with saturated side chains. Brassicasterol did not increase ABCA1 levels despite having a Δ22 double bond in its side chain. This may reflect the orientation of the C-24 methyl group in brassicasterol, which is in the 24(S), rather than the 24(R) configuration. Next we examined whether the position of the double bond in the sterol side chain influenced the effect on ABCA1 expression. CHO-7 cells were treated with 25 μm cholesterol, 20-dehydrocholesterol, 22-dehydrocholesterol, 24-dehydrocholesterol, or 24,28-methylene cholesterol (fucosterol) for 16 h (Fig. 2B). ABCA1 protein levels were increased in cells treated with 20-dehydrocholesterol, 22-dehydrocholesterol, and 24-dehydrocholesterol, but not in cells treated with fucosterol. The largest increase in ABCA1 protein level was seen in the cells treated with 24-dehydrocholesterol. The greater potency of 24-dehydrocholesterol is not due to preferential accumulation of this sterol, because each of the sterols administered accumulated to comparable levels in the cells (data not shown). 24-Dehydrocholesterol is an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and is commonly known as desmosterol. Desmosterol Induces a Dose-dependent Increase in ABCA1 Levels in CHO-7 Cells—ABCA1 protein levels were consistently increased within 4 h after addition of 25 μm desmosterol to CHO-7 cells and continued to increase for at least 16 h (Fig. 2C). Desmosterol also reduced expression of the SREBP target genes LDLR and HMGCR, as indicated by the decreased levels of LDLR and HMGCR protein at the 16-h time point. Accordingly, all subsequent sterol treatments were performed for 16 h. A dose-response experiment indicated that increase"

It would be particularly interesting to combine the shape selectivity of a mesoporous oxide with the electronic and photonic characteristics of a useful semiconductor. We demonstrated the synthesis of a mesoporous germanium semiconductor using liquid-crystals-templated chemistry. The template removal was achieved by a two-step ion-exchange thermal procedure. This semiconductive mesoporous form of germanium possesses hexagonal pore ordering with very high surface area and exhibits strongly size-dependent optical properties as well as photoluminescence.

While the formation of GPCR dimers/oligomers has been reported to play important roles in regulating receptor expression, ligand binding, and second messenger activation, less is known about how and where GPCR dimerization occurs. The present study was performed to identify the precise cellular compartment in which class A GPCR dimer/oligomer biogenesis occurs. We addressed this issue using confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor GPCR proximity within discrete intracellular compartments of intact living cells. Time-lapse confocal imaging was used to follow CFP- and YFP-tagged serotonin 5-HT2C receptors during biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trafficking through the Golgi apparatus and subsequent expression on the plasma membrane. Real-time monitoring of FRET between CFP- and YFP-tagged 5-HT2C receptors was performed by acceptor photobleaching within discrete regions of the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane. The FRET signal was dependent on the ratio of CFP- to YFP-tagged 5-HT2C receptors expressed in each region and was independent of receptor expression level, as predicted for proteins in a non-random, clustered distribution. FRET efficiencies measured in the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane were similar. These experiments provide direct evidence for homodimerization/oligomerization of class A GPCR in the ER and Golgi of intact living cells, and suggest that dimer/oligomer formation is a naturally occurring step in 5-HT2C receptor maturation and processing.

They are present in most all cells in the human body and are signaling proteins that transmit information across the plasma membrane in response to neurotransmitters, hormones, odorants, taste, and light. GPCR were originally thought to function as monomeric units. However, over the last decade many studies have provided evidence suggesting that GPCR form dimeric/oligomeric complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Until recently, experimental evidence in favor of this model has been limited to studies using immunoprecipitation of solubilized receptors prepared from whole cell lysates and confocal microscopy showing co-localization of fluorescent-tagged GPCR in endomembranes of fixed cells. More recently, this issue has been addressed using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) following sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Positive BRET signals were detected in both plasma membrane and endomembrane-enriched fractions prepared from HEK293 cells expressing vasopressin or β2-adrenergic receptors (14Terrillon S. Durroux T.

While these results suggest that GPCR dimerization may occur within intracellular compartments, direct experimental evidence demonstrating the formation of class A GPCR homodimers in the ER and Golgi of intact living cells is still lacking.The present study was performed to test the hypothesis that class A GPCR form dimers/oligomers in the ER and Golgi of intact living cells. Previously, we have shown that 5-HT2C receptors are present as constitutive homodimers on the plasma membrane (15Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Herein, we used a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to determine if 5-HT2C receptors form homodimers in the ER prior to trafficking to the Golgi and plasma membrane. Immunoprecipitation with differentially tagged 5-HT2C receptors revealed the presence of 5-HT2C receptor bands from ER and plasma membrane, and confocal fluorescence imaging was used to quantify fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the ER and Golgi of living HEK293 cells expressing fluorescent-tagged 5-HT2C receptors. The confocal microscopy-based FRET approach allows specific intracellular compartments to be examined, without compromising cellular integrity, and real-time monitoring of GPCR dimerization in the ER and Golgi apparatus. These experiments are the first to use time-lapse confocal imaging of transfected HEK293 cells to provide real-time visualization of fluorescent-tagged 5-HT2C receptors during biosynthesis in the ER, trafficking through the Golgi, and subsequent expression on the plasma membrane at physiologically relevant receptor expression levels. Our results demonstrate that class A GPCR can form homodimeric/oligomeric complexes in the ER and Golgi of intact living cells, indicating that dimerization/oligomerization may be a naturally occurring step in the maturation and processing of 5-HT2C receptors.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates containing polylysine-treated glass coverslips. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected for 5 h and cultured post-transfection in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All experiments were performed in serum-free culture media 12–36 h post-transfection.Fusion Proteins—All studies were performed using the INI isoform of the human 5-HT2C receptor. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were attached to the C-terminal end of the 5-HT2C or CCR5-chemokine receptor by ligation into pECFP-N1 or pEYFP-N1 vectors (Clontech) to create 5-HT2C/CFP, 5-HT2C/YFP, and CCR5/YFP as previously described (15Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 5-HT2C/HA fusion protein was created by PCR to add the 10 amino acid HA sequence to the C-terminal end of the receptor, as previously described (15Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Center for Functional Genomics, Albany, NY). YFP and HA attached to the C terminus of the receptor had no effect on ligand binding or inositol phosphate production (15Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with 40 ng of the indicated plasmid DNAs and imaged live (at room temperature in HEPES-buffered Minimal Essential Medium without phenol, Cellgro) using a Zeiss LSM 510Meta confocal imaging system with a 30 milliwatt argon laser and a ×63 1.4 NA oil immersion objective at ×2 zoom. The pEYFP-ER plasmid (Clontech) encoding a YFP fusion protein containing the ER-targeting sequence of calreticulin with a KDEL retention sequence and the pEYFP-Golgi plasmid (Clontech) encoding a YFP fusion protein that specifically targets the trans-medial region of the Golgi apparatus were used as markers to visualize ER and Golgi, respectively, following excitation at 514 nm. Real-time imaging of CFP- and YFP-tagged 5-HT2C receptors was performed 12–24-h post-transfection to visualize 5-HT2C receptors following biosynthesis in the ER, trafficking through the Golgi, and subsequent expression on the plasma membrane. Cells co-expressing 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP were imaged following excitation at 458 nm. CFP and YFP fluorescence were separated using on-line finger printing and linear unmixing with the Zeiss Meta detector and Zeiss Aim Software, as previously described (15Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—HEK293 cells, plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates containing polylysine-treated glass coverslips, were co-transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP plasmid DNA in the following ratios: 1:1 (40 ng + 40 ng); and 1:2 (20 ng + 40 ng) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For control experiments, cells were transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP (40 ng) + ER/YFP marker (40 ng) or 5-HT2C/CFP (40 ng) + CCR5/YFP (40 ng). Transfected cells were imaged live (at room temperature in HEPES-buffered Minimal Essential Medium without phenol) using a Zeiss LSM 510Meta confocal imaging system with a 30 milliwatt argon laser and a ×63 1.4 NA oil immersion objective at ×2 zoom. CFP and YFP emission spectra were collected (from cells expressing 5-HT2C/CFP or 5-HT2C/YFP alone) following excitation at 458 nm and were used as reference spectra for linear unmixing of CFP and YFP emission spectra in co-transfected cells using the Zeiss META detector and Zeiss AIM software, as previously described (15Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). FRET was measured by acceptor photobleaching (31Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize a 2-μm optical slice through the middle of live HEK293 cells expressing both 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP receptors in the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane. Pre-bleach CFP and YFP images were collected simultaneously following excitation at 458 nm (38% laser intensity; detector gain = 740). A selected region of interest was irradiated with the 514-nm laser line (100% intensity, 60 iterations, using a 458-nm/514-nm dual dichroic mirror) for 5–10 s to photobleach YFP. Post-bleach CFP and YFP images were collected simultaneously (at 458 nm) immediately following photobleaching. FRET was measured as an increase in CFP fluorescence intensity following YFP photobleaching. FRET efficiency was calculated as 100 × [(CFP post-bleach – CFP prebleach)/CFP post-bleach] using the FRET Macro in the Zeiss Aim software package, taking into account CFP and YFP background noise in each channel. FRET efficiencies were calculated in cells co-expressing 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP, in cells expressing 5-HT2C/CFP alone, and in cells co-expressing 5-HT2C/CFP with ER/YFP or CCR5/YFP. For live cells expressing only 5-HT2C/CFP the mean FRET efficiency was –1.3 ± 0.7%, indicating that receptor migration within the region of interest during the 5–10-s photobleach period does not give rise to a false positive FRET signal.Radioligand Binding Assay—HEK293 cells were plated and transfected as described above for the FRET experiments. Membranes were prepared from transfected cells and [3H]mesulergine binding was performed as previously described (32Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Niswender C.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Protein was measured by BCA (Pierce). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software.Immunoprecipitation and PNGase Digest—HEK293 cells (4 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were pretreated with or without 1 μm Brefeldin A (Sigma) for overnight prior to transfection with 1 μg of 5-HT2C/YFP and 1 μg of 5-HT2C/HA plasmid DNA using 20 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). As a control, separate dishes of cells were transfected independently with either 5-HT2C/YFP or 5-HT2C/HA, and the cells were mixed together after transfection. Transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), sonicated for 30 s on ice, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm CHAPS). The membrane proteins were solubilized for 60 min on ice and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. Solubilized membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with 10 μl of HA(Y-11)-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture, resuspended in 50 μl of denaturing Laemmli sample buffer. For the PNGase digest, solubilized membrane protein was diluted in 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5) and incubated with 2 μl of PNGase (NewEngland Biolabs) for 3 h at 37°C. Samples were run on a Tris-HCl ready gel (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 70 min under denaturing conditions. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), probed with GFP(B-2)-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:3,000 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSConfocal Fluorescence Imaging of ER and Golgi Membranes in Living Cells—HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing a mutant YFP protein engineered with an ER-targeting and retention sequence (ER-YFP) or with a YFP variant that specifically targets the trans-medial region of the Golgi apparatus (Golgi-YFP). Live cell confocal fluorescence imaging was performed to visualize ER and Golgi membranes in 2-μm thick optical slices through the middle of HEK293 cells expressing the ER-YFP or Golgi-YFP marker. In HEK293 cells, ER membranes appear as a diffuse reticular network spreading outward from the nucleus throughout the cytosol toward the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Golgi membranes are visualized as dense areas of intense fluorescence confined to a discrete perinuclear region of the cytosol (Fig. 1B).Real-time Confocal Fluorescence Imaging of 5-HT2C Receptors Trafficking from the ER to the Golgi and Plasma Membrane—Fluorescent proteins were used as markers to visualize 5-HT2C receptors following biosynthesis in the ER and subsequent trafficking to the Golgi and plasma membrane. HEK293 cells co-transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP and the ER/YFP marker showed co-localization of CFP and YFP fluorescence in the ER 12-h post-transfection (Fig. 1, C–E). Cells co-transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP and the Golgi/YFP marker showed co-localization of CFP and YFP fluorescence in the Golgi 16-h post-transfection (Fig. 1, F–H). Twenty hours post-transfection, 5-HT2C/CFP fluorescence was on the plasma membrane, and the Golgi/YFP marker remained in the Golgi (Fig. 1, I–K). Based on these results, a time course was performed in cells co-transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP. The cells were imaged live using confocal fluorescence imaging at various time points post-transfection. Ten hours after the addition of transfection reagents, 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP receptor fluorescence began to emerge. 12–16-h post-transfection, confocal fluorescence imaging revealed many cells with a diffuse reticular pattern of fluorescence (Fig. 2A), identical to HEK293 cells expressing the ER-YFP marker (Fig. 1A), demonstrating 5-HT2C receptor expression in the ER. Confocal fluorescence imaging 16–20-h post-transfection revealed many cells with a more clustered, dense pattern of labeling with a distinct perinuclear distribution (Fig. 2B), identical to HEK293 cells expressing the Golgi-YFP marker (Fig. 1B). By 20-h post-transfection, many cells were expressing 5-HT2C receptors on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). At this time, 5-HT2C receptor expression appears to have reached a steady-state level with the majority of the receptor expressed on the plasma membrane and little intracellular fluorescence remaining. This phenomenon has been observed in every one of our transient transfections and in all of our stable cell lines. Whether this is because of mRNA stability or some other form of feedback regulation by the receptors once they reach the plasma membrane is unknown. While the time course for receptor expression is likely to vary for different receptors in different cell lines and different culture conditions, our results indicate that it is possible to monitor receptor trafficking through discrete intracellular compartments at early time points post-transfection.FIGURE 2Confocal fluorescence imaging of living HEK293 cells co-transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP.

HEK293 cells co-transfected with 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP were visualized live by confocal fluorescence imaging using a Zeiss LSM-510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope. CFP and YFP fluorescence were imaged simultaneously following excitation at 458 nm and subsequent linear unmixing of emission spectra using the Zeiss Meta detector (Fig. 3, A and B). CFP- and YFP-tagged 5-HT2C receptors were co-localized in the ER of a living HEK293 cell (Fig. 3C). Acceptor photobleaching was used to measure FRET between 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP in the ER. This method involves the selective irradiation of YFP fluorescence using the 514-nm laser line. If 5-HT2C/CFP (donor) and 5-HT2C/YFP (acceptor) are within 10 nm of each other and the fluorophore dipoles are aligned, resonance energy can be transferred from CFP to YFP. If FRET occurs, then photobleaching of YFP fluorescence will result in enhanced CFP fluorescence, because of the dequenching of CFP following the removal of YFP. To perform acceptor photobleaching, a pre-bleach image was captured using the 458-nm laser line (Fig. 3, A–C). A region of the ER (marked by the white rectangle in Fig. 3E) was selectively irradiated using the 514-nm laser line. A 458/514-nm dual dichroic mirror was used to allow rapid, automated image acquisition immediately after YFP photobleaching (Fig. 3, D–F). An increase in CFP fluorescence was observed following YFP photobleaching (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3D) and the FRET efficiency was 28.5%. Acceptor photobleaching experiments, as shown in Fig. 3, were performed on 50 living HEK293 cells co-expressing 5-HT2C/CFP and 5-HT2C/YFP. All FRET measurements were made 12–16 h after transfection, when 5-HT2C receptor expression in the ER was visible. FRET efficiency was plotted versus the uD/A ratio (post-bleach CFP fluorescence/pre-bleach YFP fluorescence). The amount of FRET observed within a given cell was dependent on the uD/A ratio (Fig. 4A). When FRET efficiency was plotted versus acceptor fluorescence by uD/A ratio, there was no correlation between the amount of FRET observed and 5-HT2C receptor expression level in the ER (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 3Acceptor photobleaching FRET in the ER. Fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to visualize a 2-μm thick optical cross-section of a living HEK293 cell co-expressing 5-HT2C/CFP (donor) and 5-HT2C/YFP (acceptor) in the ER. CFP (green) and YFP (red) images were captured simultaneously following excitation at 458 nm and linear unmixing of their emission spectra (A–C). A region of ER (marked by the white rectangle) was photobleached at 514 nm for 5 s. Post-bleach images were captured simultaneously following excitation at 458 nm (D–F). FRET is visualized as an increase in CFP fluorescence following YFP photobleaching (marked by arrow in D).

https://openalex.org/W2072434783,"Escherichia coli is a metabolically versatile bacterium that is able to grow in the presence and absence of oxygen. Several previous transcript-profiling experiments have compared separate anaerobic and aerobic cultures. Here the process of adaptation was investigated by determining changes in transcript profiles when anaerobic steady-state cultures were perturbed by the introduction of air. Within 5 min of culture aeration the abundances of transcripts associated with anaerobic metabolism were decreased, whereas transcripts associated with aerobic metabolism were increased. In addition to the rapid switch to aerobic central metabolism, transcript profiling, supported by experiments with relevant mutants, revealed transient changes suggesting that the peroxide stress response, methionine biosynthesis, and degradation of putrescine play important roles during the adaptation to aerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2003890477,"Apoptosis is characterized by the activation of specific biochemical pathways that lead to the organized demise of cells. Intracellular GSH depletion has been observed during apoptosis; however, neither the mechanisms involved in the reduction of the intracellular GSH concentration, [GSH]i, nor its link to the progression of apoptosis have been elucidated. We have studied this issue using Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells where changes in [GSH]i can be analyzed biochemically and at the single cell level by flow cytometry. A reduction in the total [GSH]i in response to FasL occurs in two distinct stages prior to the loss of membrane integrity. Jurkat cells express several members of the multidrug resistance protein (ABCC/MRP), and the organic anion-transporting polypeptide protein (SLCO/OATP) families of GSH efflux pumps at the mRNA level. Glutathione loss and its accumulation in the extracellular medium, induced by FasL, was trans-stimulated by the organic substrates MK571, probenecid, taurocholic acid, estrone sulfate, and bromosulfophthalein and inhibited by high concentrations of extracellular GSH. Single cell analysis demonstrated that intracellular GSH loss was paralleled by the activation of an organic anion uptake process, supporting the role of an anion exchange mechanism (SLCO/OATP-like transport) in GSH efflux induced by FasL. Additionally, high extracellular GSH inhibited the activation of the execution caspases, the cleavage of their substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and α-fodrin, and DNA degradation. In contrast, the trans-stimulation of GSH efflux by MK571 increased the cleavage of the execution caspases and their substrates. Together these results suggest that GSH efflux during FasL-induced apoptosis is mediated by a SLCO/OATP-like transport mechanism that modulates the progression of the execution phase of apoptosis.

Apoptosis is a ubiquitous genetically encoded pathway that enables cells to undergo highly regulated death in response to specific signals. It has also been observed to occur as a consequence of distinct pathologies, and its deregulation can lead to autoimmune diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (1Green D.R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is characterized by the activation of precise pathways leading to specific biochemical and morphological alterations, including changes in the intracellular ionic homeostasis, cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine externalization, chromatin condensation, DNA degradation, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation (1Green D.R.

Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis, postischemic neuronal degeneration, traumatic brain injury, and inflammatory lung diseases. Its deregulation is also associated with progression and metastasis of tumors and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (3Curtin J.F. Cotter T.G. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). GSH is the predominant low molecular weight thiol in animal cells. It participates in many cellular reactions, including antioxidant defense of the cell, drug detoxification, and cell signaling, and has been reported to be necessary for the proliferation of several cells, including lymphocytes (4Pompella A.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanisms involved in intracellular GSH (GSHi) loss have not been identified. Glutathione synthesis occurs intracellularly, and its catabolism occurs by a series of both enzymatic and plasma membrane export mechanisms. Glutathione degradation occurs extracellularly; therefore, the export of GSH and GSH adducts is also an important step in its turnover (15Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To date, two GSH transporter families have been implicated in GSH efflux across the plasma membrane. These include the multidrug-resistant protein (MRP), encoded by ABCC genes, subfamily of the ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), and the organic anion-transporting polypeptide proteins (OATP), encoded by SLCO genes. During apoptosis, GSHi loss has been suggested to be mediated by activation of GSH active transport (7Hammond C.L. Madejczyk M.S. Ballatori N. Toxicol. Appl.

In this work, we present evidence for the involvement of an organic anion exchange mechanism (a SLCO/OATP-like transporter) in the reduction of [GSH]i observed during FasL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we show that the GSHi loss is a necessary step for the progression of the execution phase of the cell demise.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 31 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 atmosphere. Jurkat cells (5–7 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with FasL for the time indicated for the induction of apoptosis. In the medium containing high GSH, NaCl was substituted with 25 mm l-glutathione, maintaining the same osmolarity of the media. For choline- or N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-substituted medium, RPMI 1640 medium was initially made substituting NaCl for either choline chloride or NMDG. Additionally, choline bicarbonate and magnesium phosphate were used in place of sodium bicarbonate and sodium phosphate, respectively. Medium osmolarity was measured on a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Logan, UT). Total Intracellular Glutathione Determinations, [glutathione]i—Quantitative, colorimetric determination of total intracellular glutathione concentration, [glutathione]i, was measured using a Bioxytech GSH-420 kit (Oxis Research, Portland, OR) following the manufacturer's specifications. This method is based on the formation of a chromophoric thione, using 4-chloro-1-methyl-7-trifluoromethylquinolinum methylsulfate as chromogen, whose absorbance was measured at 420 nm on a DU650 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The absorbance at 420 nm is linearly proportional to the concentration of glutathione. A calibration curve with provided calibrator solutions was performed for each experiment. For each sample, 2 × 107 cells/sample were used, and total glutathione content was normalized to protein concentration for each sample. This method determines [glutathione]i (i.e. both reduced (GSH) and oxidized forms) (GSSG is reduced to GSH using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Results are expressed as a percentage of change in the intracellular GSH content versus control conditions. Reduced (GSH) and Oxidized (GSSG) Glutathione Determinations—Cells were incubated with 250 μm l-(αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) for 4 h to inhibit catabolism of released GSH by the γ-glutamyl-transferase. Then cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were induced to undergo apoptosis with FasL in the presence of acivicin. Samples were centrifuged, and aliquots were taken for extracellular determinations. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), homogenized, and kept frozen until use for intracellular determinations. The extracellular and intracellular GSH and GSSG concentrations were measured enzymatically using the GSH/GSSG-412 kit (Oxis Research). Samples were prepared in 5% metaphosphoric acid to remove proteins, with or without 1-methyl-2-vinyl-pyridium trifluoromethane sulfonate, a GSH-specific scavenger. Ellman's reagent DTNB (5′,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) reacts with GSH to form a product with an absorption maximum at 412 nm. GSSG was determined using glutathione reductase and NADPH to reduce GSSG to GSH, followed by reaction with Ellman's reagent. Results are normalized to protein concentration for each sample. Flow Cytometry Assay—FasL-induced apoptotic parameters were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD LSR II flow cytometer and BD FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences) for data analysis, unless otherwise stated. Cells were analyzed at a cell density of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and in all cases 10,000 cells were analyzed. Fluorophores were diluted in Me2SO and preloaded at 37 °C, 7% CO2. In all cases, the final concentration of Me2SO never exceeded 0.1%. When indicated, propidium iodide (PI) was added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml to evaluate plasma membrane integrity. Sequential analysis of the distinct fluorophores was used, and, unless otherwise indicated, cells with increased PI fluorescence were excluded during the analysis. For PI, cells were excited with an argon 488-nm laser, and emission was acquired with a 695/40 filter. Histograms and plots in all cases are representative of at least three different experiments. Changes in different morphological and biochemical parameters during apoptosis induced by FasL in Jurkat cells were determined as follows. Changes in Intracellular Glutathione Concentration, [GSH]i— For intracellular GSH (GSHi) measurements, cells were preloaded 10 min with 10 μm mBCl, which forms blue fluorescent adducts with intracellular glutathione (17Sebastia J. Cristofol R. Martin M. Rodriguez-Farre E. Sanfeliu C. Cytometry A. 2003; 51: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Hedley D.W. Chow S. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to flow cytometry examination, PI was added. For mBCl, cells were excited with a UV 405 laser, and emission was acquired with a 440/40 filter. When indicated, mBCl fluorescence was plotted against changes in forward scatter, which was acquired by exciting the cells with an argon 488-nm laser. 5-Carboxyfluorescein (CF) Efflux Assay for Functional Assessment of Multidrug Resistance Protein Activity—Cells were incubated with 1 μm CFDA for 1 h at 37 °C then centrifuged and washed with CFDA-free medium. CFDA diffuses into cells, where it is cleaved by intracellular esterases, resulting in fluorescent CF, which is a substrate of ABCC/MRP transporters (19Zamek-Gliszczynski M.J. Xiong H. Patel N.J. Turncliff R.Z. Pollack G.M. Brouwer K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were then resuspended in CFDA-free medium and allowed to efflux CFDA for the time indicated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of ABCC/MRP activity reversal agents. Immediately prior to flow cytometry examination, PI was added. For CF fluorescence, samples were excited using an argon 488 laser with a 530/30 filter. CDF Uptake Assay, for Functional Assessment of Organic Anion Transport Activity—Organic anion transport activity during apoptosis was evaluated by a CDF uptake assay. Organic anion transporters have previously been reported to transport organic anion fluorescein derivates, including CDF (19Zamek-Gliszczynski M.J. Xiong H. Patel N.J. Turncliff R.Z. Pollack G.M. Brouwer K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Miller D.S. Letcher S. Barnes D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F508-F520PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was induced in the presence of 5 μm CDF for the time indicated. Cells were then centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in PBS. For simultaneous analysis of [GSH]i levels, cells were incubated for an additional 10 min with mBCl as described previously. Immediately prior to flow cytometry examination, PI was added. For CDF fluorescence, samples were excited using an argon 488 laser with a 530/30 filter. An increase in organic anion transport (OAuptake-) is reflected by CDF accumulation in cells as measured by an increase in fluorescence. Jurkat Cell Immunolabeling Assay—Samples were washed once with ice-cold PBS and then fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit for 30 min at room temperature in dark according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were then centrifuged and washed with the Perm/Wash buffer and stained with PE-conjugated anti-active caspase-3, FITC-conjugated anti-PARP cleavage or FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-MRP1 for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following incubation, cells were washed with the PermWash buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. PE and FITC fluorescence were detected using an argon 488 laser with 575/26 and 530/30 filters, respectively. DNA Degradation Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Samples were pelleted and washed in ice-cold PBS. Then cells were fixed by the addition of 70% cold ethanol to a volume of ∼1.5 ml, adjusted to 5 ml with cold 70% ethanol, and stored at –20 °C overnight. Fixed cells were pelleted, washed once in PBS, and stained in 1 ml of 20 μg/ml PI, 1 mg/ml RNase, in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. 7500 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSort flow cytometer and BD Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences) for analysis. Region gates were set on a PI area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. Determination of mRNA Levels of ABCC/MRP and SLCO/OATP Genes by Real Time PCR—RNA extraction from Jurkat cells was performed using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed in PCR buffer containing 500 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5.5 mm MgCl2, with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, dNTP (deoxy-CTP, -GTP, -TTP, and -ATP), oligo(dT)16, and RNase inhibitor, all reagents from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 9.5 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. mRNA levels for the organic anion-transporting polypeptides (SLCO/OATP proteins) and the multidrug resistance protein (ABCC/MRP) members were determined by real time PCR on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 sequence detection system and Taqman gene expression assay (Assays-on-Demand™;Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers' guidelines. Primer probes for the ABCC/MRP were as follows: ABCC1/MRP1 (transcript accession no. NM_019902.1), ABCC2/MRP2 (NM_000392.1), ABCC3/MRP3 (NM_020037.1), ABCC4/MRP4 (NM_005845.2), ABCC5/MRP5 (NM_005688.2), ABCC6/MRP6 (NM_001171.2), ABCC7/MRP7 (NM_000492.2), ABCC8/MRP8 (NM_000352.2), ABCC9/MRP9 (NM_020298.1). Primer probes for the SLCO/OATP transporters were as follows: SLCO1A2/OATP-A (NM_021094.2), SLCO1B1/OATP-C (NM_006446.2), SLCO1B3/OATP-8 (NM_019844.1), SLCO1C1/OATP-F (NM_017435.2), SLCO2A1/hPGT (NM_005630.1), SLCO2B1/OATP-B (NM_007256.2), SLCO3A1/OATP-D (NM_013272.2), SLCO4A1/OATP-E (NM_016354.3), SLCO4C1/OATP-H (NM_180991.4), SLCO5A1/OATP-J (NM_030958.1), and SLCO6A1/OATP-1 (NM_173488.2), ordered as kits from Applied Biosystems. All probes were labeled with FAM TaqMan™ fluorogenic probe (5′-6FAM-TGGCCCCAGCATGCGACCTC-tetra-methylrhodamine-3′). As reported, during PCR amplification, 5′ nucleolytic activity of Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the 5′ reporter fluorescent dye from the 3′ quencher dye. This ends the activity of the quencher dye, and the reporter dye emits fluorescence, which increases in each cycle proportional to the rate of probe cleavage in real time. PCRs were carried out in 96-well plates (MicroAmp Optical 96-well reaction plate and optical caps; Applied Biosystems) in a 50-μl reaction mix volume containing the corresponding concentration of cDNA sample, 2.5 μl of primer probes, and 1× Taqman universal PCR master mix without AmpEraseUNG (containing MgCl2, dUTP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and Taq Gold polymerase; Applied Biosystems). Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and then subjected to 40 cycles of PCR (15 s at 95 °C to activate the TaqDNA polymerase and 1 min at 60 °C to anneal/extend). Relative mRNA levels for ABCC/MRP and SLCO/OATP transporters were analyzed using a standard curve from 50 to 200 ng (five concentrations) of cDNA input to obtain the threshold cycle, CT. This CT value is determined as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescent emission increases above a threshold level (usually 10 times the S.D. value of the base line) at a concentration of 50 ng of cDNA input. As control, we used GAPDH to correct for potential variation in RNA loading of amplification efficiency in each experiment. Data are expressed as the intercept CT values of each gene obtained from standard curves normalized against the GAPDH CT value (CT GAPDH/CT). All samples were amplified simultaneously in triplicate in one assay run. For amplification efficiency validation, standard curve equation values are shown in Table 1 for each gene analyzed (i.e. each primer/probe set used). Table 1 shows the standard curve equation for each gene, where the logarithm of each cDNA input concentration is plotted on the x axis, and the corresponding CT value is plotted on the y axis. R2 is calculated from the standard curve of five data pairs (0–200 ng). CT values greater than 40 indicate that mRNA levels were on the lower limit of detection and are not considered significant.TABLE 1Gene expression of GSH efflux pumps in Jurkat cellsGSH transportersSlopeIntercept (CT)R2CT GAPDH/CTGene nameProtein nameMultidrug resistance proteins (ABCC/MRP)ABCC1MRP-1-3.51 ± 0.9334.46 ± 3.170.97 ± 0.040.71 ± 0.068ABCC2MRP-2-3.61 ± 0.1839.52 ± 0.220.99 ± 0.010.62 ± 0.004ABCC3MRP-3NDABCC4MRP-4-3.90 ± 0.0235.29 ± 0.230.97 ± 0.010.69 ± 0.004ABCC5MRP-5-5.09 ± 0.7139.90 ± 1.780.99 ± 0.010.6 ± 0.02ABCC6MRP-6-4.34 ± 0.6746.74 ± 1.860.93 ± 0.030.52 ± 0.021ABCC7MRP-7-3.91 ± 0.2743.59 ± 0.40.98 ± 0.030.56 ± 0.005ABCC8MRP-8NDABCC9MRP-9NDOrganic anion transport polypeptides (SLCO/OATP)SLCO1A2OATP-A-3.05 ± 0.7144.51 ± 1.570.87 ± 0.170.55 ± 0.019SLCO1B1OATP-CNDSLCO1B3OATP-8NDSLCO1C1OATP-FNDSLCO2A1hPGT-4.24 ± 0.4246.17 ± 0.910.95 ± 0.020.52 ± 0.011SLCO2B1OATP-B-2.96 ± 0.3345.88 ± 1.40.74 ± 0.370.53 ± 0.016SLCO3A1OATP-D-3.72 ± 0.1835.65 ± 0.440.98 ± 0.030.68 ± 0.009SLCO4A1OATP-E-3.82 ± 0.1934.83 ± 0.970.94 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.019SLCO4C1OATP-H-3.54 ± 0.4439.89 ± 0.090.92 ± 0.110.61 ± 0.001SLCO5A1OATP-J-1.42 ± 0.4242.05 ± 0.90.55 ± 0.380.58 ± 0.012SLCO6A1OATP-INDGAPDH-3.10 ± 0.224.36 ± 0.790.99 ± 0.021 Open table in a new tab Protein Extraction and Western Immunoblotting—Cells were pelleted, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini protease mixture; Roche Applied Science). Samples were sonicated and centrifuged, and the pellets were discarded. Then samples were assayed in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer for protein concentration using a Bio-Rad protein assay, and cell extracts were normalized to equal protein concentration. Loading buffer containing glycerol, SDS, and bromphenol blue was added, and samples were denatured at 99 °C for 5 min. Protein extracts, 50 μg/sample, were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide Tris/glycine gels (Novex; Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were incubated with the corresponding primary antibody (1:1000) overnight. Then blots were incubated for 1 h with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and 0.5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were then visualized on film with the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were subsequently stripped using 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS buffer and reprobed for α-tubulin to verify equal protein loading. Statistical Analysis—When indicated, significances of difference in mean values were calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test. The number of experiments is indicated in each case in the legends of the figures. FasL-induced Reduction in Total Intracellular Glutathione Concentration [GSH]i—A reduction in [GSH]i is a feature observed in apoptosis triggered by different stimuli, but the mechanisms involved in GSHi loss are not clear (21Hall A.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Apoptotic agents have also been reported to stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen species, particularly hydrogen peroxide (22Hentze H. Latta M. Kunstle G. Lucas R. Wendel A. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 139: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Kern J.C. Kehrer J.P. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which might reduce [GSH]i by its oxidation to GSSG. However, several reports have demonstrated that the activation of an efflux transport mechanism for GSH extrusion rather than its oxidation to GSSG underlies the decrease in [GSH]i (7Hammond C.L. Madejczyk M.S. Ballatori N. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 195: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P.

We first evaluated whether the reduction in [GSH]i was associated with a decrease in the total concentration of GSH. Changes in total glutathione concentration [glutathione]i of Jurkat cells induced to die by FasL were analyzed by a quantitative biochemical assay that measures both GSH and GSSG. If changes in [GSH]i reflect its oxidation, then [glutathione]i should not change. Treatment of Jurkat cells with FasL resulted in a time-dependent (Fig. 1A, left) and dose-dependent (Fig. 1A, right) reduction in [glutathione]i. These results support the hypothesis that activation of an efflux transport mechanism underlies the decrease in [GSH]i. Apoptosis is a stochastic phenomenon that can be explained by exponential kinetics, which suggests first that the risk of cell death is constant, second that cell death occurs randomly in time, and third that the death of one cell is independent of that of other cells (24Clarke G. Lumsden C.J. McInnes R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Accordingly, kinetic and dose-dependent curves of the reduction in [GSH]i induced by FasL (Fig. 1A) fit well with exponen"
https://openalex.org/W2043990544,"Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) by the nonhomologous end-joining pathway in mammals requires at least seven proteins involved in a simplified two-step process: (i) recognition and synapsis of the DNA ends dependent on the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) formed by the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs in association with Artemis; (ii) ligation dependent on the DNA ligase IV·XRCC4·Cernunnos-XLF complex. The Artemis protein exhibits exonuclease and endonuclease activities that are believed to be involved in the processing of a subclass of DSB. Here, we have analyzed the interactions of Artemis and nonhomologous end-joining pathway proteins both in a context of human nuclear cell extracts and in cells. DSB-inducing agents specifically elicit the mobilization of Artemis to damaged chromatin together with DNA-PK and XRCC4/ligase IV proteins. DNA-PKcs is necessary for the loading of Artemis on damaged DNA and is the main kinase that phosphorylates Artemis in cells damaged with highly efficient DSB producers. Under kinase-preventive conditions, both in vitro and in cells, Ku-mediated assembly of DNA-PK on DNA ends is responsible for a dissociation of the DNA-PKcs·Artemis complex. Conversely, DNA-PKcs kinase activity prevents Artemis dissociation from the DNA-PK·DNA complex. Altogether, our data allow us to propose a model in which a DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation is necessary both to activate Artemis endonuclease activity and to maintain its association with the DNA end site. This tight functional coupling between the activation of both DNA-PKcs and Artemis may avoid improper processing of DNA.

In addition, tissue-specific DSB are produced during specialized processes like meiosis in germinal cells or V(D)J recombination in lymphocytes. Improper signaling or repair of DSB in cells can lead to cell death or cancer-prone genomic rearrangements (1Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Immunol.

Genet. 2006; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).DSB are mainly repaired through two distinct pathways: homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), but DSB are mainly processed by the latter pathway in mammalian cells. NHEJ requires several factors that recognize and bind the DSB, catalyze the synapsis of the broken ends, and then process and reseal the break (3Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev.

Artemis exhibits an intrinsic single strand-specific 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity but has also hairpin opening activity in vitro mediated by its DNA-PKcs-dependent phosphorylation (29Ma Y.

This corroborates the findings that a lack of Artemis in vivo leads to V(D)J recombination defects analogous to that produced by a DNA-PKcs deficiency (i.e. impaired coding joining in human cells (26Nicolas N.

In addition, DNA-PKcs activates a versatile endonuclease activity of Artemis that can cleave various substrates near the single- to double-stranded transition region (29Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K.

Moreover, Artemis could have another role in the regulation of cell cycle progression following DNA damage, including UV irradiation (35Wang J. Pluth J.M. Cooper P.K. Cowan M.J. Chen D.J.

It has been reported to form a complex with and to be phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs, leading to the activation of its endonucleolytic activity (29Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). However, under these experimental conditions with purified components, DNA-PKcs was activated without Ku, and no role was observed for Ku in the overhang processing or the hairpin opening by the Artemis·DNA-PKcs complex (29Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 42Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.L.

This implies that important aspects of the interactions between Artemis and the other core NHEJ components may have been overlooked. With this in view, we have analyzed the interactions of Artemis and NHEJ proteins on DNA ends by incubating human nuclear cell extracts with paramagnetic beads bearing double-stranded oligonucleotides and characterizing proteins bound to DNA ends. We next have challenged and validated in cells our in vitro results by using a detergent-based cellular fractionation protocol that allows us to assess in situ the DSB-induced recruitment NHEJ repair proteins (19Drouet J.

The blunt-end C0 double-stranded DNA fragment was constructed by annealing the 32-nucleotide oligomer 5′-TAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACCGGTGTTCG-3′ biotinylated on the 5′-end with the complementary nonbiotinylated oligonucleotide. The 5′ Cn protruding oligonucleotides were constructed by annealing the 32-mer biotinylated as above with complementary nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides bearing various protruding 5′ ends (5′-CGCG-3′ for C2, 5′-CGATCG-3′ for C4, and 5′-CGTTAACG-3′ for C6, respectively).Chemicals—Calicheamicin γ1 (Cal), a generous gift from P. R. Hamann (Wyeth Research, Pearl River, NY), was dissolved in ethanol and stored at –70 °C. Neocarzinostatin was a kind gift from Dr. V. Favaudon (Institut Curie, Orsay, France). It was stored as 1 mm stock solution in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0, at –80 °C and diluted in the same buffer before use. Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum-II) was a gift from Roger Bellon Cie. Cisplatin (3 mm stock solution) was dissolved in 150 mm NaCl and stored at –20 °C. Wortmannin (Sigma) and NU7026 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO (10 mm stock solution) and stored at –20 °C. Small aliquots of stock solution chemicals were used once.Antibodies—Anti-Ku70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (clone 111), anti-Ku70/80 (clone 162), anti-p460 (DNA-PKcs, clone 18.2), and anti-actin (clone ACTN05) monoclonal antibodies were from Neomarkers. Monoclonal antibody anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10), anti-phosphorylated H2AX (JBW301), and anti-lamin A/C (clone 636) were from BD Biosciences, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-Rad51 and the monoclonal antibody anti-HP1α (clone 2HP-2G9) were gifts from Dr. M. Defais (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France) and Dr. R. Losson (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories.Cell Culture and Extracts—All culture media were from Invitrogen and were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum unless indicated, 2 mm glutamine, 125 units/ml penicillin, and 125 μg/ml streptomycin. Guetel are SV40T-transformed, telomerase-immortalized Artemis-deficient fibroblasts, and Guetel-A were obtained after transduction of Guetel with pMND-Artemis-Myc-ires-GFP retroviral vector expressing a C-terminal Myc-His-tagged Artemis protein (37Poinsignon C. de Chasseval R.

Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as previously described (18Calsou P. Delteil C. Frit P. Drouet J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), except that the final dialysis was performed for 3 h at 4°C in an excess volume of dialysis buffer as follows: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After preparation, all of the extracts were immediately frozen and stored at –80 °C.Peptide and Purified Protein—The recombinant N-terminal hexa-His-Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer was expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus-based expression vector as previously described (44Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and purified on a Hitrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+ ions followed by HitrapQ HP (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange chromatography. The C80 peptide (GSGSEGGDVDDLLDMI) was synthesized by H. Mazarguil (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale) and corresponds to the last 12 C-terminal amino acids of Ku80 with a GSGS linker to a biotin moiety at the N terminus as published (45Gell D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The peptide buffer used as control was 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8.Ku Immunodepletions and Artemis Immunoprecipitations—For Ku immunodepletions, anti-Ku70/80 (162) antibodies were coupled to magnetic anti-mouse IgG beads (Dynabeads M-450; Dynal) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Then 250 μg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min under gentle agitation with 20 μl of beads in dialysis buffer. The supernatant was removed over a magnet (Dynal MPC; Dynal). A second depletion was performed immediately under the same conditions. For Artemis immunoprecipitation, anti-Myc antibodies were added to Guetel-A nuclear extracts in IP buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm cantharidin (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture tablets as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C under agitation, and then 20 μl of protein A-immunobeads (Dynal) were added per reaction and further incubated for 90 min at 4 °C under agitation. Then the beads were washed with IP buffer and used as necessary.DNA End Binding Assay—Five pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide as indicated were immobilized on 10 μl of streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M280 streptavidin; Dynal) in 50 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl for 30 min at 20 °C under agitation. After washes with the same buffer, DNA- or mock-treated beads were incubated in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 30 μg of nuclear extracts in standard reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3.4% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 1 mm ATP when necessary. For conditions without ATP, extracts were first incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in standard reaction buffer without ATP, supplemented with 2 mm glucose and 0.2 units of hexokinase (Sigma) in order to remove traces of ATP as described (18Calsou P. Delteil C. Frit P. Drouet J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For conditions with wortmannin, extracts were preincubated in the presence of 30 μm wortmannin in reaction buffer without oligonucleotide and ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Control extracts were similarly preincubated in parallel. Incubation was for 30 min at 30 °C under agitation. The extract supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice with 250 μl of IP buffer; then the beads were heated in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated in an 8% acrylamide Tris-glycine-SDS gel.Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—After DNA end binding assays as above but with 5 pmol of free C6 double-stranded oligonucleotide, the reaction volume was completed to 100 μl with IP buffer. For anti-actin, -Ku, or -DNA-PKcs IPs, the mixture was mixed with 10 μl of magnetic anti-mouse IgG immunobead suspension coated with the corresponding primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dynal), and the beads were mixed gently on a wheel for 3 h at 4 °C. For anti-Artemis IPs, anti-Myc antibodies were first added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under agitation, and then 20 μl of protein A-immunobeads (Dynal) were added per reaction and further incubated for 90 min at 4 °C under agitation. The beads were pulled down over a magnet, the extract supernatant was removed, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of IP buffer, and proteins in the immunoprecipitates were heated in SDS sample buffer and separated in a 8% acrylamide Tris-glycine-SDS gel.DNA-damaging Treatments and Transfection—Before drug exposure, exponentially growing cells were washed with unsupplemented medium, either mock-treated or treated with chemicals, at the specified concentrations in unsupplemented medium at 37 °C in culture dishes and then harvested at the indicated time points. For UV irradiation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then exposed to UVC irradiation (254 nm) with a germicidal lamp (Bioblock). Immediately after irradiation, unsupplemented medium was added, and cells were postincubated as above. Fus9 and Fus1 cells were transiently transfected with the Nucleofector II apparatus (Amaxa) as follows: 2 × 106 cells were transfected with 3 μgof pcDNA1.1-Artemis-myc vector (37Poinsignon C. de Chasseval R.

Cell fractionation was carried out by two consecutive extractions. The supernatant was collected at each step and labeled as fraction S. Pellets of about 2 × 106 cells were first resuspended for 3 min on ice in 200 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini™; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm cantharidin, all"
https://openalex.org/W1990974655,"One of the oldest and most intriguing problems in the handling of materials is how a collection of solid grains packs together. While granular packing is normally determined by how grains are poured or shaken, we find that a systematic and controllable increase in packing is induced by simply raising and lowering the temperature, e.g., without the input of mechanical energy. The results demonstrate that thermal processing provides a largely unexplored mechanism of grain dynamics, as well as an important practical consideration in the handling and storage of granular materials."
https://openalex.org/W1999546563,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) 8 has an important role in initiating immune responses to viral single-stranded RNA and the antiviral compound resiquimod. Together with TLR3, -7, and -9, it forms a subgroup of the TLRs that are localized intracellularly and signal in response to pathogen-derived nucleic acids. In this work, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify regions of the TLR8 extracellular domain that are required for stimulus-induced signal transduction. We have shown that a cysteinerich sequence predicted to form a loop projecting from the solenoidal ectodomain structure at leucine-rich repeat 8 is essential for signaling in response to both single-stranded RNA and resiquimod. A second region, centered on an aspartic acid residue in leucine-rich repeat 17, is also required for TLR8 function. The corresponding residue in TLR9 is known to be important for pH-dependent binding and signaling in response to unmethylated CpG DNA, suggesting that the TLR7/8/9 subgroups share a common signaling mechanism. We have also shown that TLR8 is localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum but that signaling is completely abolished by an inhibitor of vesicle-type H+ ATPases. This indicates that TLR8 is present at low levels in an acidified compartment and that a lowered pH is required for receptor function. We propose that pH-dependent changes in the ligand facilitate activation of the receptor. The protonated form of resiquimod, a cell-permeable weak base, is likely to concentrate significantly (∼100×) in acidified compartments, and this may potentiate low affinity interactions with either the receptor or a specific binding protein.

Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6190) Google Scholar). The initial signaling complex leads to the activation of NF-κB, which induces transcription of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-12, and a large number of other genes. Some TLRs also activate the interferon response factor family of transcription factors that induce genes involved in anti-viral responses, such as interferon-α (see Ref. 1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar for a review). Humans have 10 functional TLRs, and these have evolved to recognize a variety of components derived from pathogenic or commensal microorganisms, principally bacteria and viruses. These molecules include lipids, such as lipopolysaccharide, from Gram-negative bacteria (TLR4) (3Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar), proteins (e.g. flagellin, TLR5 (4Mizel S.B. West A.P. Hantgan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23624-23629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)), and nucleic acids. Nucleic acids and small molecules, such as imidazoquinolines and immunostimulatory guanosine nucleotides, are recognized by a subgroup of the TLRs (5Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar, 6Hemmi H. Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Sanjo H. Hoshino K. Horiuchi T. Tomizawa H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 7Lee J. Chuang T.H. Redecke V. She L.P. Pitha P.M. Carson D.A. Raz E. Cottam H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). It is noticeable that these subgroups are more closely related to each other than the rest of the TLR family and that they have conserved structural features. The nucleic acid subfamily comprises TLRs -3, -7, -8, and -9. TLR3 responds to double-stranded RNA and TLR9 to unmethylated CpG DNA sequences (9Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5380) Google Scholar). TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by imidazoquinolines, a family of small molecule drugs that elicit powerful anti-viral responses (see Fig. 3A) (6Hemmi H. Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Sanjo H. Hoshino K. Horiuchi T. Tomizawa H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 10Jurk M. Heil F. Vollmer J. Schetter C. Krieg A.M. Wagner H. Lipford G. Bauer S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 499Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Imidazoquinolines have been identified that stimulate either TLR7 or TLR8, or both TLRs 7 and 8 (11Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S.S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). These compounds are only slightly different in structure, and it remains unclear how this specificity is achieved. It is likely that single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from a viral origin is the natural agonist for human TLR8 and mouse TLR7 (5Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar, 12Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford G. Wagner H. Bauer S. Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). The TLR3/7/8/9 subgroups also share a common cellular localization. Rather than being secreted to the cell surface, they are retained in intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and this subcellular localization is thought to provide specificity and to prevent activation by self-nucleic acid (13Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Studies on TLR9 activation have shown that, in the resting state, the receptor resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, there is a rapid translocation of the receptor into lysosomes. In the case of viral nucleic acid, lysosomal proteases are required for the degradation of viral capsid and therefore release the viral nucleic acid into this intracellular compartment (13Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The only structure of a TLR extracellular domain solved to date is that of TLR3. The 23 LRRs form a horseshoe-shaped solenoid substituted with a high density of N-linked glycans (15Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 16Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, one face of the LRR solenoid is free from glycosylation, and positively charged patches on this surface may associate with double-stranded RNA. There are also two inserts outside the LRR framework that extend from the non-glycosylated face of the receptor and could provide binding sites for double-stranded RNA, one in LRR12 and another in LRR20. In addition, a recent mutagenesis study has identified several cysteine and asparagine residues in the ectodomain that are required for activation of TLR3 (17de Bouteiller O. Merck E. Hasan U.A. Hubac S. Benguigui B. Trinchieri G. Bates E.E. Caux C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38133-38145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). TLR7-9 are more closely related to each other than to TLR3 and share some unusual conserved features in the extracellular domain. In particular, TLR7-9 have a 16-amino-acid insert in LRR8, a sequence that has four conserved cysteine residues, and a linker region of ∼30 amino acids at LRR14 that may subdivide the LRRs into two structurally independent blocks (18Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1A). A study (19Rutz M. Metzger J. Gellert T. Luppa P. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) with purified TLR9 extracellular domain shows specific and pH-dependent binding of DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, and a dissociation constant of 200 nm has been measured for this interaction. The binding activity was mapped to a region on the convex surface of LRR17, and this work provides evidence for direct interaction of nucleic acid-derived stimuli with TLR ectodomains. In this paper, we have studied the requirement of the cysteine-rich insert in LRR8 and an acidic residue in LRR17 for signaling by TLR8. TLR8 is unusual, as it appears to be redundant in the mouse but plays a critical role in humans. For example, it is the only TLR that is active in neonates (20Levy O. Zarember K.A. Roy R.M. Cywes C. Godowski P.J. Wessels M.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and is important for virally induced maturation of certain human dendritic cell subtypes (11Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S.S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We report here that the short insert sequence in LRR8 is critical for TLR8-mediated signaling in response to both imidazoquinolines and single-stranded RNA and that all four cysteine residues are absolutely required for function. We also show that oligonucleotides enhance signaling by human TLR8 in response to imidazoquinolines but not by TLR7. Cell Culture and Biological Reagents—Osteosarcoma (U20S) and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were from stocks maintained by GlaxoSmithKline (Stevenage, UK). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and where appropriate, penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide. U20S cells stably expressing TLR8 were produced by GlaxoSmithKline and were maintained as for untransformed U20S cells, including 500 μg/ml G418 for selection. pcDNA3hTLR8 and pcDNA3hTLR7 vectors were supplied by GlaxoSmithKline. pEYFPN1 and pECFPN1 were from Clontech. Human TLR8 isoform 2 was used (GenBank™ reference NP_61954). U20S and HEK293 cells do not endogenously express TLRs 7-9. Resiquimod was synthesized by GlaxoSmithKline. CpG DNA 2006 (stimulatory, 5′-TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT-3′ with phosphothioate linkages) and GpC 2006 (non-stimulatory, 5′-TGCTGCTTTTGTGCTTTTGTGCTT-3′ with phosphothioate linkages) were obtained from MWG Biotech. ssRNA40 (5′GCCCGUCUGUUGUGUGACUC-3′ with phosphothioate linkages) was purchased from Metabion. Bafilomycin A1 from Streptomyces griseus was purchased from Sigma. Mutagenesis—The primers used to mutate TLR8 are detailed in supplemental Fig. S1. The QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used, and two rounds of mutagenesis were performed where necessary to create all the desired mutations. Successfully mutated colonies were back-cloned into nonmutated pcDNA3 backbone. All constructs were fully sequenced to verify only the required mutation had been introduced. NF-κB Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates so as to reach ∼95% confluency after 18 h. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines. For one well, DNA mixtures of 2 μg of TLR (or empty vector), 1 μg of NF-κB-luc reporter, and 0.1 μg of pRLTK (Promega) were used. 24 h after transfection, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates and stimulated with compound. After incubation with stimulating compound for 18 h, the Dual Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase readings (created from the NF-κB promoter system) were normalized to the Renilla luciferase readings (under the control of the thymidine kinase-constitutive promoter) for the corresponding wells to correct for any variation in cell number. Thereafter, data were expressed as a fold induction of NF-κB when comparing stimulated with non-stimulated (mediumonly) wells. Means and standard deviations were obtained from quadruplicate readings. Results are from one experiment and are representative of at least three separate assays. Signaling assays were performed in U20S cells, including a stably expressing TLR8 cell line, and in HEK293 cells. Similar results were obtained in both cell types. Interleukin-1β at 50 nm was used as a positive control for NF-κB activation. When using ssRNA40 as a stimulating compound, RNA·Dotap complexes were first created using a ratio of 1 μg of RNA to 3 μl of Dotap (Roche Applied Science). Dotap was also complexed in the same way to either CpG DNA or resiquimod to see whether this delivery system enhanced NF-κB activation. Western Blotting—Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer and then centrifuged to remove debris. Samples were then run on a 4-12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Mouse anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) was used at a 1:10000 dilution as the primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary antibody and then developed using the ECL plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Fluoresence confocal microscopy was performed on the Leica TCS SP2 AOBS system or the Leica DM IRBE with two-photon titanium-sapphire laser in the Multi-Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge. Colocalization studies were performed using the blue-white ER-tracker (Invitrogen). CFP was excited at 405 nm and the emission collected at 450-490 nm. YFP was excited at 514 nm and the emission collected at 540-600 nm. Using a two-photon system, ER-tracker was excited using 808 nm and emission collected at 400-600 nm. Live cells were used for the work with ER-tracker. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min for the CFP and YFP co-localization studies. Images were generated using the Leica LCS software. Acidification Inhibitor Experiments—Experiments were performed as for the NF-κB luciferase assay. Before stimulation with the required compound, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with lysosomal acidification inhibitors. Either 10 or 100 nm bafilomycin A1 was diluted in cell culture medium. The cells were then stimulated for 18 h at 37 °C before performing the luciferase assay. The Extracellular Domain of TLR8 Contains Regions That Are Critical for NF-κB Activation upon Stimulation with Resiquimod or ssRNA—As outlined above, the TLR7/8/9 subgroups have features that may confer specificity for nucleic acid-derived stimuli (Fig. 1A). In particular, the 16-amino-acid insert in LRR8 is unlikely to be accommodated within the LRR framework (Fig. 1B) and probably forms a loop structure protruding from the convex surface of the solenoid. The consensus of the loop is CXRCXXXXXPCXXC, suggesting that the four cysteine residues and the basic arginine are of particular importance (Fig. 1C). We therefore carried out a systematic mutagenesis of these cysteine residues in TLR8 and assayed the mutant receptors for signaling activity to NF-κB in response to both resiquimod and ssRNA. We found that changing any of these four cysteine residues to alanine completely abolished signaling by TLR8 when stimulated by both resiquimod and ssRNA (Fig. 1D). Likewise, mutation of aspartate 543, a conserved residue shown previously to be important for TLR9 function, also resulted in an inactive receptor. To eliminate the possibility that the loss of function we observed was a secondary consequence of introducing unpaired cysteine residues into the structure, we generated all six combinations of double cysteine mutation and found that these were also unable to signal (Fig. 1E). In addition, mutant receptors that had either a deletion of LRRs 8-15 or all four cysteine residues changed to alanine were inactive (Fig. 1F). Wild-type and Mutant TLR8 Receptors Are Expressed at Similar Levels and Localize Predominantly to the Endoplasmic Reticulum—We next tested whether the signaling defects of the mutant receptors might be caused by misexpression or mislocalization. Full-length constructs of both wild-type TLR8 and the single cysteine mutants were prepared, fused at the C terminus with either CFP or YFP (cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins) (Fig. 2A). The tagged constructs were tested in the NF-κB assay to determine whether the activity of the receptor was retained. The tagged wild-type receptors were able to activate NF-κB upon stimulation, although at somewhat reduced levels as compared with the untagged receptor (Fig. 2B). By contrast, all four single cysteine mutants were unable to signal. Western blotting of cell lysates with an anti-GFP antibody showed that mutant and non-mutant receptors were expressed in equivalent amounts (Fig. 2C). Thus, the mutant receptors were no more sensitive to degradation than the wild-type receptor. We then examined the subcellular localization of the receptors in living HEK293 cells with fluorescent microscopy. Wild-type TLR8 visualized by fluorescence from the YFP tag is observed in the endoplasmic reticulum, as it has the same distribution as an ER-specific marker dye (Fig. 2D). The localization of the single cysteine mutant u2 is indistinguishable (Fig. 2E). Finally, cotransfection of wild-type TLR8 tagged with CFP and the Asp-543 (u5) mutant tagged with YFP confirms that the inactive mutants are expressed in the same pattern as the functional wild-type receptors (Fig. 2F). Signaling by TLR8 Is Dependent on Vesicle Acidification and Is Modulated by Oligodeoxynucleotides—Next, we tested the affect on signaling of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of v-type ATPases (21Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17707-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are required for acidification of Golgi, late endosomes, and lysosomes. We found that signaling in response to both resiquimod and ssRNA was profoundly sensitive to bafilomycin A1 treatment. We then studied the effects of co-stimulation with TLR9 agonists on the TLR8 pathway. As expected, ssRNA40 activated TLR8, whereas stimulation with either CpG or GpC DNA had no effect. However, when both ssRNA and CpG DNA were used to co-stimulate the cells, there was a 40% reduction in NF-κB activation, although this inhibition was not observed with GpC DNA (Fig. 3B). We then examined the effect on NF-κB activation of co-stimulating either TLR7- or TLR8-expressing cells with resiquimod and CpG DNA. U20S cells transiently transfected with TLR7 or TLR8 were stimulated by treatment with resiquimod and DNA oligonucleotides or combinations of the two. In the case of TLR7, as previously reported (22Beignon A.S. McKenna K. Skoberne M. Manches O. DaSilva I. Kavanagh D.G. Larsson M. Gorelick R.J. Lifson J.D. Bhardwaj N. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), there is a slight decrease in NF-κB activation upon stimulation with resiquimod and both CpG and GpC DNA (Fig. 3C). However, in the case of TLR8, stimulation with resiquimod and DNA caused an increase in signaling by both stimulatory and non-stimulatory oligonucleotides. These experiments were repeated using a stably expressing TLR8 U20S cell line with stimulation in the presence or absence of Dotap, which enhances endocytic uptake of DNA (23Yasuda K. Rutz M. Schlatter B. Metzger J. Luppa P.B. Schmitz F. Haas T. Heit A. Bauer S. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Again, there was an increase in NF-κB activation when both resiquimod and CpG DNA were used for stimulation, and this effect was enhanced when Dotap was included in the assay. Both the stimulatory and the non-stimulatory forms of DNA can cause this effect, and bafilomycin A1 abolished all signaling other than that mediated by the positive control interleukin-1. The mechanism of signaling by all Toll and Toll-like receptors is likely to involve dimerization of the ectodomains, but this is achieved in remarkably diverse ways by different stimuli. For example, Drosophila Toll is activated by a cytokine ligand, Spatzle, whereas TLR4 signals in response to lipopolysaccharide indirectly through the co-receptor protein MD-2 (24Gangloff M. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Weber A.N. Moncrieffe M.C. Gangloff M. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22793-22799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By contrast, the closely related subgroup TLR7-9 is stimulated by non-self nucleic acids or synthetic compounds structurally related to purine nucleosides and are thus likely to have related mechanisms of activation. In this paper, we have probed, using site-directed mutagenesis, the role played by two distinct sequences that are highly conserved in the TLR7/8/9 subgroups but absent in other family members. The first sequence was a short insert in LRR8 containing four cysteine residues. Bell et al. (18Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) have proposed previously that the insert is homologous to a short sequence in a cytoplasmic CpG-binding protein. However, the LRR8 insertion sequence was not identified as significantly similar to a cytoplasmic CpG-binding protein in homology searches (not shown); therefore, the significance of this similarity is unclear, especially as the extracellular cysteines of TLR8 may be oxidized to form disulfide bonds. Nevertheless, it was clear from our results that the integrity of the LRR8 loop is critical for the signaling function of TLR8, as mutating the four cysteine residues in any combination abolished the capacity of the receptor to signal. We have also shown that a second site (Asp-543) in LRR17 was critical for receptor function. This residue was conserved in TLR7-9 but not in TLR3 (see Fig. 4A). Mutation of the corresponding residue in TLR9 abolishes specific binding of the ectodomain to CpG DNA in vitro (19Rutz M. Metzger J. Gellert T. Luppa P. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We have also shown that, similar to TLR9, TLR8 is localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the case of TLR9, stimulation of dendritic cells with CpG DNA causes a profound reorganization of the ER membrane system, with projections moving out and potentially fusing with the plasma membrane (14Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). By contrast, our studies suggest that treatment of TLR8-expressing cells with resiquimod causes no gross perturbations of the ER (supplemental Fig. S2). Nevertheless, functional TLR8 must be present at some level in an acidified compartment, such as the late endosome or lysosome, as signaling is completely abolished by bafilomycin A1. The pH in the ER was ∼7.2 and was not acidified by v-type H+ATPases. On the other hand, bafilomycin A1 prevents acidification of late endosomes and lysosomes, which normally have a pH of ∼5, and the Golgi, which has a pH of 6.5 (27Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S. McCaffery J.M. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but does not affect vesicle trafficking (21Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17707-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the question of how TLR8 is trafficked into an acidified compartment. This could involve constitutive cycling of ER-derived vesicles through the Golgi from where they can be targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes. Alternatively, a mechanism similar to that proposed for TLR9 might operate in which projections of the ER are thought to fuse with the plasma membrane and then transferred receptors are internalized by endocytosis (14Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the mechanism of delivery, the amount of receptor in the late endosome or lysosome must be a small fraction of the total (Fig. 2). It is unlikely that treatment with resiquimod induces trafficking of TLR8 to lysosomes, as no difference in TLR8 localization is seen between stimulated and unstimulated cells (supplemental Fig. S2). If the amount of TLR8 in acidified compartments is low, this could explain the enhancement we observed when cells were co-stimulated with resiquimod and oligodeoxynucleotides. The level of signaling would be directly proportional to the receptor number at low concentrations of TLR8, and CpG or GpC oligonucleotides would induce transfer of the ER membrane to acidified compartments, thereby increasing the TLR8 receptor number (14Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). On the basis of our results, it is also likely that TLR8 is unable to function in the ER, as resiquimod is a neutral molecule and cell-permeable. Although it is possible that all of the receptors seen in the ER are non-functional due to misfolding, it is more likely that low pH is a necessary prerequisite for signaling to occur. Certainly, as our signaling assay was dependent on vesicle acidification, a fraction of wild-type TLR8 in the ER must have been correctly biosynthesized and trafficked to the late endosome or lysosome. The observed pH dependence of signaling could operate at two levels. First, there could be conformational changes in the receptor ectodomains, presumably involving the ionization of histidine side chains. This kind of mechanism operates in the low density lipoprotein receptor, which binds tightly to low density lipoprotein at the cell surface but releases it in the late endosome. This occurs because a histidine-rich pseudoligand in the ectodomain becomes ionized and displaces the bound low density lipoprotein (28Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could contribute to pH dependence in the case of TLR8, as there are a number histidine residues in the ectodomain, although only one (His-575 in LRR18; see Fig. 4A) is conserved between TLRs 7-9. A second possibility is that the ligands themselves are activated as a consequence of lowered pH. In this regard, it is significant that the binding of CpG DNA to the TLR9 ectodomain is strongly pH-dependent, and binding is abolished by mutation of the residue corresponding to Asp-543 in TLR9 (19Rutz M. Metzger J. Gellert T. Luppa P. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This suggests that specific binding may be dependent on the ionization state of the CpG DNA or resiquimod and ssRNA in the case of TLR8. There are a number of ionizable groups in both polynucleotides and resiquimod. For example, cytidine has a pKa of 4.2, although this value would be significantly higher when the base is substituted with phosphate in the nucleotide and polynucleotide forms. Thus, a significant fraction of the CpG DNA delivered to the lysosome would carry a positive charge but would be largely unprotonated in the cytoplasm or the ER. In a recent paper (13Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), a chimeric TLR9-TLR4 receptor has been shown to be expressed on the cell surface and to signal in response to CpG DNA, findings that appear to argue against such a mechanism. However, in those experiments, a high concentration of CpG DNA (3 μm) was used, and at the pH of the experiments, a subpopulation in the protonated form may have been sufficient to activate the surface-exposed receptor. CpG oligonucleotides are inefficiently taken up by cells, and the use of agents such as Dotap to stimulate uptake enhances signaling by up to 50-fold (23Yasuda K. Rutz M. Schlatter B. Metzger J. Luppa P.B. Schmitz F. Haas T. Heit A. Bauer S. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus the overall concentration of CpG in the endosome or lysosome is likely to be much lower than that in the culture medium, but a much higher proportion would be in the conjugate acid form because of the lower pH. In the case of the imidazoquinolines, a pKa value of 6.9 has been measured for the imidazo group of imiquimod (29Chollet J.L. Jozwiakowski M.J. Phares K.R. Reiter M.J. Roddy P.J. Schultz H.J. Ta Q.V. Tomai M.A. Pharm. Dev. Technol. 1999; 4: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 7.2 for resiquimod. 3R. J. Gibbard, P. J. Morley, and N. J. Gay, unpublished results. Thus, at pH 5, these molecules are likely to be present largely as the positively charged protonated species of the conjugate acid. In addition, resiquimod is a membrane-permeable weak base and, as such, the protonated form will accumulate in acidic compartments, in principle being 100× more concentrated in the late endosomes and lysosomes than in the ER. If the conjugate acid form of resiquimod accumulates in the acidified compartment, this would stabilize low affinity interactions and favor receptor activation. Thus, a plausible model is that activation of the TLR7-9 subgroup involves binding to negatively charged regions in the receptor ectodomain by ligands that develop a positive charge at pH 5 in the late endosome and lysosome. In fact, there are several conserved acidic residues in LRR17 and 18 in addition to Asp-543 located on both concave and convex surfaces of the solenoid (see Fig. 4A). In conclusion, our results argue that the nucleic acid-type ligands of TLR7-9 are activated by low pH and induce homodimerization of the receptor ectodomains, for example, by neutralizing surface charges and promoting hydrophobic aggregation (Fig. 4C). Alternatively, the ligands may bind to a co-receptor protein, an indirect mechanism similar to that used by TLR4 (24Gangloff M. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D).

A screen for genes that control Drosophila heart development revealed a cardiac defect in which pericardial and cardial cells dissociate, which causes loss of cardiac function and embryonic lethality. This phenotype resulted from mutations in the genes encoding HMG-CoA reductase, downstream enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, and G protein Gγ1, which is geranylgeranylated, thus representing an end point of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Our findings reveal a cardial cell–autonomous requirement of Gγ1 geranylgeranylation for heart formation and suggest the involvement of the mevalonate pathway in congenital heart disease."

https://openalex.org/W2158067905,"NRL (neural retina leucine zipper) is a key basic motif-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, which orchestrates rod photoreceptor differentiation by activating the expression of rod-specific genes. The deletion of Nrl in mice results in functional cones that are derived from rod precursors. However, signaling pathways modulating the expression or activity of NRL have not been elucidated. Here, we show that retinoic acid (RA), a diffusible factor implicated in rod development, activates the expression of NRL in serum-deprived Y79 human retinoblastoma cells and in primary cultures of rat and porcine photoreceptors. The effect of RA is mimicked by TTNPB, a RA receptor agonist, and requires new protein synthesis. DNaseI footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using bovine retinal nuclear extract demonstrate that RA response elements (RAREs) identified within the Nrl promoter bind to RA receptors. Furthermore, in transiently transfected Y79 and HEK293 cells the activity of Nrl-promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene is induced by RA, and this activation is mediated by RAREs. Our data suggest that signaling by RA via RA receptors regulates the expression of NRL, providing a framework for delineating early steps in photoreceptor cell fate determination.

The vertebrate retina is a convenient and relatively less complex model to investigate gene regulatory networks during development of the central nervous system. It consists of seven major cell types (six neurons and one glia) that are generated in a conserved histogenic order from common pool(s) of retinal progenitors (1Livesey F.J. Cepko C.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Given the multipotency of retinal progenitors, one can predict that differentiation of distinct cell types depends upon precisely timed expression of cell type-specific genes under the coordinated and combinatorial influence of signaling molecules and transcription factors (1Livesey F.J.

Similar regulatory networks are also responsible for maintaining appropriate expression levels of phototransduction proteins in adult retina (5Chen Y. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Mol.

Extrinsic factors are thought to influence the timing, ratio, and functioning of different cell types during retinal differentiation (1Livesey F.J. Cepko C.L. Nat. Rev.

The vitamin A derivative, retinoic acid (RA), is an important morphogen that acts through its receptors (RAR and RXR), which are members of steroid-thyroid hormone nuclear receptor subfamily (2Levine E.M.

RA is involved in the development of eye as well as other tissues; its deficiency causes microphthalmia and other defects (41Hyatt G.A. Schmitt E.A. Fadool J.M. Dowling J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Given the complex networks of gene regulation during photoreceptor differentiation, the mechanism(s) by which extrinsic factors influence cell type-specific gene networks are not completely understood. In this report, we have used the regulation of NRL expression as a paradigm to gain insights into signaling pathways that control photoreceptor development. Using serum-deprived Y79 human retinoblastoma cells and cultured rat and porcine photoreceptors, we show that expression of NRL is induced by serum as well as RA. We demonstrate that RA acts on the RAREs identified within the NRL promoter to induce its expression. Our studies reveal a possible regulatory mechanism by which RA influences photoreceptor differentiation and rod-specific gene expression. Reagents—Tissue culture media and serum were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Retinoic acids, growth factors, and other reagents were procured from Sigma. Stock solutions of RA and growth factors were prepared in 1% ethanol and/or dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell Culture—Y79 human retinoblastoma cells (ATCC HTB 18) and HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) were maintained in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, under standard conditions with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For serum starvation and RA treatment experiments, Y79 cells (5 × 104) were cultured in the presence or absence of the serum (same batch of serum was used in all the experiments), atRA, 9-cis-RA, cycloheximide (CHX), and 4-(E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl) benzoic acid (TTNPB) at indicated concentrations. Me2SO or ethanol was added to Y79 cells in lieu of the soluble factors as negative control. For protein synthesis inhibition experiments, Y79 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and then simultaneously treated with RA and CHX for 8 or 24 h. NRL expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. In another set of experiments, serum-starved Y79 cells were first incubated with RA alone for 8 or 24 h and then CHX was added. Cell extracts were then analyzed 24 h later for examining NRL expression by immunoblotting. Primary cultures of new-born rat retinal cells and enriched adult porcine photoreceptors were prepared according to published procedures (48Traverso V. Kinkl N. Grimm L. Sahel J. Hicks D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4550-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For newborn rat retinal cultures, rat pups were anesthetized and decapitated, the retinas dissected into CO2-independent Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and chopped into small fragments. The fragments were washed twice in Ca/Mg-free PBS and then digested in PBS containing 0.1% papain for 25 min at 37 °C. Tissue was dissociated by repeated passage through flame polished Pasteur pipettes, then seeded into tissue culture plates precoated with laminin, in Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% FBS. After 48 h, medium was changed to a chemically defined formula (Neurobasal A supplemented with B27) for a further 48 h, and then treated according to the different experiments (below). For pig photoreceptor cultures, eyes were obtained from freshly slaughtered adult pigs, the retinas removed and dissected under sterile conditions. Tissue was minced, digested with papain, and dissociated by mild mechanical trituration. Cells obtained from the first two supernatants were pooled and seeded at 5 × 105/cm2 into 6 × 35 well tissue culture plates as above. Cells were cultured as outlined above (48 h Neurobasal A/2% FBS, then 48 h Neurobasal A with B27). Experimental Treatments and Immunochemistry—After the 4-day culture period, both primary cell models were treated as follows. RA was added to test wells (1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μm, stock solution prepared in Me2SO, 10 μl/well). Negative control wells received Me2SO alone, and positive control wells were treated with Neurobasal containing 2% FBS. For immunoblotting, the medium was removed after 24 h; cells were rinsed in PBS and processed as indicated. For immunocytochemical studies, medium was removed after 24 h, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min using 0.1% Triton X-100, then preincubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% sodium azide) for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight in affinity-purified anti-NRL antiserum (1:1000 dilution), and monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody rho-4D2 (45Li A. Zhu X. Craft C.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1375-1383PubMed Google Scholar), rinsed thoroughly, and incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa594 and anti-mouse IgG-Alexa488) combined with 4,6-di-amino-phenyl-indolamine (DAPI) (all from Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 2 h. Cells were washed, mounted in PBS/glycerol, and examined under a Nikon Optiphot 2 fluorescence microscope. All images were captured using a CCD camera and transferred to a dedicated PC. The same capture parameters were used for each stain, and final panels were made using untreated images for direct comparison of staining intensities. Protein Expression Analysis—Y79 and newborn rat retinal cells were sonicated in PBS and clarified supernatant was used for further analysis. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Proteins were detected using anti-NRL polyclonal antibody as described (15Cheng H. Khanna H. Oh E.C. Hicks D. Mitton K.P. Swaroop A. Hum. Mol.

Immunoblots from three independent experiments for rat and pig retinal cultures were analyzed by densitometric scanning, and normalized to serum-supplemented control levels in each case. Statistical analysis of data were performed using the one-tailed Student's t test, with p < 0.05 accepted as level of significance.

Protoc. 2000; 5: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Solid phase DNaseI footprinting was performed as described (50Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1511-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using 100 μg of RNE, and various fragments from the upstream conserved regions of the mouse Nrl promoter were used as template. For EMSA, oligonucleotides containing the wild-type mouse Nrl promoter sequence (oligo III-2 nucleotides -726 to -686: 5′-<ACGGGGAAAAGGTGAGAGGAAGC>-3′, oligo II-1 nucleotides -469 to -427: 5′-<GCAGGGGCTGAAATGTGAGGA>-3′) or deletion of the putative RAREs (mt-Oligo III-2: 5′-<CTGAGACACCGCACGGGGAGGAAGCTGAGGGC>-3′; and mt-Oligo II-1: 5′-<GGTGAAGGTAGGGCAGTGAGGATGCTTGAAAA>-3′) were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 12% glycerol) with RNE (20 μg) and poly(dI-dC) (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, a non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide was used in molar excess of the labeled oligonucleotide. In some gel-shift experiments, antibodies were added after the incubation of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides with RNE. Samples were loaded on 7.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection of Y79 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Prior to transfection, cells were serum-starved 24 h in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), diluted to 1.5 × 105 cells in 250 μl and seeded into 24-well plates. Transfection was performed with 0.5 μg of promoter-luciferase construct and 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6. One hour after transfection, 10 μm RA or 1% ethanol was added to each well. Transfected cells were cultured for additional 24 h and harvested. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Experiments were repeated at least three times, and the luciferase activity was calculated as a fold change from the base line luciferase activity obtained in the presence of vector only. Transient transfection of HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) cells was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The wild type and mutant Nrl promoter-luciferase constructs, and pCMV-β-gal were added to the cells at a concentration of 0.1 μg and 0.05 μg, respectively. After 3 h, 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0 or 500 nm atRA was added to each well. Cells were harvested after 24 h in 100 μl of Glo lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured. Serum-deprivation of Y79 Cells—We had shown earlier that NRL is expressed in Y79 cells but not in other tested cell lines (22Swaroop A. Xu J.Z. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To generate an efficient in vitro model system to study regulation of NRL expression, we carried out serum deprivation of Y79 cells. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR failed to detect NRL transcripts within 24 h after serum deprivation (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis showed that NRL expression in Y79 cells decreased 8 h after serum depletion and was undetectable by 24 h (Fig. 1A). No cell death was detected because of serum deprivation within the time span of the experiments (data not shown). When serum was supplied to these cells, NRL expression was detectable in 2 h and completely restored within 8 h (Fig. 1B). Multiple immunoreactive bands in 29-35 kDa range represent different phosphorylated isoforms of NRL that are detected by affinity-purified anti-NRL antibody (23Swain P.K. Hicks D. Mears A.J. Apel I.J. Smith J.E. John S.K. Hendrickson A. Milam A.H. Swaroop A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36824-36830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additional bands observed in immunoblots may represent unrelated cross-reactive proteins, and their levels did not change after serum deprivation. RA Effect on NRL Expression—To identify some of the possible activators in serum, we tested the effect of a number of soluble factors on NRL expression. We detected a dose-dependent increase in NRL expression following incubation with atRA and its isomer, 9-cis RA (Fig. 2A). The effect of RA was mimicked by a RAR-specific agonist, TTNPB (Fig. 2B). Northern blot analysis of RNA from the treated cells also showed RA induction of NRL transcripts (data not shown). We then evaluated the time course of NRL induction by RA. An increase in NRL protein was observed in serum-starved Y79 cells after 8 h of incubation with atRA (Fig. 2C). A similar effect was observed with 9-cis RA (data not shown). Treatment of cells with atRA and CHX (20 μg/ml), an inhibitor of protein synthesis (51Vazquez D. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 30 (1-312): i-xPubMed Google Scholar), blocked NRL induction when both were added simultaneously (Fig. 2D). This suggests that intermediate protein synthesis is necessary for RA-mediated induction of NRL expression. However, when cells were pretreated with RA for 8 or 24 h, CHX had no detectable effect on NRL expression (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that synthesis of intermediary factors necessary for NRL induction occurs within 8 h of RA treatment. RA Stimulation of NRL Expression in Rat and Porcine Photoreceptors—To investigate the effect of RA on the expression of NRL in photoreceptors in vitro, we utilized two different culture models. Immunoblotting of proteins isolated from monolayer cultures of newborn rat retina revealed that maintenance of cells in chemically defined conditions for 24 h led to moderate but reproducible decreases in NRL expression levels, and that either re-addition of serum or increasing doses of RA increased the NRL band intensity (Fig. 3A). Only a single NRL-immunoreactive band was visible using the newborn rat retinal cells (Fig. 3A). Similar induction in NRL expression was observed using highly enriched photoreceptor cultures prepared from adult pig retina, which however showed two NRL-immunoreactive bands (Fig. 3B). In both rat and pig cultures, maximal effects were observed with 5-20 μm RA, and higher doses led to some toxicity especially in cells from new-born rat retina. Immunocytochemical studies of pig photoreceptor cultures revealed that NRL was confined to rod nuclei in all cases, and that signal was relatively strong in serum- or RA-supplemented conditions. The serum-free photoreceptor culture displayed a modest but reproducible decrease in NRL-specific signal in the nuclei, as seen in immunoblots (Fig. 3C). Expression levels in newborn rat retinal cultures were too low to be detected by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Role of RA Receptors—We next examined whether RA acts directly on the Nrl promoter. DNaseI footprinting analysis of conserved sequences upstream of the transcription start site of the mouse Nrl gene identified putative RAREs (regions III-1, III-2, and II-1), in addition to other transcription factor binding elements (Fig. 4, A and B; data not shown). Oligonucleotides encompassing these protected sequences were radiolabeled and used for EMSA analysis (Fig. 4C). We observed mobility shift of the radiolabeled oligonucleotides in the presence of bovine retinal nuclear extracts (Fig. 4D). The intensity of the shifted bands was reduced or eliminated by molar excess of the same non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, but not by a mutant oligonucleotide carrying a deletion of the putative RAREs. The shifted bands were also diminished when anti-RARα, anti-RXRα, or anti-RXRγ but not RARβ, RARγ, or RXRβ-specific antibodies were added (Fig. 4D). To investigate the functional relevance of the binding of RA receptors to the Nrl promoter, we performed transient transfection experiments in serum-deprived Y79 cells using Nrl promoter-luciferase constructs containing the 2.5-kb fragment (pGL3-Nl) as well as deletion variants encompassing the foo"

Succinate is produced by the glycosomal and mitochondrial NADH-dependent fumarate reductases, which are not essential for parasite viability. To further explore the role of the succinic fermentation pathways, we studied the trypanosome fumarases, the enzymes providing fumarate to fumarate reductases. The T. brucei genome contains two class I fumarase genes encoding cytosolic (FHc) and mitochondrial (FHm) enzymes, which account for total cellular fumarase activity as shown by RNA interference. The growth arrest of a double RNA interference mutant cell line showing no fumarase activity indicates that fumarases are essential for the parasite. Interestingly, addition of fumarate to the medium rescues the growth phenotype, indicating that fumarate is an essential intermediary metabolite of the insect stage trypanosomes. We propose that trypanosomes use fumarate as an essential electron acceptor, as exemplified by the fumarate dependence previously reported for an enzyme of the essential de novo pyrimidine synthesis (Takashima, E., Inaoka, D.

Fumarases, also called fumarate hydratases (FHs), 3The abbreviations used are: FH, fumarase or fumarate hydratase; DHOD, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FRD, NADH-dependent fumarate reductase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FHc, cytosolic fumarase; FHm, mitochondrial fumarase; DHOD, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: FH, fumarase or fumarate hydratase; DHOD, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FRD, NADH-dependent fumarate reductase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FHc, cytosolic fumarase; FHm, mitochondrial fumarase; DHOD, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. are ubiquitous enzymes, which catalyze the stereospecific reversible hydration of fumarate to malate. Most prokaryotes and eukaryotes express two isoforms of fumarases. In eukaryotes, the mitochondrial isoform performs this reaction as part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and as such is central to aerobic respiration. The cytosolic isoform, as exemplified by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is thought to be involved in the metabolism of fumarate, which is produced in the cytosol by a number of reactions (1Pines O. Even-Ram S. Elnathan N. Battat E. Aharonov O. Gibson D. Goldberg I. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 393-399PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct classes of fumarases, class I and class II, have been so far identified, with no obvious amino acid sequence homology, although they both belong to a superfamily of metabolic enzymes that are functionally related (2Williams S.E.

They occur in several bacteria (5Guest J.R. Miles J.S. Roberts R.E. Woods S.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 2971-2984PubMed Google Scholar) and in eukaryotes, such as fungi (6Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J.

In contrast, class I fumarases (including similar fumA and fumB enzymes) are homodimeric, thermolabile, iron-sulfur-containing enzymes of ∼120 kDa. Class I fumarases occur primarily in bacteria, including Escherichia coli (9Woods S.A. Schwartzbach S.D. Guest J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and are also present in a few unicellular eukaryotes. The so far available data about eukaryotic class I fumarases are restricted to sequencing projects. Here, we analyzed the metabolic role(s) of both class I fumarase isoforms expressed in Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite belonging to the trypanosomatid family. Several trypanosomatid species cause serious diseases in humans such as sleeping sickness (T. brucei), Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.) (10Barrett M.P.

Among these species, T. brucei has become the favorite model to study metabolism and other processes shared with other trypanosomatid species. Indeed, RNA interference (RNAi) has been developed in a very powerful reverse genetic tool for T. brucei, by allowing this parasite to inhibit specifically the expression of a target gene (15Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), but it failed to be functional in T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. (16DaRocha W.D. Otsu K. Teixeira S.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 133: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). T. brucei differentiates into several adaptative forms during its life cycle: the bloodstream forms in the mammalian host and the procyclic form in the midgut of the tsetse fly vector. Both can easily be kept in axenic cell culture and genetically manipulated. All trypanosomatids analyzed so far are characterized by aerobic fermentation of glucose, with excretion of partially oxidized end products (18Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., 1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 19Cazzulo J.J.

Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 185-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The energy metabolism of the T. brucei bloodstream forms is unique among trypanosomatids. Indeed, they rely entirely on glycolysis (which takes place in glycosomes, peroxisome-like organelles) with pyruvate as the main excreted end product, although the mitochondrion plays a minor role (18Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., 1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 23Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other adaptative forms of trypanosomatids, exemplified by the T. brucei procyclic form, have a more elaborate energy metabolism, with several excreted end products, such as succinate, acetate, and lactate (21Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Kinetoplastid. Biol. Dis. 2003; 2: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Besteiro S. Barrett M.P. Riviere L. Bringaud F. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 185-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The T. brucei procyclic form contains a functional mitochondrial electron-transport chain that allows the generation of a proton gradient used for several cellular processes, including ATP generation by the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation). However, oxidative phosphorylation is not essential when glucose is the major carbon source and most of the required ATP synthesis is provided by substrate level phosphorylation (24Bochud-Allemann N.

Interestingly, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not used as a bona fide cycle, i.e. to convert acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide, although all the enzymes of the cycle are expressed in the procyclic form grown in glucose-rich medium (27van Weelden S.W.

About half of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) produced in the cytosol re-enters the glycosomes to be converted into malate by PEP carboxykinase and malate dehydrogenase. Malate is then converted into succinate by fumarases and NADH-dependent fumarate reductases (FRD). Approximately two-thirds of the succinate is produced in the glycosomes by a glycosomal FRD isoform (FRDg) (30Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol.

To further study these unusual succinic fermentation pathways, we determined the subcellular location of the fumarases expressed in the procyclic trypanosomes and analyzed glucose metabolism and growth phenotypes of fumarase mutants. Trypanosome and Glycosome Preparation—The procyclic form of T. brucei EATRO1125 was cultured at 27 °C in SDM79 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 3.5 mg ml–1 hemin (33Brun R.

Glycosomes were purified by isopycnic centrifugation from the procyclic (EATRO1125) form of T. brucei as described (35Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Spits H. Eur. J.

Briefly, PCR-amplified 531- or 588-bp fragments containing the antisense FHc or FHm sequences (458 or 492 bp of targeted sequence, plus 40 or 72 bp used as a spacer to form the loop between the annealing sense and antisense sequences, respectively) and the restriction sites added to the primers were inserted in the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew100 plasmid. Then a PCR-amplified 525- or 482-bp fragment containing the sense FHc or FHm sequences was inserted, upstream of the antisense sequence, using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (XhoI was introduced at the 3′ extremity of the antisense PCR fragment). To target the FHm and FHc genes simultaneously, we produced by overlapping PCR chimerical sense and antisense molecules composed of the DNA fragments used to target FHm and FHc. For the chimeric sense molecule, we generated by PCR an FHm-S fragment flanked by HindIII (5′-end) and the first 20 bp of the FHc-S fragment (3′-end), and an FHc-S fragment flanked by the first 20 bp of the FHm-S fragment (5′-end) and XhoI (3′-end). Then, the sense chimeric fragment was produced by overlapping PCR, with the same 5′ and 3′ primers as used to PCR amplify the FHm-S and FHc-S fragments, respectively, and as templates the gel-purified FHm-S and FHc-S fragments. The resulting 974-bp PCR fragment is composed of the FHm fragment (458 bp) followed by the FHc fragment (492 bp) and flanked by the HindIII (5′-end) and XhoI (3′-end) restriction sites. We used the same approach to generate the chimeric antisense molecule, which is composed of the FHc-AS fragment containing a 72-bp extension as compared with the FHc-S fragment (spacer between the sense and antisense chimeric sequences) followed by the FHm-AS fragment (458 bp) and flanked by the HindIII and XhoI (5′-end) and BamHI (3′-end) restriction sites. The HindIII/BamHI-digested chimeric antisense fragment was inserted in the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew100 plasmid. Then, the HindIII/XhoI-digested chimeric sense fragment was inserted, upstream of the chimeric antisense sequence, in the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of the recombinant pLew100 plasmid. The HindIII/BamHI-digested chimeric sense/antisense cassette, extracted from the recombinant pLew100 plasmid, was inserted in HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the p2T7Ti-177 vector (kindly provided by B. Wickstead and K. Gull) (40Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids (pLew-FHc-SAS, pLew-FHm-SAS, pLew-FHc/m-SAS, and p2T7Ti-177-FHc/m-SAS containing the chimeric construct) have a sense and antisense version of the targeted gene fragment(s), separated by a 40- or 72-bp fragment, under the control of the PARP promoter linked to a prokaryotic tetracycline operator (pLew100) or under the control of two opposing tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters (p2T7Ti-177). The EATRO1125 procyclic form cell line (EATRO1125.T7T), constitutively expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gene and the tetracycline repressor under the dependence of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter for inducible control by tetracycline (38Bringaud F.

Trypanosome transfection and selection of phleomycin-resistant clones were performed as previously reported (41Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of EGFP-tagged FH in Trypanosomes—The pLew79 expression vector was used to produce recombinant FH proteins tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) optimized for fluorescence and expression in mammalian cells. The EGFP gene, preceded by a multicloning site (HindIII, BclI, XhoI, AgeI, HpaI, MluI, XbaI, and NdeI) (32Coustou V. Besteiro S. Riviere L. Biran M. Biteau N. Franconi J.M. Boshart M. Baltz T.

Then, PCR fragments corresponding to the first 390 amino acids of FHm (pLew-FHm-1/390.EGFP), the same region deleted for the N-terminal 12 residues (pLew-FHm-13/390.EGFP) and the first 333 amino acids of FHc (pLew-FHc-1/333.EGFP) were inserted between the XhoI (or HindIII) and XbaI restriction sites of the pLew-EGFP1 plasmid. In addition, a PCR fragment corresponding to the last 282 amino acids of FHc (pLew-FHc-284/565.EGFP) was inserted between the XhoI and XbaI restriction sites of the pLew-EGFP2 plasmid. The recombinant plasmids were introduced in the EATRO1125.T7T cell line, as described above. Production of FH Antibodies—Recombinant fragments, corresponding to the first 400 amino acids of FHc or FHm preceded by a N-terminal histidine tag (6 histidine codons were introduced in the 5′ primer), were expressed in the E. coli BL21, using the pET3a expression vector (Novagen). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and recombinant proteins were purified by nickel chelation chromatography (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antisera were raised in rabbits or mice by three injections at 15-day intervals of 200 or 50 mg, respectively, of FHc-His or FHm-His recombinant nickel-purified proteins, electroeluted after separation on SDS-PAGE, and emulsified with complete (first injection) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The specificity of the produced immune sera was assayed against both FH recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli, by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Western Blot Analyses—Total protein extracts of wild type or mutant procyclic form or bloodstream form T. brucei (107 cells) were size fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and immunoblotted on Immobilon-P filters (Millipore) (42Harlow E.

Together with other bilins such as phycocyanobilin it serves as a light-harvesting pigment in the photosynthetic light-harvesting structures of cyanobacteria called phycobilisomes. The biosynthesis of both pigments starts with the cleavage of heme by heme oxygenases to yield biliverdin IXα, which is further reduced at specific positions by ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs), a new family of radical enzymes. The biosynthesis of phycoerythrobilin requires two subsequent two-electron reductions, each step being catalyzed by one FDBR. This is in contrast to the biosynthesis of phycocyanobilin, where the FDBR phycocyanobilin: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA) catalyzes a four-electron reduction. The first reaction in phycoerythrobilin biosynthesis is the reduction of the 15,16-double bond of biliverdin IXα by 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebA). This reaction reduces the conjugated π -electron system thereby blue-shifting the absorbance properties of the linear tetrapyrrole. The second FDBR, phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebB), then reduces the A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene structure of 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin to yield phycoerythrobilin. Both FDBRs from the limnic filamentous cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon and the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.

By using various natural bilins, the substrate specificity of each FDBR was established, revealing conformational preconditions for their unique specificity.

A combination of substrate/product binding analyses and gel permeation chromatography revealed evidence for metabolic channeling. Phycobilins are linear tetrapyrrole molecules that are important cofactors of the photoreceptor phytochrome and the cyanobacterial light-harvesting phycobiliproteins. One of the major pigments found in the phycobilisomes of certain cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptomonads is phycoerythrobilin (PEB). 3The abbreviations used are: PEB, phycoerythrobilin; BV, biliverdin IXα; DHBV, 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin; FDBR, ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase; Fredi, Fremyella diplosiphon; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PCB, phycocyanobilin; PcyA, phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PE, phycoerythrin; PebA, 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PebB, phycoerythrobilin: ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PΦB, phytochromobilin; Synpy, Synechococcus sp.

In these organisms PEB is covalently linked to the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin (PE), a major constituent of the light-harvesting structures called phycobilisomes. These structures allow the organisms to efficiently absorb light in regions of the visible spectrum that are poorly covered by chlorophylls. Through resonance energy transfer the absorbed light energy is transferred to the photosynthetic reaction centers in the membrane. Freshwater cyanobacteria of the genus Calothrix (Fremyella) are able to adapt their phycobiliprotein composition within the phycobilisome in response to different light conditions. In a process called complementary chromatic adaptation the organisms are able to adjust the quantities of phycocyanin and PE for maximal light harvesting efficiency. Not only is the synthesis of apophycobiliproteins and linker proteins regulated by light, but also the biosynthesis of the enzymes required for PEB synthesis. It has been demonstrated that the expression of the genes pebA and pebB encoding ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs) in Fremyella diplosiphon (Calothrix or Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7601) is up-regulated by green light, as is the expression of the cpeBA genes encoding the α- and β-subunits of PE (1Alvey R.M. Karty J.A. Roos E. Reilly J.P. Kehoe D.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2448-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, marine cyanobacteria of the Synechococcus group are able to regulate phycourobilin to PEB ratios by adjusting the expression of phycoerythrins with different phycourobilin content, PE(I) and PE(II) (2Palenik B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), or, as recently suggested, by lyases that mediate PEB isomerization on the phycobiliproteins (3Everroad C. Six C. Partensky F. Thomas J.C. Holtzendorff J. Wood A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because these organisms retain a fixed phycocyanin:PE ratio (4Waterbury J.B. Watson S.W. Valois F.W. Franks D.G. Can. Bull. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 1986; 214: 71-120Google Scholar), they are not considered as classical chromatic adapters. The biosynthesis of phycobilins proceeds via the heme biosynthetic pathway. The final product, heme, is cleaved by heme oxygenases to yield biliverdin IXα (BV), which is subsequently further reduced by a family of FDBRs (Fig. 1). These enzymes are characterized by a distinct double bond regiospecificity resulting in bilins with a wide variety of spectroscopic properties. Synthesis of phytochromobilin (PΦB), the chromophore of plant phytochromes, is catalyzed by phytochromobilin synthase (HY2) through a formal two-electron reduction at the A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene structure. Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA) catalyzes the four-electron reduction of BV to phycocyanobilin (PCB), the chromophore of certain cyanobacterial phytochromes and one of the major light-harvesting pigments in cyanobacterial phycobilisomes. PcyA is the best described member of the FDBR family. It mediates two subsequent electron reductions at both vinyl groups of BV (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this reaction 181,182-dihydrobiliverdin is a visible semi-reduced intermediate. Because no metal or organic cofactors could be detected in the FDBR family, a radical mechanism for PcyA was postulated (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Evidence for the appearance of an intermediate substrate radical was recently demonstrated by absorbance and EPR spectroscopy (6Tu S.L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Structural information to this new family of enzymes has recently been added through the solved crystal structure of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 PcyA (7Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to the PcyA-catalyzed reaction the biosynthesis of PEB (which is an isomer of PCB) requires two independent enzymes, each catalyzing a two-electron reduction. 15,16-Dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebA) reduces the C-15 methine bridge of BV and phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebB) the A-ring diene structure of 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin (DHBV), respectively. The biosynthesis of phycourobilin still remains unknown, but it might proceed analogously to the PecE/F isomerase/lyase activity of Mastigocladus laminosus, which covalently attaches and isomerizes PCB to yield bound phycoviolobilin (8Storf M.

Here we present the biochemical characterization of recombinant PebA and PebB from the filamentous freshwater cyanobacterium, F. diplosiphon, and the unicellular marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.

The forward and reverse primers were: 5′-GGAATTCGATCTATAAGTGCTTCCTTGAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTATTTGGCTACAACAGTTGCTAATG-3′ for pebA; and 5′-GGAATTCGATCCGGAGCGAAGCGAAGTTG-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGTTATTTGATAGCTGATGTGAGCTTTC-3′ for pebB (the underlined bases indicate the EcoRI, XhoI, or PstI sites).

Production and Purification of Recombinant PebA and PebB—For production of recombinant PebAFredi, PebASynpy, and PebBSynpy, 2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated at 1:100 from an overnight culture of BL21(λDE3) carrying the respective plasmid construct and cultivated at 37 °C to an A578 nm ∼ 0.6–0.8. After a temperature shift to 17 °C, protein expression was induced by adding 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were cultured for a further 15 h at 180 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0,05% Triton X-100), and disrupted by passage through a French press cell at 20,000 p.s.i. After ultracentrifugation for 50 min at 170,000 × g the supernatant was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose™ 4FF column. Washing and elution were done according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Protein-containing fractions were cleaved with 2 units of PreScission™ protease/mg of protein in the recommended cleavage buffer. Cleavage led to an additional eight amino acid residues on the N termini of the proteins, and the first amino acid was changed from Met to Ile. A second glutathione-Sepharose column was used to separate the GST tag from the protein. The protein solutions were dialyzed against reaction buffer (25 mm TES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl). If indicated, an additional purification step was performed using gel permeation chromatography on a High Load™ 26/60 Superdex™ 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were concentrated using a stirred ultrafiltration cell with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 and stored up to 3 days on ice. Production of recombinant PebBFredi was induced using anhydrotetracycline (200 μg/ml). Cultivation conditions (i.e. medium, temperature) were identical to those described above. Purification was done on a Strep-Tactin-Sepharose® column as recommended by the manufacturer. Strep-tagged PebBFredi is N-terminally extended by 20 additional amino acids (Strep-tag® II). Purification of Recombinant Reductants—The DNA sequence of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 ferredoxin (petF) was amplified from the plasmid pSe280fd (obtained from D. Bryant) using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-GGAATTCGATCGCTACATATAAGGTTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTAGTAGAGTTCTTCCTCTTT-3′ (the underlined sequences indicate the EcoRI or XhoI sites). The PCR product was ligated to pGEX-6P-3. Expression was done in NZCYM medium as described elsewhere (11Schluchter W.M. The Characterization of Photosystem I and Ferredoxin-NADP+-Oxidoreductase in the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Pennsylvania State University, 1994Google Scholar), and protein production was induced using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A578 nm of 0.6–0.8. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction. Purification was done with two sequential glutathione-Sepharose columns as described for the bilin reductases. The employed cleavage buffer was free of dithiothreitol and EDTA. Determination of Protein and Bilin Concentrations—Concentrations of the bilin reductases were determined using the calculated molar extinction coefficient (ϵ280 nm) (12Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5044) Google Scholar). The concentration of recombinantly produced ferredoxin from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was determined using an ϵ420 nm of 9.7 mm–1 cm–1 (13Shin M. Oshino R. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Concentration of BV IXα was calculated using an ϵ376 nm of 68.6 mm–1 cm–1 and an ϵ698 nm of 32.6 mm–1 cm–1 in 2.5% HCl-MeOH (14Heirwegh K.P. Blanckaert N. Van Hees G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentration of 3E-PEB was determined using ϵ326 nm 15.8 mm–1 cm–1 and ϵ591 nm 25.2 mm–1 cm–1 in 5% HCL-MeOH (15Cole W.J. Chapman D.J. Siegelman H.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5976-5977Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The concentration of DHBV was determined by measuring the absorbance at the 561-nm maximum in 5% HCl-MeOH and using the long wavelength extinction coefficient of 3E-PEB for calculation. All concentrations were determined using a Ultrospec 2000 UV-visible spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). Bilin Reductase Activity Assay—Assays for bilin reductase activity were done as described previously with small modifications (10Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The standard assays contained 1.5 μm bilin reductase, 5 μm bilin substrate, and 4.8 μm recombinantly produced Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 ferredoxin or the alternative ferredoxins in reaction buffer. The assays were incubated for 15–30 min at 30 °C in the dark. Bilins were isolated using C18 Sep-Pak columns (Waters) and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. For spectrometric detection of electron transfer activity, the assay was performed using 10 μm PebAFredi, 10 μm BV, 40 μm NADP+, and 0.0125 units/ml ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase. Preparative Production of 15,16-Dihydrobiliverdin—Larger quantities of DHBV were produced enzymatically by setting up a 10-ml bilin reductase activity assay containing 20 μm BV, 5 μm PebAFredi, and 4.8 μm Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 ferredoxin in reaction buffer at 30 °C. The reaction progress was monitored by measuring absorbance spectra at different time points during the reaction. If no further substrate conversion was observed, the reaction was stopped immediately by adding 40 ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and cooling on ice. A C18 Sep-Pak light column was preconditioned with sequential washes of CH3CN, H2O, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and 10% (v/v) MeOH in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The bilin was loaded on the column washed with 6 ml 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 6 ml of 20% MeOH in trifluoroacetic acid, eluted with CH3CN, and dried in vacuo. The purity of produced DHBV was controlled by HPLC for contamination by other bilins. Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopic Analysis—All protein solutions used for binding site saturation experiments were checked for homogeneity with analytical gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column. Protein solutions were adjusted to concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 18 μm; substrate and product complexes were formed by incubating the protein solution with a 4 μm final concentration of the bilin (5–10 μl of stock solution) for 20 min on ice in the dark. All fluorescence measurements were performed under physiological conditions in reaction buffer using an Aminco Bowman AB2 spectrofluorimeter at a constant temperature of 20 °C. The excitation/emission wavelengths used were 590 nm/610 nm for PebA·DHBV, 605 nm/645 nm for PebB·DHBV, and 545 nm/630 nm for PebB·3E-PEB. Both excitation and emission slit widths were set at 4 nm, and the scan speed was 2.5 nm/s. Determination of binding constants of substrate/product to the enzymes was done according to Clarke (16Clarke A.R. Engel P.C. Enzymology Labfax. Academic Press, London1995: 191-221Google Scholar). Binding curves were measured by the increase of fluorescence intensities, as the bilin·enzyme complex is formed at equilibrium. Obtained data were analyzed using Sigma Plot 9.0 (Systat Software Inc.), and data were fitted against Equation 1.F=Fmax×[enzyme](Kd+[enzyme])(Eq. 1) Time-dependent absorbance measurements (Fig. 4) were performed in a stirred cell tempered to 30 °C on an Agilent Technologies 8453 spectrophotometer with ChemStation biochemical analysis software. Absorbance spectra (Fig. 5) were measured using a Lambda 2 UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).FIGURE 5Spectroscopic properties of bilins and enzyme·bilin complexes.

Formation of enzyme·bilin complexes caused intensive changes in absorbance properties of the bilins. The shoulder at ∼430 nm in the DHBV spectra (B) is possibly an indication of non-enzymatic rubin-like degradation products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HPLC-Analysis—Bilin reaction products were analyzed as described previously (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Gel Permeation Chromatography of Enzyme·Bilin Complexes—Enzyme·bilin complexes were formed by incubating protein solution with approximately double the molar concentration of bilin for 3 min at 30 °C. The complex was purified by passing it through a NAP™-5 column (GE Healthcare) prior to analytical gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column. During isocratic elution, absorbance was simultaneously detected at 280, 585, and 605 nm using the UV-900 detector of the ÄKTApurifier system (GE Healthcare). Recombinant Production and Purification of FDBRs—PebA of the filamentous freshwater cyanobacterium F. diplosiphon and also PebA and PebB of the coccoid marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH8020 were expressed using a tac promoter-driven N-terminal GST fusion protein. A protocol using overnight proteolytic cleavage of the affinity-purified GST fusion protein followed by a second affinity chromatography to remove GST tag and protease led to the best results. This purification strategy led to less than 10% impurity (Fig. 2). Prior to all quantitative experiments, a third purification step using gel permeation chromatography was performed to remove possibly aggregated enzyme. N-terminal sequencing of PebAFredi by Edman degradation revealed no GST or other protein contamination after this purification step, and the yields of this method varied, depending on the enzyme, between 3 and 7 mg/liter cell culture. The best results for PebBFredi purification were achieved with tet promoter-driven expression followed by single-step purification of the Strep-tagged enzyme (Fig. 2). This procedure yielded about 1 mg/liter cell culture. Activity of the Recombinant Enzymes—To verify the activity of the purified bilin reductases, we used an in vitro assay system as described previously with an excess of reductant (10Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The optimal pH value for PebAFredi activity was determined to be pH 7.5, and therefore all further assays were performed at this pH. As expected, both PebAs were found to convert BV to DHBV (Fig. 3). The reduction of the 15,16-double bond of BV is accompanied by obvious blue-shifts of the absorption that enabled us to monitor the in vitro reaction progress spectroscopically (shown in Fig. 4). The analyzed PebBs catalyzed the reduction of the A-ring diene system of DHBV to PEB, which may likely be a 2,3-reduction, followed by isomerization to 3Z-PEB, which is the supposed natural chromophore of PE. The overall reaction can be followed by HPLC in an assay mixture containing BV, PebA, and PebB at once (Fig. 3) or individually using BV as a substrate for PebA or purified DHBV as substrate for PebB (data not shown) to confirm the specific catalytic activity for both enzymes. The appearance of the energetically stable 3E-PEB may be a result of the bilin extraction procedure as described previously (10Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In our assay system both reactions were found to be most efficient using plant type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins of Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 or S. oleacera as redox partners followed by the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from P. umbilicalis; only marginal activity could be detected using [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from C. pasteurianum. These results are in good agreement with results obtained for PcyA of Anabaena sp. PCC7120 (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and for phytochromobilin synthase of Avena sativa (17McDowell M.T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consistent with PcyA is the insensitivity of PebAFredi toward metal chelators like EDTA (10 μm), o-phenanthroline (5 μm), or 2,2′-dipyridyl (5 μm), indicating no involvement of protein-associated metal ion cofactors during catalysis (data not shown) (5Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Reoxidation of 15,16-DHBV—The PebA-catalyzed reduction of BV to DHBV was found to be reversible. Incubation of a preformed complex of PebA and DHBV for 3–6 days on ice in the dark led to a visible transformation of the color from pink to green, the result of a back-oxidation of DHBV to BV, which was confirmed by HPLC (data not shown). This back-oxidation was slower under low oxygen conditions; a control experiment with carbonic anhydrase instead of PebA in the solution resulted in much lower DHBV reoxidation, indicating that this reaction is accelerated in the presence of PebA. Substrate Specificity of FDBRs—To analyze the substrate specificities of the various FDBRs we examined different natural bilins (Table 1). In our standard HPLC assay system, we did not find 3E-PCB to be converted by PebA, indicating that a lack of A- and D-ring vinyl moieties, together with a changed geometry of the A-ring ethylidene group, prevents recognition of 3E-PCB as substrate. DHBV was not converted by PcyA, demonstrating that the reduction of the 15,16-double bond causes structural difference in the bilin, which likely prevents proper placement of the bilin in the active site pocket. Interestingly, we found that PebA was able to reduce the plant bilin PΦB to PEB, indicating that an A-ring ethylidene group instead of an A-ring vinyl group is not critical for substrate recognition by PebA.TABLE 1Substrate specificity of FDBRs from cyanobacteriaBilin substrateFDBRPebAPebBPcyABV IXαDHBVNMaNM, not metabolized.3E-/3Z-PCBDHBVNM3E-/3Z-PEBNM3E-PCBNMNMNM3E-/3Z-PΦB3E-/3Z-PEBbThe substrate used in the assay was the product of the HY2 reaction, which yields the 3E- and 3Z-isomers of PΦB.NMNM/3E-/3Z-PCBcOnly 3Z-PΦB is metabolized (5).181182-DHBVNDdND, not determined.NM3E-/3Z-PCBa NM, not metabolized.b The substrate used in the assay was the product of the HY2 reaction, which yields the 3E- and 3Z-isomers of PΦB.c Only 3Z-PΦB is metabolized (5Frankenberg N.

Open table in a new tab Spectroscopic Properties of FDBR Complexes with Their Substrates or Products—All tested bilins incubated with PebA or PebB displayed distinct spectroscopic properties differing from those of the free pigments (Fig. 5). Not only were the absorbance maxima shifted, but also the peak intensities and the ratio of the long wavelength absorbance peak and the near UV absorbance peak intensities (λmax2/λmax1) changed (Table 2). Interestingly, the protein environment of PebA and PebB influences the spectral properties of one and the same bilin, indicating differences in the bilin binding pocket of both FDBRs. BV binding to PebA causes an increase in absorbance compared with free BV, with a shifted long wavelength absorbance maximum from 681 to 691 nm. Bound to PebB, the absorbance maximum is less intensely increased, but the long wavelength absorbance maximum is shifted from 681 to 706 nm. Consequently, the ratio of λmax2/λmax1 did not change notably, and lies between 0.3 for BV and 0.52 for PebA·BV (Fig. 5A and Table 2). Spectral analyses of complexes of the semi-reduced intermediate DHBV with PebA (enzyme·product complex) and PebB (enzyme·substrate complex) revealed noticeable differences. DHBV binding to PebA led to an absorbance increase at both maxima and to a shift from 565 to 590 nm for λmax2. Binding to PebB shifted the λmax2 to 605 nm and decreased the λmax1 absorbance, thereby changing the color of the complex from pink to blue. The λmax2/λmax1 ratio was changed from 0.63 (free DHBV) to 0.97 (PebA·DHBV) and 1.36 (PebB·DHBV) (Fig. 5B and Table 2). The binding of 3E-PEB to PebB led to an increased absorbance at the long wavelength absorbance"
https://openalex.org/W1989774093,"Among the few regulatory events in the minimal bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the phosphorylation of the HPr phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system. In the presence of glycerol, HPr is phosphorylated in an ATP-dependent manner by the HPr kinase/phosphorylase. The role of the latter enzyme was studied by constructing a M. pneumoniae hprK mutant defective in HPr kinase/phosphorylase. This mutant strain no longer exhibited HPr kinase activity but, surprisingly, still had phosphatase activity toward serine-phosphorylated HPr (HPr(Ser-P)). An inspection of the genome sequence revealed the presence of a gene (prpC) encoding a presumptive protein serine/threonine phosphatase of the PP2C family. The phosphatase PrpC was purified and its biochemical activity in HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation demonstrated. Moreover, a prpC mutant strain was isolated and found to be impaired in HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation. Homologues of PrpC are present in many bacteria possessing HPr(Ser-P), suggesting that PrpC may play an important role in adjusting the cellular HPr phosphorylation state and thus controlling the diverse regulatory functions exerted by the different forms of HPr.

Bacteria possess highly sophisticated signal transduction systems to survey the nutrient supply in their environment and to respond appropriately. For carbon metabolism, the phosphotransferase system (PTS) 3The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphotransferase system; PNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. has functions comparable with a central processing unit in many bacteria. Small PTS proteins that can be reversibly phosphorylated and specifically interact with a plethora of partners in their different modifications states are of crucial importance (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson J.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PTS is composed of two general proteins, enzyme I and HPr, and a set of sugar-specific permeases. The primary function of the system is the uptake of sugars coupled to their phosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is derived from phosphoenolpyruvate and is transferred via enzyme I, HPr, and the sugar-specific permease to the incoming sugar (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson J.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its function in carbohydrate transport, the PTS is one of the major regulatory systems in many bacteria. This is because of the different phosphorylation state of PTS proteins in the presence or absence of sugars. In Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, the IIA domain of the glucose permease is the key player in signal transduction mediating either inducer exclusion or the stimulation of cyclic AMP synthesis. In contrast, in Gram-positive bacteria with a low GC content in their chromosomal DNA (i.e. the Firmicutes) as well as in spirochetes and many proteobacteria, the HPr protein plays the central role in the regulation of carbon metabolism (2Stülke J. Schmalisch M. Topics Curr. Genet. 2004; 9: 179-205Crossref Google Scholar). In the Firmicutes, including Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HPr is not only phosphorylated in a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent manner on His-15 but is also subject to a regulatory phosphorylation by the metabolite-controlled HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) on Ser-46. Although HPr(His∼P) is required for sugar transport, both HPr(His∼P) and HPr(Ser-P) play distinct roles in the regulation of carbon metabolism and virulence. HPr(His∼P) can phosphorylate several transcription regulators and enzymes, thereby stimulating their activity (3Stülke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 4Darbon E. Servant P. Poncet S. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, HPr(His∼P) seems to be required for the activity of the L. monocytogenes virulence transcription factor PrfA (5Herro R. Poncet S. Cossart P. Buchrieser C. Gouin E. Glaser P. Deutscher J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 9: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HPr(Ser-P) serves as a cofactor for the pleiotropic transcription factor CcpA that mediates carbon catabolite repression and activation in the Firmicutes (6Deutscher J. Küster E. Bergstedt U. Charrier V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Schumacher M.A. Allen G.S. Diel M. Seidel G. Hillen W. Brennan R.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of HPr depends on the nutrient supply of the bacteria. In the absence of glucose, free HPr and HPr(His∼P) are present in the cells. In contrast, a significant portion of HPr is phosphorylated on Ser-46 when the bacteria grow in the presence of glucose (8Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Ludwig H. Rebhan N. Blencke H.M. Merzbacher M. Stülke J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the two phosphorylation events are mutually exclusive. Once formed, HPr(His∼P) can be dephosphorylated by the transfer of the phosphate group back to enzyme I, to any of a large set of sugar permeases, or to one of the regulatory protein targets. In contrast, HPr(Ser-P) can only be dephosphorylated by the action of the HPr kinase itself, which also exhibits a phosphorylase activity, depending on the presence or absence of easily metabolizable carbon sources. In contrast to the more common protein phosphatases, the phosphorylase transfers the phosphate group to an inorganic phosphate, thus generating pyrophosphate (10Reizer J. Hoischen C. Titgemeyer F.

We are interested in the regulatory mechanisms of carbon metabolism in M. pneumoniae. These pathogenic bacteria are characterized by their extremely reduced genomes with only a handful of regulatory proteins (12Himmelreich R. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Pirkl E. Li B.C. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4420-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Projects to create artificial life, the so-called minimal genome concept, did recently attract much scientific interest to the investigation of Mycoplasma genitalium, M. pneumoniae and other related cell wall-less bacteria collectively called Mollicutes (13Glass J.I. Assad-Garcia N. Alperovich N. Yooseph S. Lewis M.R. Maruf M. Hutchinson C.A. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). One of the few regulatory proteins of M. pneumoniae is the HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) encoded by the hprK gene (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unlike its homologue from B. subtilis, which exhibits kinase activity only in the presence of high ATP concentrations or when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is present, the M. pneumoniae enzyme is active as a kinase at very low ATP concentrations because of its high affinity for ATP (15Merzbacher M. Detsch C. Hillen W. Stülke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This feature may reflect the adaptation of M. pneumoniae to nutrient-rich human mucosal surfaces (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The structure of the M. pneumoniae HPrK/P has been elucidated (Protein Data Bank code 1KNX); however, the reason for the different control of activities as compared with the homologous enzymes from other organisms has so far remained obscure (16Allen G.S. Steinhauer K. Hillen W. Stülke J. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Nessler S. Fieulaine S. Poncet S. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Janin J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Assays of in vivo HPr phosphorylation have revealed that HPr is phosphorylated on His-15 but not on Ser-46 when the bacteria grows with glucose or fructose. HPr(Ser-P) was detectable only in the presence of glycerol (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This finding is in contrast to the previous biochemical analysis of M. pneumoniae HPrK/P and still awaits an explanation. Moreover, a substantial portion of HPr is doubly phosphorylated in the presence of glycerol, suggesting distinct interaction properties of the proteins involved in HPr phosphorylation (19Halbedel S. Stülke J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 247: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The genetic analysis of M. pneumoniae is hampered by the lack of a genetic system. Transposons have been used to obtain mutants (13Glass J.I. Assad-Garcia N. Alperovich N. Yooseph S. Lewis M.R. Maruf M. Hutchinson C.A. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4343-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, it has so far not been possible to isolate any predetermined desired mutant strains. In this work, we have described a simple screen for the isolation of M. pneumoniae mutants. The analysis of an hprK mutant revealed the presence of an additional enzyme involved in the dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P). The corresponding gene prpC (MPN247) was identified, and the activity of the encoded protein phosphatase was proven in vitro and in vivo. Bacterial Strains, Oligonucleotides, and Growth Conditions— E. coli DH5α was used for overexpression of recombinant proteins. The cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μgml-1). The M. pneumoniae strains used in this study were M. pneumoniae M129 (American Type Culture Collection 29342) in the 33rd broth passage and its isogenic mutant derivatives GPM51 (hprK::mini-Tn, GmR) and GPM68 (prpC::mini-Tn, GmR). The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. M. pneumoniae was grown at 37 °C in 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks containing 100 ml of modified Hayflick medium as described previously (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Carbon sources were added as indicated. Strains harboring transposon insertions were cultivated in the presence of 80 μg/ml gentamicin.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′→3′)aThe “P” at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide sequences indicates phosphorylation.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymatic DNA manipulations and modifications were done as described previously (9Ludwig H. Rebhan N. Blencke H.M. Merzbacher M. Stülke J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the amplification of a C-terminally truncated hprK allele, the oligonucleotides KS9 and SH30 were used. The PCR fragment was digested with SalI and NheI and ligated into the overexpression vector pWH844 (22Schirmer F. Ehrt S. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was sequenced and named pGP366. To overexpress M. pneumoniae PrpC (MPN247), we constructed plasmid pGP370 in two steps. First, a 1.5-kb fragment containing the M. pneumoniae MPN247 gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA using the primers SH64 and SH65. As the MPN247 gene contains a TGA codon that codes for tryptophan in M. pneumoniae but for an opal codon in E. coli, the PCR fragment was the template for mutagenesis by the combined chain reaction (23Bi W. Stambrook P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the amplification primers SH66 and SH67 and the 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primer SH68 to introduce an A375G transition. The resulting fragment was cloned between the SalI and NheI sites of pWH844. The replacement of the TGA by a TGG codon was verified by DNA sequencing. Electroporation of M. pneumoniae—M. pneumoniae was transformed with plasmid DNA by electroporation as described previously (24Hedreyda C.T. Lee K.K. Krause D.C. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Transposants were selected on PPLO agar containing 80 μg/ml gentamicin, and single colonies were transferred into modified Hayflick medium also containing 80 μg/ml gentamicin. Southern Blot Analysis—For the preparation of M. pneumoniae chromosomal DNA, cells of a 100-ml culture were harvested as described previously (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 mm EDTA, and RNase A was added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. After an incubation step at 37 °C for 15 min, 50 μl of proteinase K (25 mg/ml) and 75 μl of 10% SDS were added. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C until the lysate was clarified and subsequently cooled down on ice. To precipitate debris, 300 μl of 5 m NaCl were added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (25 min, 15000 × g, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was mixed with 500 μl of isopropyl alcohol to precipitate the chromosomal DNA. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and finally resolved in 300 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Digests of chromosomal DNA were separated using 1% agarose gels and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics) (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) and probed with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes obtained by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) using PCR-generated fragments as templates. Primer pairs for the amplification of hprK, prpC, and aac-ahpD gene fragments were SH3/SH4, SH66/SH73, and SH62/SH63, respectively (see Table 1). The reverse primers contained a T7 RNA polymerase recognition sequence. In vitro RNA labeling, hybridization, and signal detection were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (DIG RNA labeling kit and detection chemicals; Roche Diagnostics). Western Blot Analysis—In vivo HPr phosphorylation was assayed by Western blot analysis as described previously (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The different forms of HPr were detected using antibodies directed against M. pneunomiae HPr. Protein Purification—His6-HPr, His6-HPrK/P, His6-PrpC, and the His6-tagged version of the C-terminally truncated HPrK/P were overexpressed using the expression plasmids pGP217 (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), pGP204 (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), pGP370, and pGP366, respectively. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm) to exponentially growing cultures, and the proteins were purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column as described previously (19Halbedel S. Stülke J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 247: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the recombinant HPr protein, the overproduced protein was purified from the pellet fraction of the lysate by urea extraction and renatured as described previously (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Vitro Activity Assays of HPrK/P and of HPr(Ser-P)-dephosphorylating Enzymes—HPrK/P activity assays in cell extracts and the preparation of HPr(Ser-P) were carried out as described previously (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Halbedel S. Stülke J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 247: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To detect HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase activity in cell extracts, a 20 μm concentration of HPr(Ser-P) was incubated with 10 μg of cellular protein in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 20 μl for 2 h at 37°C followed by thermal inactivation (19Halbedel S. Stülke J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 247: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase activity of PrpC was assayed in 20 μl of buffer containing 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol with 20 μm HPr(Ser-P) and 300 nm His6-PrpC. The dephosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min and stopped immediately by thermal denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C. The assay mixtures were analyzed on 10% native polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining. The dephosphorylating activity of M. pneumoniae PrpC toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was assayed in a buffer containing 300 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol with 25 mm PNPP, and 5 μg of purified His6-PrpC in a total reaction volume of 1 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of PrpC, carried out for 10 min at 30 °C, and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 m EDTA, pH 8.0. The reaction product p-nitrophenol was quantified photometrically at a wavelength of 420 nm. Isolation of a M. pneumoniae hprK Mutant—M. pneumoniae can be subjected to transposon mutagenesis using delivery vectors such as pMT85 (25Zimmerman C.U. Herrmann R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 253: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have designed a strategy, designated “haystack mutagenesis,” to isolate any viable desired mutant. This is based on an ordered collection of M. pneumoniae transposon mutants and the assumptions that these bacteria contain ∼200 non-essential genes and that ∼920 clones are required to find a desired mutant at a confidence level of 99%. We isolated 2976 individual transposon mutants and grouped them into pools of 50 clones. With this number of mutants, a hprK mutant is included in the library with a probability of 99.999%. Cells of each pool were used in a PCR to detect the occurrence of products corresponding to junctions between the hprK gene and the mini-transposon using the oligonucleotides KS10 and SH29 (see Fig. 1A). From one pool that gave a positive signal, colony PCR with the 50 individual mutants resulted in the identification of one hprK mutant. The presence of the transposon insertion in hprK was verified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). To test whether this strain contained only one unique transposon insertion, we performed another Southern blot using a probe specific for the aac-aphD resistance gene present on the mini-transposon. As shown in Fig. 1B, only one single band hybridizing with this probe was detected. Moreover, this fragment had the same size as the NcoI-SmaI fragment hybridizing to the hprK probe (see Fig. 1B). The isolated hprK mutant strain was designated GPM51. The position of the transposon insertion in the hprK gene of M. pneumoniae GPM51 was determined by DNA sequencing. The hprK gene was disrupted after its 625th nucleotide, resulting in a truncated protein of 208 amino acids with one additional amino acid and the subsequent stop codon encoded by the inserted mini-transposon. Thus, the protein is truncated in the immediate vicinity of the active center of HPrK/P (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Allen G.S. Steinhauer K. Hillen W. Stülke J. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The position of the transposon insertion and the target duplications are shown in Fig. 1C. HPr Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation in the hprK Mutant—The only known biochemical activities of HPrK/P are the phosphorylation of HPr on Ser-46 and the dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P). To test the effect of the disruption of the hprK gene on HPr phosphorylation, we performed in vivo phosphorylation assays. For this purpose, protein extracts of M. pneumoniae were subjected to native gel electrophoresis, and the different forms of HPr were detected by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2A). The different species of HPr could be identified due to the heat lability of the phosphoamidate of HPr(His∼P). As shown in Fig. 2A, two bands of HPr were detected in the wild type strain. Upon heating, the fastest band disappeared, and a new, more slowly migrating band became visible. Thus, three forms of HPr (i.e. HPr(Ser-P), HPr(His∼P), and the doubly phosphorylated HPr(Ser-P)(His∼P)) were present in the wild type strain grown in medium containing glucose and glycerol. This observation is in good agreement with previous results (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, only singly phosphorylated HPr was detectable in the hprK mutant strain grown under the same conditions. This band disappeared completely upon heating, suggesting that HPr(His∼P) is the only form of HPr present in the hprK mutant strain (see Fig. 2A). Similarly, an analysis of cell extracts revealed ATP-dependent kinase activity on recombinant HPr in the wild type strain but not in the hprK mutant GPM51 (see Fig. 2B). Thus, as expected, no HPr kinase activity was detectable in the mutant. Next, we wanted to determine whether the hprK mutant strain had also lost the HPr phosphatase activity. Because no HPr(Ser-P) was present in GPM51, this analysis had to be performed using purified HPr(Ser-P) and cell extracts of the wild type and mutant strains. As shown in Fig. 2B, HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation was detected in the wild type strain. Surprisingly, complete HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation was also observed in the hprK mutant strain GPM51. This finding demonstrated that there was still an active HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase even when the hprK gene encoding HPr kinase/phosphorylase was disrupted. Identification of PrpC as a Novel Protein Phosphatase That Targets HPr(Ser-P)—Two possible reasons for the phosphatase activity observed in M. pneumoniae GPM51 could be: (i) the truncated HPrK/P present in this strain could have still had phosphatase activity or (ii) another protein in M. pneumoniae could have been active in HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we cloned a truncated hprK allele that was identical to the truncated hprK present in GPM51. This protein was purified and used to assay phosphatase activity using HPr(Ser-P) as a substrate. However, although the full-length protein dephosphorylated HPr(Ser-P), no activity was detected using the truncated protein (data not shown). This observation suggests that another protein encoded by M. pneumoniae might dephosphorylate HPr(Ser-P). Dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) by a protein different from HPrK/P has, so far, not been reported in any bacterium. A candidate for such a phosphatase is the protein encoded by the open reading frame MPN247, which is annotated as a PP2C-like protein phosphatase (12Himmelreich R. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Pirkl E. Li B.C. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4420-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Because phosphatases of this family dephosphorylate a broad range of protein substrates (26Shi L. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1382-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Obuchowski M. Postępy Biochem. 2005; 51: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the MPN247 gene product was the phosphatase in question. To test this idea, the MPN247 gene was cloned in a way that allowed the subsequent purification of the His-tagged gene product. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography and its activity as a HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase tested. As shown in Fig. 3, complete HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation was observed in the presence of manganese ions. Thus, the protein encoded by the MPN247 gene exhibited HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase activity. Based on the similarity of the deduced protein with the B. subtilis phosphatase PrpC and on the similar genetic arrangement (clustering with a protein Ser/Thr kinase) (28Obuchowski M. Madec E. Delattre D. Böl G. Iwanicki A. Foulger D. Séror S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the MPN247 gene was renamed prpC. An alignment of the M. pneumoniae PrpC protein with other phosphatases of the PP2C family is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. As can be seen, the active sites involved in the binding of metal ions and phosphate are highly conserved in all proteins of the family. Control of PrpC Activity—Protein phosphatases of the 2C family are regulated by a broad range of different metabolites, among them inorganic phosphate and glycerol-2-phosphate (28Obuchowski M. Madec E. Delattre D. Böl G. Iwanicki A. Foulger D. Séror S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The regulation of M. pneumoniae PrpC was studied using the synthetic substrate PNPP or HPr(Ser-P). First, we determined the kinetic parameters of PrpC activity with PNPP. The Km and Vmax values were found to be 1.14 ± 0.19 mm and 2.41 ± 0.69 μmol min- 1 mg-1, respectively (using a molar extinction coefficient ϵ420 of 12,500 m-1 cm-1). In the presence of inorganic phosphate, the PrpC activity was strongly inhibited in a competitive manner (Ki 62 ± 18 μm), whereas glycerol-2-phosphate caused a weak inhibition (50% inhibition at 34 ± 11 mm) (see Fig. 4A). In contrast, glycerol did not affect PrpC activity. The inhibition of PrpC activity by inorganic phosphate and glycerol-2-phosphate was also observed using the natural substrate HPr(Ser-P) (see Fig. 4B). HPr Phosphorylation in a prpC Mutant Strain—To confirm the biological role of PrpC, we isolated a prpC mutant from the mutant library using the oligonucleotides SH67 and SH29 as described for the hprK mutant. The transposon insertion was verified by Southern blot analysis with probes specific for prpC and aac-ahpD to demonstrate disruption of the prpC region and the unique insertion of the transposon, respectively. The insertion occurred after the 167th nucleotide of prpC, giving rise to a truncated protein (see supplemental Fig. S2). The resulting strain was designated GPM68. To test the HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase activity of the prpC mutant strain GPM68, HPr(Ser-P) was incubated in the presence of a cell extract of this strain. As shown in Fig. 2B, almost no HPr dephosphorylation was detected in the prpC mutant strain, whereas the phosphatase activity was present both in the wild type and hprK mutant strains. The residual HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylating activity seen with cell extracts of the prpC mutant is probably caused by the presence of a functional HPrK in this strain. However, as HPrK absolutely requires phosphate to be active in dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), this activity is rather weak because no additional phosphate was included in this assay. This finding suggests that PrpC might be the major player controlling HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation. The finding that PrpC is a crucial factor in the control of HPr phosphorylation was supported by an analysis of the in vivo HPr phosphorylation state. In the presence of glucose, fructose, or glucose and fructose, no HPr(Ser-P) was detectable in the wild type and prpC mutant strains. In contrast, HPr(Ser-P) was formed in the presence of glycerol irrespective of the availability of glucose. This is in good agreement with our previous observation that glycerol triggers HPr(Ser-P) formation in vivo (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When both glycerol and glucose were present in the medium, a larger portion of HPr was present in the doubly phosphorylated form and as HPr(Ser-P) in the prpC mutant GPM68, as compared with the isogenic wild type strain (Fig. 5). Thus, PrpC is indeed implicated in the regulation of HPr phosphorylation in living cells of M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae, M. genitalium, and other Mollicutes have recently attracted much interest because of their small genomes and the possibility of defining the minimal genetic equipment required for independent life. However, although random transposon mutageneses suggested sets of genes that might be essential or not (13Glass J.I. Assad-Garcia N. Alperovich N. Yooseph S. Lewis M.R. Maruf M. Hutchinson C.A. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 30Hutchinson C.A. Peterson S.N. Gill S.R. Cline R.T. White O. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Science. 1999; 286: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), it has, so far, not been possible to test these hypotheses by the directed isolation of mutants. The haystack mutagenesis approach developed in this work allowed us to obtain any desired viable mutant in an easy way. Our results confirm the previous finding that the hprK gene is non-essential, but they contradict the assignment of prpC (MPN247) as one of the essential genes (13Glass J.I. Assad-Garcia N. Alperovich N. Yooseph S. Lewis M.R. Maruf M. Hutchinson C.A. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 30Hutchinson C.A. Peterson S.N. Gill S.R. Cline R.T. White O. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Science. 1999; 286: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). With the transposon mutant library at hand, the essentiality of each of the predicted genes can easily be verified or eliminated. Moreover, with the availability of a tool for mutant isolation, the research on M. pneumoniae and related species will be significantly accelerated, making thus far intractable problems accessible for investigation. The reductive evolution of M. pneumoniae has resulted in the loss of nearly all regulatory genes. Among the few regulatory responses observed in M. pneumoniae are the induction of heat shock genes upon temperature upshift and the phosphorylation of HPr on Ser-46 in the presence of glycerol (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Weiner J.III Zimmerman C.U. Göhlmann H.W.H. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6306-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The formation of HPr(Ser-P) is catalyzed by the HPrK/P encoded by the hprK gene (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and this is the only enzyme in M. pneumoniae with such an activity. In contrast, dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) is not exclusively catalyzed by HPrK, as detected using a hprK mutant strain. Surprisingly, an additional enzymatic activity was detected, and we showed here that the protein phosphatase PrpC is responsible for this activity. Thus, a novel protein is implicated in controlling the phosphorylation state of HPr. Enzyme I of the PTS phosphorylates His-15 of HPr, and this phosphate residue can be transferred to either of the two functional PTS sugar permeases, i.e. the glucose permease or the fructose permease (18Halbedel S. Hames C. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7936-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HPrK/P mediates phosphorylation of Ser-46, but both HPrK/P and PrpC catalyze dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P). The presence of two different enzymes for this purpose has interesting implications. The phosphatase activity of HPrK/P is triggered when the concentration of inorganic phosphate is high in the cell (14Steinhauer K. Jepp T. Hillen W. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3277-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Merzbacher M. Detsch C. Hillen W. Stülke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these conditions occur when the cells are depleted of nutrients (32Mason W. Carbone D.P. Cushman R.A. Waggoner A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PrpC is strongly inhibited by the presence of inorganic phosphate (see Fig. 4). In summary, the intracellular phosphate concentration does not seem to be important for the dephosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P), because one of the two enzymes is active under either condition. The HPr phosphorylation state is of key importance for the control of carbon metabolism in the Firmicutes. HPr can either serve in sugar transport, it can activate transcriptional regulators and enzymes, or it can be a co-factor of a transcriptional regulator. In the model organism B. subtilis, HPr is phosphorylated on Ser-46 when the bacteria grow on glycolytically metabolizable carbon sources such as glucose (8Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Ludwig H. Rebhan N. Blencke H.M. Merzbacher M. Stülke J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has long been believed that HPrK/P is the only protein phosphorylating HPr or dephosphorylating HPr(Ser-P). Interestingly, only part of HPr is phosphorylated on Ser-46, even when the bacteria grow in the presence of glucose. In contrast, all HPr was converted to HPr(Ser-P) in a mutant strain devoid of the transcriptional regulator CcpA (9Ludwig H. Rebhan N. Blencke H.M. Merzbacher M. Stülke J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). From these data, it was concluded that additional factors might control HPr phosphorylation. It is tempting to speculate that PrpC is the protein for which we are searching. Indeed, PrpC is also present in B. subtilis. In the presence of glucose (low phosphate), it might dephosphorylate a part of HPr(Ser-P), which remains available for sugar transport. PrpC is a member of the family of PP2C protein phosphatases. These enzymes use a broad spectrum of phosphorylated substrates, including the artificial substrate PNPP, the PII protein in cyanobacteria (33Irmler A. Forchhammer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12978-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), or anti-σ factors and the translation factor EF-G in B. subtilis (34Adler E. Donella-Deana A. Arigoni F. Pinna L.A. Stragier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Gaidenko T. Kim T.J. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2136842509,"α-Defensins are mediators of mammalian innate immunity, and knowledge of their structure-function relationships is essential for understanding their mechanisms of action. We report here the NMR solution structures of the mouse Paneth cell α-defensin cryptdin-4 (Crp4) and a mutant (E15D)-Crp4 peptide, in which a conserved Glu<sup>15</sup> residue was replaced by Asp. Structural analysis of the two peptides confirms the involvement of this Glu in a conserved salt bridge that is removed in the mutant because of the shortened side chain. Despite disruption of this structural feature, the peptide variant retains a well defined native fold because of a rearrangement of side chains, which result in compensating favorable interactions. Furthermore, salt bridge-deficient Crp4 mutants were tested for bactericidal effects and resistance to proteolytic degradation, and all of the variants had similar bactericidal activities and stability to proteolysis. These findings support the conclusion that the function of the conserved salt bridge in Crp4 is not linked to bactericidal activity or proteolytic stability of the mature peptide."

In box C/D snoRNPs a similar kink-turn with bound 15.5K protein is required for selective binding of proteins NOP56 and NOP58. Here we analyzed RNA structural requirements for association of hPrp31 with U4 snRNP in vitro by hydroxyl radical footprinting. hPrp31 induced protection of the terminal penta-loop, as well as of stems I and II flanking the kink-turn. Similar protection was found with U4/U6 snRNA duplex prebound with 15.5K protein. A detailed mutational analysis of the U4 snRNA elements by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that stem I could not be shortened, although it tolerated sequence alterations. However, introduction of a third Watson-Crick base pair into stem II significantly reduced hPrp31 binding. While stem I of U4atac snRNA showed relaxed binding requirements, its stem II requirements were likewise restricted to two base pairs. In contrast, as shown previously, stem II of the kink-turn motif in box C/D snoRNAs is comprised of three base pairs, and NOP56 and NOP58 require a G-C pair at the central position. This indicates that hPrp31 binding specificity is achieved by the recognition of the two base pair long stem II of the U4 and U4atac snRNAs and suggests how discrimination is achieved by RNA structural elements during assembly of U4/U6 and U4atac/U6atac snRNPs and box C/D snoRNPs.

The processing of pre-mRNA in the nucleus is catalyzed by a large RNA-protein complex, the spliceosome (1Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd.

The spliceosome comprises, apart from the pre-mRNA substrate, the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, 4The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; snoRNP, small nucleolar RNP; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; MBP, maltose-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. as well as numerous splicing factors, that is, proteins that do not make up an integral part of the snRNPs. Each snRNP is a stable complex, consisting of a single RNA molecule and various proteins, of which some (the so-called Sm proteins) are common to all snRNPs, while others are specific to a particular snRNP (2Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The individual snRNPs interact with one another in a dynamic manner during the splicing cycle. For example, at the beginning of this cycle the U4 snRNP and the U6 snRNP are associated firmly with one another by two extended stretches of RNA-RNA base pairs. Two intermolecular helices of the U4/U6 snRNA are separated by an intramolecular 5′-terminal hairpin loop (5′ stem-loop) of the U4 snRNA (4Bringmann P. Appel B. Rinke J. Reuter R. Theissen H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Hashimoto C. Steitz J.A.

The 5′-terminal stem-loop of the U4 snRNA (Fig. 1B) consists of a stem I, an intramolecular loop and then a stem II. The latter ends in a pentanucleotide loop (“penta-loop”). Thus at this stage the U4 and U6 snRNP form a single particle, the U4/U6 di-snRNP. This complex, in turn, associates with the U5 snRNP and thus the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP is formed, which is integrated as such into the precatalytic spliceosome. During the rearrangement of the fully assembled spliceosome to its catalytically active state, the intermolecular base pairing between the U4 and U6 snRNAs becomes disrupted and the U4 snRNP particle is released from the spliceosome. In the subsequent steps, a base-paired region is formed between the U6 snRNA and the U2 snRNA, which leads to the formation of the catalytically active center (8Nilsen T.W. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 10Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Following the processing of the pre-mRNA, the spliceosome dissociates, and the U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs reassemble ready for a new round of splicing (10Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 11Nilsen T.W. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 279-307Google Scholar). A key part in the stability of the tri-snRNP and its formation from the U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U5 snRNP is played by the U4/U6-specific protein hPrp31 (also known as 61K). Studies in vitro, using HeLa cell nuclear extract depleted of hPrp31, showed that hPrp31 is essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA and for the formation of the human tri-snRNP particle (12Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Liu S. Vornlocher H.-P. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1148-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The same is true in living human cells, for which it was shown by RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of hPrp31 that this protein is needed for the stability of the tri-snRNP particle (13Schaffert N. Hossbach M. Heintzmann R. Achsel T. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3000-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein hPrp31 performs a dual function in the tri-snRNP particle. On the one hand, hPrp31 binds to the U4 snRNA in the U4/U6 di-snRNP (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), although the exact nature of this interaction, the point of contact and the mode of binding, is largely unknown. On the other hand, hPrp31 forms a bridge between the U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U5 snRNP by binding to the U5-specific protein hPrp6 (also known as U5-102K; Ref. 12Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Liu S. Vornlocher H.-P. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1148-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The importance of the bridging function of hPrp31 between the U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U5 snRNP particle is also supported by the observation that, in the course of the catalytic activation of the spliceosome, the association of the U4 snRNP with the U6 snRNP on the one hand and the U5 snRNP on the other hand is weakened and the hPrp31 dissociates along with the U4 snRNP (15Makarov E.M. Makarova O.V. Urlaub H. Gentzel M. Will C.L. Wilm M. Lührmann R. Science. 2002; 298: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Assembly studies in vitro have shown that hPrp31 does not bind alone to the U4/U6 di-snRNP. First of all, the protein 15.5K must bind to the intramolecular loop (“kink-turn motif”; Ref. 16Klein D.J. Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) of the 5′-terminal hairpin loop of the U4 snRNA (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein 15.5K is also necessary for the binding of the U4/U6-specific heterotrimeric CypH/hPrp4/hPrp3 (also known as 20/60/90K) protein complex. It thus functions as a nucleation factor. While the binding of CypH/hPrp4/hPrp3 depends on the prior binding of protein 15.5K, the protein hPrp31 and the complex CypH/hPrp4/hPrp3 bind independently of one another. The situation just described for the U4/U6 di-snRNP particle is the same for the binding of hPrp31 to the U4atac/U6atac-snRNAs of the minor U12-type spliceosome (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Schneider C. Will C.L. Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3219-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By ultraviolet irradiation of the U4atac-snRNP and the native purified U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP particle, hPrp31 has been cross-linked to single-stranded nucleotide regions at the three-way junction of the base-paired U4 and U6 snRNAs and the terminal penta-loop of the U4atac and the U4 snRNAs (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Kühn-Hölsken E. Lenz C. Sander B. Lührmann R. Urlaub H. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 1915-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This argues for the existence of direct contacts between hPrp31 and the U4 snRNA. The formation of the U4-15.5K complex suffices for the stable binding of hPrp31. However, it remains unclear which regions of the U4 snRNA are required for this and what factors determine its specificity. The corresponding determinants in hPrp31 are likewise unknown. Protein hPrp31 possesses a so-called Nop domain in its central region, which shows clear homology to a domain of the box C/D snoRNP-associated proteins NOP56 and NOP58 (12Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Liu S. Vornlocher H.-P. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1148-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Gautier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell.

Bird A.C. Hunt D.M. Bhattacharya S.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 375-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Above all, hPrp31 shows functional homology to NOP56 and NOP58. Here too, the binding of protein 15.5K to the box C/D snoRNA, which, like the U4 snRNA, is capable of forming a kink-turn motif, is a prerequisite for the binding of NOP56 und NOP58 to the box C/D snoRNA (21Watkins N.J. Ségault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Lührmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how the specificity of the binding of hPrp31 to the U4 snRNA, and not to the box C/D snoRNA, is achieved. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that hPrp31 is also of clinical interest. Mutations in its gene (PRPF31) are correlated with the autosomal dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa, a disorder that leads to degeneration of the photoreceptors of the eye (20Vithana E.N. Abu-Safieh L. Allen M.J. Carey A. Papaioannou M. Chakarova C. Al-Maghtheh M. Ebenezer N.D. Willis C. Moore A.T. Bird A.C. Hunt D.M. Bhattacharya S.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 375-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations associated with this disease are situated in and around the conserved central Nop homology domain. In this work, we have analyzed the structural requirements for hPrp31 association with the U4 snRNP in vitro. We have identified nucleotides within the U4 snRNA that are protected from hydroxyl-radical attack in the presence of protein hPrp31. By employing U4 and U4atac snRNAs deletion and point mutants, we were able to determine the structural requirements within the U4 and U4atac snRNAs for the binding of protein hPrp31 to the U4 and U4atac snRNPs. Our findings provide insight into how binding specificity is achieved in the exclusive interaction of proteins hPrp31 and NOP56/NOP58 with their targets, the U4/U6 and U4/U4atac snRNPs and box C/D snoRNPs, respectively.

The MBP-hPrp31 fusion protein was created by first subcloning of the hPrp31 cDNA into pETM-41 (EMBL). Escherichia coli strain HMS174 was transformed with pETM-41-hPrp31 and grown at 20 °C to an A600 of 0.8. isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm to induce protein expression. After incubation for 3 h at 20°C, cells were pelleted. Cells were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and one tablet of complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then subjected to sonication with a microtip (Branson) and three 20-s bursts at an amplitude of 40%. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the MBP-hPrp31-containing lysate was loaded directly onto 2 ml of amylose-Sepharose (New England Biolabs). Bound MBP-hPrp31 was washed once with 20 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and twice with buffer B. The MBP-hPrp31 protein was finally eluted stepwise with buffer B supplemented with 10 mm maltose in 500-μl fractions. Peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer B.

Ribose cleavage of the RNA backbone was initiated by hydroxyl radicals generated with H2O2 and Fe(II)-EDTA as described (22Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and cleavage products were analyzed by primer extension using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 65-82 of human U4 snRNA as before (22Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Approximately 0.03 pmol of 32P-labeled U4 snRNA oligoribonucleotides were incubated with 25 pmol of recombinant 15.5K and/or 50 pmol of MBP-hPrp31 proteins and 10 μg of E. coli tRNA (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer B. Subsequently, RNA and RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% (80:1) native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA and visualized by autoradiography as described (22Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, all experiments were quantified with a PhosphorImager. Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting Studies Reveal Protection of Various Regions of the U4 snRNA by Protein hPrp31—It was previously shown that protein hPrp31 is only in direct contact with the U4 snRNA after protein 15.5K binds to the kink-turn motif of U4 snRNA (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To narrow down the possible RNA contacts in the ternary 15.5K-hPrp31-U4 snRNA complex, we investigated it by hydroxyl radical footprinting (22Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this method, any ribose of an RNA that is shielded by protein will be protected from cleavage of the RNA backbone induced by hydroxyl radicals. Analysis is by primer extension with reverse transcriptase. Through a comparison with cleavage sites on naked RNA, the absence of a stop before a particular position is considered as a protection at this position in the complex. We assembled the ternary 15.5K-hPrp31-U4 snRNA complex by incubating full-length U4 snRNA with an excess of recombinant 15.5K and glutathione S-transferase-hPrp31 protein (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used more than 95% of the U4 snRNA was converted into the ternary complex, as assayed by EMSA (data not shown). To distinguish nucleotides protected by protein hPrp31 from those protected by protein 15.5K only, a binary 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex was assembled in a parallel sample; naked RNA was used as a reference. These complexes were treated with H2O2 in the presence of Fe(II)-EDTA to generate hydroxyl radicals. The RNA was subsequently analyzed by primer extension (Fig. 1A) of the U4 snRNA. A comparison of the cleavage pattern of naked RNA (lane 2) with that of a control omitting the reagent Fe(II)-EDTA (lane 1) shows distinct cleavages at all nucleotides (compare lanes 1 and 2). Lane 3 shows the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern observed in the binary 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex. Strong protection is found in the kink-turn and in the adjacent stems I (A29-G34) and II (G43-C47) (lanes 2 and 3; compare Fig. 1A, FP 2 and FP 1). This is in agreement with the results of our earlier studies (22Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Vidovic I. Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Lührmann R. Ficner R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1331-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) in which these nucleotides were identified as the binding site for protein 15.5K. The cleavage pattern of U4 snRNA in the ternary complex revealed a number of additional protection sites arising from the presence of protein hPrp31. One region extended from G35 to C42 (lanes 3 and 4; FP A in Fig. 1A), comprising the penta-loop and nucleotides of stem II not protected by protein 15.5K. Furthermore, protection was observed in stem I next to the kink-turn at positions G26, C27, and C28 (FP B) and at nucleotides C16 and G18 (FP C). In the U4/U6 snRNA duplex, FP C would be located in the U4/U6 helix II, adjacent to the three-way junction of the U4/U6 duplex. We were therefore interested whether protein hPrp31 would similarly protect these nucleotides when binding to the 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex in the context of the duplex. To investigate this, we first created the duplex by annealing U6 snRNA to U4 snRNA before addition of proteins 15.5K and hPrp31. Formation of the U4/U6 duplex was quantitative, and the duplex was as efficient as the single-stranded U4 snRNA in ternary complex formation, as determined by EMSA (data not shown). Hydroxyl radical footprinting was then performed as above, on (i) the protein-free U4/U6 duplex (Fig. 1A, lane 6), (ii) the complex formed between the duplex and protein 15.5K (Fig. 1A, lane 7), and (iii) the complex formed between the preformed 15.5K-U4/U6 snRNA complex and protein hPrp31 (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Duplex formation on its own did not influence the accessibilities of the riboses in U4 snRNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 2), except for a reduced reactivity at A39-G43 in the U4/U6 snRNA duplex. Similarly, the footprint of protein 15.5K on the U4 in the U4/U6 duplex was essentially identical to the one described above (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 3, FP 1 and FP 2). The addition of protein hPrp31 resulted in protection of nucleotides essentially identical to those seen in the absence of U6 snRNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 4). In particular, the protection of the penta-loop and the adjacent stem II was unchanged (FP A). Protection at the bottom of stem I (FP B), adjacent to the binding site for protein 15.5K, was more extensive in that A25 also showed protection. Somehow more enlarged was FP C, which was found to extend from G14 to G18. Fig. 1B depicts the footprints on the secondary structures of U4 snRNA (24Myslinski E. Branlant C.

The overall pattern of protection of U4 snRNA by protein hPrp31 was thus comparable in the hPrp31-15.5K-U4 snRNA and the hPrp31-15.5K-U4/U6 snRNA complexes, with the only differences observed on the borders of the protected regions in FP B and C. In summary, these data show that in vitro protein hPrp31 protects regions of stems I and II, the complete terminal penta-loop, and nucleotides in the helix adjacent to the three-way junction. Protein hPrp31 Requires the Complete Stem I of the 5′ Stem-loop of U4 snRNA for Binding—We next investigated which of the structural elements of U4 snRNA that were found to be protected from hydroxyl radical attack by protein hPrp31 in the footprinting experiment were required for stable binding of protein hPrp31 to the 15.5K-U4 snRNA binary complex. For this more detailed analysis, we prepared a series of mutant RNA oligonucleotides and assayed them for ternary complex formation by EMSA. To ease solubilization of hPrp31 we used a fusion protein comprising the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused to hPrp31. This behaves in a manner identical to nontagged hPrp31 (data not shown). In all experiments, the binary 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex (B in Fig. 2) was first assembled with recombinant 15.5K protein and radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide. Formation of the ternary complex (T in Fig. 2) was then initiated by adding MBP-hPrp31 protein. Complexes were then analyzed directly by native PAGE at 4 °C. Since the single-stranded 5′-region of the U4 snRNA was protected by the protein, we first deleted this segment (U4-2, Fig. 2). No reduction in the amount of ternary complex formed (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 7) was observed compared with the longer deletion mutant U4 snRNA (U4-1), which binds in a manner identical to that of the wild-type U4 snRNA (14Nottrott S. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5527-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hence, the contact between the single-stranded 5′ end of the U4 snRNA and protein hPrp31 is not required for stable binding. However, the deletion of five base pairs from stem I significantly depressed formation of stable ternary complex (U4-3; Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 11). Residual ternary complexes (in yields of ∼20% compared with the U4-2 or U4-1 RNA) were unstable, resulting in an ill-defined smear migrating above the binary 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex. Complex formation could not be restored by extending the truncated three base pair long stem I of mutant U4-3 by a C-G base pair (U4-4, SL1 in Ref. 22Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changing the sequence of the upper part of stem I while leaving the number of base pairs intact, or deleting the bulged-out A, did not reduce the yield of ternary complex (oligonucleotides U4-10 and U4-11, respectively, see “Experimental Procedures”; data not shown). We conclude that the length of stem I is critical for productive interaction of protein hPrp31 with the binary 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex. Protein hPrp31 Does Not Require the Penta-loop of the 5′ Stem-loop of U4 snRNA for Binding—The hydroxyl radical footprint showed extensive protection of the entire penta-loop and protein hPrp31 in the ternary complex (Fig. 1). We therefore next tested a number of different penta-loop mutants and assayed their effect on stable ternary complex formation in the above experimental system. We used the U4-2 mutant (Fig. 2), which has wild-type properties while being closest in length to the other mutants, as a reference with which to compare the mutants. Replacement of the penta-loop by an unrelated sequence did not impair complex formation (U4-5, Fig. 3). Replacement with a tetranucleotide loop (UGAA in U4-6, Fig. 3; other loops tested were UUCG and GCAA) likewise had no effect (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 11, and data not shown). We therefore introduced a more dramatic change into the backbone of the penta-loop by opening it up. An RNA duplex with dangling ends was created by annealing the 5′ (20-37) and 3′ (38-52) halves of the U4 snRNA 5′ stem-loop (U4-A, Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, this duplex still allowed efficient ternary complex formation (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 15). Finally, we simply deleted the penta-loop by annealing 5′ and 3′ halves lacking the penta-loop sequence entirely (U4-B, Fig. 3). The stability of this duplex was dramatically impaired (as assayed by EMSA; data not shown); it no longer supported the formation of significant amounts of stable binary 15.5K-U4 snRNA complex (Fig. 3, lane 18) compared with the reference U4-2 (lane 2) and all other mutants tested (lanes 6, 10, and 14). However, this duplex did support the efficient formation of stable ternary complex upon addition of protein hPrp31 to the binary complex assembly mixture (lane 19). Protein hPrp31 therefore appears to stabilize transient interactions of protein 15.5K with U4 snRNA in the ternary complex. We conclude that the penta-loop per se is not essential for protein hPrp31 binding to the 15.5K-U4 snRNA binary complex. Protein hPrp31 Requires a 2-Base Pair-long Stem II of the 5′ Stem-loop of U4 snRNA for Binding—In addition to the penta-loop, protein hPrp31 had also been found to be in contact with the adjacent short stem II (Fig. 1). Since the penta-loop was not required for stable ternary complex formation, we next investigated the function of stem II in ternary complex formation. To this end, we first extended stem II by a single C-G base pair (U4-7, Fig. 4A). Strikingly, this mutant no longer supported ternary complex formation in our assay system (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 7; ∼90% reduction of ternary complex f"
https://openalex.org/W2082933933,"Previous studies have shown that the valanimycin producer Streptomyces viridifaciens contains two genes encoding proteins that are similar to seryl-tRNA synthetases (SerRSs). One of these proteins (SvsR) is presumed to function in protein biosynthesis, because it exhibits a high degree of similarity to the single SerRS of Streptomyces coelicolor. The second protein (VlmL), which exhibits a low similarity to the S. coelicolor SerRS, is hypothesized to play a role in valanimycin biosynthesis, because the vlmL gene resides within the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster. To investigate the role of VlmL in valanimycin biosynthesis, VlmL and SvsR have been overproduced in soluble form in Escherichia coli, and the biochemical properties of both proteins have been analyzed and compared. Both proteins were found to catalyze a serine-dependent exchange of 32P-labeled pyrophosphate into ATP and to aminoacylate total E. coli tRNA with l-serine. Kinetic parameters for the two enzymes show that SvsR is catalytically more efficient than VlmL. The results of these experiments suggest that the role of VlmL in valanimycin biosynthesis is to produce seryl-tRNA, which is then utilized for a subsequent step in the biosynthetic pathway. Orthologs of VlmL were identified in two other actinomycetes species that also contain orthologs of the S. coelicolor SerRS. The significance of these findings is herein discussed.

The aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs) 2The abbreviations used are: AARS, aminoacyl tRNA synthetase; SerRS, seryl-tRNA synthetase. are a well studied family of enzymes that ligate a specific amino acid to the cognate tRNA for subsequent incorporation into protein (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The ligation process involves a two-step reaction sequence. The first step proceeds by reaction of the amino acid with ATP to generate an aminoacyl adenylate AA-AMP. This step is followed by transfer of the amino acid to the 2′- or 3′-hydroxyl group of the 3′-terminal ribose of the tRNA. The AARSs are divided into two unrelated classes. The enzymes of each class share a characteristic catalytic folding pattern, identifiable sequence motifs, and distinctive mechanistic features (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that the active site of class I synthetases contains a Rossmann dinucleotide binding fold, whereas members of the class II family of enzymes exhibit a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by three α-helices in a barrel-like structure (4Schimmel P. Ribas De Pouplana L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All class I enzymes attach their amino acid substrate to the 2′-hydroxyl group of the tRNA-terminal adenosine, whereas class II AARSs (except PheRS) attach the amino acid substrate to the 3′-hydroxyl group (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Investigations over the last two decades have shown that some AARSs participate in biochemical processes besides direct involvement with protein biosynthesis (5Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 683-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Francklyn C. Perona J.J. Puetz J. Hou Y.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These alternate functions are of two types, those that involve the synthesis of an aminoacylated tRNA and those that do not. An example of the former is the conversion of Glu-tRNAGln and Asp-tRNAAsn into their glutaminylated and asparaginylated versions by amidotransferases (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Examples of the latter type of function include AARSs that participate in translational regulation, promote the splicing of mitochondrial cytochrome genes, and serve as precursors of species with cytokine-like activity (4Schimmel P. Ribas De Pouplana L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Francklyn C. Perona J.J. Puetz J. Hou Y.M. RNA (N.

The antibiotic valanimycin (see Fig. 1) is a naturally occurring azoxy compound isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456-hF10 by Yamato et al. (7Yamato M. Iinuma H. Naganawa H. Yamagishi Y. Hamada M. Masuda T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to antibacterial activity, valanimycin exhibits potent antitumor activity against in vitro cell cultures of mouse leukemia L1210, P388/S (doxorubicin-sensitive), and P388/ADR (doxorubicin-resistant) (7Yamato M.

Precursor incorporation experiments have established that valanimycin is derived from l-valine and l-serine via the intermediacy of isobutylamine and isobutylhydroxylamine (Fig. 1) (17Parry R.J.

Furthermore, the azoxy nitrogen atoms in valanimycin have been shown to originate from the nitrogen atoms of isobutylamine and serine (17Parry R.J. Li Y. Lii F.-W. J. Am. Chem.

Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functions of five proteins encoded by these genes have been elucidated. These functions include a valine decarboxylase (VlmD) (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol.

Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and a Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (VlmI) that regulates valanimycin production. 3R. P. Garg and R. J. Parry, manuscript in preparation. The identity of the gene(s) responsible for the formation of the novel N–N bond that is present in valanimycin has thus far remained elusive. A novel feature of the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster is the presence of a gene (vlmL) that appears to encode a class II seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The translation product of vlmL exhibits a relatively low identity (38%) to the single SerRS that is present in Streptomyces coelicolor. This finding suggests that an additional SerRS gene might be present in S. viridifaciens. The presence of a second SerRS gene (svsR) in S. viridifaciens has been subsequently confirmed by PCR experiments (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As expected, the translation product of svsR exhibited a high degree of identity (91%) to the SerRS of S. coelicolor but a relatively low level of identity to VlmL (39%). The presence of a gene in the valanimycin gene cluster that appears to encode a SerRS is very intriguing, because the role that this protein might play in valanimycin biosynthesis is quite unclear. In this paper, we have described a phylogenetic analysis of VlmL as well as the overexpression and biochemical characterization of VlmL and the “housekeeping” seryl-tRNA synthetase of S. viridifaciens, SvsR. General—Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, Bio-Rad, or G. E. Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Sigma Genosys. Restriction enzymes were obtained from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI). l-[3H(G)]serine (29.5 Ci/mmol) and [32P]Na4P2O7 (102.3 Ci/mmol) were procured from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Competent cells of Escherichia coli DH10B and BL21 (DE3) were purchased from Invitrogen and EMD Biosciences, Inc. (Madison, WI), respectively, and were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The purity and molecular weight of overproduced proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE using broad range protein molecular weight markers from Bio-Rad. Prestained protein molecular weight markers from New England Biolabs were used for Western blotting. Protein concentrations were determined with the Advanced Protein Assay Reagent from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO) or by use of the BCA reagent from Pierce. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. DNA Manipulations—Genomic DNA was prepared from S. viridifaciens MG456-hF10 using DNAZOL reagent (MRC Inc., Cincinnati, OH) after pulverization of mycelium frozen with liquid nitrogen. Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIA-prep spin plasmid kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). PCR products were separated on agarose gels and purified from the gels. Digestion with restriction endonucleases and ligation experiments were carried out by standard procedures under conditions recommended by the manufacturers. Automated DNA sequencing was performed at Lone Star Sequencing Laboratories (Houston, TX) using universal and synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Computational Analyses—Primary sequence alignments were performed using The Gene Inspector, version 1.5, software (Textco, Inc., West Lebanon, NH) run on a Macintosh computer. BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) analyses were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. GraphPad Prism, version 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), was used for the nonlinear regression analysis of all enzyme assay data. Sequencher, version 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), was used to compile DNA sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis of SerRSs was carried out by the creation of a multiple sequence alignment with ClustalW (24Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4056) Google Scholar). A tree was then generated based on a Kimura distance matrix and the neighbor-joining method using the PHYLIP software package (25Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Cloning of vlmL and svsR—vlmL was amplified from cosmid pVal35 (19Parry R.J. Li W. Copper H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 409-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR using an N-terminal primer containing an NdeI site (bold) (5′-TATTACATATGCATGACCCTCACGAGT-3′) and a C-terminal primer with an EcoRI site (bold) (5′-TTATGAATTCGAGAGTGGTTCCGTC-3′). The vlmL PCR product was cloned into a PCR3.2 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pFLAG-CTC to produce pFLAG-CTC-VlmL. The svsR gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of S. viridifaciens using primers designed from the nucleotide sequence of the S. coelicolor seryl-tRNA synthetase. The N-terminal primer (5′-TATTACATATGATTGACCTTCGCCTGCTT-3′) contained an NdeI site, whereas the C-terminal primer (5′-TTATGAATTCCTTGGCCACCGGCTCCAG-3′) carried an EcoRI site. A mixture of Vent and TaqDNA polymerase was used for amplification in standard PCR buffer with annealing at 66 °C for 30 s. The 1.3-kb PCR product was purified after separation on an agarose gel, cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and sequenced. The gene was then subcloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pFLAG-CTC to produce pFLAG-CTC-SvsR. The N-terminal PCR primers for vlmL and svsR were both designed to replace the native GTG start codon of each gene with an ATG codon to improve expression in E. coli. Overexpression, Purification, and Characterization of Proteins— Overproduction and purification of VlmL and SvsR from pFLAG-CTC-VlmL and pFLAG-CTC-SvsR were carried out according to the protocols outlined in the FLAG vector instruction manual (Sigma). The conditions for optimal expression of VlmL and SvsR were standardized by Western blotting using FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the desired plasmid were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin and then diluted 100-fold into fresh 2× Luria-Bertani medium plus 0.4% glucose and ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of ∼0.6 was reached, whereupon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 2 h, the cells were harvested and stored at –20 °C until utilized for isolation of the desired protein. The cells from a 1-liter culture were suspended in 25 ml of TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), which contained 0.3% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 50 μg each of RNase and DNase, and one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After 40 min of incubation at 37 °C, a cell-free extract was prepared by centrifugation at 18,700 × g for 30 min. The cell-free extract was filtered through a 0.2micron syringe filter and passed over a 2-ml column of FLAG antibody resin. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with 20 bed volumes of TBS buffer. FLAG-tagged proteins were then eluted with a 100 μm solution of FLAG peptide (Sigma) in TBS buffer. The protein was concentrated, and the FLAG peptide was removed by repeated concentration and dilution using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter with a Mr 10,000 cutoff (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The resulting protein was stored at –80 °C in TBS buffer containing 15% glycerol. Western blotting with GroEL antibodies (Sigma) was carried out with each protein preparation to eliminate the possibility of GroEL contamination (26Couch R. Seidle H. Parry R.J. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Native molecular weights for VlmL and SvsR were determined by gel filtration using a 10 × 300-mm Superose 6 column and TBS buffer with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The void volume of the column was determined with dextran blue 2000. The molecular weight calibration standards (G. E. Healthcare) used to calibrate the column consisted of thyroglobin (669,000), ferritin (440,000), catalase (232,000), aldolase (158,000), albumin (67,000), and chymotrypsinogen A (25,000). ATP-[32P]PPi Exchange Assays—The ATP-pyrophosphate (PPi) exchange reactions were carried out at 30 °C in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH), 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate (0.5 μCi of [32P]PPi), and 5 mm ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, and incubations were carried out for variable periods of time. The amino acid concentrations ranged from 20 to 800 μm, whereas the concentrations of enzyme ranged from 40 to 400 nm. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.5 ml of an activated charcoal: tetrasodium pyrophosphate:perchloric acid mixture (1.6:4.5:5% in water). Each quenched reaction mixture was filtered with a vacuum manifold containing a 24-mm GF/C filter (Whatman Inc., Florham Park, NJ). The charcoal on each filter was washed twice with 1 ml of PP buffer (2% tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 20% aqueous HClO4) and then washed twice with water. The filter paper disc bearing the charcoal was transferred to 10 ml of SX18–4 scintillation mixture (BD Biosciences), and the level of [32P]PPi incorporation into ATP was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Aminoacylation Assays—Aminoacylation assays for VlmL and SvsR were carried out with total E. coli tRNA (Roche Applied Science). Typically, a 50-μl reaction mix contained 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 μm l-serine, 1.5 μCi of l-[3H(G)]serine, 3.2 mm tRNASer (200 μg of total E. coli tRNA), and concentrations of enzyme at 0.8–5.0 nm. The concentration of tRNASer in the total E. coli tRNA was calculated from data provided by the manufacturer. Negative controls were carried out by omission of enzyme, tRNA, or ATP from the reaction mixtures. The reactions were incubated at 35 °C for variable time intervals or with varied substrate concentrations. Aliquots of the incubation mixtures were spotted onto 24-mm papers disks (Whatman grade 3) that were presoaked in 10% trichloroacetic acid and dried. The paper discs were washed twice with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 5 mm serine and then washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Each washed paper disc was sequentially submerged for 5 min in 75% ethanol and 100% ether and then dried completely at 60 °C. The quantity of [3H]seryl-tRNA present on each disc was determined by liquid scintillation counting using SX18–4 scintillation mixture (BD Biosciences). Acid Urea Gel Electrophoresis to Detect Aminoacylated tRNA— The aminoacylation reactions were carried out as described above using l-[3H(G)]serine and E. coli tRNA and the aminoacylated tRNA separated from unacylated tRNAs by a modification of the method of Varshney et al. (27Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μl) of the reaction mixtures were diluted with an equal amount of quenching buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0), and the aminoacylated tRNA was separated by acidic, denaturing 8 m urea PAGE (14%) using a Mini-Protean cell (Bio-Rad). The electrophoretic separation was run for ∼2 h at 100 V, and the gel was then submerged in 15 ml of amplifying solution (G. E. Healthcare) after fixing. The treated gel was then dried and autoradiography carried out for 1–6 days depending on the assay. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of VlmL and SvsR—Previous work identified a housekeeping seryl-tRNA synthetase gene in S. viridifaciens in addition to vlmL (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the current studies, the S. viridifaciens housekeeping SerRS (svsR) and vlmL were amplified using primers that contained restrictions sites to facilitate the cloning of each gene into the protein expression vector pFLAG-CTC. The amino acid translation product of each gene was analyzed by BLAST. SvsR and VlmL both display a strong degree of similarity to other seryl-tRNA synthetases, and both proteins display the three motifs that are associated with class II AARSs (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. 6). SvsR exhibits >90% identity to the housekeeping SerRSs of other Streptomyces strains, but only 38% identity to VlmL. BLAST analysis reveals that two other actinomycetes, Streptomyces avermitilis and Frankia sp. EAN1pec, each contain two genes that encode SerRSs. One of the two SerRS genes (GenBank™ BAC70005, ZP_00567562) present in each of these organisms encodes a protein that exhibits a high degree of identity to VlmL. Fig. 2 displays a phylogenetic tree created with PHYLIP software (25Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) relating these and other bacterial SerRSs to one another. The phylogenetic tree suggests that VlmL (GenBank™ AAN10249), BAC70005, and ZP_00567562 are more closely related to the SerRSs of Gram-negative bacteria than to the SerRSs of Gram-positive bacteria. An alignment between the amino acid sequences of VlmL and the SerRSs of S. coelicolor, S. avermitilis, and Frankia sp. EAN1pec is shown in supplemental Fig. 6. Protein Overexpression and Characterization—VlmL and SvsR were overexpressed in E. coli as C-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins using the pFLAG-CTC vector in which expression is driven from the inducible trc promoter. Both proteins were overproduced largely in soluble form with yields of ∼5 mg/liter culture broth. The maximum amounts of protein were observed after 2 h of induction at 37 °C. Longer incubation at 37 °C or the use of lower temperatures resulted in proteolysis and reduced yields. On SDS-PAGE analysis, both VlmL and SvsR exhibited the molecular weights expected for the denatured proteins and appeared to be >95% pure (data not shown). The native molecular weights of VlmL and SvsR were determined by gel filtration in TBS buffer on a Superose 6 column calibrated with standard protein molecular weight markers. The elution volume of VlmL corresponded to a molecular weight of ∼90,000, indicating that VlmL exists as a dimer. This observation is consistent with the behavior exhibited by other SerRSs (3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 28Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). SvsR displayed two major fractions on gel filtration. The elution volume for one fraction was similar to that of VlmL, indicating a dimeric form for the enzyme, whereas a second fraction amounting to ∼50% of the total protein eluted at an early time point, similar to the 669,000 thyroglobin standard. This high molecular weight fraction appears to be an aggregated form of SvsR, because SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the protein sample used for analysis was of high purity. Potential contamination of the overproduced SvsR by GroEL (native molecular weight of 14-mer ∼800,000) was ruled out by Western blotting with GroEL antibodies. PPi Exchange Assays—The adenylation activity exhibited by VlmL and SvsR with l-serine as a substrate was assayed using the amino acid-dependent exchange of radiolabel from [32P]PPi into ATP. This assay measures the reversible formation of the aminoacyl-AMP derivative of the amino acid (Equation 1).AA+ATP+AARS⇌AARS·AA-AMP+PPi(Eq. 1) VlmL and SvsR were each assayed in a buffered medium containing ATP and [32P]PPi. The progress of the exchange reaction was monitored versus time under conditions of varied substrate concentration by adsorption of the radiolabeled ATP onto activated charcoal and quantification of the adsorbed radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Nonlinear regression analyses of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration were transformed into Lineweaver-Burk plots to calculate Km and Vmax values, the latter of which were then used to calculate kcat. Fig. 3 shows the substrate versus velocity and Lineweaver-Burk plots (inset) for VlmL and SvsR, respectively, and the measured kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The data show that VlmL displays a somewhat tighter binding affinity for l-serine than does SvsR, whereas the kcat for l-serine turnover by VlmL is only ∼7% of that exhibited by SvsR. The kcat/Km values for the two enzymes show that SvsR is the more efficient of the two enzymes at catalyzing the adenylation of l-serine.TABLE 1Kinetic data for VlmL and SvsR enzymesParameterVlmLSvsR[32P]PPi exchange assayVmax409.0 ± 11.6 pmol min-1 ml-1721.6 ± 42.9 pmol min-1 ml-1Km79.28 ± 5.94 mm274.4 ± 28.5 mmkcat1.01 min-115.16 min-1kcat/Km12.74 min-1 mm-155.19 min-1 mm-1Aminoacylation assayVmax130.7 ± 11.6 pmol min-1 ml-1112.7 ± 6.4 pmol min-1 ml-1Km2.99 ± 0.43 mm6.48 ± 0.26 mmkcat9.71 min-13.37 min-1kcat/Km3.26 min-1 mm-10.52 min-1 mm-1 Open table in a new tab Aminoacylation Activities of VlmL and SvsR—The ability of VlmL and SvsR to catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA by l-serine was evaluated. Each of the overproduced proteins was incubated with total E. coli tRNA and l-[3H(G)]serine and the [3H]seryl-tRNA produced from the pool of tRNA was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on Whatman filter paper. Intriguingly, both VlmL and SvsR catalyzed the aminoacylation of tRNA by l-serine. The rates of tRNA aminoacylation catalyzed by VlmL and SvsR were linear with time (Fig. 4), and omission of enzyme, ATP, or tRNA resulted in the complete lack of precipitated radioactivity (data not shown). The aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by VlmL and SvsR followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics under conditions in which the concentration of l-serine or tRNA (Fig. 5) was varied. The maximal rates for the conversion of radiolabeled serine into radiolabeled seryl-tRNA by VlmL and SvsR were calculated to provide a comparison of the efficiency of the aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by each enzyme. The calculations show that these two enzymes catalyze the aminoacylation reaction at comparable rates.FIGURE 5Substrate-velocity plot for aminoacylation of total E. coli tRNA with l-[3H]serine (Lineweaver-Burk plot insets). Reactions were carried out with 1.3 nm VlmL (A) or 3.3 nm SvsR (B) over 10 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Acid Urea Gel Analysis of Aminoacylation of tRNA—In order to confirm that [3H]seryl-tRNA was produced in the aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by both VlmL and SvsR, the labeled seryl-tRNA produced in the enzymatic incubations was separated by PAGE using acidic, urea-containing gels, and the labeled seryl-tRNA was visualized by autoradiography. It was observed that the amount of labeled seryl-tRNA produced by both enzymes increased with time in a manner that was consistent with the increase in labeled seryl-tRNA observed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Fig. 4, insets). Acidic urea PAGE analysis of control incubations carried out in the absence of tRNA confirmed that the radioactive product observed by PAGE in the complete incubations was tRNA-dependent (data not shown). Additional control experiments verified that the formation of radiolabeled seryl-tRNA was also dependent on the presence of ATP and the presence of VlmL or SvsR (data not shown). Previous investigations have shown that the valanimycin producer S. viridifaciens contains two genes that appear to code for SerRSs (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that one of these genes (svsR) is likely to play a primary metabolic role, whereas the second gene (vlmL), which is embedded in the valanimycin gene cluster, appears to be involved in valanimycin biosynthesis (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) of the VlmL protein reveals that it is not closely related to the SerRSs of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, orthologs of VlmL exist in both S. avermitilis MA-4680 and Frankia sp. EAN1pec. The sequence differences between the VlmL subfamily and housekeeping SerRSs are greatest in the N-terminal region (supplemental Fig. 6), which encodes a coiled-coil domain (28Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This domain has been shown to interact with the cognate tRNA (28Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), but it might also interact with other proteins involved in valanimycin biosynthesis. Analysis of the genomic regions surrounding the VlmL orthologs of S. avermitilis and Frankia sp. reveals the presence of several genes that exhibit strong similarities to genes found within the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Consequently, it appears that a locus for the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite related to valanimycin is likely to be present in both of these actinomycete species. To clarify the function of vlmL in valanimycin biosynthesis, the biochemical characterization of both the VlmL and SvsR proteins was undertaken. VlmL and SvsR were overproduced in E. coli in soluble form as C-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were first assayed for the l-serine-dependent exchange of [32P]PPi into ATP, an assay that measures the enzyme-dependent reversible formation of the seryl-AMP derivative (see Equation 1). Both proteins displayed activity in this assay, with VlmL exhibiting a somewhat slower turnover rate than SvsR (Table 1). VlmL and SvsR were then assayed for their ability to catalyze the aminoacylation of total E. coli tRNA with serine (Equation 2).AARS·AA-AMP+tRNA⇌AARS+AA-tRNA+AMP(Eq. 2) Michaelis-Menten-like behavior was observed for both proteins in this assay (Fig. 5). The data (Table 1) show that both proteins catalyze the aminoacylation reaction with comparable efficiency. From these observations, we hypothesize that the function of VlmL in valanimycin biosynthesis is to produce seryl-tRNA, which then serves as the substrate for a subsequent step in the biosynthetic pathway. Precedent for involvement of an aminoacyl tRNA in a biochemical pathway unrelated to protein biosynthesis is provided by the formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid from l-glutamyl-tRNA in chloroplasts and some bacteria (29Jahn D. Verkamp E. Söll D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 215-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although the details of the later stages in the valanimycin biosynthetic pathway are presently unknown, several steps will clearly be required to produce valanimycin from seryl-tRNA and isobutylhydroxylamine. These include N–N bond formation, a formal four-electron oxidation of the N–N bond to the level of an azoxy group, and dehydration of the serine-derived hydroxyl group. The most novel of these processes is clearly N–N bond formation. It is possible that the ester moiety of the seryl-tRNA is somehow required for this reaction. Prior investigations have shown that the oxygen of isobutylhydroxylamine is not the source of the valanimycin azoxy oxygen atom (23Tao T. Alemany L.B. Parry R.J. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 1213-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This observation limits the number of mechanisms that can be envisioned for formation of an N–N bond. An interesting issue raised by our hypothesis is the degree of cross-talk that occurs between the seryl-tRNA produced by SvsR for use in protein biosynthesis and the seryl-tRNA generated by VlmL for valanimycin biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown (21Garg R.P. Ma Y. Hoyt J.C. Parry R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that disruption of the vlmL gene strongly reduces, but does not eliminate, valanimycin production. The phenotype of the vlmL mutant suggests that seryl-tRNA produced by SvsR can be used for valanimycin production, although the process appears to be inefficient. This inefficiency might result from compartmentalization of the valanimycin pathway. Alternatively, VlmL may utilize only a single tRNASer isoacceptor as a substrate in contrast with SvsR, which would be expected to utilize all of the isoaccepting tRNASer species. Future studies will examine this question as well as the role played by seryl-tRNA in valanimycin biosynthesis. We thank Dr. S. Martinis for critical reading of the manuscript and Amy Williams for the protocols for tRNA aminoacylation and acidic urea PAGE analysis.

In the developing central nervous system, the axon must navigate through a complex terrain consisting of various cell types, distinct neuronal processes and many extracellular matrix molecules. Within this complex terrain are guidance cues that direct the growth cone, the motile tip of the axon, to its target. Actin assembly is a key process that controls the growth and steering of the axon growth cones (1Bear J.E. Krause M. Gertler F.B. Curr. Opin.

The Rho family of small GTPases, which includes Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, has important roles in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and has been implicated in axon guidance and cell migration (3Bishop A.L.

Rho GAPs and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors are themselves regulated by several extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways (8Lamarche N. Hall A.

A role for Rho GTPase-activating proteins in repulsion mediated by Roundabout (Robo) has been demonstrated in Slit signaling in neuronal migration. Robo is a cell surface receptor that is responsible for the repulsive effect of Slit. Wong and colleagues (11Wong K. Ren X.R. Huang Y.Z. Xie Y. Liu G. Saito H. Tang H. Wen L. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mei L. Wu J.Y. Xiong W.C. Rao Y. Cell. 2001; 107: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) used a two-hybrid screen to identify a novel family of GAPs that interact with the intracellular domain of rat Robo1. Three members of this family were identified and named Slit-Robo (sr) GAP1, GAP2 and GAP3, corresponding to KIAA1304, KIAA0456, and KIAA0411, respectively. The srGAPs contain a RhoGAP domain, an SH3 domain, and a Fes/CIP4 homology domain. The proline-rich conserved cytoplasmic motif 3 (CC3) motif in Robo binds directly to the SH3 domain of the srGAP subfamily of Rho GAPs (11Wong K. Ren X.R. Huang Y.Z. Xie Y. Liu G. Saito H. Tang H.

In cultured mammalian cells, srGAP1 can bind to and decrease the level of active Cdc42 and RhoA, but not Rac1. Extracellular application of Slit to primary neurons increases the intracellular binding of Robo and srGAP1, and inhibits Cdc42 activity in a Robo- and srGAP-dependent manner, which emphasizes the importance of the CC3 motifs in Robo1 and the SH3 domain of srGAPs in Slit-Robo signaling pathway (11Wong K.

The intracellular region of Drosophila Robo contains four identifiable conserved motifs, designated CC0, CC1, CC2, and CC3 (12Kidd T. Brose K. Mitchell K.J. Fetter R.D. Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Tear G. Cell. 1998; 92: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 13Zallen J.A. Yi B.A. Bargmann C.I.

The proline-rich CC3 motif contains the conventional PXXP sequence generally recognized by SH3 domains. However, the proline-rich sequence of the CC3 motif, 1476TYTDDLPPPPVPPPAIKSP1493(12Kidd T.

Cell. 1998; 92: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), may be a mixture of class I and class II proline-rich peptides (see below). It is therefore interesting to characterize the binding orientation and exact sites in the CC3 motif for the srGAP1 SH3 domain. Found in a wide variety of intracellular proteins in living cells, the SH3 domain is a ubiquitous protein interaction module that contributes to many aspects of complex signaling networks (14Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SH3 peptide recognition surface includes a hydrophobic cleft that is flanked on one side by variable loops (RT and n-Src loops) that contribute to the recognition specificity and determine ligand register and orientation (14Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dalgarno D.C. Botfield M.C. Rickles R.J. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain recognizes a proline-rich sequence of its ligand protein with a PXXP motif, which is further classified into +XφPXφP (class I) and φPXφPX+ (class II) (where φ and + are usually a hydrophobic residue and an arginine residue, respectively) (16Feng S.

Biol. 1993; 229: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), known as a collagen chain conformation, and fits the ligand-binding site on the SH3 surface. An SH3 domain may interact with several ligand proteins in vivo, due not only to the low ligand recognition specificity of the domain but also to the weak interactions, with Kd (dissociation constant) values of 1-102 μm in most cases (14Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L.

This results in the formation of a complicated network consisting of many SH3-containing proteins and their interaction partners (or ligand proteins). To better understand the molecular basis of the polyproline-SH3 interactions within the Robo-srGAP complex, we report the first three-dimensional structure of the srGAP1 SH3 module at 1.8-Å resolution. This structure reveals the relevant protein-protein interaction surface and provides a rationale for the weak binding properties exhibited by srGAPs. We have also investigated the recognition site in the intracellular domain of Robo recognized by the srGAP1 SH3 domain using BIAcore experiments. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA fragments encoding the srGAP SH3 domains (srGAP1 SH3, srGAP2 SH3, and srGAP3 SH3) from Ala-9 to Val-60 were amplified by PCR using the full-length srGAP sequences (KIAA1304, KIAA0456, and KIAA0411) as templates. The PCR fragments were cloned into pGEX 6p-1 (GE Healthcare). The glutathione S-transferase-SH3 proteins were overexpressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain, then purified by glutathione S-transferase-glutathione affinity chromatography, cleaved with PreScission Protease. The recombinant srGAPs SH3 domains were stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl and concentrated to 15 mg/ml. Crystallization—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing equal 1-μl volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. The best diffracting crystals of srGAP1 SH3 domain were obtained at 18 °C from a protein solution at 15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and a reservoir solution containing 1.5 m lithium sulfate, pH 7.5. Cubic-shaped crystals grew within 1 week. Crystals were soaked in 100% paraffin oil (Hampton Research) as a cryoprotectant prior to x-ray diffraction experiments. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Initial crystals of the srGAP1 SH3 domain were diffracted to 2.5-Å in-house under cryo-conditions with a Rigaku MM-007 rotating CuKα anode x-ray source and a Mar345 detector. The space group is body-centered cubic (I23) and different kinds of crystal packing were observed in one drop. Later, data from another primitive cubic crystal (space group P23) diffracting to 1.8 Å were collected in-house. Data were reduced and scaled by the program HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The phase problem was solved using the 2.5-Å diffraction data in space group I23, and refinement of the srGAP1 SH3 domain model was performed using CNS with the 1.8-Å diffraction data in space group P23. The asymmetric unit contains two srGAP1 SH3 domains with a Vm of 2.1 Å3 Da-1. The srGAP1 SH3 domain structure was refined by iterative cycles of manual corrections with O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y.

The final 1.8-Å resolution structure of the srGAP1 SH3 domain, consisting of residues 6-60, has an Rwork of 20.8% and Rfree of 25.7%. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Atomic coordinates have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2GNC. Peptide Synthesis and Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore)—All peptides used for BIAcore experiments were synthesized by Beijing Scilight Biotechnology except the CC3-I13 and CC3-II14 peptides, which were synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. A C-terminal GGK extension was added to several peptides for coupling to the CM5 chip via the lysine side chain amino group, but ultimately this scheme was substituted by SH3 domain binding to the chip for our experiments. The peptides were in freeze-dried powder and were dissolved in sterile water and stored at -80 °C. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on a Pharmacia Biosensor BIAcore 3000 instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three srGAP SH3 domains (srGAP1 SH3, srGAP2 SH3, and srGAP3 SH3) were covalently coupled to different flow cells of the CM5 chip, respectively, binding to the dextran matrix of a CM5 sensorchip (Pharmacia Bio-sensor). Immobilizations were performed in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. A reference surface was generated simultaneously under the same conditions but without protein injection and used as a blank to correct for instrumental and buffer effects. The amount of protein bound to the sensor chip was monitored by the change in refractive index. Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in HBS running buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) with a flow-rate of 60 μl/min. After each binding experiment, the sensor chip was regenerated by a 90-s pulse of 90 μl of HBS buffer at a flow rate of 60 μl/min, a treatment that did not produce significant changes in baseline and response after each run. Thus, estimation of kinetic parameters was realized by repetitive injections of a series of peptides at variable concentrations at 60 μl/min flow rate to the immobilized srGAP SH3 domains. Response curves were prepared by extracting the signal generated using the control flow cell. Analysis of experimental data and kinetic parameters were performed with BIAevalution software version 4.1 (Pharmacia Bio-sensor). Crystal Structure of the srGAP1 SH3 Domain at 1.8-Å Resolution—We have solved the crystal structure of the srGAP1 SH3 domain, encompassing the region from residues Ala-377 to Val-428 of the full-length srGAP1 protein, at 1.8-Å resolution. For convenience, residues are subsequently renumbered from Ala-9 to Val-60 throughout the article. The general topology of the srGAP1 SH3 domain is similar to that of other SH3 domains, consisting of five β-strands arranged as two orthogonal β-sheets and forming a compact anti-parallel β-barrel (16Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 17Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, one of the sheets is formed by β-strands βa, βe, and the first half of βb, whereas the other is formed by β-strands βc, βd, and the second half of βb. A kink in β-strand b allows it to participate in both β-sheets. Strands βa and βb are connected by a long hairpin loop (RT loop), which flips onto the top of the β-barrel and is approximately orthogonal to the central axis of the barrel with a left-handed twist. The conformation is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving residues Tyr-15, Leu-23, Phe-25, and the upper part of the β-barrel hydrophobic core. The loop is further stabilized by extensive intra-loop hydrogen bonds, as well as those between the loop and rest of the SH3 domain. The majority of residues in the RT loop are extremely well defined in the electron density map, including hydrophilic residues such as Asp-14 and Glu-22. There are two classic β-bulges found in the βb strand, which endows this long strand with greater flexibility than in other SH3 domain structures (Fig. 2). The defining features of the β-bulge in the SH3 domain are hydrogen bonds between the amide nitrogens of both Tyr-34 and His-35 and the carbonyl group of Lys-43 (26Chan A.W. Hutchinson E.G. Harris D. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1574-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This is a highly conserved β-bulge in the middle of the second β-strand of the SH3 domain that appears to provide a necessary kink in this strand, thus enabling it to hydrogen bond to both sheets comprising the fold. The other β-bulge is adjacent to the n-Src loop, in which the amide nitrogens of Ala-37 and Ser-38 both hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of the Trp-41, and the NH of Trp-41 is bonded to the carbonyl of Ser-38. The right-handed helical angles generally observed at the Tyr-34 and Ala-37 amino acids are characteristic of position 1 in the classical β-bulge. Interestingly, there are five β-turns in the overall srGAP1 SH3 domain structure, which includes almost all types of β-bend (27Shin I. Ting A.Y. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12667-12668Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). All of them are located in the loop regions of the srGAP1 SH3 domain. Four residues on the tip of the RT loop (Ser-19, Ala-20, Arg-21, and Glu-22) form a type I β-turn. At the end of the RT loop, four residues (Lys-26, Lys-27, Gly-28, and Ala-29) form a type II β-turn N-terminal to strand βb. The whole n-Src loop (Ser-38, Glu-39, Asp-40, and Trp-41) is just a classic type I β-turn. The distal loop (His-46 to Ile-49) linking strands βc and βd is a classic type II β-turn. Finally, in the center of the ligand recognition groove, the four residues (Pro-54, His-55, Gln-56, and Tyr-57) separating strands βd and βe are in a 310-helical conformation. There are two molecules in one asymmetric unit of the crystal structure. The two chains of the srGAP1 SH3 domain structure can be superimposed with an overall root mean square deviation of 0.58 Å for all Cα atoms. The structures of the two srGAP1 SH3 domains are essentially identical, including side chain orientations, with a few notable exceptions (Fig. 3). The largest deviation is at position 13. In molecule B, Phe-13 stacks against Tyr-57 on the same side of the binding groove. This stacking of Phe-13 against the conserved Tyr-57 on the same side of the aromatic ligand binding groove is the same general conformation observed in almost all other SH3 structures to date. However, in molecule A, the conformation of the phenyl group of Phe-13 is directed away from Tyr-57 and is located on the opposite side of the binding groove where it lies close to Phe-8 of a symmetry-related molecule A. This suggests that even conserved residues in the SH3-fold involved in ligand binding have plasticity and can adapt to different conditions. Another possibility may be that the conformational change of Phe-13 in molecule A is a result of crystal packing. The Ligand Binding Region of the srGAP1 SH3 Domain—In the crystal structure of the srGAP1 SH3 domain, the ligand binding area is a hydrophobic patch on the surface surrounded by several charged residues. As shown in Fig. 1B, the side chains of highly conserved residues such as Phe-13, Tyr-15, Glu-22, Trp-41, Pro-54, Tyr-57, Leu-52, and Ala-37 generate three general clefts labeled pocket 1 (P1), pocket 2 (P2), and pocket 3 (P3) and an additional fourth pocket labeled pocket 4 (P4) (Fig. 1B). P1 is composed of two hydrophobic residues with Phe-13 on one side and Tyr-57 on the other. This pocket is the most anomalous one in the SH3 ligand binding groove with a very shallow bottom and almost no surrounding side face. P2 is constructed with Pro-54 on the bottom and Tyr-54, Tyr-15, Trp-41, Gln-56, and Asp-40 backbones at the sides. It can be further divided into two subsites, one formed by residues Tyr-15, Trp-41, Pro-54, and Tyr-57 and the other formed by the side chains of Asp-40, Trp-41, and Gln-56. Among the three general clefts, P2 is the largest and deepest. P3 is formed by the long alkyl side chain of Glu-22 and the indole ring of Trp-41 at one side, the long alkyl side chain of Arg-21 on the other side, the side chain of Ser-19 at the top, and Leu-52 on the bottom. Generally, the P3 pocket is large, contributing to the ligand binding affinity and specificity among the SH3 domain family. In the srGAP1 SH3 domain, there is an unusual basic arginine residue on the side wall of P3 adjacent to the conserved negative residue Glu-22 (Fig. 1B). Arg-21 is in the i+2 position of the classic I β-turn on the tip of the RT loop, and the dihedral angle makes its side chain point of the pocket with its long alkyl side chain constituting one side wall of the P3 pocket. Moreover, the conserved acidic residue Glu-22 is fixed by two strong hydrogen bonds to Thr-19 and Tyr-15, with its long alkyl side chain constituting the other side wall of the P3 pocket. Thus, the so-called specificity pocket P3 is particularly unsuitable for binding to the charged residues in the ligand. On the contrary, it is inclined to be a hydrophobic pocket together with the adjacent hydrophobic pocket P4, accommodating the aromatic residues of the binding ligand (Fig. 5). The three clefts (P1, P2, and P3) are arranged linearly from left to right and are approximately parallel to the direction of the hairpin loop. The fourth hydrophobic pocket termed P4 is aligned vertical to the preceding groove containing the P1, P2, and P3 pockets. It is made up of three hydrophobic residues with Trp-41 on one side, Leu-52 on the other, and Ala-37 on the distal side. Comparison with Other SH3 Domains Reveals the Unique Binding Scaffold of the srGAP1 SH3 Domain—We compared the srGAP1 SH3 domain with the crystal structures of three other SH3 domains: the α-spectrin SH3 domain D48G mutant (PDB code 1BK2) (24Martinez J.C. Pisabarro M.T. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the c-Crk N-terminal SH3 domain (PDB code: 1CKA) (28Wu X. Knudsen B. Feller S.M. Zheng J. Sali A. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1995; 3: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and the Abl tyrosine kinase SH3 domain (PDB code 1ABO) (29Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviations between the Cα atoms of these structures and the srGAP1 SH3 domain are 0.98, 1.3, and 2.1 Å, respectively. Superposition of these structures reveals the unique binding surface presented by the srGAP1 SH3 domain. In the conventional PXXP binding site, most of the conformations of the conserved hydrophobic residues in these structures resemble each other except for Phe-13 and Tyr-57 in the P1 pocket (Fig. 3). The phenyl ring of Phe-13 (Tyr-70 in 1ABO) in the srGAP1 SH3 domain is directed sidewards and upwards from the bottom of the P1 pocket relative to the other SH3 domain. The aromatic side chain of Tyr-57 in the srGAP1 SH3 domain is deflected to one side from the center of the P1 pocket compared with the other SH3 domain. These differences make the P1 pocket of the srGAP1 SH3 domain shallower and smaller than the general groove surrounding the first “XP” dipeptide in other SH3 domains (19Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Spectrin involves in a multiprotein scaffold attached to diverse cellular membranes and functions in actin dynamics and focal adhesions, partially through the central region hosting an SH3 domain (30Rotter B. Bournier O. Nicolas G. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Merilainen J. Palovuori R. Sormunen R. Wasenius V.M. Lehto V.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 647-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by the sequence alignment in Fig. 4, the α-spectrin SH3 domain D48G mutant was among those with the highest sequence similarity to the srGAP1 SH3 domain, and was therefore used as a search model for the molecular replacement solution of the structure. In general, there is a conserved class I β-turn in the tip of the RT loop, which includes a cluster of polar residues forming the specificity pocket P3. It is interesting to note that the srGAP SH3 domain has oppositely charged residues in the i+2 and i+3 positions similar to the α-spectrin SH3 domain. These two residues have almost the same conformations in the two structures (Fig. 3). In the structure of the Crk-N SH3 complex with a high affinity peptide from C3G, a lysine in the C3G peptide is tightly coordinated by three acidic residues in the class I β-turn in the tip of the RT loop of the Crk-N SH3 domain (Fig. 5). The conformations of these three acidic residues are similar to those of the srGAP1 SH3 domain (Fig. 3). However, in the srGAP1 SH3 domain, basic residue Arg-21 replaces Glu-149, whereas Ser-19 replaces Asp-147 of the Crk-N SH3 domain. The opposing electrostatic residues lining the P3 specificity pocket make it unsuitable for tight binding to ligand as in the other high affinity binding SH3 domains. This may offer an explanation for the differences in their ligand binding specificities and affinities as discussed later. The SH3 domain of the Abl kinase was selected for comparison as it binds to the same proline-rich CC3 motif of Robo as the srGAP1 SH3 domain (32Bashaw G.J. Kidd T. Murray D. Pawson T. Goodman C.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 33Hsouna A. Kim Y.S. VanBerkum M.F. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 57: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the complex of the Abl SH3 domain complex with synthetic peptide 3BP1, the four residues in the tip of the RT loop form a type II β-turn in the P3 specificity pocket. Asp-77 (Ala-20 in srGAP1 SH3) points toward the center of the pocket to form a hydrogen bond with Met-4 of its binding peptide, compensating for the function of the conserved acidic residue in the bottom of P3 (29Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3 and 5). In the srGAP1 SH3 domain, the classical type I β-turn directs the Arg-"
https://openalex.org/W2149819344,"We have recently reported that Shewanella oneidensis, a Gram-negative γ-proteobacterium with a rich arsenal of redox proteins, possesses four old yellow enzyme (OYE) homologues. Here, we report a series of high resolution crystal structures for one of these OYEs, Shewanella yellow enzyme 1 (SYE1), in its oxidized form at 1.4Å resolution, which binds a molecule of PEG 400 in the active site, and in its NADH-reduced and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde- and p-hydroxyacetophenone-bound forms at 1.7Å resolution. Although the overall structure of SYE1 reveals a monomeric enzyme based on the α8β8 barrel scaffold observed for other OYEs, the active site exhibits a unique combination of features: a strongly butterfly-bent FMN cofactor both in the oxidized and NADH-reduced forms, a collapsed and narrow active site tunnel, and a novel combination of conserved residues involved in the binding of phenolic ligands. Furthermore, we identify a second p-hydroxybenzaldehyde-binding site in a hydrophobic cleft next to the entry of the active site tunnel in the capping subdomain, formed by a restructuring of Loop 3 to an “open” conformation. This constitutes the first evidence to date for the entire family of OYEs that Loop 3 may indeed play a dynamic role in ligand binding and thus provides insights into the elusive NADH complex and into substrate binding in general. Structure-based sequence alignments indicate that the novelties we observe in SYE1 are supported by conserved residues in a number of structurally uncharacterized OYEs from the β- and γ-proteobacteria, suggesting that SYE1 represents a new subfamily of bacterial OYEs.

The OYE family has been studied since the 1930s when Warburg and Christian isolated a yellow enzyme from brewers' bottom yeast (Saccharomyces carlsbergensis) (1Williams R.E. Bruce N.C. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Theorell purified the enzyme in 1935 and showed that it was composed of a colorless apoprotein and a yellow dye. The dye turned out to be a vitamin B2-derived molecule, FMN, and to be essential for catalysis. When a second yellow enzyme was isolated from yeast, the first enzyme was named old yellow enzyme (OYE), 3The abbreviations used are: OYE, old yellow enzyme; SYE, Shewanella yellow enzyme; p-HBA, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde; p-ACE, p-hydroxyacetophenone; PETN, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase; OPR, oxophytodienoic acid reductase; NAD(P)H, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.3The abbreviations used are: OYE, old yellow enzyme; SYE, Shewanella yellow enzyme; p-HBA, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde; p-ACE, p-hydroxyacetophenone; PETN, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase; OPR, oxophytodienoic acid reductase; NAD(P)H, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. a name that has persisted till this day.

Furthermore, OYEs can form long wavelength charge transfer interactions with phenolic compounds (24Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn exhibit a distinct binding mode in the active site involving hydrogen bonding of the phenolate oxygen to a strictly conserved histidine/asparagine or histidine/histidine pair (25Fox K.M. Karplus A.P. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of OYE proceeds by a ping-pong mechanism consisting of an oxidative and reductive half-reaction. Consistent with the plethora of functional similarities among members of the OYE family, the first crystal structures reported revealed a common α8β8 barrel fold with significant variations in the capping subdomain (25Fox K.M.

Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, interesting differences have begun to emerge in recent studies. For example, morphinone reductase lacks the general acid (tyrosine) that protonates the substrate (28Messiha H.L. Bruce N.C. Satelle B.M. Sutcliffe M.J. Munro A.W. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27103-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In another case, enzymes possessing two histidines (23Williams R.E. Rathbone D.A. Scrutton N.S Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3566-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in the active site for substrate binding can catalyze the reduction of TnT to the H-Meisenheimer complex, whereas the enzymes with only one histidine cannot. Finally, YqjM has a flavin that is butterfly-bent in both the reduced and the oxidized state (29Kitzing K. Fitzpatrick T.B. Wilken C. Sawa J. Bourenkov G.P. Macheroux P. Clausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27904-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have recently probed the genome of Shewanella oneidensis, a Gram-negative γ-proteobacterium with a remarkable respiratory versatility (30Heidelberg J.F. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) (www.tigr.org), using yeast OYE1. We identified four OYE homologues (NP718044, NP718043, NP719682, and NP718946) that we named SYE1–4 for Shewanella yellow enzyme (31Brigé A. Van den Hemel D. De Smet L. Carpentier W. Van Beeumen J. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SYE1 (NP718044) is the Shewanella OYE homologue with the greatest sequence identity to OYE1. Here, we report structural studies of SYE1 at high resolution and show that SYE1 exhibits a number of novel features that can be mapped to strongly conserved sequence fingerprints in several structurally uncharacterized OYE homologues from the β- and γ-proteobacteria. This suggests that SYE1 may be the prototype of a new subfamily of bacterial OYEs. Materials—The Q-Sepharose FF and Source 30Q matrices and the MonoQ and Superdex 200 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the pACYC-Duet-1 vector was from Novagen. Structure screens 1 and 2 were from Molecular Dimensions Ltd., and the additive screen was from Hampton Research. Trizma base, ammonium sulfate, FMN, MES, Na2HPO4, and NaH2PO4 were purchased from Sigma; HEPES and PEG 400 were from Fluka; NaCl and NADH were from Merck; t-hexenal, t-decenal, and t-dodecenal were from Acros; and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Duchefa. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The sye1 gene was excised from a pGEX-SYE1 construct using EcoRI and NotI and cloned in the first multiple cloning site of pACYC-Duet-1, generating pACYC-SYE1. This cloning strategy puts the sye1 gene out of frame with the His tag. The pACYC-SYE1 vector was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cultures were grown at 28 °C under constant shaking, and SYE1 expression was induced at 0.5 A600 nm using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultures were left to grow for another 7 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended using 30 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, per liter of culture grown. The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication, and the soluble fraction was clarified by centrifugation. SYE1 was purified in four steps. Lysate containing SYE1 was manually loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and SYE1 was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed to remove the salt and was loaded onto a Source 30Q column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. SYE1 eluted at 80–100 mm NaCl. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, and loaded onto a MonoQ column from which SYE1 eluted at 40–60 mm NaCl. As a final step the SYE1 fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column. The elution profile of SYE1 was consistent with a 40-kDa protein, indicating that SYE1 was a monomer. Final purity was confirmed by silver staining of an SDS-PAGE gel. The pure fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 35 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 70 mm NaCl. The protein was subsequently concentrated to 12 mg/ml and stored in 100-μl aliquots at –80 °C. Crystallization of SYE1—Crystallization trials were set up by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, using 200 μl of reservoir solutions (Structure Screens 1 and 2; Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) and mixing equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir (1 μl + 1 μl) to make the droplets. Within 2 days needle-like crystals were observed in condition 30 (2% PEG 400, 2 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5). Optimization of the crystals by varying the pH and the concentrations of PEG 400 and ammonium sulfate was unsuccessful. We therefore screened a series of additives (Additive screen; Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) against the condition with the best needles (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 2% PEG 400). Substantially improved crystals were observed in the presence of 0.5% β-octyl glucoside. Upon further optimization, diffraction quality crystals were grown in droplets containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0–8.5, 1.75 m ammonium sulfate, 2% PEG 400, and 0.25% β-octyl glucoside. This condition gave rise to two distinct crystal morphologies, rectangular block-shaped (Form A) versus hexagonal-shaped crystals (Form B), which diffracted to 1.3 Å versus 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation. We thus chose to focus on Form A crystals. They belong to space group P212121 with a = 48.45 Å, b = 83.60 Å, and c = 87.53 Å and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit with a Vm value of 2.24 Å3/Da. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the EMBL beamlines X13 and BW7A in DESY (Hamburg, Germany) using single crystals that were previously cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen following a brief incubation (∼20 s) in a cryoprotectant solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 m ammonium sulfate, 2% PEG 400, 20% (v/v) glycerol). All of the diffraction data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar). Data statistics are presented in Table 1. The native SYE1 structure was solved by molecular replacement using maximum-likelihood methods implemented in the program PHASER (33Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The search model was generated from the coordinates of morphinone reductase (Protein Data Bank entry 1GWJ) which exhibited a 50% sequence identity with SYE1. Nonconserved residues were replaced by alanine (or glycine), and all of the insertions were deleted, as well as all ligands, including water molecules and the FMN cofactor. The correctness of the structure solution was assessed from the quality of the electron density for missing side chains and other unique structural features. Several rounds of model building were subsequently alternated with further crystallographic refinement employing simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and individual B-factor refinement using a maximum-likelihood target function, as implemented in CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16949) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). A random 5% set of the possible reduced data were selected and used to flag reflections for the calculation of Rfree values. The same set of reflections was used for the calculation of the Rfree for all data sets. The FMN cofactor was initially modeled with a planar isoalloxazine ring, but difference electron density maps after the first round of refinement showed clear evidence for a butterfly-bent ring about the imaginary N-5–N-10 axis. The planarity weights were therefore relaxed during subsequent rounds of refinement to facilitate proper refinement of the FMN ring atoms. Ensuing electron density maps indeed contained no residual positive or negative difference electron density for the FMN substructure. A PEG 400 molecule, a sulfate ion, a β-octyl glucoside molecule, and water molecules were modeled in the final stages of refinement. The electron density maps allowed us to model the entire PEG 400 molecule, which is consistent with the refined temperature factors of the PEG 400 molecule (see Table 1). All of the ligands were refined using atomic parameters extracted from the HICUP server. Ligand p-hydroxyacetophenone was composed by combining two molecules (phenol and an acetyl group). For all three soaking experiments difference density maps were initially calculated using coefficients Fobs,soak – Fobs,native and calculated phases from the high resolution native structure. All of the residues were found in the most favored, additional, or generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (program Procheck (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar)) except for Trp274, an aromatic amino acid that lines the active site tunnel. The r.m.s.d. values for the different models were calculated by the program SEQUOIA (36Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the figures were drawn with Pymol (www.pymol.org).TABLE 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsNative SYE1p-HBA SYE1p-ACE SYE1NADH SYE1Data collectionSource, wavelengthDESY/EMBL-X13, 0.8034 ÅDESY/EMBL-X13, 0.8034 ÅDESY/EMBL-X13, 0.8067 ÅDESY/EMBL-X13, 0.8067 ÅResolution (Å)1.41.71.71.7Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 48.45, b = 83.60, c = 87.53a = 47.99, b = 83.91, c = 88.36a = 48.56, b = 83.68, c = 87.48a = 48.20, b = 83.74, c = 88.10VM (Å 3 Da -1)2.242.252.252.25Unique reflections69169380333922338791Redundancy6.8 (6.1)6.9 (6.4)6.5 (5.9)7.0 (6.2)Completeness (%)99.9 (99.3)99.5 (97.4)99.7 (98.4)99.9 (99.6)Rsym (%)aRsym = ΣhΣi|I(h,i)- 〈I(h) 〉|\ΣhΣiI(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of reflection h, and 〈I(h) 〉 is the average value over multiple measurements.0.031 (0.232)0.056 (0.450)0.033 (0.090)0.056 (0.248)Average I/σ(I)42.9 (7.6)32.9 (4.0)49.0 (18.2)32.7 (7.3)RefinementProtein Data Bank codes2GOU2GQ92GQ82GQAResolution (Å)30-1.430-1.720-1.720-1.7|F|/σ(|F|)0000Reflections (working set/test set)65677/351936041/199237158/206536773/2018Rcryst' Rfree0.157, 0.1740.189, 0.2230.161, 0.1900.168, 0.194R.m.s. deviationsBonds (Å)0.0060.0070.0070.006Angles (°)2.21.41.51.4Average B-factors (Å2)Protein atoms10241316FMN61379Water24353028Ligand29 (PEG 400)21 and 3911a Rsym = ΣhΣi|I(h,i)- 〈I(h) 〉|\ΣhΣiI(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of reflection h, and 〈I(h) 〉 is the average value over multiple measurements. Open table in a new tab Soaking Experiments—Form A crystals of SYE1 were washed two times with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 m ammonium sulfate and were subsequently incubated in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 m ammonium sulfate, supplemented with 50 mm of the desired ligand. Complex formation in the crystals was monitored via the rapid change of color from yellow to lime-green, in the case of the phenolic ligands and from yellow to colorless in the case of NADH. Incubation times for the phenolic ligands were typically 2–5 min depending on the size of the crystal used and in the case of NADH 30 min to several hours. After incubation, the crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Kinetic Studies—All of the kinetic parameters were determined under strict anaerobic conditions, and all of the assays were performed in triplicate. The reaction mixtures consisting of 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.3 (5.75 g of Na2HPO4, 1.49 g of NaH2PO4, and 2.92 g of NaCl/liter), 60–120 μm NADH, and varying concentrations of substrate were prepared within a glove box (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI) and transferred to sealable quartz cuvettes (Hellma). The concentration of NADH was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm. Enzyme solutions were prepared in sealed flasks and made anaerobic by bubbling with N2 gas. The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixtures using a Hamilton needle. The enzyme concentration was kept constant at 100 nm. SYE activity was assayed by following the oxidation of NADH using a double beam Uvikon 943 spectrophotometer. Apparent steady state kinetic constants were determined by least squares fitting procedures to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation. Protein Data Bank Accession Codes—The coordinates and structure factors for the four structures of SYE1 reported here are available via the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) with accession codes 2GOU, 2GQ8, 2GQ9, and 2GQA. Overall Structure of SYE1—The structure of oxidized SYE1 was determined by molecular replacement methods using morphinone reductase as the search model and was refined at 1.4 Å resolution (Table 1). SYE1, like all OYE homologues characterized to date (26Breithaupt C. Straβner J. Breitinger U. Huber R. Macheroux P. Schaller A. Clausen T.

Like morphinone reductase (37Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. and- Moody P.C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and PETN reductase (27Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), SYE1 has four extra barrel elements: (a) the N-terminal β-hairpin that closes the bottom of the barcapping subdomain formed by secondary structure elements between β3 and α3; (c) an α-helix linking β4 and α4, which in OPR1 (26Breithaupt C. Straβner J. Breitinger U. Huber R. Macheroux P. Schaller A. Clausen T. Structure. 2001; 9: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) is thought to aid in substrate recognition; and (d) the α-helix between β8 and α8 that contributes to the binding of FMN. In the course of refinement difference electron density maps showed clear additional density for three nonprotein elements: a PEG 400 molecule, a sulfate ion, and a β-octyl glucoside molecule (Fig. 1A). PEG 400 was an essential component of the crystallization condition and could be traced in the active site of SYE1 (Fig. 1C). OPR1 also binds PEG in the active site, but in that case the PEG molecule is doubly bent and resembles the substrate 12-oxophytodienoic acid. In SYE1 the PEG 400 molecule is extended, and only the first six atoms (corresponding to two ethylene glycol units) enter the active site tunnel, whereas the rest of the molecule bends around the hydrophobic active site entrance and extends outwards like the tail of a pig (Fig. 1C). Interactions between the PEG molecule and SYE1 are largely based on van der Waals' interactions with the hydrophobic lining of the active site. The sulfate ion and the β-octyl glucoside molecule participate in intermolecular contacts between two adjacent SYE1 molecules in the crystal lattice. The β-octyl glucoside molecule lies on one side parallel to His39 and is coordinated on the other side by Lys261 from a symmetry-related molecule. In contrast to the sugar ring, the tail of the β-octyl glucoside molecule is not well defined in the electron density maps. The sulfate ion is coordinated by His337 and Arg336 and by His344, Arg301, and Arg323 from a symmetry-related SYE1. The last two amino acids are involved in the coordination of the flavin phosphate oxygens. The overall structure of SYE1 superimposes well with a number of OYE homologues: morphinone reductase (1.2 Å r.m.s.d. over 344 Cα atoms), PETN reductase (1.3 Å r.m.s.d. over 347 Cα atoms), OPR1 (1.4 Å r.m.s.d. over 317 Cα atoms), OYE (1.6 Å r.m.s.d. over 293 Cα atoms), and YqjM (1.7 Å r.m.s.d. over 217 Cα atoms). The largest differences can be found in the capping subdomain and the loop between β6 and α6. The β-hairpin that connects the two β-strands of the capping subdomain is orientated in SYE1 toward the inside of the barrel. The Active Site Structure—The active site of SYE1 is composed of a narrow and shallow tunnel about 10–15 Å long and is lined by aromatic and hydrophobic residues. At its bottom, the tunnel opens up toward the flavin. Interestingly, Loop 6 4Loops are numbered after the β-strand they follow. Thus Loop 6 lies between β-strand 6 and α-helix 6. folds toward the center of the barrel and contributes to a significant part of the lining of the tunnel. This makes the tunnel markedly narrower than any other OYE characterized thus far, which is surprising given the high overall structural similarity with the bacterial homologues PETN reductase and morphinone reductase. We propose that this feature may be of functional importance. FMN is tightly bound in the protein and exhibits the lowest B-factors in the structure. The amino acids that contact the riboflavin moiety of FMN are conserved among the different known OYE structures (26Breithaupt C. Straβner J. Breitinger U. Huber R. Macheroux P. Schaller A.

O-2 makes an additional hydrogen bond with the amide of His181 and the guanidino group of Arg233 (Fig. 2A). Differences can be seen in the amino acids binding the ribityl hydroxyl groups and the phosphate oxygen atoms. The first two hydroxyl groups are each hydrogen-bonded to the guanidino group of Arg233, and to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Pro24 and a water molecule, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2063902873,"Ribonuclease E (RNase E) is a multifunctional endoribonuclease that has been evolutionarily conserved in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. X-ray crystallography and biochemical studies have concluded that the Escherichia coli RNase E protein functions as a homotetramer formed by Zn linkage of dimers within a region extending from amino acid residues 416 through 529 of the 116-kDa protein. Using fragments of RNase E proteins from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae, we show here that RNase E derivatives that are as short as 395 amino acid residues and that lack the Zn-link region shown previously to be essential for tetramer formation (i.e. amino acid residues 400–415) are catalytically active enzymes that retain the 5′ to 3′ scanning ability and cleavage site specificity characteristic of full-length RNase E and that also confer colony forming ability on rne null mutant bacteria. Further truncation leads to loss of these properties. Our results, which identify a minimal catalytically active RNase E sequence, indicate that contrary to current models, a tetrameric quaternary structure is not required for RNase E to carry out its core enzymatic functions.

Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that the genomes of E. coli and many other Proteobacteria encode both a type I RNase E/G enzyme, typically containing 900–1100 amino acid residues and having the ∼500-residue catalytic domain at the amino-terminal end, and a type IV family member (i.e. RNase G), consisting almost entirely of sequences conserved between the two enzymes in an ∼500-amino acid residue protein. However, other bacterial genomes encode only one RNase E/G homolog (26Lee K. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Kaberdin V.R. Miczak A.

Although all members of the RNase E/G family that have been experimentally studied cleave their substrates in A + U-rich regions, the substrate sites cleaved by RNase G and RNase E are not identical (9Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2878-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 25Tock M.R. Walsh A.P. Carroll G. McDowall K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8726-8732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, despite extensive homology between the catalytic domains of all members of the RNase E/G family, biochemical studies indicate that the RNase E of E. coli can degrade substrates quasi-processively in a 3′ to 5′ scanning mode, whereas RNase G from the same organism has a distributive mode of action (28Feng Y. Vickers T.A. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14746-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The evolutionarily conserved region of members of the RNase E/G family of enzymes is ∼500 amino acids in length, and a 498-residue amino-terminal RNase E fragment of the E. coli RNase E protein retains endoribonucleolytic activity in vitro (17McDowall K.J. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Bacteria expressing a shorter fragment consisting of residues 1–427 fused with the last 25 residues of the protein are reported to be viable, indicating that the conserved fragment is not required in its entirety for bacterial viability. However, these bacteria are less normal in mRNA degradation than a temperature-sensitive rne mutant at 37 °C and are nonviable at 44 °C (29Ow M.C. Liu Q. Kushner S.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 854-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of RNase E was solved using a fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1–529 (30Callaghan A.J. Marcaida M.J. Stead J.A. McDowall K.J. Scott W.G. Luisi B.F. Nature. 2005; 437: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It was shown that the 529-amino acid segment contains two domains that are joined by a Zn-link (amino acids 400–415). The Zn-link is required for RNase E to form a homotetrameric quaternary structure, and the formation of such tetramers has been thought to be required for the proper functioning of the enzyme (30Callaghan A.J.

Starting with the well studied 498-residue amino-terminal fragment of E. coli RNase E (N-Rne), 4The abbreviations used are: N-Rne, residues 1–498 of E. coli RNase E; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; BR30M, 30-mer 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide substrate with 2′-O-methylated nucleotides at positions 16 and 17; nt, nucleotide(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.4The abbreviations used are: N-Rne, residues 1–498 of E. coli RNase E; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; BR30M, 30-mer 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide substrate with 2′-O-methylated nucleotides at positions 16 and 17; nt, nucleotide(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. we constructed a series of rne gene deletions that truncate the protein from either end. Here we show that a peptide that extends 395 or 415 amino acids from the amino-terminal end of the RNase E proteins of E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae is (despite the lack of the Zn-link and the small homodimer-forming domain shown previously to be required for tetramer formation) sufficient for ribonuclease activity, cleavage site specificity, and 3′ to 5′ scanning of substrate in vitro, as well as for in vivo complementation of an rne null mutation. Our finding that such functions are mediated by these truncated proteins indicates that, contrary to current models, a tetrameric quaternary structure is not essential for the core enzymatic functions of RNase E.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Bacterial Strains—A plasmid encoding an E. coli N-Rne fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1–498 followed by a hexahistidine affinity tag and a thrombin cleavage site in a pET16b vector (Novagen) has been described (17McDowall K.J.

To construct a plasmid expressing a fragment of H. influenzae RNase E, the coding sequence for residues –16 to 476 5The original gene annotation for the H. influenzae rne gene, gi 16272362, which was initially used as the source of expression constructs for this work, was updated on May 22, 2003, to gi 30995373. The two annotations differ in the position of the predicted start codon for the protein; the predicted protein product from the first gene annotation has 16 amino-terminal residues that are absent in the second annotation. Swiss-Prot entry P44443 agrees with the second annotation. Hence, the second annotation was used throughout this manuscript, and proteins for which the amino-terminal residue corresponds to the start site of the first annotation are numbered as starting at residue –16. was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of strain KW20 (American Type Culture Collection 51907) and cloned into the intein-based expression vector pTYB4 (New England Biolabs) by ligation in a manner that added a Pro-Gly dipeptide at the carboxyl terminus of the final expressed protein product. The coding sequence for H. influenzae RNase G protein was introduced into the pTYB4 vector. Coding sequences for shorter fragments of the E. coli and H. influenzae RNase E enzymes were amplified from these plasmids and cloned by ligation into the intein-based expression plasmid pTYB1 (New England Biolabs) in a manner that left no extraneous residues on the carboxyl termini of the protein products.For complementation experiments, gene fragments were PCR-amplified using the plasmids described above as templates and were then introduced into the NotI- and XbaI-cleaved Ampr pRNG3 parental plasmid (10Lee K. Bernstein J.A. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) so that the expression of individual gene fragments is controlled by lacUV5 promoter. Specifically, fragments expressing E. coli RNase E residues 1 to 400 and 1 to 395, H. influenzae RNase E residues –16 to 476 and –16 to 399, E. coli RNase G residues 1 to 400, and H. influenzae RNase G residues 1 to 396 were cloned into the pRNG3 vector for complementation studies.Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Expression plasmids were introduced by transformation into E. coli BL21(DE3), and bacteria were grown at 30 °C to a cell density corresponding to A600 ∼ 0.5. Protein expression was induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and cells were incubated for an additional 18 h at 25 °C. E. coli RNase E (residues 1–498) with an amino-terminal histidine tag was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column purification. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole and were disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column previously charged and equilibrated with the same buffer. Supernatant was applied to the column, and the column was washed with ∼10 column volumes of a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with an elution buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 100 mm EDTA. The eluant was then dialyzed into a storage buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl.Cells containing intein-based expression constructs were disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a chitin affinity column, which was washed with 1–2 liters of lysis buffer. Intein cleavage was then induced by treatment with ∼50 mm dithiothreitol on the column, and the reaction was allowed to proceed to completion overnight. Protein was eluted and concentrated to an ∼200-μl volume and applied to a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) for gel filtration and buffer exchange into a storage buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl. Crystallization scans were carried out by standard methods (33McPherson A. Sci. Am. 1989; 260: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Gel Filtration Chromatography—Purified protein was dialyzed into gel filtration running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. A Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with running buffer and calibrated with blue dextran molecular weight ∼106 (void volume), bovine serum albumin 66 kDa, ovalbumin 44 kDa, and myoglobin 17 kDa. A 1-ml sample was loaded onto a size exclusion column at 4 °C with a flow rate at 1 ml/min, and protein elution was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm.Activity Assays—BR30M, a 30-mer oligoribonucleotide substrate containing 2′-O-methylated nucleotides at positions 16 and 17 was chemically synthesized as described previously (28Feng Y. Vickers T.A. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14746-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Endonuclease activity was assayed in 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C and stopped at each time point by removing a 6-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture and adding it to an equal volume of loading dye containing 80% (v/v) formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF. The reaction mixtures were then denatured at 85 °C for 3 min and analyzed by electrophoresis in 15% urea-acrylamide gels.In Vivo Complementation Assays—The Apr pRNG3-based plasmids into which segments coding for fragments of RNase E or RNase G proteins had been inserted were introduced by transformation into E. coli strain KSL2000 to test their ability to complement an rne deletion using methods described previously (10Lee K. Bernstein J.A. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rne null mutation of KSL2000 was initially complemented by a Kmr plasmid carrying the gene for full-length E. coli RNase E under the control of an arabinose promoter. After transformation with an Ampr plasmid encoding an RNase E or G fragment for which transcription was initiated at an IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter, cells were cultured on a LB plate containing 0.1% arabinose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The colonies picked from the LB plates were then inoculated into LB medium containing the same concentrations of arabinose, ampicillin, and kanamycin and grown to A600 = 0.6. At that cell density, 10 μl of 1:103 to 1:106 dilutions of bacteria were spotted onto LB plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and amounts of IPTG (1, 10, 100, or 1000 μm) sufficient to induce expression of the truncated RNase E/G peptide being tested (12Steege D.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1079-1090Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression and in Vitro Characterization of Stable Fragments of RNase E and RNase G—N-Rne has been employed previously for investigation of substrate specificity (14Huang H.

Cell. 2003; 114: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To identify the minimal domain that retained activity, additional constructs for expression of N-Rne fragments with deletions from either the amino or the carboxyl terminus were made (Fig. 1B) utilizing an intein-based expression and affinity purification methods (see “Experimental Procedures”). RNase E was predicted from its amino acid sequence to have an RNA-binding S1 domain (Pfam PF00575) near the amino terminus, spanning residues 35 to 119 (16Casarégola S. Jacq A. Laoudj D. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempête M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Diwa A.A. Jiang X. Schapira M. Belasco J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Constructs designed to produce a series of RNase E deletion variants lacking amino acid residues through the S1 domain were generated; specifically, residues 1–115, 1–129, and 1–163 were deleted in independent constructs. However, the protein fragments encoded by these constructs showed very low solubility and were found to form inclusion bodies when overexpressed in E. coli.Systematic deletions from the carboxyl terminus of N-Rne were made. A fragment consisting of residues 1–494 showed less aggregation than the His6-tagged 1–498 N-Rne fragment but also formed hetero-oligomers on gel filtration and failed to form crystals. Using a coarse deletion grid of ∼20 residues, we found that constructs spanning residues 1 to 400 (Rne 400) or 1 to 300 (Rne 300) produced soluble proteins, whereas constructs expressing fragments of intermediate lengths did not. A finer screening grid identified protein fragments consisting of residues 1–400 (Rne 400) and 1–395 (Rne 395) as being highly soluble. The carboxyl-terminal deletion proteins derived from E. coli N-Rne were assayed for endoribonuclease activity on the 30-nt BR30M substrate (Fig. 2A) used previously for studies of RNase E cleavage specificity and mode of action (28Feng Y. Vickers T.A. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14746-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). BR30M contains three repeats of a sequence that normally is susceptible to RNase E cleavage. However, in BR30M, there are 2′-O-methyl-modified nucleotides in the central repeat, preventing cleavage at that site. During quasi-processive RNase E scanning of BR30M from the 3′ to 5′ direction, transit of the endoribonuclease past the 2′-O-methyl-modified site is blocked, and only the cleavable sequence 3′ to the modified site is attacked, generating a 25-nt 5′-labeled cleavage fragment (28Feng Y. Vickers T.A. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14746-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that RNase E fragments as short as 395 residues showed the ability to generate the expected 25-nt fragment, albeit less well than the longer RNase E-derived peptides that we tested (Fig. 2B). A 300-residue peptide was devoid of detectable activity (Fig. 2B), as was one that was only five residues shorter than Rne 395 (data not shown). These findings indicate that truncations that result in RNase E peptides as short as Rne 395 retain the quasi-processive 3′ to 5′ scanning mode of action and cleavage site specificity that is intrinsic to E. coli Rne proteins containing the Zn-link region.FIGURE 2Endoribonuclease cleavage assay of N-terminal fragments of RNase E and its homologs.

A. 2002; 99: 14746-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with 2′-O-methyl modification of two nucleotides flanking the cleavage site of the second repeat (underlined). The sites of RNase E/G cleavage are indicated by a solid arrow; the open arrows indicate the sites that can be cleaved only by RNase G, which cleaves substrates in distributive mode with no directionality. The solid triangle indicates the site that is not cleaved, because of 2′-O-methylation. B, gel showing migration of the 32P-5′-labeled BR30M substrate and its cleavage products. Equal amounts of labeled substrate and 50 ng of each protein were used in the assay, and aliquots were taken at the indicated time points. For RNase E derivatives having quasi-processive activity, only the site at the 3′ end from modified nucleotides can be cleaved, as the enzyme cannot cleave and progress beyond the middle, modified site. This cleavage yields a major product of 25 nt. C, cleavage by fragments of RNase E homologs. The BR30M RNA substrate and 50 ng of protein were used for each assay. Only E. coli RNase G, which cleaves substrate randomly without directionality, can cleave BR30M at the 5′ end from the modified nucleotides (5 and 6 nt) (25Tock M.R. Walsh A.P. Carroll G.

All of these truncation fragments lacked the enzyme segment containing the Zn-link region required for tetramer formation by E. coli RNase E. As seen in Fig. 2B, the truncated –16 to 399 H. influenzae RNase E fragment showed the same cleavage site specificity and mode of action as a longer fragment, –16 to 476, which contains the Zn-link, and was even more active than E. coli Rne 494, yielding an additional cleavage at the adventitious site found earlier to be cut by highly active longer length RNase E derivatives (28Feng Y. Vickers T.A. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14746-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Equivalent minimal length fragments of H. influenzae Rng (1–396) (Fig. 2B) and E. coli Rng (data not shown) did not show enzymatic activity on this substrate.In Vivo Complementation of an rne Null Mutation in E. coli by RNase E and RNase G Fragments—The retention of in vitro endoribonuclease activity of truncated RNase E and G fragments prompted us to test their in vivo activity as assayed by their ability to confer colony forming ability on an E. coli strain carrying an rne null mutation. Using methods described previously (10Lee K. Bernstein J.A. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1445-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), plasmid-encoded ribonuclease proteins were expressed under control of a lacUV5 promoter regulated by IPTG added to the culture medium. The rne null mutation was complemented by E. coli Rne 395 in the presence of 10 μm IPTG, although cell growth was slower (Fig. 4). The H. influenzae RNase E fragment –16 to 476 also complemented the rne null mutation in the presence of 10 μm IPTG. The shorter H. influenzae protein fragment, consisting of residues –16 to 399, conferred colony forming ability only at IPTG concentrations of 100 mm or higher; and cells expressing the RNase G fragments, E. coli Rng 400 and H. influenzae Rng 396, were unable to form colonies even at an IPTG level of 1000 μm. Thus, the in vivo complementation ability correlated well with the in vitro catalytic activities observed for these ribonuclease variants.FIGURE 4In vivo complementation of an rne null mutation by expression of RNase E or G protein fragments.

Aor was further characterized as an Nrf2-regulated antioxidative enzyme that reduces carbon-carbon double bonds in a variety of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) is a reactive membrane lipid metabolite that activates multiple pathways, including Nrf2-mediated induction of cytoprotective enzymes. Physiologically, it is postulated that 15d-PGJ2 alkylates key regulatory proteins via the electrophilic carbon centers found in two α, β-unsaturated ketone moieties. This current study addresses the metabolism of 15d-PGJ2 by rat Aor (rAor) and subsequent deactivation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway by both rat and human AOR. We demonstrate that induction of NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase activity by 15d-PGJ2 is markedly attenuated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that overexpress rAor. Luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed these findings. Concentrations required for doubling the NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase response are increased from 1.8μm in wild-type to >10μm in rat Aor transgenic fibroblasts. 15d-PGJ2 is metabolized by recombinant rAor with a Km of 9.6 μm and kcat of 18.5 min-1. The major product is 12,13-dihydro-15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (dihydro-15d-PGJ2). The reduction of C=C by Aor yielding dihydro-15d-PGJ2 abolishes the inducibility in an antioxidant response element-driven luciferase assay. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 can be catabolized by Aor, thereby attenuating subsequent Nrf2 signaling and possibly inflammatory and apoptotic processes also influenced by 15d-PGJ2.

Prostaglandins are primarily derived from arachidonic acid following phospholipase-catalyzed release from membrane lipids. Arachidonic acid is converted by cyclooxygenases into PGH2, which is further metabolized into PGD2, PGE2, prostacyclin, or thromboxane via various prostaglandin synthases. PGD2 can undergo dehydration reactions to yield the J2 series of prostaglandins, including PGJ2, Δ12,14-PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2 (1Shibata T. Kondo M. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10459-10466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The J2 series of prostaglandins influences multiple signaling pathways by covalently binding with key signaling molecules (2Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Among them, 15d-PGJ2 has displayed highest potency as an inducer of gene expression. Discovered as an agonist for peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), 15d-PGJ2 was shown to modulate the expression of genes containing a peroxisome-proliferator response element in the promoter region, resulting in adipocyte differentiation (7Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). In addition, 15d-PGJ2 contains two α,β-unsaturated ketone moieties in tandem within its structure. These moieties covalently modify critical proteins in multiple pathways, such as IκB kinase, Thioredoxin, and Keap1 (3Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 6Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 745-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), resulting in altered protein complex conformations and, subsequently, the expression of effector genes. That 15d-PGJ2 may serve as an endogenous regulator of Nrf2 signaling is of particular interest. This pathway, centrally composed of two proteins, Keap1 and Nrf2, is responsible for the induction of many cytoprotective and antioxidative enzymes that form a natural defense system against assaults brought by electrophiles and oxidants. Nrf2 belongs to the cap' n' collar family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors. Keap1 is an actin-binding protein that sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm under basal conditions. Upon exposure to inducers, the Keap1-Nrf2 binding equilibrium is disrupted, followed by an increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, which in turn, heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins to enhance transcription of target genes via a cis-acting antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter regions. Animals with impaired Nrf2 expression display a greatly increased susceptibility toward chemically induced carcinogenesis (9Yu X. Kensler T. Mutat. Res. 2005; 591: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Chemicals that promote Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, such as sulforaphane, oltipraz, and triterpenoids, are under intensive study as experimental and clinical chemopreventive agents against chemically induced carcinogenesis (10Fahey J.W.

Alkenal/one oxidoreductase (Aor), originally discovered as a leukotriene B4-12-hydroxydehydrogenase in porcine kidney (13Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18128-18135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is highly inducible in rat liver following treatment with the chemopreventive agent D3T (14Primiano T. Gastel J.A. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was later found that, compared with dehydrogenase activity, Aor has a 100-fold higher reductase activity, thereby efficiently catalyzing the hydrogenation of the C=C double bond in a variety of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Such action reduces the key reactive centers, preventing electrophilic attack on macromolecules. Consequently, Aor has been shown to ameliorate acute cytotoxicity of 4-hydroxynonenal, a lipid peroxidation product and a α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, in cultured human embryonic kidney cells (15Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reactivity of 15d-PGJ2 lies in two α,β-unsaturated ketone moieties, one of which is located on the cyclopentenone ring. Both of these electrophilic carbons may attack nucleophilic centers found on protein side chains, such as the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues (16Perez-Sala D. Cernuda-Morollon E. Canada F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51251-51260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because at least one of these reactive centers can potentially serve as a substrate for Aor, in the present study we examined the possible deactivation by Aor of 15d-PGJ2 signaling through the Nrf2 pathway. Chemicals and Reagents—Prostaglandins were purchased from Cayman Chemicals Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. All solvents and chemicals were of analytical reagent grade or higher. Plasmid Construction—pCEP4-rAor and 3×NF-E2 luciferase plasmid pRBGP2 were previously constructed as described (17Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRL-TK containing a constitutive Renilla luciferase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Human AOR was PCR cloned from a human liver cDNA library (catalogue number 7113-1, Lot 1040535; Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to NCBI GenBank™ sequence (accession code NM_012212) using the following primer set: Forward, 5′-GTCGCGGAATTCAGCTTCAGGATGGTTCGTACTAAGACATGG, and Reverse, 5′-GTCGCGCTCGAGTTACTATCATGCTTTCACTATTGTCTTCCCC. PCR product was cleaned and ligated into pBlueScript between EcoRI and XhoI sites. The DNA insert was confirmed by sequencing and subcloned into episomal vector pCEP4. Expression of Aor in Escherichia coli and Purification—Recombinant rAor was purified as previously described with a few modifications (18Knight L.P. Primiano T. Groopman J.D. Kensler T.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, pTrcHisA containing rAor cDNA with a His6 tag at the N terminus was transformed into chemically competent E. coli strain BL21. Aor was expressed in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Recombinant Aor was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Elutions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions with >95% purity were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% Tween 20. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Aliquots were stored at -80 °C for up to 12 months without significant loss of enzymatic activity. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were derived from embryos of Nrf2 null or wild-type littermates (ICR strain), as well as rAor transgenic and corresponding wild-type (C57BL/6+DBA/2) MEFs. Fibroblasts were cultured in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose; Invitrogen). Both cell types were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Plasmids were transfected into 293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Measurement of Nqo1 Activities—MEF cells were seeded at 5000/well in 96-well microtiter plates 18 h before treatment with 15d-PGJ2 in complete growth medium. Nqo1 activity was measured using the “Prochaska” microtiter plate assay 48 h later (19Fahey J.W. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Stephenson K.K. Talalay P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Determination of Aor Enzymatic Activities in Cultured Cells—Cultured cells were collected and lysed in reaction buffer (0.5 × PBS, pH 7.2, 0.01% Triton X-100) by freezing and thawing three times. Cell lysates were subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to collect cytosolic fractions. Aor activities were determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the rate of NADPH oxidation at 340 nm as previously described (15Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using trans-2-nonenal as a substrate on a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer. Dual Luciferase Assay—3 × NF-E2 firefly luciferase plasmid and constitutive Renilla luciferase plasmids were co-transfected into 293 cells that had been selected after pCEP4 or pCEP4-Aor transient transfection. Cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates at 500,000 cells/well 18 h before treatment. 15d-PGJ2 dissolved in ethanol was added to fresh growth medium at a final concentration of 1-10 μm. Final ethanol concentration was kept <0.1%. 24 h after treatment, cells were washed with PBS prior to passive lysis. Harvested lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual Luciferase assay kit. The ratio of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities was used as the indicator for transcriptional activation. Enzymatic Assay and Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Enzymatic reactions were conducted in 0.5 × PBS supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and a saturating NADPH concentration of 150 μm. To measure the Km and kcat for 15d-PGJ2,10 μg of recombinant rAor was incubated with 4-120 μm 15d-PGJ2 at 37 °C with shaking. Reactions were terminated at 4, 8, and 12 min by the addition of ice-cold ethyl acetate containing 2 nmol piperine (internal standard). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min. The ethyl acetate fraction was removed, taken to dryness under vacuum, and redissolved in 60:40 acetonitrile/H2O. The piperine and remaining 15d-PGJ2 were separated using a Waters 510 HPLC system equipped with a 996 photodiode array detector monitoring 306 and 340 nm. Separation of piperine and 15d-PGJ2 was achieved using a 4.6 μm × 250 mm Luna C18 column (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) at a 1 ml/min hyperbolic gradient of 60 to 100% acetonitrile in water. Initial velocities were calculated from the consumption of 15d-PGJ2 over time, and the GraphPad Prism 4 program was used to compute the Km and kcat values via hyperbolic regression analysis. Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was conducted using a ThermoFinnigan Deca electrospray mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 1 × 15 mm Luna column eluted at 20 μl/min using a gradient as described above. Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were generated from the appropriately positively charged parent ion (m/z = 301.1, 299.1) using helium as a collision gas. Gene Expression Analysis—Wild-type 293 cells were treated by replacing medium with that containing 7.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 or ethanol as vehicle control. Total RNA was isolated 8 h after treatment using a Versagene RNA purification kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and cDNA was synthesized using the iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Gene expression measurements were performed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad). Data from real-time quantitative PCR was analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt relative quantification method as previously described (20Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript level was found to remain unchanged in both vehicle and 15d-PGJ2-treated cells. Hence, it was used for normalization. Immunoblotting—293 cells were seeded onto 6-well culture plates at 1 million cells/well 18 h before treatment with 7.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 in the growth medium. After a 16-h incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation following trypsinization. Cells were then resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with the Complete protease inhibitor mixture. After a 15-min incubation on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to the suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.6%. The suspension was then vortexed and nuclei collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Nuclear fractions were resuspended in loading buffer containing 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to ECL Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection was performed using rabbit Nrf2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum (Bio-Rad). ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for chemiluminescent detection. Statistical Analysis—Non-linear regression computation was conducted using SigmaPlot 9.0 software. Statistical comparison was performed using one-way analysis of variance. 15d-PGJ2-inducible Nqo1 Activity Is Blocked in Both Nrf2 Null and rAor Transgenic MEF Cells—Nqo1 is known to be inducible via the Nrf2-mediated pathway (21Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). To examine whether 15d-PGJ2 induces Nqo1 gene transcription, MEF derived from Nrf2 null and rAor transgenic animals, along with their corresponding wild-type counterparts, were incubated with graded concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1). The wild-type MEF showed a strong dose-dependent induction of Nqo1 activity following treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (R2 > 0.98). The difference in the magnitudes of responses to 15d-PGJ2 in the wild-type MEF cell lines may reflect the different genetic backgrounds of the cells. The wild-type cells used in Fig. 1A were established from ICR mice, whereas the ones in Fig. 1B were derived from mice of mixed C57BL/6 and DBA/2 background. Interestingly, the inducibility of Nqo1 by 15d-PGJ2 was abrogated in both Nrf2 null and rAor transgenic MEF. The lack of effect in the Nrf2 null cells highlights the importance of Nrf2 in the induction of Nqo1, whereas the loss of inducibility in rAor transgenic cells indicates that overexpression of rAor disrupts 15d-PGJ2 signaling in the Nrf2-inducible pathway. Overexpression of Rat and Human Aor Blocks Nrf2-mediated Cytoprotective Enzyme Induction in 293 Cells—Previous studies demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 could form adducts with Keap1 in rat macrophages (6Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y. Ishii T. Shibata T. Kawamoto Y. Kelly V. Sekizawa K. Uchida K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and promoted nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in 293 cells (22Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To investigate whether overexpression of rat and human Aor blocks 15d-PGJ2-induced, Nrf2-regulated gene transcription, an ARE luciferase reporter gene system was utilized. 293 cells were transfected with an episomal Aor (rat or human)-expressing vector (pCEP4-rAor, pCEP4-human AOR) or a control vector (pCEP4). Transfected cells were then selected by addition of hygromycin to the growth medium. Following selection, cells were co-transfected with a vector containing a 3 × NF-E2-driven luciferase sequence and a vector constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase. Cells were then incubated with 0.5-10 μm 15d-PGJ2 as indicated, and luciferase activities were measured 24 h later. The ratios of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities are shown in Fig. 2A. 293 cells containing the empty vector displayed a strong dose-dependent response to 15d-PGJ2 treatment (R2 > 0.98), and the concentration required to double the expression of the reporter was less than 2 μm. 15d-PGJ2 induction of the NF-E2-driven reporter was substantially repressed in both Aor-transfected cells. D3T is a potent inducer of Nqo1 that activates Nrf2 signaling but is not a substrate for Aor. Expression of the luciferase reporter induced by D3T in the wild-type, rAor-, and human AOR-overexpressing cells reached 8.5-, 8.3-, and 6.6-fold, respectively (n = 3, p > 0.6), indicating Aor overexpression itself did not affect Keap1-Nrf2 signaling. Induction of native Nqo1 transcripts was also analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in wild-type and Aor-overexpressing 293 cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2. Nqo1 transcript levels were significantly induced in wild-type cells yet showed little change in Aor-overexpressing cells compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2B). Mechanistically, this may be explained by the changes in Nrf2 nuclear localization (Fig. 2C). Nuclear extracts from wild-type cells showed a significantly higher accumulation of Nrf2 after administration of 15d-PGJ2, whereas in comparison modest changes were observed in Aor-overexpressing cells. These data further bolstered the results from luciferase assay and indicated that the overexpression of Aor attenuates activation of Nrf2 signaling by 15d-PGJ2. Metabolite of 15d-PGJ2 Fails to Induce Nrf2-mediated Transcription—To investigate the hypothesis that 15d-PGJ2 loses its inducibility due to metabolism by Aor, 15d-PGJ2 was added to recombinant rAor with and without the co-factor NADPH, followed by measurement of inductive efficacy in the ARE luciferase assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, UV-visible spectrophotometry indicated that most of the 15d-PGJ2 in the -NADPH reaction was recovered whereas the majority of the 15d-PGJ2 was metabolized by rAor in the presence of NADPH. Wild-type 293 cells transfected with luciferase reporter were then treated with equal molar amounts of recovered 15d-PGJ2 or metabolite at the concentrations indicated. 15d-PGJ2 recovered from the -NADPH reaction effectively activated Nrf2, whereas the metabolite was unable to invoke a response with the ARE luciferase reporter (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that metabolism by Aor deactivates 15d-PGJ2, thereby blunting activation of Nrf2 signaling. In Vitro Metabolism of 15d-PGJ2 by Aor—To characterize the metabolite formed from 15d-PGJ2 by Aor, 10 nmol 15d-PGJ2 was incubated with 10 μg of recombinant rAor and NADPH (150 μm) in the reaction buffer (0.5× PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and terminated at 10 and 20 min. 15d-PGJ2 has a maximum absorbance at 306 nm as indicated by the UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 4B). Chromatography monitored at 306 nm showed a time-dependent disappearance of the 15d-PGJ2 peak, which eluted at 9.2 min. Piperine, used as the internal standard during the ethyl acetate extraction, eluted at 7 min (Fig. 4A). The metabolite eluted very close to 15d-PGJ2 itself, and separation was difficult to optimize. Because of the significant absorbance of 15d-PGJ2 at the λmax of the metabolite (Fig. 4B), only substrate disappearance was measured instead of product formation for further kinetic calculation. Km and kcat values were obtained and are listed in Table 1. The Km for rAor was determined to be 9.6 μm, which is in accordance with previous studies showing tight binding between Aor and 15-oxo-prostaglandin E1 with a Km value of 10 μm (15Dick R.A. Kwak M.K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). kcat is a modest 18.5 min-1, much lower that of 2400 min-1 for 15-oxo-prostaglandin E1. The lower catalytic activity is likely because of the different position of the C=C double bond in relation to the cofactor NADPH, resulting in a less efficient hydride transfer. In comparison with other Aor substrates, metabolism of 15d-PGJ2 carries modest catalytic rigor and extremely high binding affinity (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic constants of 15d-PGJ2 as a substrate for rAor in comparison with other substrates Enzymatic measurements were conducted at pH 7.2 using NADPH as a cofactor. *, Ref. 15Dick R.A.

After the reaction reached completion, the metabolite was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried down, and reconstituted in mobile phase. Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was conducted on a ThermoFinnigan Deca LCQ mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode. Two mass units were found to be added to 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 5A), which corresponds to a single reduction on a C=C double bond. This could either occur on position 9,10 or 12,13. Because our previous study indicated that Aor prefers the stereo localization of a C=C double bond in a cis position to the carbonyl group to that in a trans position (23Dick R.A. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we suspected the single reduction occurred at carbons of 12,13 position rather than those of 9,10 position. To further verify this hypothesis, we conducted metabolism studies using 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2 as a substrate. This analog is structurally identical to 15d-PGJ2 except for the lack of the C=C double bond at the 9,10 position. PGJ2, which is missing the 12,13 double bond, was also used as a substrate (Fig. 5B). Dihydro-15d-PGJ2 displayed similar enzymatic constants to 15d-PGJ2 with a Km of 20 μm and a kcat of 120 min-1, whereas PGJ2 was metabolized minimally by Aor. Collectively, the results indicate that Aor converts 15d-PGJ2 to 12,13-dihydro-15d-PGJ2 in vitro. This finding is consistent with the recent resolution of the crystal structure of guinea pig Aor by Hori et al. (24Hori T. Yokomizo T. Ago H. Sugahara M. Ueno G. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Shimizu T.

Using 15-oxo-PGE2 as a substrate, only the ω-chain of the substrate (C12-C20) was defined in the electron density of the active site. This observation indicated that the C=C double bond at 12,13 position is likely to be in a closer proximity to NADPH than the C=C at the 9,10 position, resulting in a higher efficiency in hydride transfer. Nrf2 plays a pivotal role in coordinating the expression of multiple classes of genes in response to environmental stresses and endogenous signals (25Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H.

https://openalex.org/W2112821215,"Ligand probes with fluorescent indicators positioned throughout the pharmacophoric domain can provide important insights into the molecular basis of receptor binding and activation as reflected in the microenvironment of each indicator while docked at a receptor. We developed three cholecystokinin-like probes with Aladan situated at the N terminus, in the mid-region, and at the C terminus (positions 24, 29, and 33, respectively). These were studied in solution and docked at type A and B cholecystokinin receptors. This study demonstrated clear differences in mechanisms of cholecystokinin binding and activation of these structurally related receptors with distinct agonist structure-activity relationships. The fluorescence characteristics of Aladan are highly sensitive to the polarity of its microenvironment. The mid-region probe was least accessible to the aqueous milieu as determined by fluorescence emission spectra and iodide quenching, which was not altered by changes in conformation from active to inactive. Accessibility of the N- and C-terminal probes was affected by receptor conformation. The position 24 probe was more easily quenched in the active than in the G protein-uncoupled conformation for both receptors. However, the position 33 probe docked at the type A cholecystokinin receptor was more easily quenched in the active conformation, whereas the same probe docked at the type B cholecystokinin receptor was more easily quenched in the inactive conformation. Fluorescence anisotropy and red edge excitation shift determinations confirmed these observations and supported the proposed movements. Although both type A and B cholecystokinin receptors bind cholecystokinin with high affinity, resulting in fully efficacious biological responses, these receptors utilize distinct molecular modes of binding.

Although both type A and B cholecystokinin receptors bind cholecystokinin with high affinity, resulting in fully efficacious biological responses, these receptors utilize distinct molecular modes of binding. The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is remarkable for the extraordinary structural diversity of natural agonist ligands that bind with high affinity and specificity to initiate signaling cascades. A plausible phylogeny that describes all of these receptors having evolved from a single common ancestral precursor has been proposed (1Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Receptors & Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest, included in this organization are families and subfamilies of receptors that bind and are activated by structurally related ligands that often can be similarly shown to evolve from a common precursor as well. Indeed, these insights have been the basis for the identification of the natural ligands that activate receptors with previous “orphan” status (2van Kesteren R.E. Tensen C.P. Smit A.B. van Minnen J. Kolakowski L.F. Meyerhof W. Richter D. van Heerikhuizen H. Vreugdenhil E. Geraerts W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3619-3626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The stimulus and basis of the co-evolution of these ligands and receptors have been discussed (3Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 4Schmitz F. Pratt D.S. Wu M.J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. Kopin A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 436-441PubMed Google Scholar), but remain poorly understood. In this work, we have studied the molecular basis of the binding of a common natural agonist peptide ligand and its activation of two closely related G protein-coupled receptors, the type A and B cholecystokinin (CCK) 2The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; REES, red edge excitation shift(s); GppNHp, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate trisodium salt; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.2The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; REES, red edge excitation shift(s); GppNHp, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate trisodium salt; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. receptors. These receptors share ∼55% homology and are members of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family. Both are physiologically important, present on various target tissues. The type A CCK receptor is involved in regulation of pancreatic secretion and gallbladder contraction as well as postcibal satiety (5Mutt V. Peptides (N.Y.). 1981; 2: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The type B CCK receptor mediates gastric acid secretion, enteric motility, and certain behavioral responses, e.g. it has been implicated in panic disorder (6Rehfeld J.F. Regul. Pept. 2000; 93: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have explored the characteristics of an indicator fluorophore situated in distinct positions throughout the pharmacophore of CCK while docked at the type A and B CCK receptors in active and inactive (G protein-uncoupled state) conformations. In addition to the traditional measurements of fluorescence spectra, quenching, and anisotropy of the indicator, we have also applied measurements of red edge excitation shifts (REES) as an indication of the microenvironment of this fluorophore while docked at these receptors. The latter technique has not previously been applied to a membrane receptor. This study has demonstrated clear differences in the fluorescence characteristics of the Aladan indicator in some positions along the CCK pharmacophore when bound to the type A compared with the type B CCK receptor. Similarly, conformational changes in each of these receptors resulted in distinct changes in the fluorescence properties of these indicators. This was also reflected in the REES determinations. All of these measurements were confirmatory and complementary to each other, providing a clear picture of the microenvironment of distinct positions along full agonist peptide ligands docked at these receptors. Although both the type A and B CCK receptors bind CCK with high affinity, resulting in fully efficacious biological responses, these related receptors appear to utilize distinct molecular modes of binding. Materials—Synthetic cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (Belmont, CA). Cell dissociation medium and guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate trisodium salt (GppNHp) were from Sigma. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was from Invitrogen. Fetal Clone II culture medium supplement was from HyClone (Logan, UT). All other reagents were analytical grade. Peptide Synthesis—Based on established structure-activity considerations (7Miller L.J. Rosenzweig S.A. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12417-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three fluorescent CCK receptor probes incorporating Aladan (N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester) in distinct sites distributed throughout the pharmacophore were designed and prepared in this study. These incorporated the fluorescent indicator into the N terminus (position 24), the middle of the peptide (position 29), and the C terminus (position 33) of the ligand (Fig. 1). The parental peptide, Gly-[Nle28,31]CCK-(26–33), was prepared by manual mixed solid- and solution-phase synthesis as we described previously (8Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For each of the fluorescent probes, Aladan was synthesized as described previously (9Cohen B.E. McAnaney T.B. Park E.S. Jan Y.N. Boxer S.G. Jan L.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and incorporated in Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected form during solid-phase synthesis. Each synthetic product was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (8Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and its identity was established by mass spectrometry. Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing the type A and B CCK receptors were used as sources of receptor in this study. These cells have been characterized previously to establish their normal binding and biological activity characteristics (10Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J.

Cells were grown in a humidified environment in Costar tissue culture plasticware containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone II. Preparation of Cell Membranes—A particulate fraction enriched in plasma membranes was prepared from confluent CCK receptor-expressing cells as described previously (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested mechanically using a cell scraper and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, suspended in 0.3 m sucrose containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication for 10 s at setting 7 using a Sonifier cell disruptor (Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Plainview, NY). The final sucrose concentration of the cell homogenate was adjusted to 1.3 m, and the homogenate was placed at the bottom of the centrifuge tube and subsequently overlaid with 0.3 m sucrose prior to centrifugation at 225,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The fraction enriched in plasma membranes was harvested at the interface between 0.3 and 1.3 m sucrose; resuspended in Krebs-Ringer HEPES medium containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and stored at –80 °C until used. Characterization of Receptor Probes—Functional characterization of the Aladan-containing probes was performed by monitoring their ability to bind to the CCK receptor and to stimulate intracellular calcium responses in receptor-bearing cells. Receptor binding assays were performed using cell membranes, Krebs-Ringer HEPES medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1–2 pm CCK-like radioligand (125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[Nle28,31]CCK-(26–33)) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled fluorescent peptides as described previously (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to achieve saturable binding, followed by separation of bound and free radioligands using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with receptor-binding filter mats. Bound radioactivity was quantified with a γ-spectrometer. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (13Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar), and specific binding data were illustrated using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting routine in the Prism 4.0 software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The abilities of the probes to stimulate intracellular calcium responses in receptor-bearing cells were investigated utilizing a previously characterized calcium assay (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18552-18560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For this, semiconfluent cells were detached from the dishes using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution and washed with Ham's F-12 medium. Cells were then loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Approximately 2 million cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of agonist at 37 °C, and the fluorescence intensities were measured in a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) using a multigroup spectral acquisition profile. Emission data were collected over 300 s with 5-s increments at an integration rate of 0.05 nm/s. Calcium responses were determined after excitation at 340 and 380 nm, with emission collected at 520 nm (14Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectrometry—The fluorescence properties of the Aladan probes were determined both in solution and bound to receptor. The receptor-bound state of the probes was determined both in the active conformation, stimulated by agonist occupancy, and in the G protein-uncoupled inactive state, established by exposure to 10 μm GppNHp, a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. Samples were prepared by mixing cell membranes (50 μg of membrane protein) with 100 nm fluorescent ligand at room temperature for 20 min in Krebs-Ringer HEPES medium. The suspension was then cooled, and ligand-bound membranes were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. This fraction was then washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES medium for measurement. Fluorescence measurements were performed as quickly as possible. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out in a SPEX Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with Datamax 2.2 software. The emission spectra were acquired from 400 to 600 nm after excitation at 362 nm using 4.00-nm band pass filters at an integration rate of 0.5 nm/s. Emission spectra were corrected by subtracting the blank spectra from the sample spectra. Fluorescence Collisional Quenching Experiments—Collisional quenching studies were performed using the hydrophilic quenching reagent potassium iodide (KI) as described previously (15Harikumar K.G. Clain J. Pinon D.I. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1044-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For this, the fluorescence of receptor-bound probes was monitored in a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer using the constant wavelength analysis profile of Datamax 2.2. The fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths for each condition were collected at an integration time of 10 s using two repetitions of data acquisition (see Table 2). The maximal fluorescence intensities were recorded after sequential additions of KI (1 m aqueous stock solution incorporating 10 mm Na2S2O3) with a delay time of 10 s. The effect of ionic strength was calculated by measuring the fluorescence of a control sample using potassium chloride. Corrected fluorescence data were calculated by subtracting the blank values and were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation: F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KSV) was determined from the slope of F0/F as a function of the quencher concentration ([I–]).TABLE 2Solvatochromatic effect of fluorescent probesDielectric ConstantEmission maximumAladan24-CCKAladan29-CCKAladan33-CCKnmAladan probe in solventWater80558533533Buffer530530532Acetonitrile36.6512501501Methanol33521504509Ethanol24512493503Isopropyl alcohol20.1508493503Aladan probe bound to type A and B CCK receptorsCHO-CCKAR510498525CHO-CCKBR524495505 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence anisotropy was measured as described previously (15Harikumar K.G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 1044-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using an L-format-based single channel Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with an automatic polarizer and a thermostatically adjusted cuvette holder. Emission and excitation polarizing filters were aligned for 55° and 0°, respectively. Fluorescence polarization measurements were performed in a constant wavelength analysis profile using 10-s integration times and two sets of data acquisition. Emission measurement was carried out by adjusting the excitation side polarizer in a vertical position and the emission side polarizer in horizontal and vertical positions. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 362 nm, and the emission wavelength was fixed at the optimal wavelength as listed in Table 2 for each receptor and probe. Fluorescence polarization and anisotropy data were collected at 4, 20, and 37 °C in the absence and presence of GppNHp to manipulate the G protein-coupled and -uncoupled states of the type A and B CCK receptors. Anisotropy was calculated as described previously (15Harikumar K.G. Clain J. Pinon D.I. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1044-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). REES Determinations—REES is the property exhibited by some polar fluorophores when their emission spectra shift toward higher wavelengths in response to excitation at higher wavelengths of light (16Chattopadhyay A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Chattopadhyay A. Rawat S.S. Kelkar D.A. Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2389-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Kelkar D.A. Chattopadhyay A. Chakrabarti A. Bhattacharyya M. Biopolymers. 2005; 77: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This property is believed to reflect relatively slow solvent relaxation around the excited state of the fluorophore and to be dependent on the motional restriction of molecules surrounding the fluorophore. Unlike other fluorescence properties (such as anisotropy and quenching) that provide information about the probe itself, REES provides information about the microenvironment of the fluorophore (16Chattopadhyay A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We examined the property of REES for Aladan probes in solution and while docked at CCK receptors in active and inactive conformations. Fluorescence measurements were carried out as described above except that probes were excited at multiple wavelengths (362, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, and 420 nm using 4.00-nm band pass filters at an integration rate of 0.5 nm/s) rather than just at the optimal wavelength for the particular probe under the specific conditions. Emission spectra were collected from 420 to 600 nm. Blank spectra were collected under the same conditions in the absence of probe and were used for correction. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using Student's t test for unpaired values. Significant differences were considered to be at the p < 0.05 level. Functional Characterization of Fluorescent Probes—The three fluorescent CCK probes were synthesized and purified to homogeneity, and their structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Each probe was shown to bind to the type A CCK receptor in a saturable high affinity manner (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Binding to the type B CCK receptor was more substantially affected by incorporation of Aladan, particularly at positions 29 and 33, although the specificity and saturability of this binding were clearly established (Fig. 2 and Table 1).TABLE 1Binding and signaling characteristics of Aladan probesLigandKiBmaxStimulation of intracellular Ca2+ EC50nmpmol/mg proteinnmCHO-CCKARCCK3.7 ± 0.70.50 ± 0.160.2 ± 0.1Aladan24-CCK0.7 ± 0.20.63 ± 0.190.8 ± 0.1Aladan29-CCK3.9 ± 1.50.56 ± 0.132.0 ± 0.3Aladan33-CCK6.0 ± 1.80.96 ± 0.472.1 ± 0.6CHO-CCKBRCCK0.8 ± 0.20.83 ± 0.150.5 ± 0.1Aladan24-CCK1.9 ± 0.20.23 ± 0.021.0 ± 0.1Aladan29-CCK26 ± 1.50.33 ± 0.022.3 ± 0.8Aladan33-CCK330 ± 410.46 ± 0.0456.2 ± 1.7 Open table in a new tab The abilities of each of these probes to stimulate intracellular calcium responses in CHO cell lines expressing the type A and B CCK receptors are also shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Each of the probes was able to elicit a full biological response in the type A CCK receptor-bearing cells, although the position 29 and 33 probes had lower potencies compared with natural CCK or the position 24 probe. Potencies were also affected in parallel with binding affinities in the type B CCK receptor-bearing cells, although each was a fully efficacious agonist. Fluorescence Characterization of Probes—The fluorescence characteristics of Aladan are quite sensitive to the polarity of the environment in which it resides. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, in which the emission spectrum of one of the Aladan-containing CCK probes is shown to shift related to the solvent in which it was dissolved (true for each of the probes). The intensity of fluorescence increased, and the maximal emission shifted in the blue wavelength direction with decreasing polarity of the solvent (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This is similar to what has been described for Prodan, a fluorophore that is structurally related to Aladan (9Cohen B.E. McAnaney T.B. Park E.S. Jan Y.N. Boxer S.G. Jan L.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 19Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 also illustrates the emission spectra of each of the three probes when bound to the type A and B CCK receptors. It is noteworthy that the emission maxima for a single probe such as Aladan33-CCK could be quite different when bound to each of these receptors (emission maximum of 525 nm when bound to the type A CCK receptor and 505 nm when bound to the type B CCK receptor). In contrast, another probe (Aladan29-CCK) was observed to have similar emission maxima when bound to both receptors (498 and 495 nm for the type A and B CCK receptors, respectively), whereas a third probe (Aladan24-CCK) actually varied in the opposite direction (maxima of 510 and 524 nm for the type A and B CCK receptors, respectively). Collisional Quenching of Fluorescence—Fluorescence quenching studies with KI were performed to characterize the environment of the fluorescent probes docked at CCK receptors in the active and G protein-uncoupled inactive states. The status of G protein coupling was modified by agonist occupation in the absence or presence of GppNHp, a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. We showed previously that CCK receptors are converted from their active states into their G protein-uncoupled inactive states in the presence of 10 μm GppNHp (15Harikumar K.G. Clain J. Pinon D.I. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1044-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Stern-Volmer collisional quenching plots for each probe bound to the type A and B CCK receptors are shown in Fig. 4 and the quenching constants (KSV) are listed in Table 3.TABLE 3Fluorescent quenching constants (with KI) for receptor-bound Aladan probesLigandKSV—GppNHp (active state)+GppNHp (inactive state)m-1CHO-CCKARAladan24-CCK5.17 ± 0.592.24 ± 0.46ap < 0.001 for KSV values for the G protein-uncoupled inactive versus active state of the CCK receptor for the same probe.Aladan29-CCK3.28 ± 0.273.33 ± 0.29Aladan33-CCK7.11 ± 0.494.25 ± 0.24ap < 0.001 for KSV values for the G protein-uncoupled inactive versus active state of the CCK receptor for the same probe.CHO-CCKBRAladan24-CCK4.10 ± 0.312.30 ± 0.22ap < 0.001 for KSV values for the G protein-uncoupled inactive versus active state of the CCK receptor for the same probe.Aladan29-CCK4.27 ± 0.413.83 ± 0.28Aladan33-CCK1.53 ± 0.692.50 ± 0.34bp < 0.05 for KSV values for the G protein-uncoupled inactive versus active state of the CCK receptor for the same probe.a p < 0.001 for KSV values for the G protein-uncoupled inactive versus active state of the CCK receptor for the same probe.b p < 0.05 for KSV values for the G protein-uncoupled inactive versus active state of the CCK receptor for the same probe. Open table in a new tab The fluorescent ligands with Aladan at the N terminus (Aladan24-CCK) and C terminus (Aladan33-CCK) of CCK were more accessible to iodide quenching compared with the probe having the fluorescent indicator in the mid-region of the peptide (Aladan29-CCK). Of note, there were no significant differences in the fluorescence quenching between active and G protein-uncoupled inactive states with Aladan positioned in the mid-region of the peptide (Aladan29-CCK) for both type A and B CCK receptors. For both position 24 and 33 probes, there were significant differences, with both more easily quenched by KI in the type A CCK receptor in the active compared with G protein-uncoupled inactive state. The quenching of the position 24 and 33 probes was significantly different when docked at the type B CCK receptor in the active and inactive states, but in opposite directions (Table 3). Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence anisotropy reflects the rotational freedom of fluorescent probes. Fig. 5 illustrates the anisotropy of each of the three probes when bound to the type A and B CCK receptors in the active and G protein-uncoupled inactive states. These values were inversely proportional to temperature. As can be seen from the data in Fig. 5, anisotropy values were significantly lower for Aladan24 probes when bound to the type A or B CCK receptor in the active compared with the G protein-uncoupled inactive state. These observations support that, during activation of the receptor, the probes were more mobile and located in a more polar environment compared with the G protein-uncoupled inactive state. For Aladan33-CCK probes, anisotropy measurements showed significant increases in the mobility of the probes in the active compared with the G protein-uncoupled inactive state for the type A CCK receptor, whereas for the type B CCK receptor, during activation, the mobility of the probes significantly decreased. Anisotropy values for the Aladan33-CCK probe when bound to the type B CCK receptor were significantly lower in the presence of GppNHp compared with its active (agonist-occupied) state. REES Determinations—Shown in Fig. 6 are the REES data for each probe in solution and when bound to each of the CCK receptors. There was little or no significant REES observed when the probes were in solution, and their emissions were at the longest wavelengths observed under any condition independent of the excitation wavelength used. In contrast, when bound to the type A or B CCK receptor, significant REES was observed for each of the probes. For the position 29 probe, the absolute emission and the REES were quite similar when bound to either the type A or B CCK receptor in the active or G protein-uncoupled inactive state. For the position 24 probe, the emission was at a higher wavelength when bound to the type B compared with the type A CCK receptor. The REES was greater for this probe when bound to either receptor in its G protein-uncoupled inactive state. For the position 33 probe, the emission was at a higher wavelength when bound to the type A compared with the type B CCK receptor. Of particular interest, the REES was greater for this probe when bound to the type A CCK receptor in its G protein-uncoupled inactive state, but showed no differences related to state of the type B CCK receptor. Understanding the molecular basis of ligand binding and activation of receptors is an important step toward the rational design and refinement of receptor-active drugs. Although the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is currently the target of the largest number of approved drugs, most of these were developed after identification of a lead compound in a high throughput candidate screening program. Insights into the mechanism of action of these drugs should provide opportunities for further refinement, including adding levels of specificity and even selectivity of subsequent signaling events initiated by receptor binding. Theoretically, this can even be extended to other structurally similar members of this family, including both receptors with identified natural ligands and orphan receptors sharing structural homology and, presumably, sharing drugable pockets a"

This predisposes apoB100 to ubiquitinylation and targeting for proteasomal degradation. It has been suggested that pause transfer sequences (PTS) present throughout apoB cause inefficient translocation. On the other hand, our previous study demonstrated that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 is dependent on the presence of a β-sheet domain between 29 and 34% of full-length apoB100 (Liang, J.-S., Wu, X., Jiang, H., Zhou, M., Yang, H., Angkeow, P., Huang, L.-S., Sturley, S. L., and Ginsberg, H. N. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 35216–35221); this region of apoB has no PTS. However, the effects of the β-sheet domain may require the presence of PTS elsewhere in the N-terminal region of apoB100. To further investigate the roles of PTS and β-sheet domains in the translocation of apoB100 across the ER, we transfected McArdle RH7777, HepG2, or Chinese hamster ovary cells with human albumin (ALB)/human apoB chimeric cDNA constructs: ALB/B12–17 (two PTS but no β-sheet), ALB/B29–34 (β-sheet but no PTS), ALB/B36–41 (two PTS and a β-sheet), and ALB/B49–54 (neither PTS nor a β-sheet). ALB/ALB1–40 served as a control. Compared with ALB/ALB1–40, secretion rates of ALB/B12–17, ALB/B29–34, and ALB/B36–41 were reduced. Secretion of ALB/B49–54 was similar to that of ALB/ALB1–40. However, only ALB/B29–34 and ALB/B36–41 had increased proteinase K sensitivity, ubiquitinylation, and increased physical interaction with Sec61α. These results indicate that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 is determined mainly by the presence of β-sheet domains.

PTS do not appear to affect translocation, but may affect secretion by other mechanisms. ApoB100 is the major structural protein of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins. Elevated plasma levels of these lipoproteins are associated with an increased risk factor of atherosclerosis (1J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 2486-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24461) Google Scholar). ApoB100 is a large hydrophobic protein of 4536 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼520 kDa and is synthesized in the liver (2Cladaras C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Zannis V.I.

Models of the secondary structure of apoB100 contain three α-helical domains (1–22, 48–56, and 89–100% of apoB100) and two long β-sheet domains (22–48 and 56–89%) (3Segrest J.P. Jones M.K.

Other studies have indicated that the first 17% of the N-terminal end of apoB100 has a lipoprotein lipase-binding domain (5Yang C.-Y. Chen S.-H. Gianturco S.H. Bradley W.A. Sparrow J.T. Tanimura M.

Nature. 1986; 323: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), that the domain between 66 and 83% of full-length apoB100 is the low density lipoprotein receptor-binding domain (6Milne R. Theolis Jr., R. Maurice R. Pease R.J. Weech P.K. Rassart E. Fruchart J.C. Scott J. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19754-19760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that sequences between 1 and 5.8% and between 9 and 16% of apoB100 contain binding sites for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (7Wu X.

Studies by numerous laboratories have demonstrated several points along the intracellular itinerary of apoB100 where it can be targeted for either lipoprotein assembly and secretion or degradation (10Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), unlike typical secretory proteins, which are efficiently and completely translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PTS, pause transfer sequence(s); OA, oleic acid; McA, McArdle RH7777; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ALB, albumin; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MEM, minimal essential medium; PK, proteinase K. and then efficiently secreted (9Rapoport T.A. Science. 1992; 258: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The initial site of regulation of apoB100 occurs during its cotranslational translocation across the ER membrane. Thus, if microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity and core lipid availability are adequate, nascent apoB100, like typical secretory proteins, is translocated efficiently across the ER membrane. Then it can be assembled, with lipids, into an apoB lipoprotein in the ER lumen and secreted into the medium (10Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 11Shelness G.S. Ingram M.F. Huang X.F. DeLozier J.A. J.

If instead there is inadequate core lipid or microsomal triglyceride transfer protein is defective, cotranslational translocation of apoB100 across the ER is inefficient, and significant amounts of newly synthesized apoB100 can be degraded cotranslationally by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (10Fisher E.A.

It is believed that the complex structure of apoB100 plays an important role in its post-translational regulation, which, under a wide range of conditions, is the predominant way that the assembly and secretion of apoB lipoproteins are controlled (10Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 11Shelness G.S. Ingram M.F. Huang X.F. DeLozier J.A. J.

Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Despite demonstration of inefficient translocation of apoB100 by several groups, the basis for this remains unclear and controversial. Lingappa and co-workers suggested that “pause transfer” sequences (PTS) present throughout apoB100 are the cause of inefficient translocation (19Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22794-22801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can result in exposure of secretory proteins on the cytosolic surface of the ER (22Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Rapoport T.A. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 621-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the importance of PTS in regulating the translocation of apoB100 was questioned by Pease et al. (24Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J. Nature. 1991; 353: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Pease R.J. Leiper J.M. Harrison G.B. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7261-7271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous data do not support a critical role for PTS; we showed that the simple addition of a β-sheet domain (from 29 to 34% of the full-length apoB100 sequence) to a truncated form of apoB100 consisting of repeats of the globular N-terminal region (apoB13,16), which contains several PTS (26Kivlen M.H. Dorsey C.A. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1149-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduces translocation efficiency and is associated with proteasomal degradation of the protein (27Liang J.-S. Wu X. Jiang H. Zhou M. Yang H. Angkeow P. Huang L.-S. Sturley S.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35216-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The addition of that β-sheet domain also makes apoB13,16 responsive to oleic acid (OA). Although the domain between 29 and 34% of full-length apoB100 has no PTS (26Kivlen M.H. Dorsey C.A. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1149-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our studies could not rule out the possibility that the effects of the β-sheet domain require the presence of PTS in the N terminus of apoB100. Furthermore, the importance of other β-sheet domains was not addressed. In this study, to further investigate the relative importance of PTS and β-sheet domains in regulating the translocation of apoB100 across the ER, we transfected McArdle RH7777 (McA), HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with four different chimeric cDNA constructs derived from human albumin (ALB) and sequences of apoB100. The apoB100 sequences contained either two PTS without a β-sheet domain, a β-sheet domain without any PTS, two PTS and a β-sheet domain, and neither PTS nor a β-sheet domain. We determined how the insertion of PTS or β-sheet domains into ALB, a typical secretory protein, affects its secretion, exposure on the cytosolic side of the ER, proteasomal degradation, and interaction with the translocon. Our results indicate that, although the presence of PTS may affect the secretion of apoB100 and possibly its response to OA, it does not affect the translocation process. By contrast, our results strongly support the view that the efficiency with which apoB100 is translocated across the ER and its predisposition to proteasomal degradation are determined by the presence of β-sheet domains. Materials—N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN), dimethyl sulfoxide, leupeptin, pepstatin A, sodium oleate, and rabbit anti-ALB antibody were purchased from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin (BSA; fatty acid-free) was purchased from VWR International. [35S]Methionine/cysteine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipofectamine, protein G-agarose, and all cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Sheep anti-apoB100 polyclonal antibodies were from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-Sec61α antibody was purchased from Upstate. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-human ALB antibody was from BIODESIGN International. Rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody was from Stressgen Bioreagents Corp. Growth of Cells—CHO, McA, and HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. CHO and HepG2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. McA cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine, and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). Construction of Human ALB/ApoB Expression Plasmids—pCR3.1-ALB was constructed by inserting the cDNA encoding full-length human ALB into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). 710-bp fragments of partial human apoB or human ALB cDNA were synthesized in PCRs with oligonucleotides containing an additional BglII site (underlined sequences below). The size of the oligonucleotides synthesized was based on the “map” of apoB PTS and β-sheet domains (26Kivlen M.H. Dorsey C.A. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1149-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); by choosing sequences of apoB that were 5% of the full-length protein, we were able to produce apoB sequences with only PTS, only β-sheet domains, both PTS and β-sheet domains, or neither PTS nor β-sheet domains. ApoB12–17 cDNA (referred to as B12–17), which has two PTS but no β-sheet domain, was synthesized with sense primer 5′-GAGATCTTAAGTTAGTGAAAGAAGTTCTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CAGATCTGATAATCCAGCTCCAGTGGGGAG-3′. ApoB29–34 cDNA (referred to as B29–34), which has a β-sheet domain but no PTS, was synthesized with sense primer 5′-GAGATCTTTTGTATCAACTGCAAGTGCCT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CAGATCTGAGGTGTCAGATTTTAAAGTCAG-3′. ApoB36–41 cDNA (referred to as B36–41) was synthesized with sense primer 5′-GAGATCTTTTGAAGTGTAGTCTTCTGGTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CAGATCTGACAGTGAGTCTGAATTATAGTT-3′. ApoB49–54 cDNA (referred to as B49–54) was synthesized with sense primer 5′-GAGATCTTCAAAATGTGGATACTAAGTAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CAGATCTGAATACACTGCAACTGTGGCCTT-3′. ALB1–40 cDNA was synthesized with sense primer 5′-GAGATCTTGCACACAAGAGTGTTGCTCAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CAGATCTGATTCTGCAAACTCAGCTTTGGG-3′. ALB1–40, with the first 40% of the amino acid sequence of full-length ALB added to ALB, was chosen because it was approximately the same length as the apoB inserts and would therefore serve as a control for inserting a protein into the middle of full-length ALB (at the same site in which the apoB sequences were inserted). These PCR fragments were digested with BglII and inserted into the linear form of pCR3.1-ALB, which was digested with BglII (corresponding to nucleotide 708 or residue 236 of human ALB, which is ∼40% from the N terminus). Each construct was confirmed at the nucleotide level by sequencing. A comparison of these constructs with a schematic representation of the sites of PTS in apoB100 is shown in Fig. 1. Transfections—McA, HepG2, or CHO cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications with each ALB/apoB plasmid or ALB/ALB1–40. Experiments were performed 36–40 h after transfection. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Transiently transfected McA, HepG2, and CHO cells were preincubated in serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA for 2 h and then labeled with Eagle's MEM containing 1.5% BSA and 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min. After being washed, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm methionine and 3 mm cysteine for 10 or 120 min. The medium was collected at 120 min, and cells were lysed at 10 or 120 min. In the experiment in which OA stimulation was assessed, 0.4 mm OA was added to the incubation medium for 2 h prior to labeling and was also present during the 2-h labeling period. The lysis buffer contained 62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 30 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0)). Conditioned medium was mixed with protease inhibitor mixture and 0.86 mm freshly made phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates and conditioned medium were used for immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Immunoprecipitation of proteins was carried out according to the method of Dixon et al. (28Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates or conditioned medium was mixed with NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) and an excess amount of various antisera. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-agarose was added to the reaction solution, and the incubation was continued for an additional 16 h. The beads were washed with NET buffer, and proteins were released with sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) by boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autography or immunoblotting. Proteinase K Digestion Experiments—Microsomes were prepared according to methods described previously (27Liang J.-S. Wu X. Jiang H. Zhou M. Yang H. Angkeow P. Huang L.-S. Sturley S.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35216-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60-min labeled McA cells were scraped in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitor mixture and disrupted by 10 passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 9000 × g, and the microsomes were isolated after centrifugation for 1 h at 105,000 × g. The microsome pellets were resuspended in buffer A without protease inhibitor mixture. The microsomes were incubated with or without proteinase K (PK; 50 μg/ml) or Triton X-100 (0.5%) for 30 min on ice. After digestion, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (3 mm) was added, and the samples were incubated for another 5 min on ice. The samples were then recentrifuged, and the microsome pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Ubiquitinylation Experiments—Transfected CHO cells were pretreated with serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA and 40 μg/ml ALLN for 2 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. Ubiquitinylated proteins were captured by immunoprecipitation with antiubiquitin antibody. Total ALB protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-ALB antibody. The eluates from the immunoprecipitation was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using antibody against apoB or ALB. Physical Interaction of ALB/ApoB and Sec61α—Transfected CHO cells were pretreated with serum-free Eagle's MEM containing BSA (1.5%) and ALLN (final concentration of 40 μg/ml) for 2 h and then labeled with Eagle's MEM containing 1.5% BSA and 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min. After being washed, cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm methionine and 3 mm cysteine for 15, 30, or 60 min. Cells were collected as described above and either 1) immunoprecipitated with anti-Sec61α antibody as described above, boiled in 2% SDS to dissociate the immunoprecipitated molecules, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-ALB antibody or 2) immunoprecipitated with only anti-ALB antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE; the bands were cut from the gels; and radioactivity was determined in a Beckman Coulter LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. The percent of each construct that was associated with Sec61α was then calculated, and the data for each ALB/apoB construct was normalized to that for ALB/ALB1–40. Because there were no differences in the results at 15, 30, or 60 min, those data were combined. The Presence of PTS and/or β-Sheet Domains Significantly Inhibits Secretion of ALB/ApoB from Cultured Hepatocytes—To determine whether the presence of PTS or β-sheet domains affects the secretion efficiency of ALB/apoB chimeric proteins, pulse-chase experiments were performed. 36 h after McA cells (Fig. 2A), HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B), and CHO cells (Fig. 2C) were transiently transfected with full-length ALB, ALB/ALB1–40 (used as a control for the length of the other chimeric proteins), and the ALB/apoB constructs, the secretion of the chimeric proteins was determined. The quantity of protein in the cell lysates at the 10-min chase time point was taken as 100% of total newly synthesized ALB or ALB/apoB proteins, and the quantities of each construct secreted were normalized based on total construct synthesized. Simply repeating the first 40% of the amino acid sequence of ALB within full-length ALB (Fig. 1) reduced secretion considerably compared with full-length ALB; 34.3–42.2% of newly synthesized ALB/ALB1–40 was secreted by 120 min versus 71.7–84.4% of ALB. Thus, all other comparisons were against ALB/ALB1–40. After 120 min of chase, 24.3–31.1% of newly synthesized ALB/B49–54, which has neither PTS nor a β-sheet domain, was secreted; this was similar to the secretion of ALB/ALB1–40. In contrast, the secretion of ALB/B12–17 (two PTS), ALB/B29–34 (a β-sheet domain), and ALB/B36–41 (two PTS and a β-sheet domain) was dramatically inhibited, ranging from 1.3 to 9.9% of newly synthesized protein (Fig. 2, A–C). The data in Fig. 2 (A–C) indicate that PTS and β-sheet domains, either alone or together, can reduce apoB secretion. OA stimulates the secretion of apoB from cultured hepatocytes, particularly HepG2 cells (28Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When HepG2 cells that had been transiently transfected with chimeric cDNAs were incubated with 0.4 mm OA (Fig. 2D), the secretion of ALB/B12–17 (two PTS) and ALB/B36–41 (two PTS and a β-sheet domain) was increased significantly, as was the secretion of endogenous apoB100 in the HepG2 cells. Surprisingly, the secretion of ALB/B29–34 (a β-sheet domain without any PTS) was unaffected by OA. However, there was almost no secretion of this construct in any of the cell lines (Fig. 2, A–C). As predicted, the secretion of ALB/B49–54 (no PTS or β-sheet domain) was also unaffected by OA. It should be noted that, although OA increased the secretion of ALB/B12–17 and ALB/B36–41, the secretion of these chimera was still very low. Thus, whereas 52.5% of newly synthesized ALB/ALB1–40 was secreted at 120 min in the presence of OA, only 27.6 and 23.9% of newly synthesized ALB/B12–17 and ALB/B36–41, respectively, were secreted under the same conditions. The Presence of β-Sheet Domains Increases the PK Sensitivity of ALB/ApoB—The results described above indicate that both PTS and β-sheet domains affect ALB/apoB secretion. To determine whether the reduced secretion is associated with inefficient translocation, as assessed by cytosolic exposure of the translocating protein, we isolated microsomes and digested them with exogenous protease. This method allows for the partial digestion of proteins that are exposed on the cytosolic side of the ER (and other microsomal components) and is able to demonstrate such exposure for apoB100 (27Liang J.-S. Wu X. Jiang H. Zhou M. Yang H. Angkeow P. Huang L.-S. Sturley S.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35216-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 36 h after McA cells were transiently transfected with ALB/apoB constructs, cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine. Microsomes were then isolated and incubated with or without PK (50 μg/ml) for 30 min. After the reaction was stopped, the remaining proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ALB/ALB1–40, ALB/B12–17, and ALB/B49–54 were digested similarly (43.7 ± 8.5, 45.4 ± 7.0, and 47.6 ± 19.1%, respectively), whereas ALB/B29–34 and ALB/B36–41 were both digested more extensively (76.3 ± 5.0 and 75.8 ± 5.4%, respectively) (Fig. 3). All of the protein bands disappeared completely when the microsomes were incubated with both PK and Triton X-100, which disrupted microsomes and exposed all proteins to proteinase activity (data not shown). These results indicate that the extent of cytosolic exposure of ALB/apoB, as it translocates across the ER membrane, is determined by the presence of β-sheet domains, but not PTS. Because OA appeared to increase the secretion of ALB/B12–17 as well as ALB/B36–41, we examined the effect of OA on PK sensitivity in each construct in McA cells. In two separate experiments performed in duplicate, we did not observe any effect of OA pretreatment of the cells on their sensitivity to PK (data not shown). The Presence of β-Sheet Domains Increases the Ubiquitinylation of ALB/ApoB—Because poor translocation efficiency of apoB100 across the ER results in degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we next determined which of the ALB/apoB constructs could be ubiquitinylated. 36 h after CHO cells were transiently transfected with ALB/apoB constructs, they were preincubated for 2 h with serum-free medium containing ALLN (40 μg/ml) to block degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ubiquitin antibody, and eluates from the immunoprecipitate were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Ubiquitinylated ALB/apoB or ALB/ALB1–40 was detected by Western blotting against apoB or ALB and compared with the total immunoprecipitable protein for each construct. ALB/ALB1–40, ALB/B12–17, and ALB/B49–54 were minimally ubiquitinylated. By contrast, ALB/B29–34 and ALB/B36–41 were each ubiquitinylated by >50% (Fig. 4). The Presence of β-Sheet Domains Increases the Physical Interaction between ALB/ApoB and Sec61α—To further demonstrate that the presence of β-sheet domains affects the translocation of apoB100 because of an atypical interaction with the ER translocon, we performed two-step immunoprecipitation experiments. The Sec61 complex is a central component of the translocon, consisting of three different polypeptides, Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ (30Johnson A.E. Haigh N.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that newly synthesized apoB100 associates with the Sec61 complex (31Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarah R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Therefore, CHO cells were transiently transfected with ALB/apoB constructs, and 36 h later, the association of each construct with Sec61α was determined by two-step immunoprecipitation with anti-Sec61α and anti-ALB antibodies. ALB/B12–17 and ALB/B49–54 cross-linked with Sec61α to the same extent as ALB/ALB1–40. By contrast, ALB/B29–34 and ALB/B36–41 cross-linked with Sec61α to a significantly greater extent than ALB/ALB1–40 (Fig. 5). ApoB100, a secretory protein, acts atypically during its cotranslational translocation across the ER membrane (10Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This atypical behavior is manifested by an incomplete translocation and a bitopic orientation of apoB100 in which some domains are exposed to the cytosol and some are exposed to the ER lumen (34Davis R.A.

The LBS-independent affinity of SK for [Glu]Pg was unaffected by deletion of Lys414. By contrast, removal of SK Lys414 caused 19- and 14-fold decreases in SK affinity for [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm binding in the catalytic mode, respectively. In kinetic studies of the coupled conformational and proteolytic activation of [Lys]Pg, SKΔK414 exhibited a corresponding 17-fold affinity decrease for formation of the SKΔK414·[Lys]Pg* complex. SKΔK414 binding to [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm and conformational [Lys]Pg activation were LBS-independent, whereas [Lys]Pg substrate binding and proteolytic [Lys]Pm generation remained LBS-dependent.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6620-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) has been overlooked in previous studies. Here, we show that Lys414 is responsible for the LBS-dependent enhancement in affinity of SK·[Lys]Pg* and SK·[Lys]Pm catalytic complex formation. This interaction is shown to be structurally and functionally distinct from the LBS-dependent binding of [Lys]Pg as a substrate of the catalytic complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWild-type SK and an SK Mutant Lacking the COOH-terminal Lys—Wild-type SK (wtSK) was prepared by methods described previously (33Bean R.R.

A construct that encoded a His6-tagged TEV proteinase was kindly provided by Dr. Laura Mizoue of the Vanderbilt University Center for Structural Biology and used to remove the His6-tag from the NH2 terminus of wtSK.His6-wtSK was expressed from Rosetta(DE3) pLysS cells induced with 20 g/liter lactose for 12–16 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4 (Buffer A) with 1 mm EDTA and 0.2% sodium azide, lysed by three cycles of sonication (∼45 s cycles) on ice, and centrifuged to clarify lysates. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing 3 m NaSCN. The solubilized wtSK was dialyzed into 50 mm Hepes, 400 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4 (Buffer B) and purified by Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose chromatography with a 50–500 mm imidazole gradient in Buffer B. TEV proteinase was added to the eluted protein in a 1 to 5 molar ratio of enzyme to substrate. The reaction mixture was first dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.8 at 4 °C, and subsequently dialyzed back into Buffer B. Uncleaved fusion protein, cleaved His6-tag, and the TEV proteinase bound to Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose, and wtSK was obtained from the column flow-through. wtSK was dialyzed against Buffer A without polyethylene glycol, quick-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. SKΔ414K was prepared following an identical procedure. The correct NH2-terminal sequence for wtSK and SKΔK414 was confirmed.Native and Carboxypeptidase B (CpB)-treated SK—Native SK purchased from Diapharma and purified as described previously (7Boxrud P.D.

Fluorescence changes ((Fobs – Fo)/Fo = ΔF/Fo) as a function of total SK concentration, were fit by the quadratic binding equation to determine the maximum fluorescence change (ΔFmax/Fo) and dissociation constant (KD), with the stoichiometric factor (n) fixed at 1. Competitive binding titrations of native [Lys]Pg were performed by addition of wtSK or SKΔ414 to mixtures of [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg as a function of native [Lys]Pg concentration, as described previously (5Boxrud P.D.

Results were analyzed by fitting of the cubic binding equation to determine the KD of wtSK and SKΔ414 for native [Lys]Pg.Plasminogen Activation Kinetics—Coupled conformational and proteolytic activation of [Lys]Pg by wtSK and SKΔK414 were quantitated as described previously (5Boxrud P.D.

Fitting of parabolic progress curves of d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA) hydrolysis at 200 μm, in the presence of 15 nm [Lys]Pg and increasing wtSK and SKΔK414 concentrations gave the initial rates (v1) of VLK-pNA hydrolysis, reflecting conformational activation of the SK·Pg* complex, and the rates of activity increase (v2), reflecting Pm generation. The SK dependences of v1 and v2 were analyzed using the simplified equations described previously (5Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

For this analysis, the Km values for chromogenic substrate hydrolysis by Pm, SK·Pg*, and SK·Pm were fixed at the previously determined values, whereas the corresponding kcat values were allowed to vary within the experimental error of their determination to optimize the fit. K′A for SK·Pm binding was fixed at 12 pm (7Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

Error estimates represent the 95% confidence interval.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBinding of Native SK and CpB-treated SK to [Lys]Pg—Native SK was treated with CpB to remove the COOH-terminal lysine residue, under conditions where there was no detectable degradation of SK observable by SDS-gel electrophoresis (not shown). Titrations of [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg with native SK and CpB-SK were performed in the absence and presence of saturating 6-AHA to evaluate the effect of CpB treatment on the LBS dependence of SK affinity (Fig. 1A). In the absence and presence of 6-AHA, native SK bound fluorescein-labeled [Lys]Pg with KD 20 ± 5nm and 380 ± 40 nm, respectively, and with ΔFmax/Fo of –15 ± 1% and –19 ± 1%. By contrast, CpB-SK bound labeled [Lys]Pg with KD 130 ± 20 nm and ΔFmax/Fo –17 ± 1% in the absence of 6-AHA, and with KD 300 ± 50 nm and ΔFmax/Fo –19 ± 1% in the presence of 6-AHA. The affinities for native and CpB-treated SK in the presence of 6-AHA were indistinguishable. CpB treatment of SK decreased the effect of 6-AHA on [Lys]Pg affinity from 19-fold to 2.3-fold. This demonstrated that CpB treatment of SK resulted in a selective loss of LBS-dependent affinity for labeled [Lys]Pg.Binding of wtSK and SKΔK414 to [Lys]Pg—Titrations of [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg with wtSK and SKΔK414 were performed in the absence and presence of 10 mm 6-AHA (Fig. 1B). In the absence and presence of 6-AHA, wtSK bound labeled [Lys]Pg with KD 28 ± 6 nm and 520 ± 70 nm, respectively, and with ΔFmax/Fo of –23 ± 1% and –21 ± 1%. Like CpB-treated SK, SKΔK414 bound to labeled [Lys]Pg with weaker affinity than wtSK, with KD 610 ± 200 nm and 750 ± 350 nm in the absence and presence of 6-AHA, respectively, and ΔFmax/Fo of –24 ± 2% and –24 ± 3%. Native and wtSK bound with indistinguishable affinity to labeled Pg, and their LBS-dependent losses of affinity in the presence of 6-AHA were the same (Fig. 1, A and B). Deletion of the COOH-terminal lysine decreased the weakening effect of 6-AHA on affinity from 19- to 1.2-fold. This demonstrated that the SK mutant lacking the COOH-terminal lysine exhibited a selective loss of LBS-dependent affinity for labeled [Lys]Pg.Binding of wtSK and SKΔK414 to [Glu]Pg—Titrations of [5F]FFR-[Glu]Pg with wtSK and SKΔK414 were performed in the absence and presence of 10 mm 6-AHA (Fig. 1C). In the absence and presence of 6-AHA, wtSK bound labeled [Glu]Pg with KD 930 ± 120 nm and 471 ± 140 nm, respectively, and with ΔFmax/Fo –37 ± 1% and –19 ± 1%. SKΔK414 bound labeled [Glu]Pg with KD 634 ± 160 nm and 560 ± 150 nm in the absence and presence of 6-AHA, respectively, and with ΔFmax/Fo –30 ± 2% and –19 ± 1%. Although the amplitudes of the fluorescence changes were decreased by 6-AHA, the affinities of wtSK and SKΔK414 for labeled [Glu]Pg in the presence or absence of 6-AHA were indistinguishable and LBS-independent. This was consistent with the LBS independence of SK binding to [Glu]Pg in the compact conformation (5Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E.

Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and ΔFmax/Fo of –54 ± 2% in the absence of 6-AHA, compared with a 14-fold higher KD of 260 ± 70 pm and ΔFmax/Fo of –49 ± 2% in the presence of 6-AHA. SKΔK414 bound labeled [Lys]Pm with impaired affinity represented by KD 190 ± 40 pm and 350 ± 80 pm in the absence and presence of 6-AHA, respectively, and with ΔFmax/Fo of –50 ± 1% and –47 ± 2%. The affinities of wtSK for [5F]FFR-Pm in the presence of 6-AHA and that of SKΔK414 in the absence and presence of 6-AHA were indistinguishable within the experimental error. The results indicated that similar to [Lys]Pg, the affinity for complex formation between wtSK and [Lys]Pm was enhanced by interaction of SK Lys414 with kringles on [Lys]Pm.Binding of SKΔK414 and wtSK to Native Pg—The affinities of active site-labeled [Glu]Pg and [Lys]Pg for SK are consistently ∼5-fold lower than those of the native proteins, as determined in previous studies, but maintain the same magnitude of the effects of 6-AHA on binding (5Boxrud P.D. Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36633-36641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Bock P.E. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D.

To characterize binding of wtSK and SKΔK414 to native [Lys]Pg, [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg was used as a probe of the native and labeled [Lys]Pg competitive binding equilibria in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. To resolve the rapid binding equilibrium from slower proteolytic cleavage, individual measurements were made as a function of time after addition of wtSK or SKΔK414 to mixtures of [5F]FFR-[Lys]Pg and various concentrations of native [Lys]Pg at fixed wtSK and SKΔK414 concentrations as described previously (5Boxrud P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2097643376,"Urocortins are members of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of peptides that bind to two receptors, CRF(1) and CRF(2). While CRF(1) is a high-affinity receptor for CRF, urocortin III binds with much greater affinity to CRF(2). In the present study we investigated the effect of CRF(2) receptor activation with urocortin III on airway smooth muscle tone in vitro and in an acute model of airway inflammation in mice. Urocortin III caused relaxation of methacholine-precontracted mouse tracheal segments. CRF caused similar relaxation, but with reduced potency compared to urocortin III, consistent with the CRF(2) receptor subtype. Relaxation induced by urocortin III was concentration-dependently inhibited by the CRF(2) antagonist, astressin 2B, with an IC(50) in the nanomolar range. These relaxations were potentiated by inhibition of phosphodiesterases but unaffected by inhibition of cyclooxygenase and NO or by removal of the epithelium. Finally, the number of neutrophils retrieved by bronchoalveolar lavage after administration of bacterial LPS (LPS) was reduced by prior intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of urocortin III. This effect was also suppressed by astressin 2B, implicating CRF(2) receptors. Therefore, CRF(2) agonists appear to have both bronchorelaxant and anti-inflammatory activities and might represent an interesting therapeutic approach to the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1983960125,"Despite the generation of a large amount of sequence information over the last decade, more than 40% of well characterized enzymatic functions still lack associated protein sequences. Assigning protein sequences to documented biochemical functions is an interesting challenge. We illustrate here that structural genomics may be a reasonable approach in addressing these questions. We present the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae YMR099cp, a protein of unknown function. YMR099cp adopts the same fold as galactose mutarotase and shares the same catalytic machinery necessary for the interconversion of the α and β anomers of galactose. The structure revealed the presence in the active site of a sulfate ion attached by an arginine clamp made by the side chain from two strictly conserved arginine residues. This sulfate is ideally positioned to mimic the phosphate group of hexose 6-phosphate. We have subsequently successfully demonstrated that YMR099cp is a hexose-6-phosphate mutarotase with broad substrate specificity. We solved high resolution structures of some substrate enzyme complexes, further confirming our functional hypothesis. The metabolic role of a hexose-6-phosphate mutarotase is discussed.

Despite the overwhelming impact of systematic genome sequencing on the understanding of the biology and evolution of organisms, enormous gaps are present in our current knowledge of the function of proteins. On the one hand, it is well known that many of the newly generated protein sequences cannot be assigned with a precise function. On the other hand, a significant portion of biochemical functions experimentally determined are still not linked to a protein sequence. The awareness of the latter point, which is not well recognized, presents an important challenge. For instance, systematic analysis of the well structured and much used Enzyme Commission (EC) data base revealed that more than 39% of the experimentally identified enzyme activities (corresponding to 1529 EC numbers) are not associated with protein sequences in major public databases (1Karp P.D. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 401Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Lespinet O. Labedan B. Science. 2005; 307: 42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is clearly an urgent need to fill this gap in our biochemical knowledge, and an organized combined bioinformatics and experimental effort will be needed to bridge it (3Roberts R.J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E42Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Structural genomic endeavors, through systematic approaches at all experimental steps of the structure determination process, to fill the gap between protein sequence and structure space. Apart from being the main source of novel fold discovery, structural genomics may also generate valuable information on proteins whose function was not identified before (4Kuhn P. Lesley S.A. Mathews II Canaves J.M. Brinen L.S. Dai X. Deacon A.M. Elsliger M.A. Eshaghi S. Floyd R. Godzik A. Grittini C. Grzechnik S.K. Guda C. Hodgson K.O. Jaroszewski L. Karlak C. Klock H.E. Koesema E.

It is certain that a considerable fraction of these targets is endowed with enzymatic activities, and the identification of the biochemical function of these proteins offers a high value structural genomics spin-off. In our yeast structural genomics project we have focused on non-membrane proteins of unknown fold (6Quevillon-Cheruel S. Liger D. Leulliot N. Graille M. Poupon A. de La Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zhou C.Z. Collinet B. Janin J. Van Tilbeurgh H. Biochimie. (Paris). 2004; 86: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our initial target list consisted of a mix of proteins with known and unknown functions. In this article, we demonstrate how biochemical investigations based on initial structure determination may clearly define biochemical function. YMR099cp is a 34-kDa protein that is predicted from Psi-Blast sequence analysis to adopt an aldose-1-epimerase fold, which does not share significant homology with proteins whose biochemical function was characterized. However, no biochemical function could be deciphered from these observations. We report here on the crystal structure of YMR099cp and show that it adopts the galactose mutarotase fold (11Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of the putative active site suggested that its catalytic machinery may perform a mutarotation reaction but that YMR099cp probably has different substrate specificity from the well studied galactose mutarotase with which it shares the same fold. Our present biochemical and biophysical investigation of the catalytic activity indicate that YMR099cp corresponds to the glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase (or mutarotase) previously identified in S. cerevisiae, using biochemical experiments, but whose gene has not been identified since (12Wurster B.

Our results highlight how structural genomics may suggest biochemical experiments that allow for determination of the precise function of a target protein. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The YMR099c open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of the S. cerevisiae strain S288C as a template. An additional sequence coding for a His6 tag was introduced at the 3′-end of the gene during amplification. The PCR product was then cloned into a derivative of pET9 vector (Stratagene). Expression was done at 37 °C using the transformed Escherichia coli Gold (DE3) strain and 2xYT medium (BIO101 Inc.) supplemented with kanamycin at 50 μg/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and stored overnight at -20 °C. Cell lysis was completed by sonication. The His-tagged protein was purified on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc.) followed by gel filtration on a SuperdexTM200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Glucose-6-phosphate Epimerase Activity Measurements—Because of the specificity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for β-Glc6P, both spontaneous and YMR099cp-catalyzed formation of β-Glc6P could be followed by measuring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm caused by generation of NAD(P)H, coupled to the conversion of β-Glc6P into d-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. All kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgSO4 using an Applied Photophysics SW18-MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes of 60 μm equilibrated Glc6P and 2 mm NADP+ with 160 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Sigma), 2 mm NADP+, and various concentrations of YMR099cp. Stopped-flow data were fitted to double exponentials by a nonlinear least-squares curve fitting using software provided by Applied Photophysics. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Fluorescence Measurements for Binding of Ligands—All phosphorylated sugars used for these measurements were purchased from Sigma. Excitation was performed at 295 nm and emission scanned from 300-500 nm with a Cary Eclipse fluorospectrophotometer (Varian). Measurements were performed at 20 °C with 1 μm YMR099cp in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Successive aliquots of ligands (from 0 to 20 mm) were added to the protein. Binding of ligands to YMR099cp was quantified as a difference of tryptophan fluorescence at 350 nm as a function of ligand concentration. Experiments were performed in triplicate. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were recorded in 99% D2O with a Bruker DRX400 instrument (400 MHz), with ligands and protein concentrations of 20 mm and 25 μm, respectively. Standard Bruker software was used to acquire and process the NMR data. 1D-1H NMR was acquired with 16,000 data points and 16 scans. Two-dimensional NOESY was recorded with 256 experiments of 2048 data points and 8 scans per t1 experiment and a mixing time of 200 ms. Sine-squared-bell apodization was applied to spectra in both dimensions and processed in States-TPPI mode, followed by symmetrization. Crystallization and Resolution of the Structure—Crystallization trials were performed at 18 °C. Crystals for the apo form of the protein were grown from a mixture in a 1:1 ratio of 20 mg/ml protein solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol with a crystallization solution of 25-30% polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m Hepes pH 7.5. Crystals for the d-galactose 6-phosphate (Gal6P, 2The abbreviations used are: Gal6P, d-galactose 6-phosphate; Glc6P, d-glucose 6-phosphate; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. 100 mm) and d-glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P, 200 mm) bound forms were obtained under the following conditions: 32% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m lithium chloride, 0.1 m Hepes pH 7.5. Crystals could only be obtained by microseeding from crystals of the apo form. Crystals were cryoprotected by transferring either to paratone (Glc6P and Gal6P forms) or to a crystallization solution with progressively higher glycerol concentrations up to 30% v/v (unbound form) and then flashcooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected from a flash-cooled crystal at 100 K on beamline ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The apoprotein crystallized in space group P21212 with cell dimensions: a = 44.9 Å, b = 74.2 Å, c = 106.5 Å, corresponding to one molecule per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 55%. Image processing, data reduction, and scaling were carried out using the XDS package (16Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3199) Google Scholar). The structure of the Haemophilus influenzae Hi1317 protein (PDB code 1JOV; 26% sequence identity) was used as search model for molecular replacement trials using the MolRep program in the 20-4-Å resolution range (17Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4096) Google Scholar). This initial model was automatically rebuilt using the Arp/wARP program using data to 1.7-Å resolution (18Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). The resulting model was improved by careful analysis of the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps using the molecular graphics program TURBO-FRODO. The refinement of this model was further carried out with the program REFMAC in the 20-1.7-Å resolution range (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13700) Google Scholar). The final model for the apostructure includes all the residues from Pro2 to Lys288, 330 water molecules, 1 sodium, and 2 sulfate ions, one Hepes molecule, and one glycerol molecule from the cryoprotection solution. The sugarbound structures (Glc6P and Gal6P) crystallizing in a different space group (C2221) were solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.6 Å. Models were constructed for the Glc6P and Gal6P YMR099cp complexes for residues Pro2-Glu289. Both complexes contain one hexose 6-phosphate sugar and in the case of Gal6P a barium ion. The Glc6P and Gal6P complex models were completed with 253 and 378 water molecules, respectively. The statistics on data collection and refinement are provided in Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the YMR099c native protein and the Glc6P and Gal6P complexes have been deposited into the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the accession numbers 2CIQ, 2CIR, and 2CIS, respectively.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionApo formGlc6P formGal6P formResolution (Å)20-1.7 (1.8-1.7)20-1.5 (1.6-1.5)20-1.6 (1.7-1.6)Space groupP21212C2221C2221Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 44.9; b = 74.2; c = 106.5a = 43.7; b = 157.3; c = 104.2a = 43; b = 156.3; c = 104.0Total number of reflections137,453248,220204,046Total number of unique reflections39,08257,84643,501Rsym (%)6.1 (40.7)7.8 (46.3)6.3 (20.7)Completeness (%)98.4 (98.2)98.9 (99.6)93 (71.8)I/s(I)14.8 (4.9)21.5 (2.5)14.8 (6.5)Redundancy3.54.34.7RefinementResolution (Å)20-1.720-1.620-1.6R/Rfree (%)18.7/21.920.6/23.418.6/21.2Number of reflections used to calculate Rfree1,9542,3762,200RMSD bonds (Å)0.0120.0100.011RMSD angles (Å)1.381.2791.299B Wilson (Å2)24.62216.2Mean B factor (Å2) protein/water/ligand22.4/35.520.1/31.7/3114.2/28.7/16.4Number of atoms protein/water/ligand2,311/303/322,314/252/162,321/376/17Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored88.98988.6Generously allowed11.11111.4PDB code2CIQ2CIR2CIS Open table in a new tab Structure of the YMR099cp—The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae gene product YMR099cp (297 amino acids) has been solved using the molecular replacement method using the structure of a protein of unknown function (H. influenzae Hi1317; PDB code: 1JOV) and refined to 1.7-Å resolution (Table 1). All 2Fo - Fc electron density maps are of excellent quality, except for the N-terminal methionine and 9 C-terminal amino acids that have not been built because they were not defined in electron density. One copy of YMR099cp is present in the asymmetric unit, confirming gel filtration elution profile that clearly indicates a monomeric state of the protein in solution (data not shown). YMR099cp is made of a single globular domain of approximate dimensions 37 × 52 × 53 Å3. Its structure can be described as a β-sandwich made of 22 β-strands and two short α-helices (Fig. 1A). Strands are organized in four antiparallel β-sheets arranged in two parallel layers. The first one is made of three sheets: S1 composed of β-strands 1-4, S2 (strand order: β5, β10, and β21), and S4 (strand order: β11, β20, β19, β16, β13, and β14). The second layer is formed by the sole 9-stranded β-sheet S3 (strand order: β6-β9, β22, β18, β17, β12, and β15). The two helices α1 and α2 are facing toward the same side of the monomer and are part of the linkers connecting strands β7to β8 and β19 to β20. This fold has already been described for galactose mutarotases (RMSD of 2.2-2.6 Å over 240 Cα positions; 15-17% sequence identity (11Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol.

Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar)) and the N-terminal domain of maltose phosphorylase (RMSD of 3.4 Å over 164 Cα positions, 13% sequence identity (23Egloff M.P. Uppenberg J. Haalck L. van Tilbeurgh H. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 689-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)). Structural similarity is also shared with proteins of unknown function: Caenorhabditis elegans C01B4.6 gene product (RMSD of 2.41 Å over 235 Cα positions, 13% sequence identity; PDB code: 1LUR) and S. cerevisiae YNR071cp (RMSD of 2.67 Å over 243 Cα positions, 12% sequence identity; PDB code: 1YGA). Comparison with Galactose Mutarotases—The crystal structures of YMR099cp and of the H. influenzae Hi1317 protein (which provided the model used for molecular replacement) confirm the Psi-Blast prediction that they belong to the aldose-1-epimerase family. The best structurally and biochemically characterized member of this family is galactose mutarotase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of α/β-d-galactose (24Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This is the first step of the Leloir pathway, which in most organisms converts β-d-galactose to the more metabolically useful glucose 1-phosphate. Surface projection of sequence conservation among YMR099cp-related proteins has highlighted a highly conserved pocket whose floor is made by sheet S4 and walls by helix α2 as well as by the long loop connecting β4to β6 (Fig. 1B). This pocket, which contains a glycerol-bound molecule bound in the so-called apo structure, corresponds to the active site in galactose mutarotase. Sequence alignment of YMR099cp orthologs and galactose mutarotases reveals five strictly conserved pocket residues (Figs. 1C and 2): two histidine residues (His82 and His159, YMR099cp numbering), two acidic amino acids (Asp203 and Glu264) and Tyr161. Crystal structures of Lactococcus lactis galactose mutarotase bound to sugars have shown that these residues are involved in sugar binding (11Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis led to the conclusion that in L. lactis galactose mutarotase, His170 and Glu304 play the role of catalytic acid and base, respectively (26Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence, YMR099cp seems to possess the catalytic machinery necessary to interconvert α and β sugar anomers, suggesting that YMR099cp is a yeast galactose mutarotase. However, Gal10p was annotated recently with this activity in S. cerevisiae (27Majumdar S. Ghatak J. Mukherji S. Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Gal10p is a bifunctional enzyme with the N-terminal domain harboring UDP-galactose 4-epimerase and the C-terminal domain galactose mutarotase activities (21Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This raises the issue whether multiple genes code for galactose mutarotase activity in yeast or YMR099cp is an active mutarotase with different substrate specificity. An indication supporting the latter hypothesis comes from the refinement of the native structure, which has revealed a sulfate ion bound in the active site pocket (Fig. 1C). This ion, present in the crystallization buffer, is complexed by two arginine side chains (Arg57 and Arg86) that are strictly conserved among YMR099cp orthologs but not among bona fide galactose mutarotases (Fig. 2, family 1, black arrows). Interestingly, a sulfate ion occupies exactly the same position in the active site of H. influenzae Hi1317 (unknown function, PDB code: 1JOV), and is liganded by homologous arginines. Finally, structure superimposition of the glucose-bound galactose mutarotase E304Q mutant of L. lactis onto YMR099cp shows that the glucose O6 atom and an oxygen atom from sulfate almost overlap. The fact that sulfate ions often substitute for phosphate groups in protein structures (28Li de la Sierra I. Munier-Lehmann H. Gilles A.M. Barzu O. Delarue M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Collinet B. Graille M. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Liger D. Minard P. Blondeau K. Henckes G. Aufrere R.

Proteins. 2004; 54: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggests that YMR099cp binds a hexose-6-phosphate and that it hence may have hexose-6-phosphate mutarotase (or 1-epimerase) activity. A glucose-6-phosphate-1-epimerase, which catalyzes the mutarotation of d-glucopyran 6-phosphate (12Wurster B. Hess B. FEBS Lett. 1972; 23: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Wurster B. Hess B. Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Wurster B. Hess B. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 15Chance E.M. Hess B. Plesser T. Wurster B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was previously purified from yeast, but the sequence of the protein was not identified. Interestingly, the previously published data for the enzyme purified from yeast cells (estimated molecular mass of 35-kDa and isoelectric point of 5.8; Ref. 12Wurster B. Hess B. FEBS Lett. 1972; 23: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) fit very well with the values calculated from the YMR099cp sequence (34 kDa and pI of 6.07). Functional Studies—These structural observations led us to test YMR099cp for hexose 6-phosphate epimerase activity. For this purpose, we have used an enzyme-coupled assay. It consists in following the reduction of NAD(P) (λ = 340 nm) resulting from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which specifically converts β-Glc6P (but not the α form) into d-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate (Fig. 3A). The formation of β-Glc6P from a racemic mixture has been investigated by stopped-flow at various YMR099cp concentrations (Fig. 3B), which revealed two distinct phases. The first one corresponds to the initial burst of β-Glc6P because of its presence in the racemic mixture and hence is independent on the YMR099cp concentration. In the second phase, faster generation of NAD(P)H reflecting higher velocity constant (k+1) for the interconversion between glucose 6-phosphate anomers is obtained with increasing concentration of YMR099cp, demonstrating the glucose-6-phosphate epimerase activity of the protein (Fig. 3B, inset). In our experiments, YMR099cp accelerates the reaction two to three times more than previously observed in the same conditions by Wurster and Hess (Fig. 3B, inset; Ref. 12Wurster B. Hess B. FEBS Lett. 1972; 23: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This probably reflects the general improvement in the quality (i.e. purity and stability) of a protein sample extracted and purified within a few hours from an overexpressing E. coli strain, compared with the one of a protein sample obtained from a wild-type yeast lysate using a long and tedious purification protocol (12Wurster B. Hess B. FEBS Lett. 1972; 23: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this enzymatic assay could not be used to test other hexose 6-phosphate substrates because glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase exhibits a high degree of specificity for β-Glc6P. A more common way to measure epimerase activity is polarimetry, but this method requires the pure α or β anomeric forms of the substrates, which are usually not commercially available. We therefore used NMR to identify activity on other hexose 6-phosphate substrates (30Ryu K.S. Kim C. Park C. Choi B.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 9180-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify putative substrates to be tested by NMR, we have first tested the binding of a few potential ligands using tryptophan fluorescence. As the comparison of the YMR099cp and galactose mutarotase active sites revealed that the aromatic side chain (phenylalanine or tyrosine) that forms a hydrophobic sugar binding platform in galactose mutarotases is replaced by a strictly conserved tryptophan residue in all YMR099cp homologs, we then assumed that this side chain could be used as a fluorescent probe. This allowed us to test the binding affinity of several sugar candidates as a ligand for YMR099cp. In addition to glucose 6-phosphate, shown to be a substrate of the protein, we tested the binding of glucose, three additional hexose 6-phosphate sugars (Gal6P, Man6P, and Fru6P) and ribose 5-phosphate. These measurements revealed that YMR099cp displays a slightly higher affinity for Fru6P and Man6P than for Glc6P (Kd of 114 μm, 160 μm, and 200 μm, respectively) and has lower affinity for Rib5P and Gal6P (∼1mm, Table 2). Interestingly, the Kd value of 200 μm measured for Glc6P by fluorescence is comparable to the Km value (144 μm) determined for yeast glucose-6-phosphate epimerase (15Chance E.M. Hess B. Plesser T. Wurster B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). No binding could be detected for glucose demonstrating the importance in substrate specificity of the phosphate group.TABLE 2Ligand bindingLigandKdmMGlucose 6-phosphate0.2Mannose 6-phosphate0.16Galactose 6-phosphate0.985Ribose 5-phosphate1.1Fructose 6-phosphate0.114GlucoseNDaND, not detectable.a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab We have tested both Man6P and Gal6P as mutarotase substrates of YMR099cp using NMR techniques. Man6P and Gal6P differ from Glc6P by the orientation of the hydroxyl group at position C2 and C4, respectively (Fig. 4). First, sugar binding has been monitored using a 1H-1D reference spectrum and a one-dimensional saturation difference (STD) technique (31Meyer B. Peters T. Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2003; 42: 864-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The 1H-1D reference spectra recorded for these different ligands (present at 20 mm) in the absence or presence of 25 μm YMR099cp show a specific line broadening for the peaks corresponding to both the α and β anomeric protons upon enzyme addition. This indicates that YMR099cp binds to both anomeric forms from Glc6P, Gal6P, and Man6P (Fig. 5). This was confirmed by the STD spectra recorded for these three sugars (data not shown). Second, enzyme catalyzed anomeric interconversion was investigated using two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) as previously described for E. coli RbsD, a protein with mutarotase and pyranase activities on d-ribose (32Ryu K.S. Kim C. Kim I. Yoo S. Choi B.S. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25544-25548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Exchange cross-peaks between α and β Glc6P anomers could only be observed in the presence of YMR099cp enzyme (Fig. 5A). These cross-peaks are due to a fast YMR099cp-catalyzed interconversion between α and β Glc6P, thus confirming the glucose-6-phosphate mutarotase activity measured by enzyme-coupled assay. In addition, this validates that NOESY experiments are useful to screen for putative YMR099cp substrates. NOESY exchange cross-peaks between anomers were also observed on Gal6P and Man6P, when mixed with YMR099cp (Fig. 5, B and C). This clearly shows that YMR099cp also has mutarotase activity on Gal6P and Man6P sugars.FIGURE 5Hexose-6-phosphate mutarotase activity of YMR099cp. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra recorded with 200-ms mixing time were obtained for Glc6P (A), Gal6P (B), and Man6P (C) in the absence (left column) or presence (right column) of YMR099cp. The 1H one-dimensional NMR spectrum for each sample is shown on the x- and y-axis of the NOESY spectra. Exchange cross-peaks induced by addition of YMR099cp are linked to peaks from α and β anomeric protons by dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Altogether, these functional data clearly demonstrate that YMR099cp catalyzes the interconversion between the α and β anomers from at least three hexose 6-phosphate sugars (Glc6P, Gal6P, and Man6P).

In eubacteria, the sigma subunit of the RNA polymerase is responsible for recognizing the promoter sequence to initiate transcription (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A.

The RNA polymerase core (E) associated with a sigma factor of the σ70 family is capable of binding to a promoter and initiating transcription without any ancillary factor. In contrast, Eσ54 holoenzyme is unable to form open complex in the absence of an activator protein (9Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of the σ54-dependent promoters in many bacteria allows the σ54 factor from Aquifex aeolicus to successfully recognize the σ54-dependent promoter glnHp2 from E. coli (15Studholme D.J. Wigneshwereraraj S.R. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, Eσ54 strictly requires the presence of an activator protein to carry out the transition from closed to open complex. Experimental evidence obtained from in vitro studies using heteroduplex DNA fragments containing a σ54 promoter sequence mimicking a fork junction suggests that the inability of Eσ54 holoenzyme to spontaneously melt DNA is based on the interaction between the N-terminal region of σ54 and a repressive DNA fork formed transitorily by melted DNA at the -11- and -10-positions, 2The promoter numbering given in this work considers the dinucleotide GC as the -13- and -12-positions, respectively. which are adjacent to the GC dinucleotide. This interaction inhibits the ability of the holoenzyme to spread melting and keeps it inactive to initiate transcription. Therefore, it has been proposed that the bases in the -12 box have a regulatory role in the isomerization process (16Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Guo Y. Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Casaz P. Gallegos M.T.

Transcriptional activators of Eσ54 usually bind to sequence motifs located 100 bp upstream of the promoter sequence and for this reason are commonly known as enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs). 3The abbreviations used are: EBP, enhancer-binding protein; WT, wild type; UAS, upstream activation site. These proteins belong to the family of AAA+ ATPases and couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to remodel the nucleoprotein complex formed by the N terminus of σ54 bound to the DNA fork structure, relieving the inhibitory interactions and allowing open complex formation (21Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 22Xu H. Hoover T.R. Curr. Opin.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By sequence alignment, σ54 has been divided in three regions. Region I is located at the N terminus of the protein and contains determinants for nucleating DNA melting, for inhibiting open complex formation, and to mediate the response to the EBPs (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Syed A. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5619-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been established that Region I makes a major contribution to bind the fork junction structure located at the -11-position in heteroduplex probes (16Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Guo Y. Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Casaz P. Gallegos M.T.

Region II is variable, and although its role in transcription is still unclear, it has been implicated in assisting σ54 binding to DNA and melting (26Cannon W. Chaney M. Buck M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Southern E. Merrick M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). At the C terminus, Region III shows a helixturn-helix motif and a very conserved amino acid sequence named the RpoN box; both have been proposed to interact with DNA (21Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that some residues in the RpoN box interact with the -24 promoter sequence (28Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Ishihama A. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29728-29743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Doucleff M. Malak L.T. Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. J. Biol.

Results obtained using (p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)-EDTA Fe-σ54 conjugates indicate that in addition to σ54 Region I, the residue Arg336, which lies in Region III, is also close to the -12 promoter box (20Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M.K. Ishihama A. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 681-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result agrees with previous observations, where mutants in Arg336, as well as mutants in Region I, were defective in controlling open complex formation. Therefore, two different structural elements of σ54 have been proposed to be part of the regulatory center that controls melting (30Wang L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8979-8986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The complete genome sequence of several microorganisms has shown that the rpoN gene (encoding the σ54 factor) is widely distributed among eubacteria. A few organisms have two copies of rpoN, such as Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium etli (32Kullik I. Fritsche S. Knobel H. Sanjuan J. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Michiels J. Moris M. Dombrecht B. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ralstonia solanacearum, and Burkholderia fungorum. In B. japonicum, these copies are highly similar, and they are functionally interchangeable (32Kullik I. Fritsche S. Knobel H. Sanjuan J. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodobacter sphaeroides is the only known bacterium with four copies of rpoN in its genome. This unusual high number of rpoN gene copies does not seem to be the result of recent events of duplication, since the products of these genes show a degree of similarity ranging from 48 to 51%. We have previously shown that these copies are not functionally interchangeable (34Poggio S. Osorio A. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Poggio S. Osorio A. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 969-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RpoN1 is involved in the expression of the genes required for nitrogen fixation, whereas RpoN2 is required for the transcription of the class II and class III flagellar genes. The molecular determinants that confer this specificity have not yet been investigated. In this work, we show evidence that the promoter sequences recognized by RpoN1 and RpoN2 have subtle differences that are used by these proteins to bind differentially; furthermore, our results indicate that each sigma factor is activated only by its cognate activator protein (EBP). Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Plasmids and strains of R. sphaeroides and E. coli used in this work are listed in Table 1. R. sphaeroides was grown in Sistrom's minimal medium (36Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1962; 28: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or in minimal medium with malate (0.4%) and glutamate as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively (MG medium) (34Poggio S. Osorio A. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the N+-aerobic growth conditions, a saturated culture was diluted 1:10 with fresh Sistrom's medium in a 250-ml Erlenmayer flask. The cultures were incubated in the dark with strong shaking (200 rpm). To achieve nitrogen fixing conditions, R. sphaeroides was grown as described before (34Poggio S. Osorio A. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, a culture grown under heterotrophic conditions was collected when it reached an A600 of 0.4. After two washes with minimal medium, the cells were suspended in the original volume of MG medium. This culture was used to completely fill screw cap tubes that were incubated under constant illumination for a period of 12 h. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: for R. sphaeroides, spectinomycin (50 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), tetracycline (1 μg/ml), and gentamycin (5 μg/ml); for E. coli, spectinomycin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (15 μg/ml), gentamycin (30 μg/ml), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). E. coli strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidGenotype or descriptionReference/SourceR. sphaeroidesWS8Wild-type strain, NalrRef. 61Sockett R.E.

Restriction enzymes were used according to the recommendations from the manufacturer. Standard methods were used for transformation, ligation, and other related techniques. To isolate SP16 and SP17 strains, the wild-type nifA gene was obtained by PCR using total DNA from WS8 cells and the oligonucleotides nifA1 (5′-GCTCTAGACATCGCTCGCCCCTTCGTGCG-3′) and nifAr1 (5′-ACCGAATTCACCTTCACCAGC-3′). These oligonucleotides were designed in accordance with the R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 genomic sequence. The PCR product was cloned in pTZ19R, generating pRS310. From this plasmid, most of the coding region of nifA was deleted by inverse PCR, using the oligonucleotides nifArev1 (5′-GGTACCCCGGACGTGTCCATCACCAGAC-3′) and nifArev3 (5′-GGTACCCCGAGAAGTTCTAGCCCGCCAC-3′), which included a KpnI restriction site. The PCR product was gel-purified and digested with KpnI. The resultant product was ligated with the Kanr cassette obtained from pUC4K. The fragment carrying the nifAΔ::Kan allele was then subcloned in pJQ200mp18 and introduced to R. sphaeroides WS8 wild type or into SP8 strain (34Poggio S. Osorio A. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Allelic exchange was confirmed by Southern blot or PCR. The upstream region of fliOp wild type or that of the mutant versions of fliOp was substituted with the upstream region of nifUp following the next steps. First, the region upstream nifU was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA from WS8 cells and the oligonucleotides nif3Eco 5′-GGAATTCGCTCCCGGCAGGCGTCGTCC-3′ and nifBgl 5′-GAGATCTCACTGCAGGGAGTTGCGGAGG-3′. The amplification product was gel-purified and digested with EcoRI and BglII. The plasmids carrying fliOp wild type and the mutant versions of fliOp were amplified by PCR deleting the region upstream fliOp, using the oligonucleotides fliOBgl (5′-TGAGATCTCGCGGGCGGGCGGCACGGATG-3) and pTZ19Eco (5′-GAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACG-3′). The products were gel-purified and digested with EcoRI and BglII, and each of these products was ligated with the PCR product carrying the upstream region of nifUp. The presence of the insert as well as the correct mutation in fliOp was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Finally, the complete fragment was transferred into pBBRMCS53, and the appropriate orientation was confirmed. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (37Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) with a uracil-containing single-stranded DNA as template. The plasmid carrying the fliOp promoter consists of a 391-bp DNA fragment, cloned in pTZ19R. This DNA fragment carries 254 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (38Poggio S. Aguilar C. Osorio A. González-Pedrajo B. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5787-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were as follows: 5′-GTCCCCCTCCGCNGCAACATCCGTGCCG-3′, 5′-CAACATCCGTGCCAAGCGCCCGCGTGAGGATC-3′, and 5′-GTCCCCCTCCGCAGCACGATCCGTGCCAAGCGCC-3′. The presence of the desired mutation in the resultant plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. Finally, the fragments carrying the wild-type promoter or its derivatives were subcloned into pBBRMCS53 in the appropriate orientation. Conjugation—Plasmid DNA was mobilized into R. sphaeroides by conjugation according to previously reported procedures (39Davis J. Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 320-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase Assay—β-Glucuronidase was determined from sonicated cell-free extracts using 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide as substrate and following a previously reported protocol (40Jefferson R.A. Burgess S.M. Hirsh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8447-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-free extracts were incubated at 37 °C in reaction buffer. Samples of 100 μl were taken at three different time points and mixed with 0.9 ml of stop buffer (0.2 m Na2CO3). Fluorometric determinations were made in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LA-5 apparatus (excitation wavelength, 360 nm; emission wavelength, 446 nm). The fluorometer was calibrated using 4-methylumbelliferone standards. Specific activities are expressed as nmol of 4-methylum-belliferone formed/min/mg of protein. DNA and Proteins—Synthetic PAGE-purified oligonucleotides, corresponding to the -59 to +22 sequence of the fliOp promoter (38Poggio S. Aguilar C. Osorio A. González-Pedrajo B. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5787-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or the -58 to +23 sequence of the predicted nifUp promoter were used to construct the heteroduplex molecules used in this work (see Fig. 4). DNA probes were prepared as follows. The top strand was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and mixed with the complementary strand. The mixture containing 4 pmol of 32P-end-labeled DNA and 6 pmol of complementary strand in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 80 mm NaCl was boiled briefly and cooled slowly to room temperature. The resulting annealed probes were then diluted in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 80 mm NaCl. To obtain RpoN1 and RpoN2 proteins, the coding regions of rpoN1 and rpoN2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pBADHis-C vector. The resultant plasmids were introduced to the LMG174-1 strain, and different growth temperatures and arabinose concentrations were tested in order to determine the optimal condition to overproduce these polypeptides. Both proteins remained in the insoluble fraction in all tested conditions, and for this reason, the proteins were purified from the inclusion bodies. The procedure for protein purification is based on previously reported methods (41Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, after 3 h of induction at 30 °C with 0.02% arabinose, the cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C. The insoluble fraction was extracted with TGED buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or a mixture of protease inhibitors manufactured by Roche Applied Science, and a second extraction with 1% Triton X-100 was carried out. Detergent was removed by washing three times with TGED. Finally, the pellet was carefully resuspended in 8 m urea buffered with TGED. The protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against TGED buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, followed by a further 6-h dialysis with fresh TGED buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The oligonucleotides 5′-AGATCTGGTGCGCGTGCCCGAGGGGGC-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGCTGCGCCTGCCGCCGGCGCC-3′ were used as forward primers to obtain the PCR product coding for RpoN1ΔI and RpoN2ΔI. These products were cloned into pBAD/His-C and introduced into LMG174-1 strain. To obtain the polypeptides corresponding to Region I of RpoN1 and RpoN2, the DNA region encoding the first 57 residues of these proteins was amplified by PCR using as reverse primers the 57Nif or 57Fli oligonucleotide (5′-GGAATTCTCACTCGAGGCAGGGATTTTC-3′ or 5′-GAATTCTCATTCGATGAAAGGGTTTTC-3′, respectively), which include TCA bases as the stop codon. These proteins were purified following the procedure described above. Circular Dichroism—Previous to CD analysis, the proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol, with three changes of the dialysis buffer, each of 100 times the sample volume. Dialysis was carried out over a period of 24 h at 4 °C. Molar ellipticity values were obtained using an Aviv Biomedical CD spectrophotometer model 202-01. The resulting spectra were analyzed using CDPro (available on the World Wide Web at lamar.colostate.edu/~sreeram/CDPro/main.html). Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions were carried out at 30 °C in STA buffer (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reactions included 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor, DNA probe labeled with 32P, and a 50, 100, or 200 μm concentration of the indicated protein. After 20 min, the samples were loaded on a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel and run at 12 mA in Tris-glycine buffer. After electrophoresis, radioactivity was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager apparatus (Bio-Rad) or by autoradiography using ImageJ software. Analysis of the RpoN1- and RpoN2-dependent Promoters from the Complete Genome of R. sphaeroides—To investigate if there were any significant differences in the promoter sequences recognized by RpoN1 and RpoN2, we compared the promoter sequences that are recognized by these sigma factors. For this, the logo sequence of each set of flagellar (fli) and nitrogen fixation (nif) promoters predicted from the genome sequence was obtained using the information content software developed by Schneider and Stephens (42Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2439) Google Scholar). Comparison of the logo sequences revealed some differences (Fig. 1), in particular a higher conservation at the -26-, -27-, and -28-positions for the nif promoters as well as a strong preference for T or A at the -11-position in the nif or fli promoters, respectively, suggesting that RpoN1 recognizes a larger promoter sequence than RpoN2 and that the -11-position could be important for specificity. Evaluation of the Contribution of the Promoter Sequence Bias to Sigma Factor Specificity—To test if the differences in the promoter sequences mentioned above might be involved in the differential recognition and expression mediated by RpoN1 and RpoN2, we mutagenized the nucleotides of fliOp for those present in the sequence of nifUp. Transcriptional fusions of these promoter versions with the reporter gene uidA (encoding β-glucuronidase) were constructed using pBBMCS53. The amount of β-glucuronidase expressed from these plasmids was determined for WS8 cells grown under N+-aerobic conditions, which would maintain a low level of RpoN1 (43Meijer W.G. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3855-3866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the level of β-glucuronidase produced by the wild-type fliOp promoter, a 5-fold reduction was observed when changes were introduced at positions -28, -27, and -26, and a 9-fold reduction was observed when changes were introduced at positions -15 and -16. When these changes where combined in a single construction, the promoter activity was reduced by only 5-fold (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that when the wild-type A at the -11-position was substituted by any other nucleotide, a reduction of 50-100-fold in the promoter activity was observed, suggesting a major contribution of this particular nucleotide in the activity of the fliOp promoter. For simplicity, the changes at -28, -27, and -26 will be referred to hereafter as up-24, and the changes at -16 and -15 will be referred to as up-12. All previous constructions were introduced into the SP7/pRS210 strain, which carries a mutation in rpoN2 but properly expresses the fleT and fleQ genes encoding the flagellar EBPs (35Poggio S. Osorio A. Dreyfus G. Camarena L. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 969-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, in this strain, the activities of all of these promoters were strongly reduced, indicating that RpoN2 was responsible for the activity detected in WS8 cells. As mentioned above, the expression of RpoN1 would be at a low level under the growth conditions used in the previous experiments (43Meijer W.G. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3855-3866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to correctly evaluate if RpoN1 could promote transcription from these promoters, we cultured these strains under nitrogen-fixing conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As an induction control, the plasmid carrying the fusion nifUp-uidA was included in the assay. All of the fliOp promoter versions tested in the WS8 strain showed a similar amount of β-glucuronidase activity to that observed under N+-aerobic conditions (Fig. 3), indicating that these promoters are not significantly expressed by RpoN1. A slight increase in the activity level could be detected in SP7/pRS210 cells grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions, when the fliOp promoter more closely resembled nifUp (Fig. 3D), although the β-glucuronidase activity is only 5% of tha"
https://openalex.org/W1977840217,"In the present study, we characterized a sterile <i>cpi-2a</i>(ok1256) deletion mutant in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and showed that CPI-2a has an essential regulatory role during oogenesis and fertilization. We have also shown that the CPI2a inhibitor and both <i>Ce-</i>CPL-1 and <i>Ce-</i>CPZ-1 enzymes are present in the myoepithelial sheath surrounding germ cells, oocytes, and embryos as well as in the yolk granules within normal oocytes. Staining of mutant worms with anti-yolk protein antibodies has indicted that the proteins are not present in the mature oocytes. Moreover, green fluorescent protein expression was absence or reduced in <i>cpi-2a/yp170</i>:<i>gfp</i> mutant oocytes, although it was expressed in one of the successfully developed embryos. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the sterility in <i>cpi-2a</i>(ok1256) mutant worms is potentially caused by two possible mechanisms: 1) defects in the uptake and/or processing of yolk proteins by the growing oocytes and 2) indirect induction of defects in cell-cell signaling that is critical for promoting germ line development, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and fertilization. A defect in any of these processes would have detrimental effects on the development of normal embryos and consequently normal production of progenies as we observed in <i>cpi-2a</i> mutant worms. This is the first study that demonstrates the expression of cysteine proteases and their endogenous inhibitor in the gonadal sheath cells surrounding germ cells and oocytes, which indirectly have established their potential involvement in proteolytic processing of molecules within the gonadal sheath cells, such as components of the extracellular matrix or the cytoskeletal proteins, which are essential for proper cell-cell signaling activities of the gonadal sheath cells during normal maturation and ovulation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2117229444,"To address questions about the structure of the vacuolar ATPase, we have generated mutant strains of Neurospora crassa defective in six subunits, C, H, a, c, c′, and c″. Except for strains lacking subunit c′, the mutant strains were indistinguishable from each other in most phenotypic characteristics. They did not accumulate arginine in the vacuoles, grew poorly at pH 5.8 with altered morphology, and failed to grow at alkaline pH. Consistent with findings from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the data indicate that subunits C and H are essential for generation of a functional enzyme. Unlike S. cerevisiae, N. crassa has a single isoform of the a subunit. Analysis of other fungal genomes indicates that only the budding yeasts have a two-gene family for subunit a. It has been unclear whether subunit c′, a small proteolipid, is a component of all V-ATPases. Our data suggest that this subunit is present in all fungi, but not in other organisms. Mutation or deletion of the N. crassa gene encoding subunit c′ did not completely eliminate V-ATPase function. Unlike other V-ATPase null strains, they grew, although slowly, at alkaline pH, were able to form conidia (asexual spores), and were inhibited by concanamycin, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase. The phenotypic character in which strains differed was the ability to go through the sexual cycle to generate mature spores and viable mutant progeny. Strains lacking the integral membrane subunits a, c, c′, and c″ had more severe defects than strains lacking subunits C or H.

Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) 2The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase; F-ATPase, F1F0-ATP synthase; RIP, repeat-induced point mutation.2The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase; F-ATPase, F1F0-ATP synthase; RIP, repeat-induced point mutation. are ATP-driven proton pumps that acidify intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, including the vacuoles of fungi and plants, lysosomes, endosomes, the Golgi, and secretory vesicles. Acidification of these organelles is important for numerous cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, zymogen activation, intracellular trafficking, protein degradation, coupled transport of small molecules, and viral entry (1Kane P.M.

V-ATPases are also located at the plasma membrane in a subset of cells in which they function in processes such as renal acidification, bone resorption, and pH homeostasis (4Wagner C.A. Finberg K.E.

Much of what is known about V-ATPases comes from studies of fungal and bovine enzymes. The V-ATPase is composed of two sectors that form a ball and stalk structure (7Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18783-18789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol.

It has a molecular mass of ∼570 kDa and is composed of eight types of subunits, A through H. ATP hydrolysis occurs at the interface between the A and B subunits. The ∼260-kDa V0 sector of the enzyme, embedded in the membrane, is composed of five or six types of subunits, ac(c′)c″de (1Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The V-ATPases are closely related to the F1F0-ATP synthases (F-ATPases) of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, which synthesize ATP (9Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The composition and stoichiometry of the F1Fo-ATP synthase from Escherichia coli is α3β3γδϵ for the F1 and b2ac10 for the F0; the F0 contains a ring of 10 identical c subunits that contain the proton-binding site (10Senior A.E.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Protons move across the membrane as the c subunits rotate past the single a subunit (12Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Futai M. Omote H. Sambongi Y. Wada Y. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 2005; 102: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In several ways the V-ATPase has a more complex structure than the F-ATPase. It is significantly larger and has subunits (e.g. C, H and d) with no obvious counterparts in the F-ATPase (1Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). However, genetic experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided strong evidence that these subunits are essential components of the V-ATPase (15Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Beltran C. Kopecky J. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integral membrane part of the rotor is composed of two or three different types of proteolipids (the c, c′, and c″ subunits). The a subunit, which interacts with the proteolipids, is nearly 4-fold larger than its counterpart in the F-ATPase. Characterization of S. cerevisiae strains that lack each of the 14 subunits has provided strong evidence that every subunit is essential for the synthesis of a functional V-ATPase (1Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Such a comprehensive study of V-ATPase mutants has not been possible in metazoans because the loss of the V-ATPase causes embryonic lethality (18Inoue H. Noumi T. Nagata M. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Allan A.K. Du J. Davies S.A. Dow J.A. Physiol.

Strains with a null mutation in a V-ATPase gene are viable in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Loss of the V-ATPase gives rise to a distinctive morphological change in the hyphae, loss of vacuolar function, and defects in development (21Bowman E.J. Kendle R. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this report we have used this phenotypic complexity to ask whether strains of N. crassa lacking different V-ATPase subunits have identical phenotypes and to address specific questions concerning the subunit composition of the V-ATPase. Subunits C and H have sometimes been viewed as accessory subunits that are not part of the core catalytic mechanism (22Keenan Curtis K. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2716-2724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Subunit H interacts with other proteins such as Nef in human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (26Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and yeast ectoapyrase (27Zhong X. Malhotra R. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35592-35599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), perhaps facilitating the association of the V-ATPase with other enzymes or membranes. Subunit C appears to readily dissociate from the V-ATPase. Purified preparations of the enzyme from N. crassa were initially reported to lack this subunit (28Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we ask, do strains lacking the C and H subunits have a typical V-ATPase null phenotype? In S. cerevisiae, vph1 mutants (i.e. lacking subunit a) are able to grow, although slowly, in medium that has high calcium or alkaline pH, conditions that completely prevent the growth of strains lacking other V-ATPase subunits (29Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An isoform of the a subunit, encoded by the STV1 gene, can partially substitute for the loss of Vph1p. Later work reported that in the wild type the STV1-encoded subunit functions in the Golgi, whereas the VPH1-encoded subunit is targeted to the vacuole (30Kawasaki-Nishi S. Bowers K. Nishi T. Forgac M. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47411-47420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our preliminary findings suggested that N. crassa has only one gene for this protein. In this report we ask, are multiple genes for the a subunit characteristic of fungal species? Some investigators have suggested that V-ATPases from animals lack the c′ subunit, shown to be essential in S. cerevisiae (31Whyteside G. Gibson L. Scott M. Finbow M.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2981-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this yeast c and c′ are similar proteins with 53% sequence identity (32Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Identification of the c′ subunit and characterization of strains with mutations in the gene encoding it have not been reported from other organisms. We have found a candidate gene for subunit c′ in N. crassa and have characterized strains with mutations in this gene. We have also analyzed genome sequence data bases to ask what types of organisms have genes that may encode a c′ subunit?

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the program PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony; Sinauer, Sunderland, MA). Phylogenetic trees were constructed with JALVIEW (36Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Mutation of vma Genes by Repeat-induced Point Mutation—The procedure of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is an efficient means of inactivating genes in N. crassa (37Selker E.U. Garrett P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6870-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, an ectopic copy of the gene to be mutated is introduced by transformation. The strain is crossed, and before nuclear fusion occurs a DNA silencing mechanism changes many of the C nucleotides to T in both the endogenous and ectopic copies of the introduced gene. If the size of the duplicated gene is 2 kb or larger, 5–50% of the progeny are typically mutated (38Selker E.U. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 579-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Progeny from the cross are screened either by direct analysis of the DNA or by the appearance of a new phenotype. We used PCR to amplify the vma-5, vma-11, vma-13, and vma-16 genes. The primers used and the sizes of the fragments generated are shown in Table 1. Each of the genes was then subcloned into the plasmid pCR2.1 TOPO from the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Gene fragments were excised from the pCR2.1 plasmids by digestion with either EcoRI (vma-5 and vma-13) or NotI and SpeI (vma-11 and vma-16) and subcloned into the vector pBM61 (39Margolin B.S.

The pBM61 vector contains a truncated form of the his-3 gene designed to facilitate the targeted integration of plasmid DNA at the his-3 locus (39Margolin B.S. Freitag M. Selker E.U. Fungal Genet. Newsletter. 1997; 44: 34-36Google Scholar). We selected transformants that were histidine prototrophs. Because conidia typically have multiple nuclei, these primary transformants were usually heterokaryons. By crossing the transformants to the his-3 strain and selecting his+ progeny, we obtained homokaryotic strains. Integration of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR using the T3 and T7 primer pair that flanks the cloning site in pBM61. The homokaryotic his+ transformants were then crossed again to the wild type strain 74A. For the vma-11 and vma-16 genes, we isolated transformants of both mating types and crossed them to each other. Thus, all of the nuclei in these crosses had a gene duplication and were susceptible to the RIP process. The ascospores produced from each cross were germinated on agar plates containing Vogel's salts (40Vogel H.J. Am. Nat. 1964; 98: 435-446Crossref Google Scholar), 2% sorbose, 0.05% glucose, and 0.05% fructose. After 24 h at 30 °C colonies with defective V-ATPase were identified by the morphological abnormality shown in Fig. 1. For all putative mutant strains, genomic DNA was prepared from 20 mg of lyophilized mycelia, using the DNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen), and amplified by PCR, using the primers shown in Table 1. Sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Berkeley. The vph-1 gene was originally cloned in 1993, before sequences were available from many organisms. Briefly, we obtained from Dr. Morris Manolson (University of Toronto) 2 primers designed for the S. cerevisiae VPH1 gene (41Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With these we used PCR to generate a 141-bp fragment of the vph-1 gene from N. crassa genomic DNA. We screened a N. crassa λZAP cDNA library with this fragment and isolated several cDNA clones, one of which was used to screen the Orbach/Sachs cosmid library (Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Kansas City, MO). A 4.2-kb KpnI fragment containing the coding region and flanking sequences of vph-1 was inserted into the SK vector to create pFO2B#1A. The cDNA and genomic DNA sequences were submitted to GenBank™ with accession number U36396. These sequences are identical to those obtained by the Neurospora Genome Project. We used the RIP procedure to inactivate the vph-1 gene. A 3.9-kb SpeI fragment with the vph-1 coding region and flanks from pFO2B#1A was subcloned into the pBM61 vector and transformed into the his-3 strain. By genetic crosses to a his-3– strain and then to the wild type 74A, we obtained one rare isolate that was vph-1 null with no ectopic copy of the vph-1 gene. Inactivation of vma Genes by Homologous Gene Replacement—Despite numerous attempts, we were not able to isolate a strain with a null mutation in the vma-3 gene by using the RIP procedure. Although much less efficient, we decided to use homologous integration to replace the vma-3 protein-coding region with the inl gene, which encodes an enzyme required for inositol synthesis. Using primers that contained BamHI sites (Table 1, pair A), we amplified a 4.9-kb fragment that contained the vma-3 protein-coding region plus a ∼2-kb flanking region on each side. This fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site in the Bluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene) to produce pVMA3/5kb. We then used primers containing MluI and StuI sites (Table 1, pair B) to initiate replication on each side of the open reading frame, oriented such that the flanking regions and the vector were amplified, but not the open reading frame. Phosphate was added to the ends of the PCR product with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and subsequent ligation produced pVMA3noORF. Primers containing an MluI site (Table 1) were used to amplify the inl gene, and the gene was cloned into the MluI site in pVMA3noORF. This plasmid, named pVMA3/inl, had a functional inl gene flanked by the 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions of vma-3. It was used to transform the inl mutant strain by electroporation. Prototrophic transformants were selected. Essentially all of the transformants grew with normal hyphal morphology, indicating that the plasmid had integrated at an ectopic location, as is typical for N. crassa. However, one transformant had the same growth defects we had observed in other vma null strains. PCR analysis indicated that the inl gene had replaced the vma-3 gene. The strain with the vma-3::inl+ gene, had no detectable vma-3 protein-coding region by Southern blot analysis. Introduction of the pVMA3–5kb plasmid, which contains a functional copy of vma-3, restored growth (data not shown). As described under “Results” analysis of the phenotype of vma-11-RIP strains suggested they contained some residual V-ATPase activity. For this reason we used homologous integration to construct a strain in which the coding region of the vma-11 gene was replaced by the bar gene, which confers resistance to the fungicide bialaphos (42Pall M.L. Fungal Genet. Newsletter. 1993; 40: 58Google Scholar). We used the same strategy as with pVMA3/inl described above. A 3-kb fragment of the vma-11 gene containing ∼1 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of the protein-coding region was generated by PCR (Table 1, primer pair B). It was subcloned into the plasmid pCR2.1, generating pCR2.1bar. We then amplified this plasmid with primer pair C (Table 1, pair C). The resulting linear PCR product contained 1 kb of both upstream and downstream regions of vma-11 as well as the pCR2.1 plasmid. The fragment was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated, generating the plasmid pCR2.1vma11noORF. A 2.25-kb AatII fragment containing the BAR gene was isolated from the plasmid pBARGEM7–1 and cloned into the AatII site in pCR2.1vma11noORF at the junction of the vma-11 flanking DNA generating the plasmid pCR2.1vma-11bar. pCR2.1vma-11bar was introduced into the strain mus-52 inl a by electroporation. Strains with the mus-52 mutation have recently been shown to have higher rates of homologous integration (43Ninomiya Y. Suzuki K. Ishii C. Inoue H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12248-12253Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Colonies that grew in the presence of 200 μg of bialophos/ml (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands) were selected. PCR analysis of a colony with a morphology similar to that observed in other vma null strains indicated that the vma-11 gene had been replaced by the bar gene. This strain, named vma-11::bar, had no detectable vma-11 protein-coding region by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Generation of Anti-subunit H Antibody—A cDNA for vma-13 was generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pQE-9 (Qiagen), generating the plasmid pVMA-13–6His. The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain DH5α. Transcription of vma-13 was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. A cell lysate containing the expressed H subunit was then purified using a Ni+ column. The H subunit was verified by Western blot using the His6 antibody. The H subunit protein from an acrylamide gel was mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected into a rabbit. Serum was collected and used to visualize the H subunit in Western blots prepared from N. crassa cell fractions. Methods for Measuring Growth Rates, Spore Germination, and Arginine Content of Cells—The procedures used for composition of media, growth of strains, and genetic analysis were those of Davis (44Davis R.H. Neurospora: Contributions of a Model Organism. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 283-303Google Scholar). Vogel's medium contains salts (40Vogel H.J. Am. Nat. 1964; 98: 435-446Crossref Google Scholar) plus 2% sucrose. The rate of growth was determined by inoculating at the edge of agar plates containing Vogel's medium. The plates were incubated at 30 °C, and the position of the growth front of the colony was marked at 8- and 16-h intervals. To assess the production of viable progeny from crosses, ascospores were spread on plates containing Vogel's salts, 2% agar, 2% sorbose, 0.05% glucose 0.05% fructose, and 0.15 mg of myo-inositol/ml. Germination was induced by heat shock (30 min at 60 °C). The spores were either left on the plates or transferred individually to tubes with 1 ml of medium (2% Vogel's salts, 2% sucrose, 0.15 mg of inositol/ml).

Using the amino acid sequences of S. cerevisiae V-ATPase subunits, we searched the N. crassa genome and identified subunits C, H, a, c′, c″, and e (Table 2). The N. crassa vma genes are scattered randomly throughout the genome.

We examined the genomes of other fungi for which complete sequences are available and constructed a phylogenetic tree of all genes encoding subunit a (Fig. 2). Other filamentous ascomycetes, such as Magnaporthe grisea and Aspergillus nidulans, had a single gene, closely related to the N. crassa gene. Cryptococcus neoformans, a basidomycete, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a fission yeast, also had only one gene. Only S. cerevisiae and other budding yeasts had two genes. The VPH1 and STV1 genes of S. cerevisiae are less similar to each other than either one is to its apparent ortholog in other budding yeasts. Both mouse and human cells appear to have four genes encoding subunit a, which are equally divergent in sequence from the fungal VPH1 and STV1 genes. As in the budding yeasts, each human isoform is more similar to an isoform from mouse than to other human isoforms. A second interesting finding concerned subunits c′ and c″. Like yeast, N. crassa contains orthologs of both the vma-11 and vma-16 genes, encoding subunits c′ and c″ (Table 2). These are small, hydrophobic proteins (proteolipids) with four or five transmembrane helices. We found orthologs to these genes in all of the completed fungal genomes. Subunits c and c′ have similar sequences, but within fungi they are clearly distinct types of proteins. The N. crassa c′ subunit has a higher degree of protein sequence identity to the S. cerevisiae c′ subunit (66.5%) than it does to the N. crassa c subunit (59.5%). Fig. 3 shows the alignment of amino acid sequences of c and c′ subunits from two filamentous fungi, two budding yeasts, and one fission yeast. The subunit c from mouse is also included. The helical regions of the proteins are most highly conserved, especially the fourth helix, which contains the glutamate (Glu138 in N. crassa subunit c) that is the probable proton-binding site. However, a few regions are unique to subunit c or c′. The loop connecting helices 2 and 3 is longer in the c′ subunits and has conserved proline and histidine residues (marked with arrows in Fig. 3). Four residues in the loop between helices 3 and 4 (SFML in N. crassa) are consistently different in c′ subunits. The subunit from mouse is more similar to subunit c than to c′. In a phylogenetic tree the c and c′ subunits of fungi cluster in two distinct groups (Fig. 4). The tree clearly suggests a closer relationship of the mammalian orthologs to fungal subunit c than to c′. For Caenorhabditis elegans the relationship is less clear. This organ"

Although native HL from Streptococcus agalactiae is composed of four domains, it finally stabilizes after autocatalytic conversion as a 92-kDa enzyme composed of the N-terminal spacer, middle α-, and C-terminal domains. These three domains are independent folding/unfolding units of the enzyme. Comparative structural and functional studies using the enzyme and its various fragments/domains suggest a relatively insignificant role of the N-terminal spacer domain in the 92-kDa enzyme. Functional studies demonstrate that the α-domain is the catalytic domain. However, independently it has a maximum of only about 10% of the activity of the 92-kDa enzyme, whereas its complex with the C-terminal domain in vitro shows a significant enhancement (about 6-fold) in the activity. It has been previously proposed that the C-terminal domain modulates the enzymatic activity of HLs. In addition, one of the possible roles for calcium ions was suggested to induce conformational changes in the enzyme loops, making HL more suitable for catalysis. However, we observed that calcium ions do not interact with the enzyme, and its role actually is in modulating the hyaluronan conformation and not in the functional regulation of enzyme.

Streptococci of serological group B are well known major human pathogens. The organism predominantly colonizes the mucosal surfaces and/or skin as a first step for invasion, and is responsible for diseases like meningitis, septicemia, and other neonatal infections (1Dillon Jr., H.C.

Lin B. Willingham T.R. Baker J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Virulent Streptococcus agalactiae isolates associated with invasive disease are known to produce higher levels of extracellular hyaluronate lyases (4Yildirim A.O. Fink K. Lammler Ch. Res. Vet. Sci. 2002; 73: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).HLs form a special group of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes that cleave predominantly the N-acetylglucosamine (1β→4) glycosidic bond of hyaluronan (HA) to produce unsaturated polysaccharides (5Qui G.N. Toyoda H. Toida T. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. Tokyo. 1996; 44: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is part of a large family of enzymes called hyaluronidases, found in many Gram-positive pathogens (6Hynes W.L. Walton S.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes have been postulated to facilitate the spread of bacteria by breaking down HA, a polymer composed of repeating units of d-glucosoamine and d-glucuronic acid (7Kreil G. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1666-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). HA is ubiquitously present in many mammalian tissues including synovial fluid, cartilage, skin, brain, etc. and forms a major part of the extracellular matrix (8Jedrzejas M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The secondary substrate of HL is chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate, which is involved in cushioning of the surrounding structures and macromolecule transport (9Baker J.R. Yu H. Morrison K. Averett W.F. Pritchard D.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The native HLs from S. agalactiae and Streptococcuspneumoniae are composed of four domains: an N-terminal carbohydrate binding domain, small spacer β-sheet domain, α-domain, and C-terminal domain, which are connected through peptide linkers. Both the homologous enzymes (68% similarity) are initially expressed as 118/111-kDa and 107-kDa proteins, respectively, which are subsequently autodegraded from the N-terminal region and finally stabilized as 92-kDa (SagHL) and 89-kDa (SpnHL) proteins for which crystal structures are also available (10Rigden D.J.

In particular, the role of the C-terminal β-domain and the role of Ca2+ was suggested to modulate the functional activity of HL. To date no experimental validation of the role of Ca2+ is available.To understand the role of calcium ions in modulating the enzymatic activity of SagHL, and to study the role of different domains and their interactions that are essential for the functional regulation of the enzyme we cloned, overexpressed, and purified the SagHL, SagHL without the spacer domain (SagHL-βI), SagHL without the C-terminal domain (Sag Domain-I), α-domain, and finally the C-terminal domain (SagC). To demonstrate that the structural domains of SagHL are independent folding/unfolding units, the stability characteristics of the recombinant enzyme and independent fragments/domains were also studied.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Most of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Chelex100 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad, and ultra pure water (LiChrosolvR) was purchased from Merck.Cloning of SagHL, SagHL-βI, Sag Domain-I, α-Domain, and SagC—S. agalactiae culture and chromosomal DNA extractions were carried out as described previously (22Paton J.C. Berry A.M. Lock R. Hansman D. Manning P.A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 50-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene (Gen-Bank™ accession number-U15050) fragments encoding SagHL (Ser171-Ile984), SagHL-βI (Phe252-Ile984), Sag Domain-I (Ser171-Asn611), α-domain (Phe252-Asn611), and SagC (Lys621-Ile984) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The different forward primers used for SagHL/Sag Domain-I, SagHL-βI/α-domain, and SagC were 5′-CTA GCT AGC ATG TCA GAA CAT CCA CAA CCC GT, 5′-CTA GCT AGC ATG TTT ACA AAA CTC CTC GAC AAA T, and 5′-CTA GCT AGC ATG AAA AGT AAC TTA TCA ACC TTT AAT AGC, respectively. Similarly the reverse primers used for SagHL/SagHL-βI/SagC and Sag Domain-I/α-domain were 5′-CCG CTC GAG GAT AGC TAA TTG GTC TGT TTT TGT C and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TTA ATT AAG CAG CTT ATT CAT GTT GGC, respectively. For all the samples, PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl with 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification condition was 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3 min (for 30 cycles) and final extension for 10 min. These amplified gene fragments were digested with NheI and XhoI and then ligated into the pET 21-d vector cut with the same enzymes. Competent Escherichia coli DH5-α cells were transformed with the plasmid constructs and screened on the Luria-Bertani agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmids isolated from positive clones were further introduced into E. coli BL-21(DE3) cells for checking the expression of gene fragments.Overexpression and Purification of Proteins—For all the recombinant proteins, cells were initially grown at 30 °C until A600 ∼0.5-0.6 and later induced at 16 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown further for 7 h with mild shaking at the same temperature. For His tag proteins, cells were harvested and suspended in 5 mm imidazole buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 and 0.4 m NaCl (SagHL/SagHL-βI) and of a similar buffer of pH 8.3 for SagC. Further, the cells were sonicated, and cell lysates were loaded onto a Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated with the respective buffers. In each case, the column was initially washed extensively with the same buffer followed by the 50 mm imidazole buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient of 50-500 mm imidazole buffer. Eluted proteins were finally concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6. In the case of the Sag Domain-1/α-domain, the harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3 containing 2 mm EDTA. After sonication the cell lysate was loaded onto a Mono-Q column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the respective buffers. In each case, the column was then washed with the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer containing 50-300 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl of the respective pH values. All the recombinant proteins were further passed through Superdex 200HR 10/30 column on AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the respective buffers prepared in water (LiChrosolvR) and purified through a Chelex100 column) for activity measurements. The purity of recombinant proteins were checked and found to be more than 95% pure. Expression and purification of SpnHL was carried out as described earlier (23Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25509-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Assay of Enzymatic Activity—The activities of the SagHL, SagHL-βI, Sag Domain-I, α-domain, and Sag Domain-I:SagC complex were determined by measuring their ability to break down HA to unsaturated disaccharide units. Briefly 20 μl of the enzyme sample (1 nm, diluted just before the assay) was added to 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml HA or 0.5 mg/ml chondroitin 6-sulfate in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2 (or stated otherwise) at pH 6.2. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min during which the measurements were carried out by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm at 37 °C (23Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25509-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).For Km and Vmax determination, the protein concentrations used were 1, 8, and 3.3/1.6 nm for SagHL/SagHL-βI, Sag Domain-I/α-domain, and Sag Domain-I:SagC complexes, respectively. The concentration of polymeric HA (24Kelly S.J. Taylor K.B. Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 293-304Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was expressed as hexasaccharide units of HA (HA6), which was prepared by adding 40 units of Streptococcus hyalurolyticus HL (Sigma) to a 6 mg/ml solution of HA in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2. The mixture was incubated for 10 min to 6 h (depending upon the products desired) at 37 °C. The digested products (contains mostly tetra/hexa/octa/decasaccharide (HA4/HA6/HA8/HA10)) were loaded onto a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2 (prepared in water (LiChrosolvR) and purified through a Chelex100 column) at 25 °C with detection at 232 nm. The products were eluted, and the masses were confirmed by ESI-MS. A millimolar absorption coefficient of 5.5 was used for the disaccharide product (25Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For all enzymatic activity measurements, the required chemicals, buffers, and other components did not contain trace amounts of metal ion contamination. The solutions were further checked by atomic absorption spectroscopy.Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD measurements were made using a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter calibrated with ammonium (+)-10 -camphorsulfonate. The results are expressed as the mean residual ellipticity [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 × θobs/(lc), where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the concentration in moles of residue per liter, and l is the length of the light path in centimeters. The values obtained were normalized by subtracting the baseline recorded for the buffer having the same concentration of denaturant or salt under similar conditions. The protein concentration used for the studies was 1 μm.Size-exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—Gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column on AKTA FPLC. The column was calibrated with various molecular weight standard markers before use. The column was equilibrated and run with 20 mm Tris-HCl of the desired pH. 200 μl of the sample were loaded on the column and run at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with detection at 280 nm.RESULTSThe three domains present in the crystal structure of SagHL (92 kDa) are: the N-terminal spacer domain or βI domain (Ser171-Val244), middle domain or α-domain (Phe252-Asn611), and the C-terminal domain or βII domain (Lys621-Ile984) (18Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The spacer domain is connected to the α-domain by a seven residue linker (Thr245-Asn251) and the α-domain is connected to the C-terminal domain by a nine residue linker (Asp612-Leu620). We have cloned, overexpressed, and purified the SagHL and its different fragments/domains (Fig. 1) and studied their structural and functional properties alone or in combination with other domains.Purification and Characterization of SagHL and Isolated Fragments/Domains—The cloned and overexpressed proteins were purified by the methods described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular masses of the purified recombinant SagHL, SagHL-βI, Sag Domain-I, α-domain, and SagC were 92, 83, 50, 41, and 42 kDa, respectively, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and MALDI-TOF (data not shown) and were similar to that deduced from their primary amino acid sequences. On a Superdex S-200 column (GE Healthcare), a single peak having retention volumes of 14.1, 14.4, 15.3, 15.7, and 15.2 ml (Fig. 2B), corresponding to the calculated molecular masses of 92, 83, 50, 41, and 51 kDa were observed for SagHL, SagHL-βI, Sag Domain-I, α-domain, and SagC, respectively. The molecular mass of SagC obtained from SEC was slightly higher than that observed from the SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF. This discrepancy may be caused by stabilization of the isolated SagC domain in a slightly open conformation resulting in a larger molecular dimension compared with the globular protein of equivalent molecular mass.FIGURE 2Overexpression and purification of recombinant SagHL, SagHL-βI, Sag Domain-I, α-domain, and SagC.

Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) of SagHL shows the presence of a mixed α-helical and β-sheet conformation (Fig. 3A, inset). For studying the thermal stability and the stability against GdmCl denaturation, we monitored the changes in CD ellipticity at 222 nm for all the proteins at increasing temperatures or GdmCl concentration. Upon thermal denaturation of SagHL, three distinct transitions (Fig. 3A) centered at about 42, 59, and 70 °C were observed. In the case of GdmCl-induced denaturation also three well separated transitions; two sharp transitions between 0.3-0.5 m and 0.7-1.0 m GdmCl and a broad transition between 1.2 and 2.6 m GdmCl were observed (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that probably the three structural domains of SagHL have significantly different stabilities against both thermal and GdmCl-induced denaturation.FIGURE 3Thermal and GdmCl denaturation profile of recombinant proteins.

The data are represented as percentages, with the value observed for native enzymes in the absence of GdmCl taken as 100%. The symbols are the same as in A. An enzyme concentration of 1.0 μm was used in all studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the recombinant SagHL-βI and Sag Domain-I, biphasic profiles with two distinct transitions centered at 56, 69 °C, and 45, 68 °C, respectively, were observed (Fig. 3A). SagC showed a single transition centered at about 59 °C. These transition temperatures observed for the respective domains/fragments were similar to that observed during thermal denaturation of SagHL. GdmCl-induced denaturation also showed the respective transitions for these domains corresponding to the transition observed for SagHL (Fig. 3B).Role of Calcium Ions in Modulating Enzymatic Activity of HLs—To perform enzymatic activity measurements, water (LiChrosolvR) and buffer were passed through the Chelex100 column to remove any metal ion contamination. Proteins and substrates were further purified by SEC, pre-equilibrated and run with the buffer that was already passed through a Chelax100 column. Furthermore the solutions were also checked by atomic absorption spectroscopy to confirm the absence of metal ion contamination (data not shown).As reported earlier, the enzymatic activity of HLs is dependent on CaCl2 (14Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Pritchard D.G. Trent J.O. Li X. Zhang P. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SpnHL in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 gives almost equal enzymatic activity with polymeric HA (about 5.8 × 106 Da) and with its small hexasaccharide unit (HA6) (about 1200 Da) at equal substrate concentrations (24Kelly S.J. Taylor K.B. Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 293-304Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Comparative enzymatic activity measurements of SagHL using these substrates were carried out in the presence or absence of CaCl2, NaCl, and EDTA, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4.FIGURE 4Relative enzymatic activity of SagHL. A, enzymatic activity with HA and HA6/HA8/HA10 in the presence or absence of CaCl2 and NaCl. The filled or hollow squares represent activity of SagHL with HA in the presence or absence of CaCl2, respectively. Regular or inverted triangles represent activity with HA6/HA8/HA10 in the presence or absence of CaCl2, respectively. The filled or hollow circles are activity in the presence of 0.1 mShow full captionNaCl with HA and HA6/HA8/HA10, respectively containing 10 mm CaCl2. B, enzymatic activity with HA and HA6/HA8/HA10 in the presence or absence of EDTA. The filled or hollow squares represent activity of SagHL with HA in the absence or presence of 5mm EDTA, respectively, containing 10 mm CaCl2. Regular or inverted triangles represent activity with HA6/HA8/HA10 in the presence or absence of 5mm EDTA, respectively. The filled circle represents activity of SagHL with HA in the absence of CaCl2 but in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. Activity was measured by monitoring the rate of increase in absorbance at 232 nm for 5 min at 37 °C. The data presented are of single measurements only as the mean value of even three data in the case of enzymatic activity with HA6/HA8/HA10 (in any condition) and with HA (in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2) if plotted almost overlaps. The inset shows the activity of SagHL with chondroitin sulfate in the presence (filled square) or absence (hollow square) of CaCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With polymeric HA as substrate, about 10-fold enhancement in enzymatic activity of SagHL was observed when 0-10 mm CaCl2 was added (Fig. 4A). However, when HA6/HA8/HA10 was used as a substrate, SagHL showed maximal activity even without adding any CaCl2, and the presence of even 10 mm CaCl2 made no difference in its activity. In the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, with polymeric HA about 30% reduction in the SagHL activity was observed; however, with HA6/HA8/HA10 again no effect of NaCl on enzymatic activity was seen. The effect of EDTA (5 mm) on the enzymatic activity (Fig. 4B) was only observed with the polymeric hyaluronan, and with the other substrates, the activity was completely independent of the EDTA. No effect of EDTA was observed on the background activity (where HA was used as a substrate and no Ca2+ was added in the reaction mixture) of SagHL. This also suggested that the solutions we used for our experiment were devoid of any metal ion contamination. Similar results were also obtained with SpnHL (data not shown).In Vitro Complex Formation of α- and C-terminal Domains of SagHL—The interface between the α-domain and C-terminal domain in closely related enzymes like SpnHL and Flavobacterium heparinum chondroitin AC lyase is spread over a large area (up to 15% of the total surface area) and have significant interactions (16Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Fethiere J. Egglmann B. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of SagHL, it is observed that the interface between these two domains is spread over a significant area (Fig. 5A) and is composed of residues from both domains making several interactions between them (18Li S.
