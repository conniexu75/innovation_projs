https://openalex.org/W2822200146,"This study aimed at isolating and identifying bacteria and fungi with the capacity to degrade low density polyethylene (LDPE). The level of biodegradation of LDPE sheets with bacterial and fungal inoculums from different sampling points of Dandora dumpsite was evaluated under laboratory conditions. Incubation of the LDPE sheets was done for sixteen weeks at 37°C and 28°C for bacteria and fungi respectively in a shaker incubator. Isolation of effective candidates for biodegradation was done based on the recorded biodegradation outcomes. The extent of biodegradation on the polyethylene sheets was assessed by various techniques including weight loss analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and GC-MS. Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed the appearance of new functional groups attributed to hydrocarbon degradation after incubation with the bacteria and fungi. Analysis of the 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA sequences for bacteria and fungi respectively showed that bacteria belonging to genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Cellulosimicrobium, Lysinibacillus and fungi of genus Aspergillus were implicated as polyethylene degraders. An overall analysis confirmed that fungi are generally better degraders of polyethylene than bacteria. The highest fungal degradation activity was a mean weight reduction of 36.4±5.53% attributed to Aspergillus oryzae strain A5, 1 (MG779508). The highest degradation activity for bacteria was a mean of 35.72± 4.01% and 20.28± 2.30% attributed to Bacillus cereus strain A5,a (MG645264) and Brevibacillus borstelensis strain B2,2 (MG645267) respectively. Genus Aspergillus, Bacillus and Brevibacillus were confirmed to be good candidates for Low Density Poly Ethene bio-degradation. This was further confirmed by the appearance of the aldehyde, ether and carboxyl functional groups after FTIR analysis of the polythene sheets and the appearance of a ketone which is also an intermediary product in the culture media. To improve this degrading capacity through assessment of optimum conditions for microbial activity and enzyme production will enable these findings to be applied commercially and on a larger scale."
https://openalex.org/W2839867530,"Virtual reality has been increasingly used in research on balance rehabilitation because it provides robust and novel sensory experiences in controlled environments. We studied 19 healthy young subjects performing a balance beam walking task in two virtual reality conditions and with unaltered view (15 minutes each) to determine if virtual reality high heights exposure induced stress. We recorded number of steps off the beam, heart rate, electrodermal activity, response time to an auditory cue, and high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesized that virtual high heights exposure would increase measures of physiological stress compared to unaltered viewing at low heights. We found that the virtual high height condition increased heart rate variability and heart rate frequency power relative to virtual low heights. Virtual reality use resulted in increased number of step-offs, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and response time compared to the unaltered viewing at low heights condition. Our results indicated that virtual reality decreased dynamic balance performance and increased physical and cognitive loading compared to unaltered viewing at low heights. In virtual reality, we found significant decreases in source-localized EEG peak amplitude relative to unaltered viewing in the anterior cingulate, which is considered important in sensing loss of balance. Our findings indicate that virtual reality provides realistic experiences that can induce physiological stress in humans during dynamic balance tasks, but virtual reality use impairs physical and cognitive performance during balance."
https://openalex.org/W2837300599,"Work related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are one of the most common occupational diseases which mainly affects the lower back, neck and upper and lower extremities. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of WMSDs in nine body regions among Ready Made Garment (RMG) workers in Bangladesh and ergonomics assessment of their exposure to risk factors for the development of WMSDs.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 232 RMG employees (male: 46; female: 186; age: >18yrs) from nine RMG factories in Dhaka division during October 2015 to February 2016. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire consist of demographic questions, Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire-Extended (NMQ-E) for WMSDs assessment in nine body regions and Quick Exposure Check (QEC) method for ergonomic assessment. Prevalence of WMSDs for each body region was determined. The association between WMSDs and ergonomic assessment of their exposure to risk factors were also analyzed.Respondents' mean age was 31.3 years (SD = 7). Their mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.51 kg/m2 (SD = 3.74). Among 186 female respondents, 46 reported lower back pain (24.7%) and 44 reported neck pain (23.7%). Among 46 male respondents, 10 reported neck pain (21.7%) while 6 reported knee pain (13%). Statistically significant relationship was found between twelve month WMSDs in anatomical region in elbows (p = 0.02), hips (p = 0.01), knees (p = 0.01) and ankle (p = 0.05) with age; upper back (p = 0.001), elbows (p = 0.001), wrists (p = 0.03), hips (p = 0.001) and ankles (p = 0.01) with job experience; hips with BMI (p = 0.03); elbows (p = 0.04) with daily working hour. QEC assessment showed that level of exposure to WMSDs risk was high among 80% of the study population (p<0.003).The study found that lower back and neck were the most affected areas among RMG workers. Moreover, QEC findings warned the level of exposure to WMSDs risks is high and ergonomics intervention along with investigation and change to decrease exposure level is essential. Addressing musculoskeletal risk factors through ergonomic interventions in terms of working space, workers sitting/standing posture, seat and hand position during work and work-rest cycle are encouraged in RMG sector and policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W2793601628,"As researchers use computational methods to study complex social behaviors at scale, the validity of this computational social science depends on the integrity of the data. On July 2, 2015, Jason Baumgartner published a dataset advertised to include ``every publicly available Reddit comment'' which was quickly shared on Bittorrent and the Internet Archive. This data quickly became the basis of many academic papers on topics including machine learning, social behavior, politics, breaking news, and hate speech. We have discovered substantial gaps and limitations in this dataset which may contribute to bias in the findings of that research. In this paper, we document the dataset, substantial missing observations in the dataset, and the risks to research validity from those gaps. In summary, we identify strong risks to research that considers user histories or network analysis, moderate risks to research that compares counts of participation, and lesser risk to machine learning research that avoids making representative claims about behavior and participation on Reddit."
https://openalex.org/W2818516987,"Cortisol obtained from hair samples represents a retrospective biomarker of chronic stress experienced by the subject in previous months. Although hair cortisol levels have been used to study the relationship between maternal and neonatal stress levels in primates, this has not yet been performed in humans using a longitudinal design and focusing specifically on this association. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether a relationship existed between maternal psychological stress and hair cortisol levels during pregnancy and postpartum, and neonatal hair cortisol levels. The sample consisted of 80 pregnant women and their 80 newborn infants. We conducted a longitudinal assessment of hair cortisol levels, psychological stress, anxiety, and depression in the three trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum. After childbirth, neonatal hair cortisol levels were also measured. We found that maternal hair cortisol levels in the first trimester negatively predicted neonatal hair cortisol levels. Perceived stress in the third trimester of pregnancy also predicted lower neonatal cortisol, whereas pregnancy-specific stress in the same trimester had a positive relation with neonatal cortisol. Cortisol is essential for embryonic and fetal development; consequently, if fetal synthesis of cortisol is affected by high maternal cortisol levels, such development could be impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2860375726,"Introduction Understanding how individual and environmental factors impact physical activity (PA) level is important when building strategies to improve PA of older adults. No studies have examined how hour-to-hour weather changes influence PA in older adults or how the association between weather and PA eventually is related to cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured as peak oxygen uptake. The aim of this study was therefore to examine how hour-to-hour changes in weather effects hour-to-hour PA in a cohort of Norwegian older adults across CRF levels, gender and seasons. Methods PA was assessed objectively in 1219 older adults (70–77 years, 51% females) using the Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer, and quantified as counts·min-1 (CPM). Weather (Norwegian meteorological Institute) and CRF (MetaMax II) were measured objectively. Panel data analysis added a longitudinal dimension when 110.888 hours of weather- and PA data were analyzed. Results Older adults had a higher PA level in warmer (597 CPM) than colder months (556 CPM) (p<0.01). Fixed effects regression-models revealed that increasing temperatures (per hour) influenced PA positively in both colder and warmer months (all, p<0.01), with greater influence in fitter vs. less fit participants (p<0.01). In warmer months, increasing precipitation negatively influenced PA in both unfit females and unfit males (p<0.01). In colder months, increasing precipitation positively influenced PA for moderately fit to fit males (p<0.01), but not for females and unfit males. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between weather conditions and objectively-measured-PA among Norwegian older adults. Our findings demonstrates that unfit older adults will be less likely to participate in PA when the weather is unpleasant, compared to those highly fit. The data suggests that the impact of weather should not be ignored when planning public health strategies for increasing PA among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2834101942,"Models of human migration provide powerful tools to forecast the flow of migrants, measure the impact of a policy, determine the cost of physical and political frictions and more. Here, we analyse the migration of individuals from and to cities in the US, finding that city to city migration follows scaling laws, so that the city size is a significant factor in determining whether, or not, an individual decides to migrate and the city size of both the origin and destination play key roles in the selection of the destination. We observe that individuals from small cities tend to migrate more frequently, tending to move to similar-sized cities, whereas individuals from large cities do not migrate so often, but when they do, they tend to move to other large cities. Building upon these findings we develop a scaling model which describes internal migration as a two-step decision process, demonstrating that it can partially explain migration fluxes based solely on city size. We then consider the impact of distance and construct a gravity-scaling model by combining the observed scaling patterns with the gravity law of migration. Results show that the scaling laws are a significant feature of human migration and that the inclusion of scaling can overcome the limits of the gravity and the radiation models of human migration."
https://openalex.org/W2845113378,"Dog ownership is popular worldwide, with most human-dog dyads forming successful attachment bonds. However, millions of dogs are surrendered to animal shelters annually, possibly due to mismatches between owner expectations and the realities of dog ownership. The aim of the current study was to explore the benefits and challenges people expect from dog ownership and how these expectations vary with previous ownership history. An Australian-wide sample of 3465 prospective adopters completed a self-administered online questionnaire about the physical, mental and psychosocial health benefits and challenges they associated with dog ownership. Among the potential benefits, respondents expected increased walking (89%), happiness (89%) and companionship (61%) and decreased stress (74%) and loneliness (61%). Among the challenges, they expected increased responsibility (64%) and dog training (62%). Ownership history influenced respondents’ expectations, with previous/current dog owners having consistently greater odds of expecting benefits and reduced odds of expecting challenges than non-owners. A possible explanation is that previous/current dog owners’ exhibit bias when considering dog ownership by selectively recalling positive experiences from previous ownership. Our findings support the need for education of prospective dog owners to ensure their expectations align with the reality of ownership, based on current scientific evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2815912635,"Growth of the open science movement has drawn significant attention to data sharing and availability across the scientific community. In this study, we tested the ability to recover data collected under a particular funder-imposed requirement of public availability. We assessed overall data recovery success, tested whether characteristics of the data or data creator were indicators of recovery success, and identified hurdles to data recovery. Overall the majority of data were not recovered (26% recovery of 315 data projects), a similar result to journal-driven efforts to recover data. Field of research was the most important indicator of recovery success, but neither home agency sector nor age of data were determinants of recovery. While we did not find a relationship between recovery of data and age of data, age did predict whether we could find contact information for the grantee. The main hurdles to data recovery included those associated with communication with the researcher; loss of contact with the data creator accounted for half (50%) of unrecoverable datasets, and unavailability of contact information accounted for 35% of unrecoverable datasets. Overall, our results suggest that funding agencies and journals face similar challenges to enforcement of data requirements. We advocate that funding agencies could improve the availability of the data they fund by dedicating more resources to enforcing compliance with data requirements, providing data-sharing tools and technical support to awardees, and administering stricter consequences for those who ignore data sharing preconditions."
https://openalex.org/W2843163149,"Scaffolds populated with human cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) represent a therapeutic opportunity for heart regeneration after myocardial infarction. In this work, square-grid scaffolds are prepared by melt-extrusion additive manufacturing from a polyurethane (PU), further subjected to plasma treatment for acrylic acid surface grafting/polymerization and finally grafted with laminin-1 (PU-LN1) or gelatin (PU-G) by carbodiimide chemistry. LN1 is a cardiac niche extracellular matrix component and plays a key role in heart formation during embryogenesis, while G is a low-cost cell-adhesion protein, here used as a control functionalizing molecule. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows nitrogen percentage increase after functionalization. O1s and C1s core-level spectra and static contact angle measurements show changes associated with successful functionalization. ELISA assay confirms LN1 surface grafting. PU-G and PU-LN1 scaffolds both improve CPC adhesion, but LN1 functionalization is superior in promoting proliferation, protection from apoptosis and expression of differentiation markers for cardiomyocytes, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. PU-LN1 and PU scaffolds are biodegraded into non-cytotoxic residues. Scaffolds subcutaneously implanted in mice evoke weak inflammation and integrate with the host tissue, evidencing a significant blood vessel density around the scaffolds. PU-LN1 scaffolds show their superiority in driving CPC behavior, evidencing their promising role in myocardial regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2815914914,"The inhibition of the hERG potassium channel is closely related to the prolonged QT interval, and thus assessing this risk could greatly facilitate the development of therapeutic compounds and the withdrawal of hazardous marketed drugs. The recent increase in SAR information about hERG inhibitors in public databases has led to many successful applications of machine learning techniques to predict hERG inhibition. However, most of these reports constructed their prediction models based on only one SAR database because the differences in the data format and ontology hindered the integration of the databases. In this study, we curated the hERG-related data in ChEMBL, PubChem, GOSTAR, and hERGCentral, and integrated them into the largest database about hERG inhibition by small molecules. Assessment of structural diversity using Murcko frameworks revealed that the integrated database contains more than twice as many chemical scaffolds for hERG inhibitors than any of the individual databases, and covers 18.2% of the Murcko framework-based chemical space occupied by the compounds in ChEMBL. The database provides the most comprehensive information about hERG inhibitors and will be useful to design safer compounds for drug discovery. The database is freely available at http://drugdesign.riken.jp/hERGdb/."
https://openalex.org/W2869241011,"This study examines the potential implications of biofouling management on the development of an infectious disease in Norwegian farmed salmon. The hydroid Ectopleura larynx frequently colonises cage nets at high densities (thousands of colonies per m2) and is released into the water during regular in-situ net cleaning. Contact with the hydroids’ nematocysts has the potential to cause irritation and pathological damage to salmon gills. Amoebic gill disease (AGD), caused by the amoeba Paramoeba perurans, is an increasingly international health challenge in Atlantic salmon farming. AGD often occurs concomitantly with other agents of gill disease. This study used laboratory challenge trials to: (1) characterise the gill pathology resulting from the exposure of salmon to hydroids, and (2) investigate if such exposure can predispose the fish to secondary infections–using P. perurans as an example. Salmon in tanks were exposed either to freshly ‘shredded’ hydroids resembling waste material from net cleaning, or to authentic concentrations of free-living P. perurans, or first to ‘shredded’ hydroids and then to P. perurans. Gill health (AGD gill scores, non-specific gill scores, lamellar thrombi, epithelial hyperplasia) was monitored over 5 weeks and compared to an untreated control group. Nematocysts of E. larynx contained in cleaning waste remained active following high-pressure cleaning, resulting in higher non-specific gill scores in salmon up to 1 day after exposure to hydroids. Higher average numbers of gill lamellar thrombi occurred in fish up to 7 days after exposure to hydroids. However, gill lesions caused by hydroids did not affect the infection rates of P. perurans or the disease progression of AGD. This study discusses the negative impacts hydroids and current net cleaning practices can have on gill health and welfare of farmed salmon, highlights existing knowledge gaps and reiterates the need for alternative approaches to net cleaning."
https://openalex.org/W2812596994,"Children from low SES backgrounds hear, on average, fewer words at home than those from high SES backgrounds. This word gap is associated with widening achievement differences in children’s language abilities and school readiness. However relatively little is known about adult and child speech in childcare settings, in which approximately 30% of American children are enrolled. We examined the influence of teacher and peer language input on children’s in-class language use and language development in an intervention classroom for low-SES, high-risk 2- to 3-year-olds. Over the course of a year, day-long recordings of the classroom were collected weekly with LENA recorders. Using LENA software algorithms, we found that language input from peers was positively related to children’s in-class language use, both in-the-moment and over the course of each day, as were the number of conversational turns in which children and teachers engaged Both peer input and conversational turns with teachers were also positively related to children’s language development rates, as indexed by increases in vocabulary size. Together these results indicate the importance of child-specific rates of classroom language input in the language development of high-risk, preschoolers."
https://openalex.org/W2845745072,"Iron–sulphur (Fe-S) clusters are ubiquitous co-factors which require multi-protein systems for their synthesis. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the Rv1460-Rv1461-Rv1462-Rv1463-csd-Rv1465-Rv1466 operon (suf operon) encodes the primary Fe-S cluster biogenesis system. The first gene in this operon, Rv1460, shares homology with the cyanobacterial SufR, which functions as a transcriptional repressor of the sufBCDS operon. Rv1460’s function in M. tuberculosis has however not been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that M. tuberculosis mutants lacking a functional Rv1460 protein are impaired for growth under standard culture conditions. Elevated expression of Rv1460 and Rv1461 was observed in the mutant, implicating Rv1460 in the regulation of the suf operon. Binding of an Fe-S cluster to purified recombinant Rv1460 was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Furthermore, three conserved cysteine residues, C203, C216 and C244, proposed to provide ligands for the coordination of an Fe-S cluster, were shown to be required for the function of Rv1460 in M. tuberculosis. Rv1460 therefore seems to be functionally analogous to cyanobacterial SufR."
https://openalex.org/W2843067699,"The objective of this study was to determine fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter spp from poultry and human isolates. Forty-one Campylobacter jejuni isolates (30 of poultry origin and 11 of human origin) and 11 Campylobacter coli isolates (10 of human origin and 1 of poultry origin) were examined for ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and nalidixic acid resistance using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Thereafter, the isolates were analyzed by PCR–Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) assay for detection of Thr-86 mutation. Finally, DNA sequencing was performed for confirmation of gyrA gene mutation. A complete correlation was observed between MICs, PCR-RFLP assay, and sequencing. The results revealed high quinolone resistance rates for C. jejuni (100%) and C. coli (100%) isolates obtained from poultry and moderate resistance for C. jejuni (9.1%) and C. coli (40%) samples of human origin. A mutation in codon 86 of the gyrA gene with a Thr-to-Ile substitution is reported to be the main cause of high resistance to quinolones. This mutation can be analyzed by PCR-RFLP assay, which has been proven to be a simple and fast method for the detection of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter spp."
https://openalex.org/W2850195675,"Hearing loss is the most common sensorineural disorder, affecting over 5% of the population worldwide. Its most frequent cause is the loss of hair cells (HCs), the mechanosensory receptors of the cochlea. HCs transduce incoming sounds into electrical signals that activate auditory neurons, which in turn send this information to the brain. Although some spontaneous HC regeneration has been observed in neonatal mammals, the very small pool of putative progenitor cells that have been identified in the adult mammalian cochlea is not able to replace the damaged HCs, making any hearing impairment permanent. To date, guided differentiation of human cells to HC-like cells has only been achieved using either embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, use of such cell types suffers from a number of important disadvantages, such as the risk of tumourigenicity if transplanted into the host´s tissue. We have obtained cells expressing hair cell markers from cultures of human fibroblasts by overexpression of GFI1, Pou4f3 and ATOH1 (GPA), three genes that are known to play a critical role in the development of HCs. Immunocytochemical, qPCR and RNAseq analyses demonstrate the expression of genes typically expressed by HCs in the transdifferentiated cells. Our protocol represents a much faster approach than the methods applied to ESCs and iPSCs and validates the combination of GPA as a set of genes whose activation leads to the direct conversion of human somatic cells towards the hair cell lineage. Our observations are expected to contribute to the development of future therapies aimed at the regeneration of the auditory organ and the restoration of hearing."
https://openalex.org/W2816560231,"Results from phase III clinical trial CheckMate 025 have established nivolumab as the standard of care for treatment of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (mRCC) after VEGF inhibitor failure; however, elderly patients are under-represented in the registration trial and little is known about the activity of nivolumab in this subgroup. The purpose of the Expanded Access Program was to provide nivolumab to patients with mRCC who had progressed despite treatment with other agents that were considered standard of care.Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks to a maximum of 24 months or until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The current analysis included all patients from the EAP Italian cohort who had received ≥1 dose of nivolumab. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.A total of 389 patients with advanced RCC were enrolled in the Italian cohort of the EAP and treated with nivolumab. Of these patients, 125 (32%) were at least 70 years of age and 70 (18%) were at least 75 years of age. Efficacy with nivolumab in the elderly patients was similar to that observed in the overall EAP population and in the CheckMate 025 trial. Safety was comparable between the elderly patients and the overall EAP population, and was consistent with what previously reported.The final results suggest that elderly patients with pretreated metastatic RCC may benefit from therapy with nivolumab."
https://openalex.org/W2839960381,"Background Tools from behavioral economics have been shown to improve health-related behaviors, but the relative efficacy and additive effects of different types of interventions are not well established. We tested the influence of small cash incentives, defaults, and both in combination on increasing patient HIV test acceptance. Methods and findings We conducted a randomized clinical trial among patients aged 13–64 receiving care in an urban emergency department. Patients were cross-randomized to $0, $1, $5, and $10 incentives, and to opt-in, active-choice, and opt-out test defaults. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who accepted an HIV test. 4,831 of 8,715 patients accepted an HIV test (55.4%). Those offered no monetary incentive accepted 51.6% of test offers. The $1 treatment did not increase test acceptance (increase 1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.0 to 3.9); the $5 and $10 treatments increased test acceptance rates by 10.5 and 15 percentage points, respectively (95% CI 7.5 to 13.4 and 11.8 to 18.1). Compared to opt-in testing, active-choice testing increased test acceptance by 11.5% (95% CI 9.0 to 14.0), and opt-out testing increased acceptance by 23.9 percentage points (95% CI 21.4 to 26.4). Conclusions Small incentives and defaults can both increase patient HIV test acceptance, though when used in combination their effects were less than additive. These tools from behavioral economics should be considered by clinicians and policymakers. How patient groups respond to monetary incentives and/or defaults deserves further investigation for this and other health behaviors."

Images of this type, now known as ""Mooney faces"", are widely used in cognitive psychology and neuroscience because they offer a means of inducing variable perception with constant visuo-spatial characteristics (they are often not perceived as faces if viewed upside down). Mooney's original set of 40 stimuli has been employed in several studies. However, it is often necessary to use a much larger stimulus set. We created a new set of over 500 Mooney faces and tested them on a cohort of human observers. We present the results of our tests here, and make the stimuli freely available via the internet. Our test results can be used to select subsets of the stimuli that are most suited for a given experimental purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2870671662,"Background The minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) is being investigated as an alternative to the complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA), gold standard for CoD determination, in settings where CDA is unfeasible and/or unacceptable. We aimed to explore healthcare providers’ views and perceptions on theoretical and factual acceptability of the CDA and the MIA. Methods A qualitative study, combining ethnographic and grounded-theory approaches, was conducted within a project aiming to validate the MIA tool against the CDA for CoD investigation. We present data on in-depth and semi-structured interviews of 33 healthcare providers operating within the formal and informal health services in Southern Mozambique. MIA perception was analysed through the theory of diffusion of innovations. Results All participants considered CDA useful for CoD determination. CDA was perceived reliable, but the unpleasant nature of the procedure and its associated infection risk were the main perceived disadvantages. Participants considered the MIA simple, easy and quick to perform; likely to meet families’ expectations to know the CoD, and able to provide evidence-based knowledge for disease management. Concerns were raised on its reliability compared to the CDA. Family's emotional status and accessibility to decision-makers were mentioned as principal barriers for MIA performance. The main jeopardizing factors for MIA implementation were the shortage of required resources and the significant proportion of people dying at home. Key facilitators for MIA acceptance included the need for the support from community and religious leaders, provision of clear information to the community, and accompaniment to bereaved families. Conclusions Healthcare providers consider the MIAs potentially more acceptable and feasible than CDAs in places where the latter have shown significant implementation challenges. A clear understanding of healthcare provider’s perceived barriers and facilitators for conducting post-mortem procedures in general, and MIAs in particular, will shed light on their future field implementation for more robust mortality surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2881200711,"Objective HIV testing rates in many sub-Saharan African countries have remained suboptimal, and there is an urgent need to explore strategic yet cost-effective approaches to increase the uptake of HIV testing, especially among high-risk populations. Methods A costing analysis was conducted for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with male truckers and female sex workers (FSWs) registered in the electronic health record system (EHRS) of the North Star Alliance, which offers healthcare services at major transit hubs in Southern and East Africa. The RCT selected a sample of truckers and FSWs who were irregular HIV testers, according to the EHRS, and evaluated the effect of SMSs promoting the availability of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits in Kenyan clinics (intervention program) versus a general SMS reminding clients to test for HIV (enhanced and standard program) on HIV testing rates. In this paper, we calculated costs from a provider perspective using a mixed-methods approach to identify, measure, and value the resources utilized within the intervention and standard programs. The results of the analysis reflect the cost per client tested. Results The cost of offering HIVST was calculated to be double that of routine facility-based testing (USD 10.13 versus USD 5.01 per client tested), primarily due to the high price of the self-test kit. In the two study arms that only offered provider-administered HIV testing in the clinic, only 1% of truckers and 6% of FSWs tested during the study period, while in the intervention arm, which also offered HST, approximately 4% of truckers and 11% of FSWs tested. These lower than expected outcomes resulted in relatively high cost per client estimates for all three study arms. Within the intervention arm, 65% of truckers and 72% of FSWs who tested chose the HIVST option. However, within the intervention arm, the cost per additional client tested was lower for FSWs than for truckers, at USD 0.15 per additional client tested versus USD 0.58 per additional client tested, driven primarily by the higher response rates. Conclusion Whilst the availability of HIVST increased HIV testing among both truckers and FSWs, the cost of providing HIVST is higher than that of a routine health facility-based test, driven primarily by the price of the HIV self-test kit. Future research needs to identify strategies which increase demand for HIVST, and determine whether these strategies and the subsequent increased demand for HIVST are cost-effective in relation to the conventional facility based testing currently available."
https://openalex.org/W2881422919,"Automatic assessment of hemoglobin (H), lipaemia (L) and icterus (I) in serum or plasma (HIL indices) is the mainstay for evaluating sample quality. We planned this study to verify whether in-house prepared internal quality control (IQC) materials may be suitable for quality assurance of HIL indices. Pools containing different values of each of the three HIL indices were prepared from routine plasma samples, divided in aliquots and frozen at -20°C. Stability of frozen materials was assessed by thawing one aliquot of each pool after different days of freezing (1, 4, 8, 15, 22 and 29), and by measuring HIL indices on baseline fresh samples and frozen-thawed aliquots with Roche Cobas c702. Five fresh liquid IQCs materials were also measured at the same time points. Intra-assay and inter-assay imprecision of HIL indices calculated with commercial IQC materials ranged between 1.1-2.0% and 1.6-3.3%, respectively. When target values of HIL indices were calculated using frozen-thawed aliquots, the inter-assay imprecision of in-house prepared materials was optimal, even better than that of commercial liquid IQCs (H-index, 0.8% versus 1.6%; L-index, 2.2% versus 2.5%; I-index, 0.8% versus 3.3%). In conclusion, in-house prepared IQC materials are cost-effective alternatives to commercial liquid IQCs for HIL quality assurance."

The control group (CTRL; n = 19) underwent a traditional HAES®-based intervention. Before and after the interventions, participants were assessed for physiological, psychological, and behavioral parameters (quantitative data) and took part in focus groups (qualitative data). Body weight, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences did not significantly differ within or between groups (P > 0.05). I-HAES® showed increased peak oxygen uptake and improved performance in the timed-stand test (P = 0.004 and P = 0.004, between-group comparisons). No significant within- or between-group differences were observed for objectively measured physical activity levels, even though the majority of the I-HAES® participants indicated that they were engaged in or had plans to include physical activity in their routines. I-HAES® resulted in improvements in eating attitudes and practices. The I-HAES® group showed significantly improved all Body Attitude Questionnaire subscale and all Figure Rating Scale scores (P ≤ 0.05 for all parameters, within-group comparisons), whereas the CTRL group showed slight or no changes. Both groups had significant improvements in health-related quality of life parameters, although the I-HAES® group had superior gains in the “physical health,” “psychological health,” and “overall perception of quality of life and health” (P = 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively, between-group comparisons) domains. Finally, most of the quantitative improvements were explained by qualitative data. Our results show that this new intensified HAES®-based intervention improved participants’ eating attitudes and practices, perception of body image, physical capacity, and health-related quality of life despite the lack of changes in body weight and physical activity levels, showing that our novel approach was superior to a traditional HAES®-based program."
https://openalex.org/W2851254118,"Introduction The recent emergence of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) as a frontline surgical tool in the management of brain tumors and epilepsy is a result of advances in MRI thermal imaging. A limitation to further improving LITT is the diversity of brain tissue thermoablative properties, which hinders our ability to predict LITT treatment-related effects. Utilizing the mesiotemporal lobe as a consistent anatomic model system, the goal of this study was to use intraoperative thermal damage estimate (TDE) maps to study short- and long-term effects of LITT and to identify preoperative variables that could be helpful in predicting tissue responses to thermal energy. Methods For 30 patients with mesiotemporal epilepsy treated with LITT at a single institution, intraoperative TDE maps and pre-, intra- and post-operative MRIs were co-registered in a common reference space using a deformable atlas. The spatial overlap of TDE maps with manually-traced immediate (post-ablation) and delayed (6-month) ablation zones was measured using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Then, motivated by simple heat-transfer models, ablation dynamics were quantified at amygdala and hippocampal head from TDE pixel time series fit by first order linear dynamics, permitting analysis of the thermal time constant (τ). The relationships of these measures to 16 independent variables derived from patient demographics, mesiotemporal anatomy, preoperative imaging characteristics and the surgical procedure were examined. Results TDE maps closely overlapped immediate ablation borders but were significantly larger than the ablation cavities seen on delayed imaging, particularly at the amygdala and hippocampal head. The TDEs more accurately predicted delayed LITT effects in patients with smaller perihippocampal CSF spaces. Analyses of ablation dynamics from intraoperative TDE videos showed variable patterns of lesion progression after laser activation. Ablations tended to be slower for targets with increased preoperative T2 MRI signal and in close proximity to large, surrounding CSF spaces. In addition, greater laser energy was required to ablate mesial versus lateral mesiotemporal structures, an effect associated with laser trajectory and target contrast-enhanced T1 MRI signal. Conclusions Patient-specific variations in mesiotemporal anatomy and pathology may influence the thermal coagulation of these tissues. We speculate that by incorporating demographic and imaging data into predictive models we may eventually enhance the accuracy and precision with which LITT is delivered, improving outcomes and accelerating adoption of this novel tool."
https://openalex.org/W2877444519,"ALDH1L1 is a folate-metabolizing enzyme abundant in liver and several other tissues. In human cancers and cell lines derived from malignant tumors, the ALDH1L1 gene is commonly silenced through the promoter methylation. It was suggested that ALDH1L1 limits proliferation capacity of the cell and thus functions as putative tumor suppressor. In contrast to cancer cells, mouse cell lines NIH3T3 and AML12 do express the ALDH1L1 protein. In the present study, we show that the levels of ALDH1L1 in these cell lines fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. During S-phase, ALDH1L1 is markedly down regulated at the protein level. As the cell cultures become confluent and cells experience increased contact inhibition, ALDH1L1 accumulates in the cells. In agreement with this finding, NIH3T3 cells arrested in G1/S-phase by a thymidine block completely lose the ALDH1L1 protein. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevents such loss in proliferating NIH3T3 cells, suggesting the proteasomal degradation of the ALDH1L1 protein. The co-localization of ALDH1L1 with proteasomes, demonstrated by confocal microscopy, supports this mechanism. We further show that ALDH1L1 interacts with the chaperone-dependent E3 ligase CHIP, which plays a key role in the ALDH1L1 ubiquitination and degradation. In NIH3T3 cells, silencing of CHIP by siRNA halts, while transient expression of CHIP promotes, the ALDH1L1 loss. The downregulation of ALDH1L1 is associated with the accumulation of the ALDH1L1 substrate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, which is required for de novo purine biosynthesis, a key pathway activated in S-phase. Overall, our data indicate that CHIP-mediated proteasomal degradation of ALDH1L1 facilitates cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2852569215,"Periodontal tissue damage, accompanied by the degradation and destruction of periodontal tissue collagen, is one of the most clinically common complications and difficulty self-repair in patients with diabetes. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC) are the undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that persist in the periodontal ligament after development of periodontal tissue and the ability of PDLSC osteogenic differentiation is responsible for repairing periodontal tissue defects. However, the reasons of high glucose environment in diabetic patients inhibiting PDLSC to repair periodontal tissues are unclear. To address these issues, we propose exposing PDLSC to high-sugar mimics the diabetic environment and investigating the activity of osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation of PDLSC. At the cellular level, high glucose can promote the adipogenic differentiation and inhibit osteogenic differentiation to decrease the self-repair ability of PDLSC in periodontal tissues. Mechanistically at the molecular level, these effects are elicited via regulating the mRNA and protein expression of C/EBPβ, PPAR-γ."
https://openalex.org/W2870558055,"When pointing to parts of our own body (e.g., the opposite index finger), the position of the target is derived from proprioceptive signals. Consistent with the principles of multisensory integration, it has been found that participants better matched the position of their index finger when they also had visual cues about its location. Unlike vision, touch may not provide an additional information about finger position in space, since fingertip tactile information theoretically remains the same irrespective of the postural configuration of the upper limb. However, since tactile and proprioceptive information are ultimately coded within the same population of posterior parietal neurons within high-level spatial representations, we nevertheless hypothesized that additional tactile information could benefit the processing of proprioceptive signals. To investigate the influence of tactile information on proprioceptive localization, we asked 19 participants to reach with the right hand towards the opposite unseen index finger (proprioceptive target). Vibrotactile stimuli were applied to the target index finger prior to movement execution. We found that participants made smaller errors and more consistent reaches following tactile stimulation. These results demonstrate that transient touch provided at the proprioceptive target improves subsequent reaching precision and accuracy. Such improvement was not observed when tactile stimulation was delivered to a distinct body part (the shoulder). This suggests a specific spatial integration of touch and proprioception at the level of high-level cortical body representations, resulting in touch improving position sense."
https://openalex.org/W2843752124,"Outbreaks of root rot disease in the productive South Indian sericulture belt have threatened the sustainability of the industry. Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. causing charcoal rot is the predominant pathogen to which all productive mulberry cultivars are susceptible. The present study was undertaken to identify molecular markers associated with charcoal rot resistance in mulberry. A mapping panel comprising 214 diverse entries from the Indian germplasm collection was assessed for charcoal rot resistance by artificial inoculation. Resistance to the pathogen was observed in 20 entries, and 51 were found to be moderately resistant. A total of 773 alleles generated across 105 SSR loci and 20,384 AFLP markers generated using 32 EcoRI-NN and MseI-CNN primer combinations were used in genetic analysis. The panel was weakly structured with two subpopulations. However, most entries were found to be admixtures. Survival of cuttings and number of roots per sapling were associated with root rot resistance. Association mapping was performed using different linear mixed models. Five AFLP markers explaining 9.6–12.7% of the total phenotypic variance were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with root rot resistance. Significant associations were also detected in four AFLP markers for survival of cuttings, and these markers explained 10.7–14.2% of the total phenotypic variance. These markers should be validated using mapping populations derived from contrasting biparental combinations by linkage analysis for use in marker-assisted gene pyramiding for durable resistance. The resistant genotypes identified in this study will substantially contribute to genetic improvement of mulberry for charcoal rot resistance and can be integrated into conventional breeding programmes."

Methods This was an 18-month cross-sectional study including patients with a combination of severe motor deficiency and profound intellectual impairment. The patients were from 4 SRC and 9 RF. The following data were collected: sociodemographics, health status, care management, and adequacy of care management. Results A total of 782 patients were included: 410 (52%) were cared for in SRC and 372 (48%) in RF. Global objective adequacy (health severity and age category) was higher for patients cared for in SRC compared with patients cared for in RF (57 vs. 44%, p< = 10−3). Global subjective adequacy (self-perception of the referring physician and request of change in structure) was higher for patients cared for in SRC in comparison with patients cared for in RF (98 vs. 92%, p< = 10−3). Conclusions This study provides key elements of adequacy of care management modalities for polyhandicapped patients in France. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02400528"
https://openalex.org/W2855137272,"Most studies on motivation and intention to quit smoking have been conducted among adolescents and young adults but little is known regarding middle-aged subjects. We aimed to assess the trends and determinants of smoking status in a population-based cohort.Observational, prospective study with a first mean follow-up at 5.6 years and a second at 10.9 years. Data from 3999 participants (49.2% women, aged 35-75 years) living in Lausanne (Switzerland).Baseline prevalence of never, former and current smokers was 41.3, 34.3 and 24.3%, respectively. During the study period, more than 90% of never and former and almost 60% of current smokers at baseline retained their status after 10.9 years. Among 973 current smokers, 216 (22.2%) had quit for at least 5 years. Multivariable analysis showed increasing age to be positively associated with quitting (p-value for trend <0.001). Among 1373 former smokers, 149 (10.9%) had relapsed; increasing age (p-value for trend <0.001) was negatively associated and family history of lung disease was positively associated with relapse [OR and 95% CI: 1.53 (1.06-2.21)]. Among 1653 never smokers, 128 (7.7%) initiated smoking; Male gender [1.46 (1.01-2.12)] and living in coupled relationship [0.66 (0.45-0.97)] were associated with smoking initiation.Most middle-aged never and former smokers did not change their status with time, while 22.2% of current smokers sustained quitting. This is encouraging and could be improved with adequate supportive methods. In comparison to available data, this study confirms the difficult task of identifying subjects at risk of a negative behavioral change."
https://openalex.org/W2872008145,"The present work was focused to design a cheap, rapid, portable and easy to use filter paper based assay for the qualitative and quantitate analysis of acetone. Sodium alginate gel was loaded with the acetone specific optical signal probe, and subsequently coated onto filter paper surface to design portable colorimetric assays for acetone monitoring. The color of the paper sensor strip was observed to change from dark yellow to light yellowish in the presence of varying concentrations of acetone. Three different color analyzing models including RGB, HSV, and LAB were employed to probe the output optical signal, and their performance was compared in terms of better interpretation of the generated signal. The LAB model was found to provide better analytical figures of merit with a linear response for the acetone concentration ranging from 2.5 to 1500 ppm, and a limit of detection of 0.5 ppm. Furthermore, the specificity of the designed filter paper based sensor was demonstrated against different common interfering compounds. The results demonstrated the potential of our proposed filter paper based sensor as a novel tool for the analysis of acetone."
https://openalex.org/W2850579138,"The goal of this research is to improve the accuracy of predicting the breast cancer (BC) process using the original mathematical model referred to as CoMPaS. The CoMPaS is the original mathematical model and the corresponding software built by modelling the natural history of the primary tumor (PT) and secondary distant metastases (MTS), it reflects the relations between the PT and MTS. The CoMPaS is based on an exponential growth model and consists of a system of determinate nonlinear and linear equations and corresponds to the TNM classification. It allows us to calculate the different growth periods of PT and MTS: 1) a non-visible period for PT, 2) a non-visible period for MTS, and 3) a visible period for MTS. The CoMPaS has been validated using 10-year and 15-year survival clinical data considering tumor stage and PT diameter. The following are calculated by CoMPaS: 1) the number of doublings for the non-visible and visible growth periods of MTS and 2) the tumor volume doubling time (days) for the non-visible and visible growth periods of MTS. The diameters of the PT and secondary distant MTS increased simultaneously. In other words, the non-visible growth period of the secondary distant MTS shrinks, leading to a decrease of the survival of patients with breast cancer. The CoMPaS correctly describes the growth of the PT for patients at the T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T1cN0M0, T2N0M0 and T3N0M0 stages, who does not have MTS in the lymph nodes (N0). Additionally, the CoMPaS helps to consider the appearance and evolution period of secondary distant MTS (M1). The CoMPaS correctly describes the growth period of PT corresponding to BC classification (parameter T), the growth period of secondary distant MTS and the 10-15-year survival of BC patients considering the BC stage (parameter M)."
https://openalex.org/W2848823876,"Most island-ecology studies focus on the properties of entire island communities, thus neglecting species-environment relationships operating at the habitat-level. Habitat-specific variation in the strength and sign of these relationships will conceal patterns observed on the island scale and may preclude a mechanistic interpretation of patterns and processes. Habitat-specific species-environment relationships may also depend on the descriptor of ecological communities. This paper presents a comprehensive plot-based analysis of local vegetation composition and species diversity (species richness and species evenness) of (i) rocky shore, (ii) semi-natural grassland and (iii) coniferous forest habitats in three Baltic archipelagos in Sweden. To identify differences and consistencies between habitats and descriptors, we assessed the relative contributions of the variable-sets ""region"", ""topography"", ""soil morphology"", ""soil fertility"", ""soil water"", ""light availability"", ""distance"" and ""island configuration"" on local vegetation composition, species richness and species evenness. We quantified the impact of ""management history"" on the descriptors of local grassland communities by a newly introduced grazing history index (GHI). Unlike species diversity, changes in vegetation composition were related to most of the variable-sets. The relative contributions of the variable-sets were mostly habitat-specific and strongly contingent on the descriptor involved. Within each habitat, richness and evenness were only partly affected by the same variable-sets, and if so, their relative contribution varied between diversity proxies. Across all habitats, soil variable-sets showed highly consistent effects on vegetation composition and species diversity and contributed most to the variance explained. GHI was a powerful predictor, explaining high proportions of variation in all three descriptors of grassland species communities. The proportion of unexplained variance was habitat-specific, possibly reflecting a community maturity gradient. Our results reveal that species richness alone is an incomplete representation of local species diversity. Finally, we stress the need of including habitat-based approaches when analyzing complex species-environment relationships on islands."
https://openalex.org/W2836310716,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells facilitates tumor progression by promoting invasion and metastasis. Snail is a transcriptional factor that induces EMT, while P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux transporter involved in anticancer drug resistance, and P-gp efflux activity is stimulated in Snail-overexpressing lung cancer cells with EMT characteristics. Since the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor entinostat (Ent) reverses EMT features, our aim in this study was to determine whether Ent also suppresses P-gp activation in Snail-induced cells. First, we confirmed that Ent treatment reduced migration activity, downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin at the mRNA level in Snail-overexpressing cells, thus inhibiting EMT. Efflux and uptake assays using rhodamine123 (Rho123), a fluorescent P-gp substrate, showed that Ent also inhibited Snail-induced activation of P-gp. Moreover, P-gp activity was more strongly inhibited by Ent in Snail-overexpressing cells than in Mock cells. When we evaluated the uptakes of Rho123 by LLC-PK1 cells and P-gp-overexpressing LLC-GA5COL150 cells, Rho123 accumulation in LLC-GA5COL150 cells was significantly decreased compared with that in LLC-PK1 cells. Coincubation with Ent had no effect on Rho123 accumulation in either of the cell lines. Thus, Ent appears to be an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-gp at low concentration. Our results suggest that Ent treatment might suppress not only Snail-induced cancer malignant alteration, but also P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2827615970,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus that belongs to the family Picornaviridae. FMDV infects cloven-hoofed animals, such as pigs, sheep, goats, cattle and diverse wildlife species, and remains a major threat to the livestock industry worldwide. In this study, a transcriptome analysis of whole blood from pigs infected with FMDV was performed using the paired-end Illumina sequencing technique to understand the interactions between the pathogen and its host cells. During infection with FMDV, a total of 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 110 up-regulated genes and 10 down-regulated genes. To further investigate the DEGs involved in interactions between the virus and its host, gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were conducted. GO annotation indicated that a number of DEGs were enriched in categories involved in host-virus interactions, such as response to stimulus, immune system process and regulation of biological process. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were primarily involved in the ribosome signaling pathway and immune-related signaling pathways. Ten DEGs, including the immune-related genes BTK1, C1QB, TIMD4 and CXCL10, were selected and validated using quantitative PCR, which showed that the expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the results of the in silico expression analysis. In conclusion, this study presents the first transcriptome analysis of pig whole blood cells infected with FMDV, and the results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the interactions between FMDV and host cells as well as the diagnosis and control of FMD."
https://openalex.org/W2882074370,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mediates stress responses in the brain-gut axis. Administration of CRH modulates brain activation, for example by controlling the autonomic nervous system in response to colorectal distention. Here, we investigated the relationship between sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to colorectal distention in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We enrolled 32 patients with IBS (16 women and 16 men) and 32 healthy subjects (16 women and 16 men), and randomly divided them between CRH and saline injection groups. The patients randomly underwent no (0 mmHg), mild (20 mmHg), or strong (40 mmHg) colorectal distension. CRH (2 μg/kg) or saline was then administered via injection, and the distention protocol was repeated. The heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV; calculated as the low [LF] to high frequency [HF] peak ratio, LF/HF) were analyzed using electrocardiography. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol levels were measured at the time of each distention. Plasma adrenaline levels were shown to be associated with plasma ACTH levels in HCs injected with CRH during distention using structural equation modeling analysis. Patients with IBS injected with placebo during distention displayed a closer association between these two parameters than those injected with CRH. Generalized estimating equation analysis revealed a significant distention × group × drug interaction for HF power. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between adrenaline and HRV upon CRH injection in controls, but not patients with IBS. The relationship between HPA-sympathoadrenal responses and CRH levels during colorectal distention differs between patients with IBS and controls. Modulation of adrenal gland activity in response to ACTH stimulation may contribute to the brain-gut pathophysiology characteristic of IBS."
https://openalex.org/W2949499449,"Given the large and expanding quantity of publicly available sequencing data, it should be possible to extract incidence information for monogenic diseases from allele frequencies, provided one knows which mutations are causal. We tested this idea on a rare, monogenic, lysosomal storage disorder, Sanfilippo Type B (Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB). Sanfilippo Type B is caused by mutations in the gene encoding α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). There were 189 NAGLU missense variants found in the ExAC dataset that comprises roughly 60,000 individual exomes. Only 24 of the 189 missense variants were known to be pathogenic; the remaining 165 variants were of unknown significance (VUS), and their potential contribution to disease is unknown. To address this problem, we measured enzymatic activities of 164 NAGLU missense VUS in the ExAC dataset and developed a statistical framework for estimating disease incidence with associated confidence intervals. We found that 25% of VUS decreased the activity of NAGLU to levels consistent with Sanfilippo Type B pathogenic alleles. We found that a substantial fraction of Sanfilippo Type B incidence (67%) could be accounted for by novel mutations not previously identified in patients, illustrating the utility of combining functional activity data for VUS with population-wide allele frequency data in estimating disease incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2882156499,"We aimed to verify whether Continuous Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (10 observers used a list of six qualitative descriptors) paired with Temporal Dominant Behavioural Expression (the same observers were asked to select the dominant descriptor and to score its intensity level) was able to monitor fluctuations of animal behaviour expression over time. We applied these techniques to three groups of juvenile goats either weaned (group C), or un-weaned (groups WOM and WM). Each animal was separated from its group, moved to group C and tested for 30 min either while their mothers were at pasture, or while their mothers were in an adjacent pen (group WOM and WM, respectively). Animals from group C were separated from their group and immediately reintroduced to it. TDBE duration and score of each descriptor of behavioural expression were able to detect differences among groups but were unable to describe how the behaviour of the goats changed as the time progressed. TDBE curves described the evolution of each behavioural expression of each animal over time but were unable to detect differences among groups. The χ2 test conducted on peaks of dominance, albeit displaying the variations of the behavioural expression over time and allowing the assessment of differences among groups, focussed on occurrences of higher agreement between observers while neglecting most of the information concerning the descriptors above the level of significance. Conversely, based on mixed analysis of variance with the fixed effects of group, test interval and group x test interval (animal nested into group and observer were considered to be random), most of the descriptors were able to discriminate the three experimental groups while preserving the information on the fluctuations of the behavioural expression of the animals during the test."

However, whether glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated with various equations can equally predict outcomes after ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is still debated.We compared the clinical impact of 3 different creatinine-based equations (Cockcroft and Gault (CG), CKD-epidemiology (CKD-EPI) and Full Age Spectrum (FAS)) to predict 1-year mortality in STEMI patients.Among 1755 consecutive STEMI patients who had undergone primary PCI included between 2006 and 2011, median estimated GFR was 79 (61;96) with the CG, 81 (65;95) with CKD-EPI and 75 (60;91) mL/min/1.73 m2 with FAS equation. Reduced GFR values were independently associated with 1-year mortality risk with the 3 equations. Receiver operating curves (ROC) of CG and FAS equations were significantly superior to the CKD-EPI equation, p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively. Better prediction with FAS and CG equations was confirmed by net reclassification index.Our results suggest that in STEMI patients who have undergone primary PCI, 1-year mortality is better predicted by CG or FAS equations compared to CKD-EPI."

However, the psychological impact of these surgeries has not been fully studied. On one hand, surgical weight loss has been reported to improve standard quality of life and resolution of symptoms of depression. But on the other hand, reports of self-harm and increased ER visits for self-harm suggest other psychological difficulties. Inability to handle anxiety following surgical weight loss has alarming potential ramifications for these gastric surgery patients. In the present study, we used models of diet-induced obesity and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to ask whether anxiety behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene changes were affected by surgical weight loss under two diet regimens: i.e. low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD). We show reduced exploratory behavior in the open field test but increased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, we show increased plasma levels of corticosterone in female VSG recipients in the estrus phase and increased levels of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (avp), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc), and tyrosine hydroxylase (th). We report reduced dopamine receptor D1 (drd1) gene in prefrontal cortex (PFC) in VSG animals in comparison to Sham. Further we report diet-driven changes in stress-relevant gene targets in the hypothalamus (oxt, pomc, crhr1) and adrenal (nr3c1, nr3c2, mc2r). Taken together, these data suggest a significant impact of both surgical weight loss and diet on the HPA axis and further impact on behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2863383097,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is an ophthalmic imaging technique which has recently been introduced to clinical use. OCT-A provides visualization of the retinal vascularization in three dimensions, without injection of contrast agents. OCT-A could thus replace the current standard of opthalmic imaging, which is 2D only and requires contrast agents. However, quantitative studies remain to be carried out to assess the full potential of OCT-A. In this context, the present work proposes a methodology to perform OCT-A in a more reproducible and precise way. We introduce a procedure to automatically extract the area of interest in avascular regions, which we demonstrate on various avascular areas with a focus on the optic nerve extracted in 2-dimensional images for a selected depth. We then study the repeatability of OCT-A with our segmentation technique when implemented on various clinical devices. For illustration, we apply this segmentation to healthy control group and to patients presenting different stages of glaucoma, a disease of clinical interest. The variability observed between these two cohorts compares favorably to the variability due to instrumental limitations or the segmentation algorithm. Our results thus constitute a significant step toward a more quantitative use of OCT-A in a clinical context."

https://openalex.org/W2864316788,"A multi-objective optimization model is proposed to allocate the location of VMSs by maximizing the average traffic guidance utility of VMSs and the number of benefited links, while minimizing information redundancy. The traffic guidance utility is defined to quantitatively measure the value of an installed VMS, which is calculated from passively collected GPS data and the physical topology of road network. The number of benefited links is to measure how many links are covered by upstream VMS to disseminate information. Information redundancy is introduced to quantify the mutual impairing between any two VMSs. A heuristic search algorithm is developed to solve the optimization model, which can calculate the saturated number of VMS for a road network and optimize the project schedule of VMS installation process based on the proposed objectives. A real-world case study is conducted in Beijing to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach, where taxis are used as probe vehicles to provide GPS data. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective optimization model and it is promising to use the emerging GPS data to help agencies to allocate the locations of VMSs on both urban roads and highway networks, instead of relying on the subjective judgment from practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W2864610178,"For railway operators, one of many important goals is to improve the utilization efficiency of electric multiple units (EMUs). When operators design EMU circulation plans, EMU type restrictions are critical factors when assigning EMUs to the correct depots for maintenance.

However, targeting that problem, in this paper, an optimization model for the EMU circulation planning problem that allows depots to be selected for EMU maintenance is proposed. This model aims at optimizing the number of used EMUs and the number of EMU maintenance tasks and simultaneously incorporates other important constraints, including type restrictions, on EMU maintenance and night accommodation capacity at depots. In order to solve the model, a branch-and-price algorithm is also developed. A case study of a real-world high-speed railway was conducted to compare and analyze the effects of different maintenance location constraints. The results show that the number of EMUs used will decrease under the maintenance sharing scheme, the number of EMU maintenance tasks can be reduced, and the time occupied in EMU maintenance will be released. In addition, the scheme of maintenance resources sharing and increases to mileage limits can effectively decrease the number of EMU maintenance tasks significantly. The model and algorithm can be used as an effective quantitative analysis tool for railway operators' decision-making processes in the EMU circulation planning problem."

However, health utilisation analysis of national survey data from many low and middle income countries is constrained by the lack of disaggregated health provider data. This study is concerned with the pattern of repeat outpatient consultations for a single episode of fever from public and private qualified providers and private unqualified providers. Cross-sectional survey data from 1173 adult respondents sampled from three districts within India’s most populous state—Uttar Pradesh is analysed. Data was collected during the monsoon season—September to October—in 2012. Regression analysis focuses on the pattern of repeats visits for a single episode of mild-sever fever as the dependent variable. Results show that Women and Muslims in rural north India are more likely to not access healthcare, and if they do, consult with low quality unqualified outpatient healthcare providers. For fever durations of four or more days, men are more likely to access unqualified providers compared to women. Results of the current study supports the literature that women’s utilisation of outpatient healthcare for communicable illnesses in LMICs is often less than men. A relative lack of access to household resources explains why fever duration parameter estimates for women and men differ."

It is distinguished from all other genera and species of Labeonini by the unique combination of modified oromandibular structures and head skeleton: a well-developed, pendulous, and conspicuously arched rostral fold, with an entirely crenulated margin; prominent papillae densely covering the margin of the rostral fold and anterior part of the lower lip; long postlabial grooves, partitioning the lower lip into three parts; transverse branch of dentary longer than half the length of the longitudinal branch; stubby lateral process present at the anterolateral margin of the longitudinal branch of the dentary, close to the corner; in the upper jaw, the premaxilla bears a triangular ascending process tapering to a point; maxilla exhibits a pair of articular heads at the anterodorsal margin, and a distinct fingerlike descending process posterior to the medial articular head embracing the ascending process of the premaxilla."
https://openalex.org/W2859836584,"Acoustocerebrography is a novel, non-invasive, transcranial ultrasonic diagnostic method based on the transmission of multispectral ultrasound signals propagating through the brain tissue. Dedicated signal processing enables the estimation of absorption coefficient, frequency-dependent attenuation, speed of sound and tissue elasticity. Hypertension and atrial fibrillation are well known factors correlated with white matter lesions, intracerebral hemorrhage and cryptogenic stroke numbers. The aim of this study was to compare the acoustocerebrography signal in the brains of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation patients with and without hypertension. The study included 97 asymptomatic patients (40 female and 57 male, age 66.26 ± 6.54 years) who were clinically monitored for atrial fibrillation. The patients were divided into two groups: group I (patients with hypertension) n = 75, and group II (patients without hypertension) n = 22. Phase and amplitude of all spectral components for the received signals from the brain path were extracted and compared to the phase and amplitude of the transmitted pulse. Next, the time of flight and the attenuation of each frequency component were calculated. Additionally, a fast Fourier transformation was performed and its features were extracted. After introducing a machine learning technique, the ROC plot of differentiations between group I and group II with an AUC of 0.958 (sensitivity 0.99 and specificity 0.968) was obtained. It can be assumed that the significant difference in the acoustocerebrography signals in patients with hypertension is due to changes in the brain tissue, and it allows for the differentiating of high-risk patients with asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2866245763,"Many sensorimotor activities have a time constraint for successful completion. In this case, any time devoted to sensory processing is at the expense of time available for motor execution. Earlier studies have explored how this competition between sensory processing and motor execution is resolved by using experimental designs that segregate the sensing and acting phase of the task. It was found that participants switch from the sensing to the acting stage such that the overall (sensorimotor) uncertainty in the outcome of the task is minimized. An unexplained observation in these studies is the substantial variability in switching times. We investigated the variability in switching time by correlating it with the underlying sensorimotor uncertainty. To this end, we used a modified version of the virtual ball catching paradigm proposed by Faisal & Wolpert (2009). Subjects were instructed to catch a ball, but as soon as they initiated their movement the ball disappeared. We extended the range of horizontal velocities and used two different start positions of the ball to quantify the dependence of sensory uncertainty on ball velocity. Velocity dependence of sensory uncertainty allowed us to manipulate sensory uncertainty and hence the sensorimotor uncertainty. We found that the variability in switching times is correlated with two factors. Firstly, variability in switching times is greater when variation in switching time has only minimal effects on sensorimotor uncertainty. Secondly, variability in switching times is greater when the sensorimotor uncertainty is larger. Our results suggest that the variability in switching time reflects an uncertainty-driven exploratory process."
