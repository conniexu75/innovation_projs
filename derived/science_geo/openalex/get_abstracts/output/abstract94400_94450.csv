https://openalex.org/W2083674587,"Compounds that antagonize neuronal excitation induced by dicarboxylic amino acids were tested in two animal models of epilepsy, namely sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and threshold pentylenetetrazol seizures in Swiss mice. Sound-induced seizures could be prevented by intracerebroventricular injection of compounds that block excitation due to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. The most potent such compound, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, was anticonvulsant in both test systems when given either intraperitoneally or intracerebroventricularly. Specific antagonists of excitation that is caused by amino acids provide a new class of anticonvulsant agents."

Total volume of the granular layer also grows linearly during that time. These results demonstrate a numerical increase in a neuronal population during adulthood in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1966474984,"Interictal spikes are a simple kind of epileptic neuronal activity. Field potentials and intracellular recordings observed during interictal spikes of penicillin-treated slices of the hippocampus were reproduced by a mathematical model of a network of 100 hippocampal neurons from the region including CA2 and CA3. The model shows that this form of neuronal synchronization arises because of mutual excitation between neurons, each of which is capable of intrinsic bursting in response to a brief input."
https://openalex.org/W2026436880,"Local administration of human growth hormone in vivo to the cartilage growth plate of the proximal tibia of hypophysectomized rats resulted in accelerated longitudinal bone growth. This finding suggests that growth hormone directly stimulates the cells in the growth plate, and does not support the theory that the increase in the plasma concentration of somatomedin that follows growth hormone administration is the cause of this stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2123007261,"Single auditory nerve fibers in the cat were labeled intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase. The sample of fibers was selected to represent different response types over a wide range of characteristic frequencies. All 56 labeled neurons were found to be radial fibers innervating inner hair cells, suggesting that none of the single-unit data reported to date has been from the outer hair cell innervation. Differences in rates of spontaneous discharge and thresholds to tones among these labeled neurons were closely correlated with morphological differences in the caliber and location of their unmyelinated terminals on the body of the inner hair cell."
https://openalex.org/W2079724265,Neuromagnetic measurements of responses to auditory stimuli consisting of pure tones amplitude-modulated at a low frequency have been used to deduce the location of cortical activity. The evoked field source systematically increased in depth beneath the scalp with increasing frequency of the tone. The tonotopic progression can be described as a logarithmic mapping.
https://openalex.org/W2007457898,"Specific consistent chromosome translocations are regularly observed in certain human leukemias and lymphomas. For the myeloid leukemias, the constant recombinants are: the long arm of 9 to chromosome 22 in chronic myeloid leukemia, the long arm of 21 to chromosome 8 in acute myeloblastic leukemia, and the long arm of 17 to chromosome 15 in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Three related translocations are seen in Burkitt lymphoma and B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia; in each one, chromosome 8 is involved with chromosome 2, 14, or 22. Analysis of a complex translocation affecting chromosomes 8 and 14 indicates that the translocation of chromosome 8 to chromosome 14 is the critical constant rearrangement. The analysis of the DNA at the translocation sites of these chromosomes, rather than the reciprocal of each translocation, appears to be the most productive focus for initial study. The various immunoglobulin loci are located on chromosomes 2, 14, and 22, the chromosomes regularly involved in translocations in Burkitt lymphoma and B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1994710209,"Plasma melatonin concentrations were determined over a period of 24 hours in 20 women with clinical stage I or II breast cancer. In ten of the patients, whose tumors were estrogen receptor positive, the nocturnal increase in plasma melatonin was much lower than that observed in eight control subjects. Women with the lowest peak concentration of melatonin had tumors with the highest concentrations of estrogen receptors. A significant correlation was found between the peak plasma melatonin concentration and the tumor estrogen receptor concentration in 19 of the patients. These data suggest that low nocturnal melatonin concentrations may indicate the presence of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and could conceivably have etiologic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1993130304,"Temperature determines the sex of hatchling green turtles (Chelonia mydas) produced from eggs incubated in a beach hatchery under different temperature regimens. Cola and cool nests (less than 28 degrees C) produced almost no females (0 to 10 percent) and warm, thermostable nests (greater than 29.5 degrees C) produced almost all females (95 to 100 percent). A few intersex hatchlings were produced at lower temperatures. Since little concern is given to temperatures at which sea turtle eggs are incubated in artificial hatcheries, present conservation practices may be producing all male, all female, or even intersex hatchlings."
https://openalex.org/W2013297186,"Potassium-sensitive microelectrodes were used to study activity-dependent changes of extracellular potassium ion concentration ([K+]o) in rat optic nerves of different postnatal ages (1 day to adulthood). The maximum level to which [K+]o rose with optimal frequencies of stimulation depended on age: mean maximum evoked [K+]o was 17.2 microM in 1- to 3-day-old optic nerves and 9.8 microM in adult nerves. The ceiling [K+]o seen in immature optic nerves, which is uniquely large for a mammalian central nervous system structure, may result from a relatively enhanced rate of evoked K+ release."
https://openalex.org/W1277151639,"A cell surface molecule involved in intercellular adhesion between rat hepatocytes in vitro has been identified. Papain-solubilized plasma membrane components were fractionated; the ability of the solubilized components to neutralize the inhibition of cell aggregation, caused by multispecific antibodies directed against the cell surface, was used to follow the purification. The purified components were used to immunize rabbits. The resulting antibodies effectively inhibited hepatocyte aggregation, and this inhibitory effect could be neutralized by detergent-solubilized plasma membrane components having an apparent molecular weight of 105,000 in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Also by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunosorbent techniques it was demonstrated that the antibodies specifically reacted with a plasma membrane component having an apparent molecular weight of 105,000. This component was susceptible to digestion with papain and showed specific binding to the carbohydrate-binding lectin Lens culinaris hemagglutinin. It was thus concluded that a glycoprotein with a mass of about 105,000 daltons is involved in rat hepatocyte intercellular adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2023346689,"Adenosine triphosphate levels in erythrocytes are correlated with LDH-B genotype in Fundulus heteroclitus. Adenosine triphosphate is the fish's allosteric modifier of hemoglobin oxygen affinity. Since oxygen delivery to muscle affects swimming performance, fish of each homozygous LDH-B phenotype were swum to exhaustion at 10 degrees or 25 degrees C to determine whether in vitro differences attributed to the LDH-B allelic isozymes were manifest in vivo. At 10 degrees C, the critical swimming speed of the LDH-BaBa phenotype was 3.6 body lengths per second, whereas that of the LDH-BbBb phenotype was 4.3 body lengths per second. At 25 degrees C there were no differences between LDH-B phenotypes in erythrocyte adenosine triphosphate levels, blood oxygen affinity, or swimming performance."
https://openalex.org/W2046911567,"Lipofuscin granules (age pigments) emit yellow light under ultraviolet excitation in the fluorescence microscope. The reported blue emission maximum of extracts of lipofuscin-laden cells may result from instrumental bias. The major fluorescent components that accumulate with age in these lysosomal residual bodies of human retinal pigment epithelium are yellow-emitting fluorophores. Different age-related fluorophores, which do emit blue light, are derived from other intracellular sources. A reevaluation of the connection between blue-emitting lipid peroxidation products and the age-related lipofuscin granules of classical pathology is necessary."

https://openalex.org/W2024798559,"Responses of auditory neurons in the inferior colliculi of mice were studied longitudinally before and shortly after each animal was exposed to intense noise. Noise exposure caused expected losses in auditory sensitivity, but in 31 percent of the neurons studied, unexpected alterations of temporal patterns of action potentials were observed: certain suprathreshold stimuli that had evoked only transient ""onset"" responses or inhibition of spontaneous discharges prior to noise exposure came to elicit sustained excitation after exposure. Thus, noise-induced hearing loss can be associated with increases in neural responsivity and alterations of normal neural coding processes."
https://openalex.org/W2092805385,"Cultured neurons become attached to hydrogel substrates prepared from 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate but grow few nerve fibers unless fibronectin, collagen, or nerve growth factor is incorporated into the hydrogel. Antibodies to fibronectin inhibit nerve fiber growth on hydrogels containing fibronectin, which suggests that growing neurons interact directly with proteins trapped in the hydrogel. The adhesive requirements for attachment of neurons appear distinct and possibly less specific than those for fiber growth. Defined hydrogel substrates offer a controlled method for analyzing complex substrates that support nerve fiber growth and neuronal differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1526112307,"The transport of three neutral amino acid analogs has been studied in an epithelial cell line from a pig kidney. 2-Aminoisobutyric acid is accumulated by LLC-PK1 cells against a concentration gradient through a mechanism with several features of a carrier-mediated process. The influx is accounted for by a saturable Na+-dependent and nonsaturable Na+-independent process. The total influx of 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid is also mediated through Na+-dependent and Na+-independent systems. Part of the Na+-dependent influx of 2-aminoisobutyric acid was competitively inhibited by 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (Ki = 4.2 mM).l Selectivity studies indicate that the 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid-sensitive part of 2-aminoisobutyric acid influx is mediated through the A system, whereas the insensitive part occurs through the ASC system. Cycloleucine transport also involves a Na+-dependent and Na+-independent process. The Na+-dependent influx is completely inhibited by 2-aminoisobutyric acid but not perceptibly by 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid. This influx probably represents entry through the ASC system. The Na+-independent component is completely inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a specific substrate for the L system. Uptake studies from either side of the monolayers indicate that these transport systems are exclusively located in basolateral membranes of the cultured renal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051969115,"Juvenile goldfish were allowed to grow for 3 months after dopaminergic or indoleamine-accumulating cells in their retinas had been destroyed by intravitreal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, respectively. New cells of each type were found growing in concentric rings at the margin of the retina. To compensate for the loss of dopaminergic innervation in retinas treated with 6-hydroxydopamine, cells in the growth zone appeared to proliferate at a higher rate than those in untreated retinas and long processes were extended into the retina by the first dopaminergic cells to appear."

The technique, which requires only 10(3) to 10(9) cells and approximately 2 minutes for acquisition of each spectrum, demonstrated the occurrence of many signal changes during differentiation. With cell extracts, 64 signals were assigned to 12 amino acids and 19 other intermediary metabolites, and a dramatic signal change was attributed to a fourfold increase in cytoplasmic phosphorylcholines."

There were no overt signs of toxicity. When tested between 3 and 4 years of age under conditions of both high and low luminance, treated monkeys exhibited spatial vision that was impaired compared with that of control monkeys."
https://openalex.org/W1504247812,"Proteoglycans extracted from rabbit corneal stroma can be separated by ion exchange and gel chromatography into two proteokeratan sulfates (PKS-I, PKS-II) and two proteodermatan sulfates (PDS-I, PDS-II). PKS-I (21% of the total glycosaminoglycans) contains 48% protein, and PKS-II (43% of the total) has 57% protein. In both, the only hexosamine is glucosamine, 7% of which is found in oligosaccharides. There is much more sialic acid in the oligosaccharides of PKS-II than of PKS-I, and the amino acid compositions of the two proteoglycans differ significantly. The keratan sulfates isolated from them by papain digestion are different in size, but both are digested by endo-beta-galactosidase. PDS-I (30% of the total glycosaminoglycans) has 32% protein, and 35% of its uronic acid is iduronic acid. PDS-II (6% of the total) has 42% of its uronic acid as iduronic. In general, the four rabbit proteoglycans resembled those of human and bovine corneal stroma in being smaller and more protein-rich than those of cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W1575755640,"Metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), recently implicated in arrhythmogenesis, was characterized in rabbit ventricular homogenates. Activities of four enzymatic pathways were distinguishable after subcellular fractionation and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography including microsomal lysophospholipase, microsomal acyl coenzyme A/LPC acyltransferase, cytosolic lysophospholipase, and cytosolic lysophospholipase-transacylase. Microsomal lysophospholipase activity was attenuated 81% by acidosis comparable to that in ischemic myocardium (pH 6.5) and was inhibited by substrate. LPC acyltransferase was identified in the microsomal fraction based on CoA-dependent phosphatidyl choline synthesis, the positional specificity of acylation of LPC, and identical reaction velocities with both of its labeled co-substrates. LPC acyltransferase had a Vmax of 5.1 nmol/mg/min, a broad pH optimum centered at pH 7, and an apparent Km for LPC and palmitoyl-CoA of 14 microM and 7 microM. Cytosolic lysophospholipase was separated from lysophospholipase-transacylase by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and distinguished from microsomal lysophospholipase by its broad pH activity curve, Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax = 9.5 nmol/mg/min, Km = 7.5 microM), and lack of substrate inhibition. Lysophospholipase-transacylase was identified in the cytosolic fraction by CoA-independent phosphatidyl choline synthesis and purified 4885-fold from homogenate by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite, gel filtration, and polylysine chromatography. The partially purified enzyme had a transacylase/lysophospholipase activity ratio of 0.6, and transacylation of LPC was prominent at submicellar concentrations of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1548081975,"The cholesterol to phospholipid mole ratio (C/PL) of human platelets was increased 1.3-fold or maintained at a normal value by incubating platelets with sonicated dispersions of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (C/PL = 3 or 1, respectively). Thrombin-induced mobilization of [3H]arachidonic acid from prelabeled phospholipids and subsequent formation of labeled cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase products were increased in cholesterol-enriched platelets as a function of thrombin concentration. Elevated platelet cholesterol content affected thrombin-induced changes in platelet phospholipids: (a) hydrolysis of PC was more sensitive to thrombin and was markedly enhanced over a wide range of thrombin concentrations (0.1-2 units/ml); (b) hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) was increased at thrombin concentrations greater than or equal to 0.2 unit/ml. Increased metabolism of [3H]arachidonic acid in stimulated cholesterol-enriched platelets was due to loss of [3H]arachidonate from PC at 0.1 unit/ml of thrombin. At higher thrombin concentrations (0.2-2 units/ml) it reflected enhanced hydrolysis of predominantly PC, but also PI. We conclude that cholesterol, possibly through its effect on platelet lipid organization, influences arachidonic acid metabolism in stimulated plates by promoting enhanced activity of platelet phospholipase(s) for liberation of arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1560968406,"We have obtained the iron K-edge extended X-ray adsorption fine structure spectra of the 3Fe ferredoxin II of Desulfovibrio gigas in the oxidized and reduced states. For both states, interpretation of the EXAFS data suggests that the Fe-S first shell coordination distance is near 2.25 A, in agreement with crystallographic studies of model compounds and proteins containing 2Fe-2S and 4Fe-4S centers, as well as with a recent crystallographic study of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (Ghosh, D., Furey, W., Jr., O'Donnell, S., and Stout, C. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 4185-4192). The apparent Fe-Fe distance we obtain for the desulfovibrio protein (2.7 A) also agrees with similar distances seen in other Fe-S centers, except with the 3Fe cluster in the Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I structure, for which an Fe-Fe distance of 4.2 A was reported. We conclude that either the two 3Fe ferredoxins have substantially different core dimensions, a possibility apparently unique to 3Fe centers among known Fe-S systems in proteins, or that one (or more) of the structural studies is in substantial error."
https://openalex.org/W1591763256,"Mouse pituitary thyrotropic tumor minces were labeled with [35S]methionine and fractionated into rough microsomes, intermediate, and low density smooth microsomes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone subunits were mainly in rough microsomes after a 10-min pulse, but with increasing chase times the proportion in smooth microsomes increased. In rough microsomes, small amounts of an alpha subunit precursor of Mr = 11,000 and larger amounts of an alpha form of Mr = 18,000 were rapidly processed to a form of Mr = 21,000, while small amounts of a beta-subunit precursor of M r = 11,000 were processed to a form of Mr = 18,000. Most of the Mr = 18,000 and Mr = 21,000 subunit forms were converted by endoglycosidase H to forms of Mr = 11,000 to 12,000. Small amounts of endoglycosidase H-resistant forms appeared in low density smooth microsomes after a 30-min chase. Subunit combination was not detected at 10 min; combination was first detected at 20 min and increased progressively to a maximum of 61% of beta in the low density smooth microsomes at 60 min of chase. Although alpha of Mr = 11,000 and 18,000, and beta of Mr - 11,000, were not detected in thyroid-stimulating hormone, both endoglycosidase H-sensitive and -resistant alpha subunit of Mr = 21,000 and beta subunit of Mr = 18,000 were found combined. Thus, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains only small amounts of nonglycosylated subunits (Mr = 11,000). The major subunit precursors contain one high mannose oligosaccharide (Mr = 18,000), with a second unit being added onto alpha in the rough ER. Combination of alpha (Mr = 21,000) with beta (Mr = 18,000) begins in the rough ER but occurs predominantly in the smooth ER/Golgi. Oligosaccharides of both combined and uncombined subunits are processed from high mannose to complex forms predominantly in the smooth ER/Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1545046698,"The transmembrane orientation of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol, which is the oligosaccharide donor in the glycosylation of asparagine residues of eukaryotic glycoproteins has been investigated. The lectin concanavalin A was used as a nonpenetrating probe to study the location of this oligosaccharide-lipid in microsomal vesicles prepared from cultured fibroblasts. Lectin treatment of intact vesicles, and vesicles made leaky with low concentrations of detergent showed that this oligosaccharide-lipid is on the luminal side of membrane. The oligosaccharide-lipid was bound by lectin only if the permeability barrier of the membrane had been destroyed by detergent; very little binding was seen in intact vesicles. This result suggests that glycosylation of nascent secretory and membrane glycoproteins occurs on the luminal side of the membrane. It also implies that sugar residues derived from cytoplasmic sugar nucleotides must be transported across the membrane at some point during the synthesis and accumulation of mature, luminal oligosaccharide-lipid, although the identity of the transported species remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2036069241,"This article describes recent events concerning the assessment and regulation of formaldehyde, and evaluates the scientific data pertaining to the carcinogenicity of this substance in the context of established cancer policies and guidelines. The conclusion is that recent decisions by several federal agencies to defer action to limit human exposure to formaldehyde may be a ""test case"" for a new, less protective policy concerning the regulation of carcinogenic substances in general."
https://openalex.org/W1554132671,"The lipid-bound saccharides formed by incubation of uridine diphosphate glucose with a particulate enzyme of Rhizobium meliloti were studied. They behaved like polyprenyl diphosphate saccharides when treated with ammonia or hot phenol, when catalytically hydrogenated, and on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The saccharide moieties obtained after heating at pH 2 for 10 min at 100 degrees C were separated with a gel filtration column. The following compounds were detected: galactose, glucosyl beta 1-3 galactose (Tolmasky, M. E., Staneloni, R. J., Ugalde, R. A., and Leloir, L. F. (1980) ARch. Biochem. Biophys. 203, 358-364), and some octasaccharides (I). These were compared by paper electrophoresis, thin layer and paper chromatography with an octasaccharide obtained from Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes strain 11 (II). Furthermore, Compounds I and II were compared with the exopolysaccharide of Rhizobium meliloti (III) by partial acid hydrolysis and methylation analysis. The results were consistent with the identity of the repeating unit of Compound III with Compounds I and II except for differences in the substituents (acetyl or succinyl). Studies on the labeling of the lipid-bound saccharides have shown that the sequence is: first, galactose and glucosyl beta 1-3 galactose, then the rest of glucose residues, and finally, the substituents (acetyl and pyruvic acid)."
https://openalex.org/W1585584819,"Riboflavin-binding protein (RBP) and phosvitin are phosphoglycoproteins transferred from the plasma of laying hens into the yolk of developing oocytes. We have examined the effect of phosphate removal on this yolk deposition process. Unmodified yolk RBP and phosvitin contain, respectively, 8.3 and 109 residues of phosphate/molecule. Complete dephosphorylation of yolk RBP caused a 20-min decrease in the plasma clearance half-life an 87% decrease in the uptake of the protein into oocytes in vivo. Although partially desialylated, dephospho-yolk RBP was identical with the native protein by several criteria, including riboflavin-binding capacity, mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and circular dichroism. A series of partially dephosphorylated yolk RBP samples, prepared by limited enzymatic hydrolysis, was indistinguishable from native yolk RBP by all criteria except phosphate content. Removal of the 1st phosphate residue decreased uptake of yolk RBP into oocytes by about 60%. Uptake into oocytes could not be restored to dephospho-yolk RBP by addition of anionic groups by succinylation. However, succinylation of native yolk RBP decreased its deposition into oocytes to the same extent as dephosphorylation. Partial dephosphorylation of phosvitin also had marked effects. The plasma clearance of dephosphophosvitin (70% of phosphate removed) was much faster than native phosvitin. After 4 h, 15% of injected 125I-phosvitin remained in circulation compared with only 3.8% of 125I-dephosphophosvitin. The uptake of dephosphovosvitin into oocytes was 79% less than that of native phosvitin. In vitro, 125I-phosvitin bound specifically to a preparation of oocyte plasma membranes as indicated by competition with unlabeled phosvitin but not with RBP. The specific binding of dephosphophosvitin was 96% less than that of native phosvitin and it could be displaced equally well by phosvitin or yolk RBP."

https://openalex.org/W1637365086,"Matrix acetylglutamate of uncoupled rat liver mitochondria increased about 10-fold, to 4.3 nmol/microliters, upon incubation with 5 mM concentrations of that compound. Uncoupled mitochondria incubated with the reagents needed for carbamyl phosphate and citrulline synthesis and 5 mM acetylglutamate synthesized citrulline at velocities which reached 99 nmol/min/mg of protein; simultaneously, as much as 47 nmol/min/mg of carbamyl phosphate accumulated and was distributed between matrix and medium. Maximal total carbamyl phosphate synthesis was, therefore, 146 nmol/min/mg, similar to the activity measured in liver homogenates. Without added acetylglutamate, some carbamyl phosphate accumulated when citrulline synthesis was about 40 nmol/min/mg. The finding that ornithine transcarbamylase can be limiting for citrulline synthesis shows that the activity of this enzyme is greatly restricted in mitochondria. The stimulation by ornithine of mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate synthesis was prevented when ornithine transcarbamylase was inhibited more than 96% by 5 mM delta-N-phosphonacetyl-L-ornithine, suggesting that the normal stimulatory effect of ornithine on carbamyl phosphate synthetase occurs via ornithine transcarbamylase. Lower concentrations of delta-N-phosphonacetyl-L-ornithine were required to achieve a given inhibition of citrulline synthesis from added carbamyl phosphate from endogenously synthesized carbamyl phosphate. The results reported suggest the existence of interactions between carbamyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase in the matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1970450861,"Human-Chinese hamster cell hybrids and a monoclonal antibody to human S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase were used to identify chromosome 20 as the location of the human gene for this enzyme. The gene for adenosine deaminase had previously been mapped to this chromosome. The activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is dependent in vivo on that of adenosine deaminase, since the substrates for the deaminase, adenosine and deoxyadenosine, respectively, inhibit and inactivate S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in genetic or drug-induced adenosine deaminase deficiency. This functional dependence and the likelihood that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, a eukaryotic enzyme, arose later than adenosine deaminase, which occurs in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes, suggest that the occurrence of their genes on the same chromosome may have evolutionary significance. In addition, the unusual capacity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase to form stable complexes with adenosine and its cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, suggest that evolution of its gene may have involved recombination of a portion of the adenosine deaminase gene with an adenine nucleotide domain-coding sequence of another preexisting gene."

The B10A (H-2a) strain of mice has significantly higher glucocorticoid receptor levels and a significantly greater biochemical response to glucocorticoid than the B10 (H-2b) strain, which differs from B10A within the H-2 complex only. Thus, the anti-inflammatory hormone response of glucocorticoids is correlated to hormone receptor level, both of which are influenced by the H-2 locus."

https://openalex.org/W1515251051,"Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase is inactivated by dicarbonyl reagents selectively modifying arginyl residues. Treatment with phenylglyoxal inactivates the enzyme with concomitant modification of 2.7 mol of arginyl residues/mol of subunit. If the reaction is performed in the presence of the transaminating substrate pair aspartate/oxalacetate, only 1.3 mol of arginyl residues/mol of subunit are labeled and the enzymic activity remains at 75% of the original value. One particular residue, identified by peptide analysis as Arg 292, is completely protected against modification in the presence of the substrate pair, indicating a role of its guanidinium group in substrate binding. On the basis of x-ray crystallographic studies of the complex of apoenzyme with N-(5'-phosphopyridoxyl)-aspartate (minus pyridoxal form of the enzyme), Arg 292 has been proposed as the binding site of the distal carboxylate group (Ford, G. C., Eichele, G., and Jansonius, J. N. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 2559-2563). The enzyme with blocked Arg 292 is not completely inactive, and its molecular activity toward dicarboxylic substrates is of the same order of magnitude as that of the native enzyme toward alanine, which is 10(5) times lower than that toward dicarboxylic substrates. The activity toward alanine is unchanged but the rate-enhancing effect of formate on the transamination of alanine is impaired. Formate is assumed to occupy the binding site of the distal carboxylate group (Morino, Y., Osman, A. M., and Okamoto, M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6684-6692). Apparently, the interaction of the distal carboxylate group of the substrate with Arg 292 underlies not only the binding specificity but also the kinetic specificity of aspartate aminotransferase for dicarboxylic substrates."

The 5'-terminal 7-methyl-G in mRNAs is essential for their efficient translation in vitro and may also protect mRNAs against exonucleases. We have explored whether enzymes which synthesize 5' caps of mRNAs are targets for antiviral agents. We have reported earlier that the 5'-triphosphate of a broad spectrum antiviral agent, Ribavirin, and the 5'-mono- and triphosphates of 2'-5'-linked oligo(adenylic acid) (2-5A) synthesized by interferon-treated cells on exposure to double-stranded RNA or EMC virus inhibit in vitro methylation of unmethylated vaccinia RNA by a crude mRNA methylating enzyme system from vaccinia virus. We report here that although 2-5A inhibits both purified vaccinia viral and cellular mRNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferases at micromolar concentrations, the 3'-O-methylated analogs of 2-5A, methylated in the 3'-terminal-OH or methylated at all three 3'-OH groups and with varying numbers of phosphate groups, specifically inhibited the viral enzyme at submicromolar concentrations. The inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to S-adenosylmethionine, but competitive with respect to mRNA substrate. These compounds are at least 10 times more active than 2-5A. A specific inhibitor of viral mRNA methylation heretofore has not been reported."

However, in adipocytes from homozygous Brattleboro rats oxytocin is incapable of stimulating lipogenesis or pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, although insulin stimulation of both processes is normal and the antilipolytic activity of oxytocin is normal. Thus, the Brattleboro rat provides a new genetic model for the study of oxytocin action, wherein recognition of the chemical mediator is partially defective."

https://openalex.org/W1998732624,Crystals of the histone tetramer (H3-H4)2 from calf thymus have been grown. The crystals yield x-ray diffraction patterns with Bragg spacings as small as 3.5 angstroms. Crystals grown from two types of preparations have the symmetry of the space group P61 (or P65). The best crystals were grown from histones that had the amino terminal arms removed by mild trypsinization.
https://openalex.org/W1481355806,"2'-Deoxy-2'-azidocytidine inhibits DNA synthesis of cells in tissue culture. In vitro, the diphosphate of azidocytidine was earlier shown to inhibit mammalian ribonucleotide reductase, while the triphosphate did not inhibit DNA replication in isolated cell nuclei. In intact cells, however, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools were not decreased by azidocytidine in a manner expected from an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. In order to differentiate between inhibition of precursor synthesis and DNA replication we studied in the present investigation the effects of azidocytidine on pool sizes of deoxynucleotides as well as on the incorporation of labeled cytidine or deoxycytidine into deoxycytidine triphosphate pools and DNA of cultured growing mouse fibroblasts. Azidocytidine was transformed to an active metabolite by phosphorylation with deoxycytidine kinase. Cell lines deficient in this enzyme showed an increased resistance against the analogue. Azidocytidine had a dual effect on the incorporation of labeled nucleosides. At low concentrations, the incorporation of cytidine into DNA was severely inhibited without a decrease of the specific activity of the dCTP pool or the size of the other three dNTP pools, suggesting a direct effect on DNA replication. At high concentrations of azidocytidine, incorporation into dCTP was also affected, demonstrating inhibition of CDP reduction. Our data also show that reduction of CDP is not necessarily tightly coupled to DNA replication since a rapid turnover of the dCTP pool occurred at the low concentrations of azidocytidine which severely inhibited DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1578746103,"Bovine mitochondrial coupling factor B (FB) stimulates oxidative phosphorylation as well as other energy-linked reactions which are supported by ATP hydrolysis. Extraction of FB from submitochondrial particles results in a decrease in ATP-dependent proton translocation (delta pH) and binding of the voltage-sensitive dye, oxonol VI. Reconstitution of deficient particles with FB restores ATP-dependent proton translocation and oxonol binding but has little effect on oxonol binding supported by respiratory substrates.l In contrast, low levels of oligomycin stimulate oxonol binding supported by either ATP or NADH. In the case of oligomycin, the stimulatory effect is associated with a decrease in the rate of discharge of the proton gradient, but the depletion of FB or its restoration has no detectable effect on the discharge rate. The data indicate that the primary effect of FB is upon the rate of H+ translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, while that of low oligomycin is on the H+ permeability of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1500753163,"Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the conformational change accompanying the binding to chymotrypsin of a substance carrying substrate specificity have been determined by a chemical relaxation method. An analysis of the concentration dependence of the two relaxation times and the associated amplitudes permitted the evaluation of rat constants, reaction enthalpies, and entropies of the individual steps. The pH and temperature dependencies of these parameters allowed, together with the known topography of the molecule, the identification of the ionizing groups involved in the regulation of the two steps. The combined evidence was used to compose a detailed mechanism for the function of the conformational change. The hypothesis is proposed that the side chain of ASp-194 is acting as the tongue of a switch which is moving between the positively charged His-57 side chain (catalytically inactive state) and the positively charged alpha-amino group of Ile-16 (active state), thus activating or deactivating the catalytic site. This control switch is very sensitive to changes in pH and temperature."
