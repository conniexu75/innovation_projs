https://openalex.org/W2040912209,"We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of approximately 100 M (where M is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 10(9) per cubic centimeter, a 1 M protostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2 formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does not lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation is stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass of the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is accreting material very rapidly (approximately 10(-2) M year-1). Radiative feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same pregalactic object (at least until the first star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). We conclude that at most one massive (M 1 M) metal-free star forms per pregalactic halo, consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal-poor galactic halo stars."
https://openalex.org/W2008082372,"Basic peptides such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat-(48–60) and DrosophilaAntennapedia-(43–58) have been reported to have a membrane permeability and a carrier function for intracellular protein delivery. We have shown that not only Tat-(48–60) but many arginine-rich peptides, including HIV-1 Rev-(34–50) and octaarginine (Arg8), efficiently translocated through the cell membranes and worked as protein carriers (Futaki, S., Suzuki, T., Ohashi, W., Yagami, T., Tanaka, S., Ueda, K., and Sugiura, Y. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5836–5840). Quantification and time course analyses of the cellular uptake of the above peptides by mouse macrophage RAW264.7, human cervical carcinoma HeLa, and simian kidney COS-7 cells revealed that Rev-(34–50) and Arg8 had a comparable translocation efficiency to Tat-(48–60). Internalization of Tat-(48–60) and Rev-(34–50) was saturable and inhibited by the excess addition of the other peptide. Typical endocytosis and metabolic inhibitors had little effect on the internalization. The uptake of these peptides was significantly inhibited in the presence of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C. Treatment of the cells with the anti-heparan sulfate antibody or heparinase III also lowered the translocation of these peptides. These results strongly suggest that the arginine-rich basic peptides share a certain part of the internalization pathway.

A 119-kDa protein, β-galactosidase, genetically fused with the former peptide segment, was successfully carried into various tissues in mice including the brain via intraperitoneal injection (6Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining of the tissues indicated that the fusion protein was delivered in its active form. Oligo-DNAs and metal chelates were also brought into cells using the Tat-derived peptide (4Polyakov V. Sharma V. Dahlheimer J.L. Pica C.M. Luker G.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Bioconj.

Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Such a method to deliver bioactive molecules into cells using membrane-permeable peptides has a great potential for therapeutic fields. We have recently demonstrated that not only Tat-(48–60) and Antp-(43–58) but also various arginine-rich RNA- or DNA-binding peptides such as HIV-1 Rev-(34–50) and flock house virus (FHV) coat-(35–49) were membrane-permeable and have the ability to bring exogenous protein into cells (14Futaki S.

Even octaarginine (Arg8) gave similar results based on the fluorescence microscopic observation of the fluorescein-labeled peptides (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 15Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). These peptides seem to have other similarities in translocation, namely facile internalization within 5 min, little uptake inhibition at 4 °C, and localization in the nucleus and cytosol. The above results suggested the possible existence of a ubiquitous mechanism for the internalization of the arginine-rich peptides. Since there were no sequence similarities among these peptides except that they had several arginine residues, arginine seemed to be the key amino acid for membrane permeability. Despite the great potential of the arginine-rich peptides as carriers of proteins, nucleic acids, and other bioactive compounds, little is known about the mechanism of their internalization. Involvement of the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) was suggested in the translocation of the full-length Tat protein (16Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M. Bu G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The addition of HS and the inhibitor of LRP to the culture medium produced a significant decrease in the cellular uptake of the protein. However, the uptake of the full-length Tat protein suffered a certain decrease at 4 °C (16Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M. Bu G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and some energy-dependent endocytosis pathway seemed to play a significant role in the internalization of the Tat protein. These results suggested that the mechanisms of internalization of the Tat-(48–60) peptide and the full-length Tat protein may not be completely parallel. Actually, the importance of the “core” domain (Tat-(37–48)) of the Tat protein has been claimed for the LRP-dependent internalization pathway (16Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M. Bu G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We have pointed out that many arginine-rich peptides showed very similar characteristics in translocation with HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). In addition to the translocation mechanisms of these arginine-rich peptides, it is unclear whether these peptides share the common pathway for internalization. In this study, we conducted the quantification of the cellular uptake of these arginine-rich peptides to compare their translocation efficiency using the RAW264.7, HeLa, and COS-7 cell lines. We also examined whether the internalization of a peptide could be competitively inhibited in the presence of other basic peptides. Finally, to interpret the internalization mechanism, we examined the effect of the cell surface sulfated polysaccharides as well as endocytosis and metabolic inhibitors. All the peptides used in this study were chemically synthesized by Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Rink amide resin, and fluorescein labeling was conducted using 5-maleimidofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) as previously reported (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar,18Futaki S. Ishikawa T. Niwa M. Kitagawa K. Yagami T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Rhodamine labeling of the peptides was conducted by the treatment of the peptides with 1.5 eq of tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Sigma) in dimethylformamide/methanol (1:2) for 3 h, followed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography purification. The fidelity of the products was ascertained by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. HeLa cells were purchased from the Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM, purchased from Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum (Invitrogen) without antibiotics. Cells were grown on 100-mm dishes in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (purchased from Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Trace Scientific, Melbourne, Australia) without antibiotics. The subculture was conducted every 3–4 days using the cells grown to subconfluence. RAW264.7 cells were cultivated as previously reported (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded on a eight-well Lab-Tek-II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in α-MEM containing 10% calf serum. To investigate the saturation of the internalization of the arginine-rich peptides, cells were subcultured on a chamber slide and incubated for 48 h, and then the medium was replaced by fresh medium. An excess amount (100 μm) of nonlabeled arginine-rich peptide was added to medium, followed by the addition of the fluorescein-labeled arginine-rich peptide (1 μm). After a 3-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed by acetone-methanol (1:1) for 1 min at room temperature, washed with PBS again, and then mounted with 0.01% (w/v)p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in glycerol. Treatment of the cells with sulfated polysaccharides (HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS) A, B, and C (Sigma)), heparinase III (Sigma), or anti-HS antibody (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was conducted under serum-free conditions. The HeLa cells treated with one of the above compounds for 30 min were incubated with a fluorescein-labeled arginine-rich peptide. After an additional 30-min incubation, washing and fixation were conducted as described above. The intracellular distribution of labeled peptides was observed using a fluorescence microscope IX-70 (Olympus) equipped with a ×40 lens. For the quantification experiment, HeLa, COS-7, and RAW264.7 cells were seeded on a 35-mm culture dish at a density of 1 × 105cells/dish. After a 48-h incubation, the medium was changed using fresh medium containing 1 μm of a rhodamine-labeled arginine-rich peptide. Cells were incubated with the peptide-containing medium for 3 h and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant was measured. Treatment of the HeLa cells with various inhibitors (brefeldin A, colchicine, nystatin, taxol, and wortmannin (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), chloroquine, cytochalasin D, nocodazole, rotenone, and sodium azide (Sigma)) was conducted in serum-free α-MEM at 37 °C, except for the nystatin treatment, which was in Krebs-Hepes buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 11.7 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) (19Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6439-6446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Prior to the addition of the peptides, the HeLa cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 30 min except in the case of brefeldin A (10 min) and sodium azide (60 min). The internalized peptides were quantified after a 1-h incubation of the cells with the peptides in the presence of the inhibitors. Treatment with soluble sulfated polysaccharide (25 μg/ml each) was conducted in serum-free α-MEM for 1 h at 37 °C. The protein content in the cell lysate was determined by the method of Lowry (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) with bovine γ-globulin as the standard. To assess the possible impairment of cell membranes caused by the treatment with arginine-rich peptides, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay (21Korzeniewski C. Callewaert D.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 64: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was conducted using an LDH release assay kit (Wako). HeLa cells were incubated with serum-free α-MEM containing a 100 μmconcentration of an arginine-rich peptide or 20 μmmastoparan. After 3 h, the medium was collected and mixed with substrate solution containing nitro blue tetrazolium, diaphorase, and NAD. The mixtures were left at room temperature for 5 min, and then the reaction was terminated with the stop solution (0.5 m HCl). The absorbance at 560 nm was then measured. The LDH release activity of the peptides was calculated as the percentage of the released LDH from the peptide-treated cells over that treated with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 under the same conditions. The release from the PBS-treated cells was taken as the control. In a previous report, we showed that not only Tat-(48–60), but also many arginine-rich RNA- and DNA-binding peptides, were membrane-permeable and had the ability to bring exogenous proteins into cells (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). These results were suggestive of the presence of an ubiquitous internalization mechanism commonly shared by these peptides. To more precisely understand the features of the internalization of these peptides, quantification of the internalized peptides was conducted. The peptides that showed efficient translocation by the fluorescence microscopic observation were chosen as models for the quantification, namely HIV-1 Rev-(34–50), FHV coat-(35–49), and the Arg8 peptides as well as the HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) peptide (Table I). The Arg16 peptide that showed the lower membrane permeability (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar) was also examined. The peptides were synthesized to have an extra cysteine or glycyl-cysteine amide at their C terminus for fluorescence labeling. In our previous report, we employed the fluorescein-labeled peptide for the fluorescence microscopic observations (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The rhodamine-labeled peptides were used in this study for quantification because the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein can easily be affected by the surrounding conditions (22Sjoback R. Nygren J. Kubista M. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After confirming that both the fluorescein-labeled and rhodamine-labeled arginine-rich peptides were internalized into cells basically in the same manner as each other (data not shown), the HeLa, RAW264.7, and COS-7 cells were incubated in the medium containing the rhodamine-labeled peptides for 3 h at 37 °C, washed by PBS, and solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cellular uptake of each peptide was determined by the fluorescence intensity of the lysate of the peptide-treated cells and corrected by the total protein amount. Although the PBS wash was employed here to remove nonspecifically bound peptides on the cell surface, washing the cells with a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES containing 2 m NaCl (pH 7.4)) produced little difference in the amount of peptides compared with the case of that washed by PBS only (data not shown).Table IPrimary structures of the membrane-permeable arginine-rich peptides used in this studyPeptidesSequencesHIV-1 Tat-(48–60)NH2-GRKKRRQRRRPPQ-C-conh2HIV-1 Rev-(34–50)NH2-TRQARRNRRRRWRERQR-GC-conh2FHV coat-(35–49)NH2-RRRRNRTRRNRRRVR-GC-conh2Arg8NH2-RRRRRRRR-GC-conh2Arg16NH2-RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR-GC-conh2The C-terminal cysteine was fluorescein- or rhodamine-labeled for monitoring or quantification of the peptide internalization, respectively. Open table in a new tab The C-terminal cysteine was fluorescein- or rhodamine-labeled for monitoring or quantification of the peptide internalization, respectively. The results of the quantification are shown in Fig.1. Although slight differences in the cell lines were observed, the Tat-(48–60) and Rev-(34–50) showed the highest levels of accumulation in 3 h. The accumulation of Arg8 was slightly less than those for the Tat-(48–60) and Rev-(34–50). On the other hand, although the translocation efficiency of FHV coat-(35–49) had been estimated to be comparable with the above peptides by fluorescence microscopic observations (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar), a significant difference was recognized in the quantification of the internalized FHV coat-(35–49) from those of Tat-(48–60) and Rev-(34–50). The Arg16 showed the least efficient translocation as judged from the fluorescence microscopic observations (14Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5836-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Tat-(48–60) has already been reported to enter the cells so rapidly as to reach the nucleus within 5 min (1Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). To obtain information about the kinetics on the internalization of the Rev-(34–50) and Arg8 peptides, the time course of the uptake of Rev-(34–50) and Arg8 as well as Tat-(48–60) by HeLa cells was studied (Fig. 2). The rate of cellular uptake of Tat-(48–60) turned out to be slightly faster than the other two peptides. The concentration of the Tat-(48–60) in the cells reached the maximum in 2 h and then showed a slight decrease. On the other hand, those of Rev-(34–50) and the Arg8 peptides kept increasing during the observed time period. After 2 h, the cellular concentration of the Rev-(34–50) reached a level almost comparable with that of the Tat-(48–60). The dependence of the peptide concentration on the uptake was also examined. HeLa cells were incubated for 1 h with different concentrations (0–10 μm) of Tat-(48–60), Rev-(34–50), and Arg8 (Fig. 3). The amount of the internalized peptide increased as the applied peptide concentration increased. However, the convex manner of the increase implied the presence of saturation in the cellular concentration of the peptides. Treatment using the higher concentrations (>20 μm) of the peptides induced cytotoxicity, and we were not able to quantitatively ascertain whether the peptides showed maximum concentration in the cells. The toxicity of the peptides was attributed to the rhodamine moiety, because nonlabeled peptides showed much less toxicity to the cells as described below. The internalized manner, observed in the time course and dose-dependent experiments for the Tat-(48–60), Rev-(34–50), and Arg8 peptides, was almost identical to each other. This above tendency was also basically similar with the results obtained by Polyakov et al. (4Polyakov V. Sharma V. Dahlheimer J.L. Pica C.M. Luker G.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Bioconj. Chem. 2000; 11: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), where the 99mTc-labeled Tat-(48–57) peptide was used for monitoring the internalization to human leukemia Jurkat cells, although some differences were observed in the kinetics of the uptake presumably due to the difference in the cell lines. As described above, the uptake of these arginine-rich peptides seemed to be saturable. To confirm this possibility, HeLa cells were incubated with a fluorescein-labeled peptide together with an excess amount (100 μm) of the nonlabeled peptide. After the addition of the nonlabeled peptide, the labeled peptide was added to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. During the peptide treatment, there was no detectable change in the cell morphology. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed. As a result, the internalization of the fluorescein-labeled Tat-(48–60) and Rev-(34–50) turned out to be inhibited in the presence of an excess amount of the corresponding nonlabeled peptides (Fig. 4). A similar result was obtained in the experiment using Arg8 (data not shown). Thus, it was confirmed that the internalization of these peptides was saturable. Next, we examined whether the internalization of a peptide could be inhibited in the presence of other arginine-rich peptides. Although there are no common structural or sequential characteristics except that they are all rich in arginine residues, they showed very similar internalization characteristics. This fact raised the possibility of peptides sharing a common pathway. Therefore, we examined whether these peptides shared a common pathway for their internalization. The above experiments were thus conducted using the fluorescein-labeled Tat-(48–60) or Rev-(34–50) peptides with the nonlabeled other peptides. The internalization of Tat-(48–60) was suppressed by the excess amount of Rev-(34–50) (100 μm) to almost the same extent as in the presence of an excess amount of Tat-(48–60) itself (Fig. 4). A similar result was obtained for Rev-(34–50) in the presence of the Tat-(48–60). An excess amount of the Arg8 peptide also inhibited the internalization of the Tat-(48–60) and Rev-(34–50) peptides (data not shown). Using RAW264.7 cells, the same results were obtained (data not shown). These results strongly suggested that there seemed to be a common pathway for the internalization or a maximum intracellular concentration for these arginine-rich peptides. It has already been reported that the internalization of Tat-(48–60) was not influenced by the treatment of the cells with various endocytosis inhibitors (4Polyakov V. Sharma V. Dahlheimer J.L. Pica C.M. Luker G.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Bioconj. Chem. 2000; 11: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To examine if this result was also applicable to the uptake of other arginine-rich peptides, the effects of the following reagents, known as typical endocytosis inhibitors, on the internalization of the Rev-(34–50) and Arg8 peptides as well as the Tat-(48–60) were examined: the microtubule-disrupting reagents colchicine (20 μm) (23Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), taxol (20 μm) (24Dionne M.A. Sanchez A. Compton D.A. J. Biol.

Prior to the addition of the peptides, the HeLa cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing each of the reagents at 37 °C for 30 min except in the case of the brefeldin A (10 min), and then a peptide was added to the medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the internalized peptide was quantified. The concentration and preincubation time for these inhibitors were established by referring to the literature (23Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol.

As a result, all of the reagents had little or no effects on the cellular uptake of the Rev-(34–50) and Arg8 peptides as in the case of the Tat-(48–60) peptide.

Therefore, we examined the effect of nystatin (50 μg/ml), a reagent that disrupts the internalization via caveolae, but it also had little effect on the uptake. These results suggested that the typical endocytosis mechanisms would not be the main pathway, but some energy-independent pathway would be involved in their internalization.Table IIEffect of various reagents on the cellular uptake of Tat-(48–60), Rev-(34–50) and Arg8ReagentsTatRevArg8%%%Endocytosis inhibitors Wortmannin (50 nm)92.993.995.2 Cytochalasin D (5 μm)95.593.990.7 Colchicine (20 μm)102.0102.2100.8 Nocodazole (20 μm)93.588.3108.7 Taxol (20 μm)106.1107.6104.2 Brefeldin A (10 μm)99.799.992.8 Chloroquine (50 μm)94.694.395.6Metabolic inhibitors Sodium azide (10 mm)102.892.099.5 Rotenone (1 μm)87.096.9101.9Caveolae formation inhibitor Nystatin (50 μg/ml)97.6109.092.5The cells were treated with these reagents at the given concentrations, and then a peptide (1 μm) was added to the medium.

We sequenced Gp-9 and found that it encodes a pheromone-binding protein, a crucial molecular component in chemical recognition of conspecifics. This suggests that differences in worker Gp-9 genotypes between social forms may cause differences in workers' abilities to recognize queens and regulate their numbers. Analyses of sequence evolution indicate that regulation of social organization by Gp-9 is conserved in South American fire ant species exhibiting social polymorphism and suggest that positive selection has driven the divergence between the alleles associated with alternate social organizations. This study demonstrates that single genes of major effect can underlie the expression of complex behaviors important in social evolution."

Among the GPCRs, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type B receptor (GABABR) is the only one known so far that needs two subunits, GB1 and GB2, to function. The GB1 subunit contains the GABA binding site but is unable to activate G-proteins alone. In contrast the GB2 subunit, which does not bind GABA, has an heptahelical domain able to activate G-proteins when assembled into homodimers (Galvez, T., Duthey, B., Kniazeff, J., Blahos, J., Rovelli, G., Bettler, B., Prézeau, L., and Pin, J.-P. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 2152–2159). In the present study, we have examined the role of each subunit within the GB1-GB2 heteromer, in G-protein coupling. To that end, point mutations in the highly conserved third intracellular loop known to prevent G-protein activation of the related Ca-sensing or metabotropic glutamate receptors were introduced into GB1 and GB2. One mutation, L686P introduced in GB2 prevents the formation of a functional receptor, even though the heteromer reaches the cell surface, and even though the mutated subunit still associates with GB1 and increases GABA affinity on GB1. This was observed either in HEK293 cells where the activation of the G-protein was assessed by measurement of inositol phosphate accumulation, or in cultured neurons where the inhibition of the Ca2+ channel current was measured. In contrast, the same mutation when introduced into GB1 does not modify the G-protein coupling properties of the heteromeric GABABreceptor either in HEK293 cells or in neurons. Accordingly, whereas in all GPCRs the same protein is responsible for both agonist binding and G-protein activation, these two functions are assumed by two distinct subunits in the GABAB heteromer: one subunit, GB1, binds the agonists whereas the other, GB2, activates the G-protein. This illustrates the importance of a single subunit for G-protein activation within a dimeric receptor.

G-protein-coupled receptor inositol phosphate human embryonic kidney γ-aminobutyric acid green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin horseradish peroxidase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine heptahelical domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are coded by the largest gene family of the animal genomes. These receptors detect and transduce across the plasma membrane, the information carried by a large variety of message molecules, from photons to glycoproteins and from amino acids to ions, with a very high specificity (1Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Accordingly, GPCRs are involved in a large variety of physiological and pathological processes, and as such constitute the targets of a large number of therapeutic drugs. All these receptors have an heptahelical domain (HD) formed by seven transmembrane helices interconnected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops. The intracellular face of the receptor contacts the heterotrimeric G-proteins and stimulates them upon agonist activation. Indeed, the second and third intracellular loops have been shown to play a critical role in G-protein activation by forming a pocket in which the C-terminal tail of the α-subunit of the G-protein binds (2Conklin B.R.

Such protein complexes, when constituted of different subunits, can have specific properties, not shared by the corresponding receptors alone.

We recently reported that the GB2-HD can couple to G-protein when associated in homodimers, but not the GB1-HD (31Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prézeau L. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Such data did not exclude a direct coupling of the GB1-HD when associated with GB2-HD within the heteromer. Here, the specific role of the GB1-HD and GB2-HD in G-protein activation by the heteromeric GABABreceptor was examined. Our data show that the GB2-HD plays a critical role within the heteromer for G-protein activation. cDNAs encoding wild-type GB1 and GB2 were described previously (31Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prézeau L. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of sequences encoding amino acids of the i3 loop of GB1 and GB2 was performed on a BamHI-SalI fragment from pRK-BR1a cloned into pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a Bsp120 I-XbaI fragment from pCi-Neo-BR2 cloned into pBluescript SK(−), using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For each mutagenesis, two complementary 30-mer oligonucleotides (sense and antisense; Genaxis Biotechnologie, Nimes, France) were designed to contain the desired mutation in their center. The authenticity of each point mutation and the absence of undesired ones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, a short fragment surrounding the mutation was subcloned in place of the corresponding wild-type fragment of pRK-BR1a or pRK-BR2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were cultured and transfected by electroporation as described previously (32Franek M. Pagano A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Pin J.-P. Blahos II, J. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After electroporation, the cells were plated on polyornithine-coated dishes. Serum, culture media, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France). Cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 1-week-old mice and transfected as previously described using Transfast (Promega, Lyon, France) (33Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.-M. Pin J.-P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (transfection was performed immediately before plating instead of 24 h after plating). A plasmid expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP, pGFP-N1 from CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to identify transfected neurons from electrophysiological studies. We previously reported that more than 95% of the GFP positive neurons also express the co-transfected plasmids (33Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.-M. Pin J.-P. Bockaert J.

The Western blotting protocol was already described (31Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prézeau L. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). 10 μg of membrane were loaded on a Tricine-SDS gel for electrophoresis and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation in phosphate-buffered saline/milk 5%, the membranes were incubated with the anti-GB1 antibody (Sigma) or the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1/3000, Roche Diagnostics) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-mouse HRP antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Signal was revealed using an ECL chemioluminescent assay (Amersham Biosciences). Ligand binding experiments were performed on intact HEK293 cells as previously described. Briefly, cells were plated after electroporation the day before the experiment. Thus, the cells on ice were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 118 mmNaCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2) and incubated in the presence of 0.1 nm125I-CGP64213 with or without unlabeled ligands at the indicated concentration. The incubation was terminated by washing with ice-cold buffer. The cells were disrupted with 0.1m NaOH (400 μl), and the bound radioactivity was counted and normalized to the amount of protein in each well. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm GABA. The concentration of 125I-CGP64213 used in displacement experiments (0.1 nm) was ∼10 times lower than the affinity of this radioligand on GB1. Ki values were calculated according to the equation IC50 =Ki (1+[L]/Kd),Kd being assumed to be equal toKi in the case of CGP64213. GABA was obtained from Sigma. 125I-CGP64213 was labeled to a specific radioactivity of >2,000 Ci mmol−1 (ANAWA AG, Wangen, Switzerland). l-Baclofen was synthesized in the research laboratories of Novartis Pharma in Basel (34Froestl W.

Like any other G-protein-coupled receptors, the GABAB-like receptors, such as the mGlu and CaS receptors contact the G-protein α-subunit via their second and third intracellular loops (i2 and i3 loops, respectively) (19Pin J.-P.

As shown in Fig.1, the i3 loop is very well conserved among the receptors of this family, and several residues in this loop have already been shown to play a critical role in G-protein coupling in both mGlu1 and CaS receptors. Among these, Arg-796 and Phe-802 of CaS (Arg-775 and Phe-781 of mGlu1) when mutated into Trp and Ala/Pro, respectively, generate receptors unable to activate G-protein upon agonist activation (21Francesconi A.

As shown in Fig. 1 the general characteristic of these residues (basic and hydrophobic respectively) is conserved in both GB1 and GB2 subunits suggesting that they play a similar role in the CaS and mGlu1 receptors. To identify the respective role of GB1 and GB2 in G-protein coupling of the GABABheteromer, these residues (Lys-791 and Ile-798 of GB1; Arg-679 and Leu-686 of GB2) were mutated into different residues. The following mutants were generated: GB1-K791W; GB1-K791D; GB1-I798S, GB1-I798P; GB2-R679W; GB2-R679D; GB2-L686S, and GB2-L686P. All these constructs were tagged at their N-terminal end with either a HA or c-Myc epitope, as previously described (29Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D.

Western blot analysis showed that all mutated receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). Binding experiments performed on intact cells with membrane impermeable high affinity GB1 radioligand 125I-CGP64213 indicated that any GB1 mutants were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane when co-expressed with the wild-type GB2 (Fig. 2B) but not when expressed alone (data not shown). Because GB1 only reaches the cell surface when associated with GB2 (28Calver A.R. Robbins M.J. Cosio C. Rice S.Q. Babbs A.J. Hirst W.D. Boyfield I. Wood M.D. Russell R.B. Price G.W. Couve A.

Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), these data indicate that the mutations in GB1 do not affect the correct folding of this subunit nor its association with GB2. Similarly, 125I-CGP64213 binding can be detected on intact cells expressing any of the mutated GB2 subunits co-expressed with the wild-type GB1 (Fig. 2B). This indicates that these mutated GB2 subunits are still able to bring GB1 to the cell surface, like the wild-type GB2. We then analyzed the effect of the mutations in the i3 of GB1 and GB2 on the G-protein coupling of the heteromeric receptor. To that aim, various combinations of wild-type and mutated GB1 and GB2 subunits were co-expressed with the chimeric Gα protein Gqi9 in HEK293 cells. This chimeric G-protein α-subunit corresponds to Gαq in which the last 9 C-terminal residues have been replaced by those of Gαi2. This allows this G-protein construct to couple many Gi/o-coupled receptors to PLC (2Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), including the heteromeric GABAB receptor (32Franek M. Pagano A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Pin J.-P. Blahos II, J.

As shown in Fig.3, GABA-induced IP formation was not affected when Lys-791 of GB1 or Arg-679 of GB2 were mutated into Trp or Asp. Only a 10-fold decrease in GABA potency (10-fold increase in the EC50 value, Table I) was noticed with GB2-R679W and GB2-R679D mutants expressed with GB1 (Fig.3B). However, the GABA response was dramatically reduced in cells expressing the GB2 mutants, GB2-L686P and GB2-L686S (by 94 and 83%, respectively), together with the wild-type GB1. Indeed, the maximal GABA response was largely decreased as well as the potency (increased EC50 values, see Table I) for the GB2-L686S + GB1 expressing cells, and no significant response could be measured in cells expressing GB2-L686P + GB1 (Fig. 3B and Table I). Of interest, the equivalent mutations in GB1 (GB1-I798S and GB1-I798P) did not affect much the GABA response (Fig. 3A). Only a small decrease in the maximal effect of GABA was noticed with the GB1-I798S mutant.Table IAffinity potency values of CGP 64213 and GABA on wild-type and mutated GB1 and GB2 subunitsKiKiEC50125I-CGP64213GABAGABA[nm][μm][μm]GB1-ASA22.6 ± 3.932.0 ± 6.4NRGB1 + GB222.4 ± 3.92.9 ± 0.91.3 ± 0.3GB1-K791W + GB222.9 ± 2.83.6 ± 0.71.4 ± 1.0GB1-K791D + GB217.2 ± 4.6*0.8 ± 0.1GB1-I798S + GB216.4 ± 2.2*0.4 ± 0.3GB1-I798P + GB221.3 ± 2.3*1.9 ± 1.1GB1 + GB2-R679W14.2 ± 1.2*4.0 ± 1.0GB1 + GB2-R679D25.0 ± 0.1*3.1 ± 0.1GB1 + GB2-L686S18.7 ± 1.22.8 ± 0.3105.3 ± 5.8GB1 + GB2-L686P19.2 ± 2.33.4 ± 0.9NRThe Ki of CGP64213 and GABA was determined according to displacement of 125I-CGP 64213 binding experiments performed on intact cells expressing the indicated subunits combinations (as described in “Material and Methods”).

As mentioned above the GB2-L686S and GB2-L686P mutants were able to bring the wild-type GB1 subunits to the cell surface, but it remains possible that the loss of GABA response in cells co-expressing these GB2 mutants and GB1 is because of an instability of the heteromers at the cell surface, or to the absence of allosteric interaction between the two subunits required for function. It has been reported that the association of GB2 with GB1 increases agonist affinity on GB1 by a factor 10 (10, 12, 31). As shown in Fig.4 and in Table I, both GB2 mutants were able to increase GABA affinity on GB1 like the wild-type GB2, indicating that they not only bring GB1 at the cell surface, but also still allosterically interact with GB1 at the cell surface.

To understand this phenomenon, we examined mouse models carrying conditional disruption of Brca1 in mammary epithelium in either p53 wild type (wt) or heterozygous backgrounds. Although a p53+/− mutation significantly accelerated tumorigenesis, both strains developed mammary tumors in a stochastic fashion, suggesting that multiple factors, in addition to p53 mutations, may be involved in Brca1 related tumorigenesis. A unique feature of Brca1 mammary tumors is their highly diverse histopathology accompanied by severe chromosome abnormalities. The tumors also display extensive genetic/molecular alterations, including overexpression of ErbB2, c-Myc, p27 and Cyclin D1 in the majority of tumors, while they were virtually ERα and p16 negative. Translocations involving p53 were also identified which lead to abnormal RNA and protein products. In addition, we generated cell lines from mammary tumors and found that the cells retained many of the genetic changes found in the primary tumors, suggesting that these genes may be players in Brca1-associated tumorigenesis. Despite their distinct morphology, all cultured tumor cells were Tamoxifen resistant but highly sensitive to Doxorubicin or γ-irradiation, suggesting that these methods would be effective in treatment of this disease."

For pandas to survive, conservation efforts must focus on larger landscapes rather than individual nature reserves. China recently initiated several policies, including the Natural Forest Conservation Program and Grain-to-Green Policy, which provide a historic opportunity to integrate panda conservation into national policies. Simultaneously, China is promoting the Western China Development Program, which calls for substantial infrastructure and hydropower development and economic investments. Integrating panda conservation into these development policies will be a critical challenge."

https://openalex.org/W2095092396,"We address here the effects of increasing fluencies of UV-radiation on stability, modifications, activity and HDM2-interactions of endogenous p53 tumor suppressor and on cellular damage response of human diploid fibroblasts. Low amounts of UVB/C-radiation induced a transient cell cycle arrest of the cells which correlated with rapid but transient increase in p53 levels. In contrast, high UV-fluency caused cell apoptosis and a slower but sustained increase in p53. Regulation of p53 target genes was highly dependent on the radiation dose used. Whereas low doses induced p21/Cip1/Waf1 and HDM2, high doses induced only GADD45 and BAX increasing the BAX:BCL-2 ratio. The levels of HDM2, a negative regulator of p53, increased only by the low dose of UVC and p53-HDM2 association was promoted. In the absence of HDM2-induction after the high dose of UV-radiation p53-HDM2-interaction was promoted, but HDM2 failed to downregulate p53. p53 site-specific modifications (Ser15, Ser33, Ser37, Lys382) varied kinetically and were dependent on the fluency of the radiation used. Maximal phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 and Ser33 correlated with increased levels of HDM2-free p53. The results suggest that regulation of p53 and HDM2 by UV-radiation is highly dose-dependent and contributes to the outcome of the cellular response."

Its ectopic expression induces filipodial-like membrane extensions in NIH 3T3 cells. We previously observed a defect in cytokinesis and an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSTPIP in PTP-PEST-deficient fibroblasts. In this article, we demonstrate that PTP-PEST and PSTPIP are found in the same complexes in vivo and that they interact directly through the CTH domain of PTP-PEST and the coiled-coil domain of PSTPIP. We tested pathways that could regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PSTPIP. We found that the activation of the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors can induce PSTPIP phosphorylation. With the use of the PP2 inhibitor, we demonstrate that Src kinases are not involved in the epidermal growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of PSTPIP. Together with previous results, this suggests that c-Abl is the critical tyrosine kinase downstream of growth factor receptors responsible for PSTPIP phosphorylation. We also demonstrate that PTP-PEST dephosphorylates PSTPIP at tyrosine 344. Importantly, we identified tyrosine 344 as the main phosphorylation site of PSTPIP by performing tryptic phosphopeptide maps. This is an important finding since tyrosine 367 of PSTPIP was also proposed as a candidate phosphorylation site involved in the negative regulation of the association between PSTPIP and WASP. In this respect, we observed that the PSTPIP·WASP complex is stable in vivo and is not affected by the phosphorylation of PSTPIP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PSTPIP serves as a scaffold protein between PTP-PEST and WASP and allows PTP-PEST to dephosphorylate WASP.

In PTP-PEST −/− cells, p130Cas is hyperphosphorylated and the cells exhibit impaired migration on a fibronectin matrix, presumably due to their inability to turn over focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (13Angers-Loustau A.

Additionally, in Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines overexpressing PTP-PEST, p130Cas was demonstrated to be constitutively hypophosphorylated. In these cells, motility defects were also observed and explained by the failure of these cells to form the p130Cas·CrkII complex, which is required for integrin-dependent migration (14Garton A.J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These PTPs are grouped together because, in addition to the homology in their PTP domains, they also contain a similar amino acid motif at their complete carboxyl-terminal termed the CTH domain. Previously, PTP-HSCF, a protein restricted to hemapoietic stem cells, was shown to interact with the proline, serine,threonine-rich phosphataseinteracting protein (PSTPIP) via its CTH domain (18Spencer S.

The discovery that WASP, the protein encoded by the gene mutated in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, is a ligand for the SH3 domain of PSTPIP creates an intriguing link between PSTPIP and actin reorganization (19Wu Y.

Reymond A. Cerutti L. Utzig S. Hofmann K. Simanis V. Cell. 1995; 82: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It was reported that PSTPIP associates with cortical actin during most of the cell cycle and translocates at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (18Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J.

Although the function of PSTPIP in the cleavage furrow can be thought to be similar to the function of CDC15p in yeast, the role of PSTPIP at the cortical actin during most of the cell cycle is completely unknown.

The amino terminus of these proteins can further be subdivided into a FCH (Fer kinase andCIP4 homology) and a CDC15-like coiled-coil domain (25Aspenstrom P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recently, the FCH domain of CIP4 was shown to interact with microtubules (27Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all these PSTPIP-like proteins, with the exception of PSTPIP2/MAYP, have a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain involved in the binding of WASP and/or N-WASP. Together, these proteins form a family of distantly related members that could share overlapping functions in actin-dependent biological events.WASP, N-WASP, and WAVEs (also know as SCARs) proteins interact with and activate the Arp2/3 actin nucleation activity (28Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 29Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are inactive at the resting state because of an intramolecular interaction involving the Arp2/3-binding site (known as the VCA or WCA domain) and GTPase-binding domain (30Abdul-Manan N.

Studies to date have demonstrated that the binding of GTP-loaded CDC42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to N-WASP and WASP is sufficient to release the inhibitory intramolecular interactions and activate these proteins (31Higgs H.N.

Furthermore, SH3 domain-containing proteins, such as Grb2, Nck, and WISH, can interact with a proline-rich region found on the WASP-like proteins and cooperate in their activation (34Fukuoka M.

The activation of the WASP proteins lead to actin nucleation via the recruitment and activation of the Arp2/3 complex, and to the formation of filipodia (N-WASP) and lamelipodia (WAVE) (33Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). These events are important in the generation of cell polarity, directed cell migration, vesicule transport and endocytosis (37Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Millard T.H. Machesky L.M. Trends Biochem.

Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar).In PTP-PEST −/− cells, we previously noted the hyperphosphorylation of PSTPIP and a defect in cytokinesis (13Angers-Loustau A. Côté J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This guided us to investigate if PSTPIP can interact directly with PTP-PEST. In this article, we report that PSTPIP and PTP-PEST associates in vivo. The coiled-coil domain of PSTPIP and the CTH domain of PTP-PEST mediate this interaction. We also demonstrate that PTPIP becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in mouse fibroblasts following EGF or PDGF treatment. This phosphorylation of PSTPIP is independent of Src kinases since the PP2 inhibitor did not affect it. We provide evidence that PTP-PEST negatively regulates the association of PSTPIP with SH2 domain-containing proteins by the dephosphorylation of PSTPIP on tyrosine 344. In contrast, the association of WASP with PSTPIP was demonstrated to be constitutive in vivo and independent of PSTPIP tyrosine phosphorylation. However, PSTPIP creates a physical link between PTP-PEST and WASP resulting in a specific PTP-PEST-mediated dephosphorylation of WASP.DISCUSSIONWe previously noted the hyperphosphorylation of PSTPIP in fibroblasts lacking PTP-PEST suggesting that it might be a substrate for this enzyme (13Angers-Loustau A. Côté J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this article, we provide evidence that PTP-PEST and PSTPIP physically interact and that this binding is critical for a specific dephosphorylation of PSTPIP on Tyr344. Furthermore, we show that PSTPIP is phosphorylated downstream of the activated PDGF and EGF receptors. This phosphorylation of PSTPIP is most likely mediated by c-Abl since we show that the Src kinases are not involved in this process. We performed phosphopetides maps to clearly demonstrate that PSTPIP is not phosphorylated on Tyr367. This is an important finding since it suggests that the association between PSTPIP and WASP would not be regulated by the phosphorylation of this residue in vivo. Interestingly, we show that PSTPIP can act as a linker between PTP-PEST and WASP leading to a specific dephosphorylation of WASP.The analysis of the expression of the mRNA of PSTPIP by Northern blotting suggests an enrichment in lymphoid organs (18Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, PTP-PEST is known to be ubiquitously expressed (4Davidson D. Cloutier J.F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Côté J.F. Turner C.E. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We studied the distribution of PSTPIP at the protein level and we found that it is widely expressed in several murine tissues (spleen, thymus, brain, lung, and muscle) and hematopoietic cells (pro-B cells, macrophages and less abundantly in T-cells). We also detected PSTPIP in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The expression of another PTP known to target PSTPIP, PTP-HSCF, is restricted to hematopoietic stem cells (18Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 50Cheng J. Daimaru L. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 1156-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These protein expression patterns clearly suggest that a more widely expressed PTP must replace PTP-HSCF in other cell types to regulate the phosphorylation of PSTPIP, we propose that PTP-PEST is this candidate. Our data suggests that PTP-PEST and PSTPIP patterns of expression overlap significantly and that the study of their interactions is of biological significance.Endogenous PSTPIP and PTP-PEST could be co-precipitated from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and 70Z/3 pro-B cells suggesting that these proteins are included in the same complexes in vivo. We further demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal homology (CTH) domain of PTP-PEST is required to mediate the association with PSTPIP both in a co-precipitation experiment and in an in vitro binding assay. We conclude that the CTH domain of PTP-PEST is necessary for the binding to PSTPIP. Interestingly, PSTPIP was originally cloned as a PTP-HSCF interacting protein and the CTH domain of PTP-HSCF was shown to be responsible for the interaction (18Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Since the CTH domain of PTP-PEST is 75% identical to the one of PTP-HSCF, our results are in agreement with an observation by Spencer et al. (18Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that a PTP-PEST peptide containing the CTH domain can disrupt the association between PSTPIP and PTP-HSCF. Conversely, our results demonstrate that the coiled-coil domain of PSTPIP is involved in mediating the interaction with PTP-PEST both in vivo and in vitro. A mutation of a tryptophan residue in the coiled-coil domain of PSTPIP (W232A) disrupts the association between PSTPIP and PTP-PEST. This same mutant of PSTPIP is also impaired in its ability to interact with PTP-HSCF, but it still localizes properly with the actin cytoskeleton suggesting no major disruption of the protein folding (43Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Quan C. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, the interactions between PTP-PEST and PSTPIP are conserved at the molecular level when compared with the association of PSTPIP with PTP-HSCF. It is expected that the other PEST-like PTPases PEP and BDP will also bind PSTPIP in an identical manner.To support our data on the physical association between PTP-PEST and PSTPIP, we found that both proteins co-localize in COS-1 cells by immunofluorescence analysis. This co-localization was significantly reduced when the CTH deletion mutant of PTP-PEST was studied. A surprising observation from those experiments is that the cellular localization of PSTPIP is dramatically affected whether it is bound or not to PTP-PEST. We found that PSTPIP is present at the cortical actin when co-expressed with PTP-PEST ΔCTH. However, most of the PSTPIP is found in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region when co-transfected with the WT PTP-PEST. This effect of PTP-PEST on the PSTPIP localization could be a mechanism that regulates the function of PSTPIP by promoting its turnover at the cortical actin. Interestingly, this result also suggests that in future studies the CTH domain of PTP-PEST could be used as a dominant-negative mutant that would prevent the adequate localization of PSTPIP.During this study, we observed that PSTPIP is not significantly tyrosine phosphorylated in proliferating NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We found that PDGF and EGF receptor activation can result in an increase in PSTPIP tyrosine phosphorylation. Both PDGF and EGF receptors stimulation lead to the activation of several downstream kinases. In both pathways, the Src family of kinases, c-Abl and FAK are known to play important roles (51Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 52Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 53Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). We found that c-Abl, c-Src, and Fyn are competent to phosphorylate PSTPIP in a transient transfection assay. However, the PP2 inhibitor did not block the EGF-induced phosphorylation of PSTPIP strongly suggesting that the Src kinases are not involved in the phosphorylation of PSTPIP downstream of the EGF receptor. During the completion of this work, Cong et al.(15Cong F. Spencer S. Côté J.F. Wu Y. Tremblay M.L. Lasky L.A. Goff S.P. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1413-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) found that PSTPIP becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in mouse fibroblasts following PDGF treatment. This phosphorylation was mainly under the control of c-Abl since PSTPIP failed to become tyrosine phosphorylated in Abl −/− fibroblasts (15Cong F. Spencer S. Côté J.F. Wu Y. Tremblay M.L. Lasky L.A. Goff S.P. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1413-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To support the hypothesis that c-Abl can directly phosphorylate PSTPIP, it was shown that the SH3 domain of PSTPIP directly interacts with two proline-rich sequences of c-Abl and that this interaction increases the specificity of the kinase reaction (15Cong F. Spencer S. Côté J.F. Wu Y. Tremblay M.L. Lasky L.A. Goff S.P. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1413-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). From these data, c-Abl is probably the critical tyrosine kinase downstream of the PDGF and EGF receptors involved in PSTPIP tyrosine phosphorylation.It has been reported that two major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation exist on PSTPIP: Tyr344 and Tyr367 (19Wu Y. Spencer S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5765-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was demonstrated that PSTPIP is phosphorylated on tyrosine 344 in cells treated with the PTP inhibitor pervanadate or cells transfected with v-Src since a point mutation of this amino acid to a phenylalanine completely prevented PSTPIP tyrosine phosphorylation (19Wu Y. Spencer S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5765-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of PSTPIP on tyrosine 367 was proposed based on the observation that when Y367F mutant was subjected to SDS-PAGE, a slower migrating band of PSTPIP was not detected in Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (19Wu Y. Spencer S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5765-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We did not detect any differences between the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of PSTPIP WT and Y367F when these proteins were co-expressed with tyrosine kinases. To clarify these findings, we performed an extensive analysis of PSTPIP tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that PSTPIP is not phosphorylated on tyrosine 367 (see Fig. 7). We conclude that the major site of phosphorylation in PSTPIP is Tyr344. However, we observed two phosphopeptides for PSTPIP in our maps. We do not rule out the possibility that other tyrosine residues could be phosphorylated in PSTPIP. However, these other phosphorylation sites would have to be dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Tyr344. This hypothesis is currently being tested. 2J.-F. Théberge, L. A. Lasky, and M. L. Tremblay, unpublished data.Tyrosine 344 of PSTPIP is found in a YASI motif. We tested several SH2 domains for their ability to bind phosphorylated PSTPIP and we found that the SH2 domains of c-Abl, and of the Src kinases c-Src and Fyn are capable of such a function in vitro. We also show that mutation of tyrosine 367 of PSTPIP does not affect the binding of the SH2 domain of the tyrosine kinases to PSTPIP, but that mutation of Tyr344 completely prevented the association with these SH2 domains. These results suggest that Tyr344 is the binding site for these SH2 domains. The analysis of the Tyr344motif, YASI, suggests that it does share some similarities with known c-Src and Fyn SH2 domain-binding motifs. For example, the SH2 domains of c-Src and Fyn can strongly interact with a YAEI motif found in FAK (54Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 55Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) suggesting that a YAxI motif could be sufficient for mediating the association of these SH2 with PSTPIP. The biological functions of the complexes formed between PSTPIP and SH2 domain-containing tyrosine kinases may be to transmit the signals from activated EGF and PDGF receptor. However, we failed to detect Src in PSTPIP immunoprecipitate. Thus, further studies are required to determine if PSTPIP can interact with SH2 domain-containing proteins in vivo.Having established that PSTPIP becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo following growth factor stimulation, we tested if PSTPIP can be a substrate for the catalytic activity of PTP-PEST. We found that Tyr344 of PSTPIP is a specific site targeted by PTP-PEST. Furthermore, we determined that the binding of PSTPIP to the PTP-PEST CTH domain is essential for an efficient dephosphorylation of PSTPIP. This result indicates that the catalytic domain of PTP-PEST possesses no intrinsic specificity toward phosphorylated PSTPIP, and that PTP-PEST requires another interaction for this enzyme-substrate recognition. This is in contrast to PTP-PEST recognition of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas in which the PTP domain of PTP-PEST demonstrates a marked specificity and is sufficient to recognize p130Cas (3Côté J.F.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The interaction between PSTPIP and WASP was proposed to be regulated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 367 located within the SH3 domain of PSTPIP (56Wu Y.

To delineate the signal transduction pathways distal to the receptor activation in microvascular permeability, we compared their effects on two downstream targets, i.e.endothelial nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and F-actin, in primary cultures of cardiac capillary endothelial cells. The two mediators induced a similar cytoskeletal reorganization and both the translocation and activation of eNOS, leading to NO release within the first minutes of cell exposure.

This transactivation was blocked by the selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity but not by inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor or protein kinase C activity.

The BK signal transduction in EC is mediated by the B2 receptor (B2R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, and involves activations of phospholipases A2 and C (1Busse R. Fleming I. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of phospholipase C generates inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, causing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. The consecutive productions of NO and prostacyclin (PGI2) mediate vasopermeability, angiogenesis, and anti-hyperplasia of neointimal periendothelial cells. In addition to this well recognized Gq/11-activating feature, B2R induces several signaling events commonly evoked by growth factor receptors, such as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) and expression of nuclear proto-oncogenes, c-fos and c-jun (5Adomeit A. Graness A. Gross S. Seedorf K. Wetzker R. Liebmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Though B2R lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it stimulates rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins including focal adhesion kinases, paxillin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cγ (6Zwick E.

For instance, KDR/Flk-1 induces a rapid/transient form of microvascular hyperpermeability as does BK, but it also promotes a chronic form of hyperpermeability, which has been reported to be a prerequisite for angiogenesis (11Wu H.M. Yuan Y. Zawieja D.C. Tinsley J. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H535-H542PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang W. Merrill M.J. Borchardt R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1973-C1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No specific intracellular mechanism has yet been found to mediate one or the other form of regulation. Interestingly, NO is also reported to modulate vascular tone, permeability, and capillary EC growth (21Morbidelli L. Chang C.H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, VEGF up-regulates eNOS enzyme and elicits both an acute and chronic stimulation of NO production (23Hood J.D. Meininger C.J. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1054-H1058PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol.

In addition, the eNOS activity is regulated by Ca2+-calmodulin binding and diverse protein kinases of the signaling cascades following KDR/Flk-1 and B2R activation (25Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T.

Here we compared the respective effects of BK and VEGF on two downstream targets regulating EC barrier, i.e. cytoskeleton and eNOS, in primary cultures of cardiac capillary EC that express B2R and only one type of VEGF receptor, KDR/Flk-1 (26Thuringer D. Rucker-Martin C. Frelin C. Cardiovasc Res. 2000; 47: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that some but not all actions of BK were mediated by transactivation of the KDR/Flk-1 receptor for VEGF. This work conforms to institutional guidelines (License 03387 from the Ministère Français de l'Agriculture). VEGF-165 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. BK was from Sigma. Specific inhibitors of EGF receptor (tyrphostin or AG1478) and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases (4-[(4′-chloro-2′-fluoro) phenylamino]-6,7-dimethoxy-quinazoline; TKi), and inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin) and PKC (Ro31–8220) activities, were obtained from Calbiochem. All inhibitors were used at concentrations known to block completely these activities in various cell types. Left ventricular capillary cells were isolated from adult rat hearts by retrograde perfusion of an enzymatic solution (collagenase type II; Worthington) as described previously (26Thuringer D. Rucker-Martin C. Frelin C. Cardiovasc Res. 2000; 47: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto laminin (5 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips in the standard culture medium M199 containing 10% fetal calf serum (Bio-Media), 200 units/ml streptomycin-penicillin, and 100 units/ml kanamycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were used 10 days post-isolation and were incubated for 1 day in 0% fetal calf serum culture medium before testing mediators and inhibitors. These standard culture conditions were also used for protein extraction and nitrite dosage. Culture supernatants were assayed for nitrite using the Griess reaction. Media were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and added to a 1:1 (v/v) Griess reagent (Sigma). A standard curve was constructed by use of known concentrations of sodium nitrite over the linear range (0.003 to 300 μmnitrite). Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 23 °C. Actin microfilaments were stained with 50 μg/ml tetramethyl-rhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin for 40 min. For other staining, cells were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 23 °C or overnight at 4 °C and then with the secondary antibody (F(ab′)2 fragment of IgG) conjugated with Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for another 1-h period. The primary antibodies were a polyclonal anti-eNOS antibody (1:100; Sigma), a monoclonal anti-KDR/Flk-1 antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology), and a polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories). Specificity of labeling was demonstrated by performing cell labeling with non-immune IgG instead of the primary antibodies. Observations were performed on a Leica laser confocal microscope. Series of eight optical sections were collected using a standard scanning mode format 1024 × 1024 pixels. After 1 day in 0% fetal calf serum culture medium, cell cultures were preconditioned with or without inhibitors for 30 min, stimulated with mediator for 5 min at 37 °C, and then scraped in a sonication buffer containing (in mm): 20 Tris, 20 EDTA, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 sodium fluoride, and 1 sodium orthovanadate, plus 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin (pH 8). Total homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 ×g and 4 °C. Protein content of the resulting supernatant (i.e. cellular fraction without nucleus) was determined using a Bio-Rad assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (200 μg/ml) were boiled for 5 min before use. For immunoprecipitation, samples were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology) conjugated to Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The samples were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred onto HybondTM ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 23 °C, membranes were reacted with the monoclonal anti-KDR/Flk-1 (2 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at 23 °C. After washing, the signal was detected using a chemiluminescence ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Optical densities of the dominant (230 kDa) band corresponding to the mature form of receptor KDR/Flk-1 were quantified using NIH Image 1.61. The optical density values of protein bands obtained from drug-treated samples were normalized to their respective control values. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. from n different experiments. Tests of significance were made using analysis of variance (ANOVA; Statview Software).p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Cultured capillary EC express the BK receptor B2R and only one type of VEGF receptor, KDR/Flk-1 (26Thuringer D. Rucker-Martin C. Frelin C. Cardiovasc Res. 2000; 47: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cell treatment with BK and VEGF resulted in a time-dependent reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Fig. 1A shows the F-actin pattern of EC treated for various times with BK (10 nm). Untreated cells exhibited a distinct band of actin at the cell periphery. By 3 min of BK treatment, the density of peripheral bands increased, and some intercellular openings appeared between adjacent cells as reported in EC in vivo. Indeed, agonist-elicited hyperpermeability results in a contraction process occurring at the margins of cells rather than in their general contraction (27van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Delft S. Vermeer M.A. Collard J.G. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By 10 min of BK treatment, a large increase in the amount of F-actin is evident at the cell periphery. By 30 min of BK treatment, actin fibers (stress fibers) were prominent throughout the cell and often appeared to abut with collinear filaments from adjacent cells. These effects were insensitive to cell pre-treatment with pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml) for 1 day (not shown). VEGF (50 ng/ml) rapidly induced cytoskeletal changes and formation of intercellular openings between adjacent cells, as did BK within the first 10 min of cell exposure (see Fig. 1A). However, the increase in peripheral actin band was maintained for at least 2 h with VEGF (Fig. 1B). Numerous reports demonstrate a role for NO not only in agonist-elicited microvascular hyperpermeability (3Huang Q. Yuan Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2442-H2451PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang W. Merrill M.J. Borchardt R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1973-C1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also in both migration and proliferation promoted by VEGF (16Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G.

Res. 1999; 41: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The potency of BK and VEGF to activate eNOS is compared in Fig.2A. Exposure of confluent cultures to BK (10 nm) or to VEGF (50 ng/ml) led to a rapid increase in eNOS activity as assessed by measuring nitrite contents of cell-conditioned media. Within the first 10 min of cell exposure, the BK-induced nitrite production was about 2-fold higher than that induced by VEGF (from 0.09 ± 0.04 μm in control to 1.53 ± 0.08 μm in BK and 0.76 ± 0.34 μm in VEGF; p < 0.01 controlversus agents; n = 10). Following 2 h of cell exposure, no significant difference in the nitrite content was observed between media from BK- and VEGF-treated cells (from 0.13 ± 0.04 μm in control to 1.93 ± 0.11 μm in BK and to 2.02 ± 0.24 μm in VEGF; p < 0.05 10 min versus 2 h for each condition; n = 10; not shown). Our data support the view that BK causes a rapid and transient activation of eNOS leading to a short-term NO production, whereas VEGF initiates a delayed and sustained NO production in association with its prolonged hyperpermeabilizing effect on EC monolayers. Short-term NO production involves activation of eNOS by PKC and Ca2+ mobilization (1Busse R. Fleming I. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu H.M. Yuan Y. Zawieja D.C.

Recent evidence indicates that B2R and KDR/Flk-1 may also activate eNOS via the PI3K/Akt pathway (10Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

Therefore, we used specific inhibitors of PKC and PI3K to define their respective contribution to the initial phase of nitrite release. As shown in Fig. 2A, wortmannin (10 nm), a specific inhibitor of PI3K, attenuated slightly but significantly the nitrite production after 10 min of cell stimulation by either BK or VEGF (p < 0.5; n = 10). Ro31–8220 (30 μm), an inhibitor of PKC, completely suppressed this production (p < 0.01; n = 10). Thus, undefined isoforms of PKC contribute to a major part to the initial eNOS activation induced by both BK and VEGF in our cell model. The contribution of PI3K is less. eNOS activity is known to be regulated by its interaction with the caveolar structural protein caveolin-1 (13Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). We therefore documented actions of BK and VEGF on the subcellular distribution of eNOS and caveolin-1 (Fig. 2B). Under basal conditions, a weak labeling for eNOS was observed at the cell periphery and in the nuclear region. The caveolin-1 labeling was found within plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. Exposure to BK or VEGF induced the translocation of both eNOS and caveolin-1 to the perinuclear region of EC within 10 min. Following 1 h of stimulation with BK, both eNOS and caveolin-1 rapidly cycled between plasma and Golgi membranes as reported previously by others (30Prabhakar P. Thatte H.S. Goetz R.M. Cho M.R. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27383-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, eNOS remained around cell nuclei after treatment with VEGF (not shown). Thus, BK and VEGF induce the translocation of both eNOS and caveolin-1 inside EC. Their actions, however, differ in that the effects of BK were transient whereas those of VEGF were sustained. Note that VEGF specifically maintained eNOS in the perinuclear region (13Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) in association with its prolonged contracting effect on EC (Fig.1B). Such a differential regulation may reflect the rapid/transient and chronic forms of VEGF-induced microvascular permeability to promote inflammatory and growth-promoting signals, respectively (11Wu H.M. Yuan Y. Zawieja D.C. Tinsley J. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H535-H542PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang W. Merrill M.J. Borchardt R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1973-C1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caveolae are enriched in various signaling molecules such as B2R, KDR/Flk-1, and PKC (9Ju H. Venema V.J. Liang H. Harris M.B. Zou R. Venema R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the subcellular distribution of KDR/Flk-1 (Fig.3A). Under basal conditions, most of KDR/Flk-1 labeling was located in the plasma membrane and nuclear region, forming a fluorescent pattern similar to that observed with eNOS in quiescent cells (see Fig. 2B and Fig.3A). Stimulation for 10 min with either VEGF or BK resulted in the total disappearance of KDR/Flk-1 labeling at the cell periphery. A weak KDR/Flk-1 labeling was found in the nuclear region. Western blotting of whole-cell extracts (without nucleus) from treated EC revealed a 30% decrease in the amount of KDR/Flk-1. The optical density values relative to controls were 0.66 with BK and 0.68 with VEGF (p < 0.05 control versus agents;n = 6). Thus, BK and VEGF induced internalization of KDR/Flk-1, in addition to eNOS and caveolin-1 (13Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 35Feron O. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). KDR/Flk-1 is activated through ligand-stimulated receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic kinase domain. Fig. 3B shows that VEGF and BK induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1. The immunoprecipitation with 4G10 followed by blotting with the anti-KDR/Flk-1 antibody revealed a dominant (230 kDa) band corresponding to the mature form of the phosphorylated receptor in BK- and VEGF-treated cells. The phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 was detectable after 1 min of stimulation (peaking at 5–10 min) and was increased by higher concentrations of BK (>100 nm). It must be noticed that no band (at 230 kDa) was observed in control conditions excluding a basal activation by endogenous VEGF (n = 8). Recently, it has been reported that VEGF expression is up-regulated by Ras and Src, through PKC and PI3K pathways (36Pal S. Datta K. Khosravi-Far R. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2395-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because BK activates these pathways, it may be suspected that the BK induces KDR/Flk-1 phosphorylation secondarily to secretion of VEGF. However, the transcriptional regulation of VEGF is reported to release VEGF only after 20 min of cell stimulation whereas the BK-induced transactivation of KDR/Flk-1 occurs within 1 min. In addition, we observed that the cell pretreatment for 15 min with 10 μm anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (Genentech) to prevent the possible release of VEGF (37McMahon G. Oncologist. 2000; 1: 3-10Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar) did not suppress the effect of BK (n = 2; not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that BK induces KDR/Flk-1 phosphorylation via an autocrine loop. Recently, ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of RTK, such as EGFR or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, has been suggested to mediate MAPK/ERK activation by GPCR (38Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 39Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 40Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism is still poorly understood, and it remains unclear whether PI3K and PKC stimulate the kinase activity of EGFR or suppress a tyrosine phosphatase activity. Therefore, we used specific inhibitors of PI3K, PKC and KDR/Flk-1 tyrosine kinase, to determine which of those intermediates might be involved in BK-induced phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1. The VEGF-induced KDR/Flk-1 phosphorylation was blocked by submicromolar concentrations of TKi, a selective inhibitor of VEGF RTK activity (41Hennequin L.F. Thomas A.P. Johnstone C. Stokes E.S. Plé P.A. Lohmann J.J. Ogilvie D.J. Dukes M. Wedge S.R. Curwen J.O. Kendrew J. Lambert-van der Brempt C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 5369-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The BK-induced KDR/Flk-1 phosphorylation was also blocked by TKi, but complete inhibition required 10-fold higher concentrations (10 μmm; see Fig. 3B). A similar phenomenon was described for the inhibitory effect of AG1478, a selective inhibitor of EGF RTK activity, on the EGFR phosphorylation by GPCR agonists (5Adomeit A. Graness A. Gross S. Seedorf K. Wetzker R. Liebmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This could be attributed to an autophosphorylation-independent mechanism induced by GPCR and distinct from RTK signaling itself. Cell pretreatment by wortmannin (10 nm) induced a slight but significant reduction of the BK-induced transactivation of KDR/Flk-1 suggesting contribution of PI3K (not shown). However, neither AG1478 (100 nm) nor Ro31–8220 (30 μm) had any effect on BK-induced transactivation. Thus, our data suggest that BK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 mainly through an intrinsic kinase activity of KDR/Flk-1. Contribution of KDR/Flk-1 transactivation to nitrite production and/or F-actin rearrangement induced by BK was examined (Fig. 4). Whereas AG1478 (100 nm) had no inhibitory effect on NO release, TKi (10 μm) reduced the effect of BK by about 30% (from 1.53 ± 0.08 to 1.00 ± 0.22; n = 8;p < 0.05). Because TKi totally inhibited effects of VEGF, the incomplete inhibition of BK-induced NO release indicates that eNOS activation is not exclusively mediated by activation of KDR/Flk-1. The alternative activation signal(s) may involve other transducers such as PI3K/Akt and PKC. Indeed, the BK-induced NO release was inhibited slightly by wortmannin (10 nm) and was totally prevented by Ro31–8220 (30 μm; see Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Ro31–8220 (30 μm) totally blocked the VEGF-induced NO release but did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 induced by VEGF itself. We concluded that PKC activity occurs downstream of the receptor activation. Our data are in agreement with the literature concerning the VEGF-stimulated eNOS expression that occurs via activation of KDR/Flk-1 and is inhibited by selective PKC inhibitors within the first 10 min of cell exposure (11Wu H.M. Yuan Y. Zawieja D.C. Tinsley J. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H535-H542PubMed Google Scholar, 25Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, exposing cells to BK or VEGF for 10 min leads to F-actin rearrangement and openings between adjacent cells. With 10 μm TKi pretreatment for 30 min, this actin rearrangement was totally prevented in VEGF-treated cells whereas it still occurred in response to BK (Fig. 4B). Thus, BK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 was not involved in the cytoskeletal remodeling and cell shape changes. Such a selective inhibition has been reported previously for AG1478, which inhibited the MAPK activation and protein synthesis related to GPCR-induced transactivation of EGFR but did not affect the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization or the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin by GPCR agonists (42Daub H.

Our data suggest that B2R and KDR/Flk-1 use separate pathways to regulate EC permeability (4Alexander J.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Delft S. Vermeer M.A. Collard J.G. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although VEGF activation of KDR/Flk-1 leads to rapid changes in cytoskeleton similar to those elicited by the BK activation of B2R. our study demonstrates that the bradykinin receptor B2R transactivates the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1 in cardiac capillary EC. Although our pharmacological results suggest the involvement of an intrinsic kinase activity and a small contribution of PI3K/Akt pathway, the detailed mechanism whereby BK-activated B2R causes tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 remains unknown. This KDR/Flk-1 transactivation results in rapid internalization of KDR/Flk-1 as does VEGF itself and a supplementary NO production mainly targeted into the nuclear compartment. Previously, the signals generated by RTK and GPCR were thought to be neatly compartmentalized, with very little cross-talk between these pathways. Here we show that a GPCR possess a high capacity for cross-talk with an RTK, other than EGFR or PDGFR, by using the second receptor itself as a signaling platform to amplify cell response. To our knowledge, this represents a novel mechanism whereby a GPCR activates an RTK to generate a biological activity different from the mitogenic action of GPCR."

Four human genes encoding polypeptides p125, p50, p66, and p12 have been assigned as subunits of DNA polymerase δ.

Among polymerases known today, polα, polδ, and polε are viewed as major replicative polymerases in chromosomal DNA synthesis (4Burgers P.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The replicative functions of polα and polδ have been defined primarily from studies of the SV40 DNA replication system (6Tsurimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B. Nature. 1990; 346: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). polα and its associated DNA primase synthesize RNA-DNA primers that initiate DNA synthesis on the leading strand and synthesis of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand (7Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5912-5918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Bullock P.A. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2350-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The subsequent processive elongation of the leading strand and completion of Okazaki fragments are catalyzed by polδ (9Melendy T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1942-1949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Eki T. Matsumoto T. Murakami Y. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

It has recently been suggested that polδ not only completes the gaps between pre-Okazaki fragments synthesized by pol α-primase but may also displace downstream RNA-DNA primers and refill the gaps so that no DNA products polymerized by polα are left on the newly replicated strand (12Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The role of polε in eukaryotic DNA replication is more obscure. It appears to play no role in SV40 DNA replication (13Lee S.H. Pan Z.Q. Kwong A.D. Burgers P.M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22707-22717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, polε, like polα and polδ, can be cross-linked to nascent cellular DNA (14Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and neutralizing antibodies against polε inhibited replicative DNA synthesis (15Pospiech H. Kursula I. Abdel-Aziz W. Malkas L.

On the other hand, although the budding yeast polε catalytic subunit Pol2 is encoded by an essential gene (16Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain within this polypeptide is dispensable for cell viability (17Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the catalytic domain of Pol2 are dominant-negative, suggesting that polε normally participates in DNA replication but another polymerase can substitute in its absence (18Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of polδ in lagging strand DNA synthesis, polδ, but not polε, is required for telomerase-mediated telomere addition in vivo (19Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Three temperature-sensitive mutants within the catalytic subunit of Schizosaccharomyces pombepolδ have been identified that exhibited a typical cell division cycle terminal phenotype. These data suggested that polδ is also involved in cell cycle control (20Francesconi S. Park H. Wang T.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). polδ appears to be not only the major replicative enzyme but also the primary polymerase for most DNA repair pathways. Biochemical and genetic studies implicate polδ in mismatch repair (21Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae polδ consists of three subunits 125, 58, and 55 kDa. These subunits are encoded by two essential genes, POL3 andPOL31, and a non-essential gene POL32 (29Gerik K.J. Li X.

The fission yeast subunits Pol3, Cdc1, and Cdc27 are encoded by essential genes homologous to S. cerevisiae POL3, POL31, and POL32, respectively. The smallest non-essential subunit Cdm1 has no apparent homologue in budding yeast (33Reynolds N. Watt A. Fantes P.A. MacNeill S.A. Curr.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The p125 subunit is homologous to budding yeast POL3 and fission yeast Pol3, whereas the p50 subunit is a homologue of POL31 and Cdc1. However, several recent studies suggest that mammalian polδ may consist of four subunits similar to theS. pombe enzyme. Analysis of PCNA-interacting proteins in murine cell extracts identified a novel protein p66, whose human homologue, a hypothetical protein KIAA0039, displayed some similarity to POL32 and Cdc27 (41Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More directly, an association of KIAA0039 protein, also called p68, with highly purified polδ was demonstrated by Lee and co-workers (42Mo J. Liu L. Leon A. Mazloum N. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Liu L. Mo J. Rodriguez-Belmonte E.M. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18739-18744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Finally, an additional small subunit p12 encoded by the human EST clone AA402118 was proposed to be the fourth subunit of mammalian polδ (43Liu L. Mo J. Rodriguez-Belmonte E.M. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18739-18744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on co-purification of this polypeptide with earlier characterized p125, p50, and p68 subunits of polδ and significant homology of p12/AA402118 to S. pombe Cdm1 (43Liu L. Mo J. Rodriguez-Belmonte E.M. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18739-18744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Attempts to produce recombinant polδ have met with variable success. The human catalytic subunit p125 was expressed in monkey cells using a vaccinia virus vector system. The recombinant protein was active on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) templates, and its activity could be stimulated 4.5-fold by PCNA, whereas native polδ was stimulated 10-fold by the same amount of PCNA (44Zhang P. Frugulhetti I. Jiang Y. Holt G.L. Condit R.C. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7993-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine p125 produced in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion displayed some DNA polymerizing activity, but no stimulatory effect of PCNA could be detected (45Hindges R. Hubscher U. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human p125 expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus displayed DNA polymerase activity, which was also not stimulated by PCNA (46Zhou J.Q. Tan C.K. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29740-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 47Wu S.M. Zhang P. Zeng X.R. Zhang S.J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

Co-expression of p125 and p50 subunit in insect cells resulted in formation of functional heterodimer. Its activity was stimulated 40–50-fold by PCNA, and the processivity of the heterodimer on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) was increased in the presence of PCNA like that of native calf thymus polδ (49Zhou J.Q. He H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, these data were not confirmed in another study of recombinant p125 co-expressed with p50 in insect cells (48Suzuki S. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Nagoya J. Med. Sci. 2000; 63: 99-113PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results suggest a possible explanation for the discrepancy. Co-expression of p125 and p50 in insect cells yielded a labile complex that possessed very low DNA polymerase activity and dissociated upon glycerol gradient centrifugation (50Shikata K. Ohta S. Yamada K. Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Co-expression of three subunits p125, p50, and p66 resulted in a more stable complex. This complex displayed PCNA-stimulated activity on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) template and was active on singly primed M13 DNA in the presence of RP-A, RF-C, and PCNA. Nevertheless, the specific activity of the three-subunit polδ was 10-fold lower than that of polδ isolated from human 293 cells by PCNA-affinity chromatography and 300-fold lower than that of enzyme purified from calf thymus (50Shikata K. Ohta S. Yamada K. Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we present reconstitution of human polδ in insect cells infected with four recombinant baculoviruses encoding subunits p125, p50, p66, and p12. Protein preparations purified to near-homogeneity by two different protocols contained each of the expected polypeptides. Characterization of the recombinant polδ demonstrated that it possesses specific activity comparable with the native human, bovine, and S. pombe polδ and is active on singly primed M13 DNA in the presence of RP-A, RF-C, PCNA, as well as in the SV40 DNA replication system. Bovine topoisomerase I was purified from calf thymus as described previously (51Schmitt B. Buhre U. Vosberg H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Pwo DNA polymerase was purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals; other enzymes were from Promega. A polyclonal antibody against human polδ catalytic subunit was obtained by immunizing rabbits with Escherichia coli expressed full-length p125 protein (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA).

Total RNA was isolated from HeLa S3 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Human total cDNA was prepared from total RNA using a 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system (Invitrogen). For the p125 subunit, a full-length cDNA for the polδ catalytic subunit with the sequence matching all exon sequences of the POLD1 gene was described (58Chang L.S. Zhao L. Zhu L. Chen M.L. Lee M.Y. Genomics. 1995; 28: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some nucleotide differences between thePOLD1 cDNA and genomic sequences were reported (58Chang L.S. Zhao L. Zhu L. Chen M.L. Lee M.Y. Genomics. 1995; 28: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To ensure that the POLD1 cDNA encodes the amino acid sequence identical to that deduced from the POLD1 genomic sequence, site-directed mutagenesis on the POLD1 cDNA was conducted using the Altered Sites in Vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega). A full-length POLD1 cDNA was cloned into pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene). Appropriate nucleotide changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To remove most of the 5′ non-coding sequence and to introduce a BamHI site to the 5′ end of the POLD1 cDNA, a 250-bp fragment was amplified by PCR using the POLD1 cDNA encoding plasmid as a template, with the forward primer dGGATCCCGGCGGGAAACGCTGTTTGAAG and the backward primer dTATGGCTGATGGTGGGAC. The fragment was re-introduced into the full-length POLD1 cDNA backbone and verified by DNA sequencing. To construct the baculovirus transfer vector for the p125 subunit, the POLD1 cDNA containing the entire coding region was excised by BamHI digestion and cloned into the pVL1393 transfer vector (Invitrogen). p50 subunit was cloned by PCR from human total cDNA using the forward primer dCGCGGATCCATGTTTTCTGAGCAGGCTGCC, backward primer dGGAAGATCTCAGGGGCCCAGCCCCAGGCC, and Pwo polymerase. The resulting 1422-bp PCR product was digested by BamHI andBglII and ligated into pVL1393 transfer vector. After verification of the resulting plasmid pVL1393/p50 by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing, BamHI/BglII fragment encoding p50 was recloned into the pBacHisA transfer vector (Invitrogen). p66 subunit was cloned by the same strategy using the forward primer dGGCGGATCCATGGCGGACCAGCTTTATCTG and backward primer dCGGAGATCTTATTTCCTCTGGAAGAAGCCAG. The resulting 1418-bp PCR product was digested by BamHI and BglII, ligated into pVL1393 transfer vector, and subsequently recloned into the pBacHisA transfer vector. p12 subunit was cloned using the forward primer dCGCGGATCCATGGGCCGGAAGCGGCTC and backward primer dCCGGAATTCGCCTCATAGGGGATAGAGATGCC. The resulting 345-bp PCR product was digested by BamHI/EcoRI and ligated into pBluescript II SK plasmid. After verification of the resulting pBS/p12 plasmid by DNA sequencing, the pBS/p12 was digested byBamHI/EcoRI, and the fragment containing the p12 cDNA was recloned into pVL1393 transfer vector. pBS/p12 was also digested by BamHI/HindIII, and the fragment containing the p12 cDNA was recloned into pBacHisA transfer vector. Growth and maintenance of Sf9 and High Five insect cells in monolayer cultures, preparation of recombinant baculoviruses, and infection of the cells were performed as described (59Podust V.N.

Four-subunit polδ was expressed by infection of insect cells with four recombinant baculoviruses, each encoding a subunit of human polδ. 6 × 108 High Five cells were infected for 48 h with corresponding viruses, then harvested, and lysed in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was bound to 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin. The suspension was mixed for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and the resin was pelleted by centrifugation, packed into a column, and washed with 10 ml of buffer A. Proteins were eluted with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Most of the protein eluted in fractions 2–5. Pooled fractions were diluted 5-fold with buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin), and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of NaCl from 20 to 400 mm in buffer Q, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. polδ eluted from the Mono Q column at 300 mm NaCl. In another protocol, fractions eluted from Ni-NTA resin were pooled, diluted 5-fold with buffer Q, and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of NaCl from 20 to 500 mm in buffer Q. polδ eluted from the Mono S column at 400 mm NaCl. 2.8 × 108 High Five cells were infected with a baculovirus encoding the p12-his protein, harvested 48 h later, and lysed in 10 ml of buffer A. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was bound to 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA resin. The suspension was mixed for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and the resin was pelleted by centrifugation, packed into a column, and washed with 5 ml of buffer A. Proteins were eluted with buffer B, and 0.2-ml fractions were collected. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The fraction with the highest protein concentration was used for further experiments. No DNA polymerizing activity was detected in the p12-his preparation (data not shown). Reaction mixtures (final volume of 25 μl) contained 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 6 mm MgCl2, 20 μm [α-32P]dTTP (900 cpm/pmol), 500 ng of poly(dA)-oligo(dT), 150 ng of PCNA, and polδ as indicated in the figures. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Acid-insoluble material was analyzed by scintillation counting. Reaction mixtures (final volume of 25 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 50 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 15 μm [α-32P]dTTP (5000 cpm/pmol), 100 ng of primed ssDNA (42 fmol of 3′-OH ends), 100 ng of PCNA, 1.2 μg of RP-A, and 50 ng (172 fmol) of RF-C and polδ as indicated in the figures. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and acid-insoluble material was analyzed by scintillation counting. For product length analysis, the reactions were terminated by treating them with proteinase K (60 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS and 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis on an alkaline 1.5% agarose gel, followed by autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (final volume of 40 μl) contained 30 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm each of UTP, GTP, and CTP, 50 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 15 μm [α-32P]dTTP (11,000 cpm/pmol), 250 ng of pUC-HS, 1 μg of creatine kinase, 1 μg of RP-A, 300 ng of PCNA, 74 ng of RF-C, 100 ng of topoisomerase I, 1.2 μg of T antigen, 20 ng of pol α-primase, and polδ as indicated in the figures. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by treating them with proteinase K in the presence of SDS and EDTA. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis on an alkaline 1.5% agarose gel, followed by autoradiography. Protein concentration was determined by densitometric scanning, using Image Store 7500 (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc.), of Coomassie-stained protein bands in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As protein standards, known amounts of BSA standard (Pierce) were loaded onto the same gel. To produce a four-subunit human polδ, we constructed recombinant baculoviruses encoding four polypeptides (p125, p50, p66, and p12) proposed to be subunits of the human enzyme. Recombinant viruses encoding the three small subunits as N-terminal His tag fusion proteins were also constructed. Several combinations of untagged and His-tagged subunits were then tested to determine the optimal combination for isolation of the reconstituted enzyme. Insect cells were infected with the untagged p125 baculovirus, together with baculoviruses encoding each of the small subunits, of which one expressed the His-tagged form (either p50, p66, or p12). The co-expressed proteins were purified by chromatography on Ni-NTA resin. As a control, we infected cells with a baculovirus constructed from unmodified vector pBacHisC (59Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and purified proteins from cell extracts by the same protocol. The resulting preparations were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody against the polδ catalytic subunit (Fig. 1A) and in a replication assay using poly(dA)-oligo(dT) as the template-primer (Fig.1B). Preparations isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography from cells infected with the control virus did not react with anti-p125 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane C) and showed no DNA polymerizing activity (Fig. 1B, column C). Infections with all three combinations of four baculoviruses with one His-tagged subunit yielded protein complexes that contained the p125 subunit (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3) and were about equally active in the poly(dA)-oligo(dT) assay (Fig. 1B, columns 1–3). To explore the roles of the recently described p66 and p12 subunits, we also produced three-subunit complexes lacking one of these subunits. When either p50 or p12 was His-tagged, the virus encoding the p66 subunit could be omitted during cell infection without any apparent loss of the catalytic subunit (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and6) or poly(dA)-oligo(dT) polymerizing activity (Fig.1B, columns 5 and 6). Surprisingly, a combination of viruses encoding p125, p50, and p66-his, but lacking the p12-encoding virus, yielded a protein preparation that contained the p125 subunit (Fig. 1A, lane 4) but displayed sharply reduced DNA polymerizing activity (Fig. 1B, column 4).

However, I-Smads are also localized in the nucleus. Previously, we have shown that Smad6 can function as a transcriptional co-repressor. In this study, we found both Smad6 and Smad7 interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs). Acetylation state of core histones plays a critical role in gene transcription regulation. An HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, released Smad6-mediated transcription repression. Moreover, class I HDACs (HDAC-1 and -3), not class II HDACs (HDAC-4, -5, and -6), were co-immunoprecipitated with Smad6. Endogenous HDAC-1 was also shown to interact with both Smad6 and Hoxc-8. Mapping of the interaction domain indicates Smad6 MH2 domain is mainly involved in recruiting HDAC-1. Most interestingly, Smad6 also binds to DNA through its MH1 domain, and the MH2 domain of Smad6 masks this binding activity, indicating that Smad6 MH1 and MH2 domains associate reciprocally and inhibit each other's function. Hoxc-8 induces Smad6 binding to DNA as a transcriptional complex. Our findings revealed that I-Smads act as antagonists in the nucleus by recruiting HDACs.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is mediated by two transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, type II and type I receptors (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the constitutively active type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors, leading to the propagation of signaling by recruiting and phosphorylating a group of specific proteins, Smads (3Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Smads are pivotal intracellular nuclear effectors of TGF-β family members, which transduce the signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus (3Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Smads contain two highly conserved domains: MH1 and MH2 domains (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Commonly, MH1 domain binds to DNA, whereas MH2 domain is the protein-protein interaction and transactivation domain (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). These two domains interact reciprocally and inhibit each other's function (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar,4Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Based on their function and sequence similarity, Smads are divided into three subgroups. 1) The receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are the targets of the activated type I receptors. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 mediate BMP signaling (3Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), whereas Smad2 and Smad3 mediate TGF-β signaling (5Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J.-I. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). 2) The common partner Smads (Co-Smads), Smad4 being the only one identified in mammals thus far, are shared by all of the R-Smads (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). 3) Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), including Smad6 and Smad7, stably bind to activated type I receptors and block phosphorylation of R-Smads (6Imamura T.

Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Both TGF-β and BMP induce I-Smad expression, indicating their negative feedback function in TGF-β signaling (8Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,9Takase M. Immamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Massahiro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Smad6 preferably inhibits BMP signaling, whereas Smad7 is more a general inhibitor (10Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M. ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 are expressed at the earliest stage during embryo development and highly expressed in the developing cardiovascular system, eyes, bones, and other tissues (11Yamada M. Szendro P.I. Prokscha A. Schwartz R. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Luukko K. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of Smad6 overlaps BMP-2, -4, and -7 expression, which orchestrates BMP-mediated cardiac development (11Yamada M. Szendro P.I. Prokscha A. Schwartz R. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Aortic ossification and elevated blood pressure were reported in viable Smad6 mutants (13Galvin K.M. Donovan M.J. Lynch C.A. Meyer R.I. Paul R.J. Lorenz J.N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dixon K.L. Dunmore J.H. Gimbrone Jr., M.A Falb D. Huszar D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). BMP induces the ventral mesoderm formation (14Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 15Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and the overlapped expression of Smad6 and BMP indicates that Smad6 is a key protein in balancing the function of BMP during embryo development. Smad6 inhibits BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation (16Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It is also reported that Smad6 inhibits adipogenesis (17Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 149: 667-682Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Smad7, not Smad6, was identified as inhibiting TGF-β function during embryonic vasculogenesis (18Zwijsen A. van Rooijen M.A. Goumans M.J. Dewulf N. Bosman E.A. ten Dijke P. Mummery C.L. Huylebroeck D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and lung development, injury, and repair (19Nakao A. Fujii M. Matsumura R. Kumano K. Saito Y. Miyazono K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23992-23997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The biological activities of Smads are closely associated to their cellular localization. R-Smads are located in the cytoplasm in the absence of signaling. Upon ligand stimulation, they are phosphorylated at their extreme carboxyl end SSXS motif and recruit the common partner Smad4 into the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional activators (21Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). I-Smads are located in both the cytosol and the nucleus (22Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermasson A. Itoh F.

Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanisms of I-Smads have been characterized in the cytoplasm. I-Smads interact with the activated type I receptors, which then block the phosphorylation of the R-Smads (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Smad6 was also demonstrated to interact with the phosphorylated Smad1 in the cytoplasm, competing with Smad4 to form an inactive Smad1-Smad6 complex (26Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We have shown that, in the nucleus, Smad6 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor on osteopontin promoter by interacting with Hoxc-8 (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a transcriptional repressor in BMP signaling (27Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Wan M. Shi X. Feng X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10119-10125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Smad6 repressive function in the nucleus remains unclear.Signaling to chromatin through histone modification is demonstrated as a major step for regulating target gene transcription (29Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). One of the modifications of histones is acetylation, where specific lysine residues are functional targets for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (30Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 31Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 32Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The acetylation of chromosomal histones loosens the structure of the target gene promoter and results in increased accessibility of the chromatin for transcription factors (30Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Conversely, hypoacetylation of a gene regulatory region is strongly related to silencing gene expression (30Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Several transcription repressors and co-repressors have been demonstrated to recruit HDACs to specific genes for silencing gene expression (33Burke L.J. Baniahmad A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, TGIF, a Smad transcriptional co-repressor, was identified as interacting with HDAC-1 and inhibiting TGF-β-induced gene transcription (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In addition to HDAC-1, eight other HDACs have been identified thus far (35Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 36Zhou X. marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Given that Smad6 displays similar activity as TGIF and other transcriptional repressors, all of which appear to recruit different HDAC complexes, we considered whether histone deacetylase activity might extend to Smad6 and affect its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. To address this issue, we characterized the mechanism of Smad6-mediated gene transcription. We demonstrated that an HDAC activity inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), rescued the repressive function of Smad6 in BMP signaling, indicating that HDACs engaged in the inhibitory effect of Smad6 in the nucleus. Furthermore, Smad6 was shown to interact with HDAC-1 and -3 in an immunoprecipitation assay. HDAC activity was detected in HDAC assay with an immunoprecipitated Smad6 protein complex. These data suggest that Smad6 represses gene transcription by recruiting class I HDACs and modifying chromatin conformation.DISCUSSIONI-Smads are antagonistic mediators in TGF-β signaling (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Both Smad6 and Smad7 expressions are induced by TGF-β or BMPs as negative feedback responses (8Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 9Takase M. Immamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Massahiro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). I-Smad interacts with the activated type I receptors, blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Particularly, Smad6 competes with Smad4 to form an inactive complex with phosphorylated Smad1 (26Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, antagonistic function of I-Smads is not well characterized in the nucleus. I-Smads are localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus, and TGF-β or BMP stimulation does not change the cellular distribution of Smad6. Initially, we reported that Smad6 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor through interacting with Hoxc-8 (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that both Smad6 and Smad7 were co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC-1, which is normally recruited by transcriptional repressors or co-repressors in inhibition of gene transcription. Importantly, we also find that Smad6 is a DNA-binding protein as a partner of Smad6/Hoxc-8 complex. Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA through its MH1 domain, whereas Smad6 MH2 domain recruits HDAC-1. These findings revealed an important functional aspect of I-Smads in the nucleus.Chromatin modification plays a critical role in regulating gene transcription. Acetylation is one of the major modification processes. HATs acetylate lysine residues on histone N-tails, leading to loosening of the chromatin structure and increasing the accessibility of transcriptional factors to the chromosome, whereas HDACs mediate silencing of gene transcription. R-Smads translocate to the nucleus upon BMP or TGF-β stimulation, where they function as transcriptional activators through interacting and recruiting p300/CBP to specific gene promoters (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 41Pearson K.L. Hunter T. Janknecht R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TGIF, a Smad co-repressor in the TGF-β signaling pathway, interacts with HDAC-1 and inhibits target gene expression (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HDACs inhibit gene transcription by tightening the chromosome structure. TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, rescued Smad6- and Hoxc-8-mediated transcription repression. Interaction of Smad6 and Smad7 with HDAC-1 and recruitment of endogenous HDAC activity clearly indicate the nuclear function of I-Smads as transcription repressors or co-repressors. Smad7 does not interact with Hox proteins (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, Smad7 was not shown as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor. However, the interaction of Smad7 with HDAC-1 suggests its potential function as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor in different transcription mechanisms because other cytokines such as TNF-α induce Smad7 expression (49Bitzer M. von Gersdoeff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Smad7 could also mediate cross-talk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways (49Bitzer M. von Gersdoeff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar, 50Lallemand F. Mazars A. Prunier C. Bertrand F. Kornprost M. Gallea S. Roman-Roman S. Cherqui G. Atfi A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of Smad7 in the nucleus remains to be characterized.The finding of Smad6 binding to DNA suggests that all of the Smads are DNA binding proteins. I-Smads contain both MH1 and MH2 domains, which are necessary for full activities of Xenopus Smad6 and Smad7 (51Nakayama T. Berg L.K. Christian J.L. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain is highly conserved with other Smads, but the MH1 domain is distinct (44Topper J. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K. Xu Y.-Y. Deeds J. Feeley R. Gimeno C. Woolf E. Tayber O. Mays G. Sampson B. Schoen F. Gimbrone Jr., M. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). MH1 domains of R-Smads and Smad4 bind DNA Smad box (GTCT) (41Pearson K.L. Hunter T. Janknecht R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 43Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA also through its MH1 domain. The full length of Smad6 does not bind to DNA, whereas, in the presence of Hoxc-8, Smad6 binds to DNA and forms a heterodimer. Importantly, the MH1 domain of Smad6 is required for the Hoxc-8-Smad6 complex formation although it is the MH2 domain of Smad6 that interacts with Hoxc-8. It appears that the MH2 domain of Smad6 masks its MH1 domain DNA binding activity, and that the MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad6 interact reciprocally and inhibit each other's function. Indeed, Smad6 MH1 DNA binding activity decreased when the length of Smad6 truncated MH1 domain extended to MH2 domain. This observation suggests that Hoxc-8 induces Smad6 conformation change, in which Smad6 MH1 domain becomes available to bind to DNA. Phosphorylation of Smad6 could be another way to change its conformation for DNA binding activity, which could also serve as a cross-talk with other signaling pathways.Taken together, we demonstrated a specific interaction of I-Smads with HDACs. As a model, we describe a transcription repression mechanism of Smad6. In response to BMP or TGF-β stimulation, Smad6 interacts with Hoxc-8 and binds to DNA as a heterodimer, which inhibits Smad1-induced gene transcription by recruiting HDACs. Importantly, Smad6 is also a DNA-binding protein. Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA through its MH1 domain, and Smad6 MH2 domain interacts with HDAC-1 and Hoxc-8. Consistent with the observation of I-Smads cellular distribution, our data indicate that I-Smads can function as transcription repressors or co-repressors in the nucleus as antagonistic feedback loop of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 superfamily members, which include TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), play a very important role during embryonic development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is mediated by two transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, type II and type I receptors (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the constitutively active type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors, leading to the propagation of signaling by recruiting and phosphorylating a group of specific proteins, Smads (3Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Smads are pivotal intracellular nuclear effectors of TGF-β family members, which transduce the signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus (3Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Smads contain two highly conserved domains: MH1 and MH2 domains (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Commonly, MH1 domain binds to DNA, whereas MH2 domain is the protein-protein interaction and transactivation domain (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). These two domains interact reciprocally and inhibit each other's function (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar,4Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Based on their function and sequence similarity, Smads are divided into three subgroups. 1) The receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are the targets of the activated type I receptors. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 mediate BMP signaling (3Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), whereas Smad2 and Smad3 mediate TGF-β signaling (5Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J.-I. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). 2) The common partner Smads (Co-Smads), Smad4 being the only one identified in mammals thus far, are shared by all of the R-Smads (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). 3) Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), including Smad6 and Smad7, stably bind to activated type I receptors and block phosphorylation of R-Smads (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Both TGF-β and BMP induce I-Smad expression, indicating their negative feedback function in TGF-β signaling (8Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,9Takase M. Immamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Massahiro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Smad6 preferably inhibits BMP signaling, whereas Smad7 is more a general inhibitor (10Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M. ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 are expressed at the earliest stage during embryo development and highly expressed in the developing cardiovascular system, eyes, bones, and other tissues (11Yamada M. Szendro P.I. Prokscha A. Schwartz R. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Luukko K. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of Smad6 overlaps BMP-2, -4, and -7 expression, which orchestrates BMP-mediated cardiac development (11Yamada M. Szendro P.I. Prokscha A. Schwartz R. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Aortic ossification and elevated blood pressure were reported in viable Smad6 mutants (13Galvin K.M. Donovan M.J. Lynch C.A. Meyer R.I. Paul R.J. Lorenz J.N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dixon K.L. Dunmore J.H. Gimbrone Jr., M.A Falb D. Huszar D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). BMP induces the ventral mesoderm formation (14Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 15Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and the overlapped expression of Smad6 and BMP indicates that Smad6 is a key protein in balancing the function of BMP during embryo development. Smad6 inhibits BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation (16Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It is also reported that Smad6 inhibits adipogenesis (17Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 149: 667-682Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Smad7, not Smad6, was identified as inhibiting TGF-β function during embryonic vasculogenesis (18Zwijsen A. van Rooijen M.A. Goumans M.J. Dewulf N. Bosman E.A. ten Dijke P. Mummery C.L. Huylebroeck D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and lung development, injury, and repair (19Nakao A. Fujii M. Matsumura R. Kumano K. Saito Y. Miyazono K. Iwamoto I. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20Zhao J. Shi W. Chen H. Warburton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23992-23997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The biological activities of Smads are closely associated to their cellular localization. R-Smads are located in the cytoplasm in the absence of signaling. Upon ligand stimulation, they are phosphorylated at their extreme carboxyl end SSXS motif and recruit the common partner Smad4 into the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional activators (21Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). I-Smads are located in both the cytosol and the nucleus (22Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermasson A. Itoh F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Smad6 cellular distribution is not affected by TGF-β or BMP treatment (24Sakou T. Onishi T. Yamamoto T. Nagamine T. Sampath T.K. ten Dijke P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) whereas TGF-β induces nuclear export of Smad7 (22Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermasson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanisms of I-Smads have been characterized in the cytoplasm. I-Smads interact with the activated type I receptors, which then block the phosphorylation of the R-Smads (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Smad6 was also demonstrated to interact with the phosphorylated Smad1 in the cytoplasm, competing with Smad4 to form an inactive Smad1-Smad6 complex (26Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We have shown that, in the nucleus, Smad6 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor on osteopontin promoter by interacting with Hoxc-8 (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a transcriptional repressor in BMP signaling (27Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Wan M. Shi X. Feng X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10119-10125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Smad6 repressive function in the nucleus remains unclear. Signaling to chromatin through histone modification is demonstrated as a major step for regulating target gene transcription (29Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). One of the modifications of histones is acetylation, where specific lysine residues are functional targets for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (30Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 31Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 32Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The acetylation of chromosomal histones loosens the structure of the target gene promoter and results in increased accessibility of the chromatin for transcription factors (30Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Conversely, hypoacetylation of a gene regulatory region is strongly related to silencing gene expression (30Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Several transcription repressors and co-repressors have been demonstrated to recruit HDACs to specific genes for silencing gene expression (33Burke L.J. Baniahmad A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, TGIF, a Smad transcriptional co-repressor, was identified as interacting with HDAC-1 and inhibiting TGF-β-induced gene transcription (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In addition to HDAC-1, eight other HDACs have been identified thus far (35Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 36Zhou X. marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Given that Smad6 displays similar activity as TGIF and other transcriptional repressors, all of which appear to recruit different HDAC complexes, we considered whether histone deacetylase activity might extend to Smad6 and affect its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. To address this issue, we characterized the mechanism of Smad6-mediated gene transcription. We demonstrated that an HDAC activity inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), rescued the repressive function of Smad6 in BMP signaling, indicating that HDACs engaged in the inhibitory effect of Smad6 in the nucleus. Furthermore, Smad6 was shown to interact with HDAC-1 and -3 in an immunoprecipitation assay. HDAC activity was detected in HDAC assay with an immunoprecipitated Smad6 protein complex. These data suggest that Smad6 represses gene transcription by recruiting class I HDACs and modifying chromatin conformation. DISCUSSIONI-Smads are antagonistic mediators in TGF-β signaling (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Both Smad6 and Smad7 expressions are induced by TGF-β or BMPs as negative feedback responses (8Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 9Takase M. Immamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Massahiro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). I-Smad interacts with the activated type I receptors, blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Particularly, Smad6 competes with Smad4 to form an inactive complex with phosphorylated Smad1 (26Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, antagonistic function of I-Smads is not well characterized in the nucleus. I-Smads are localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus, and TGF-β or BMP stimulation does not change the cellular distribution of Smad6. Initially, we reported that Smad6 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor through interacting with Hoxc-8 (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that both Smad6 and Smad7 were co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC-1, which is normally recruited by transcriptional repressors or co-repressors in inhibition of gene transcription. Importantly, we also find that Smad6 is a DNA-binding protein as a partner of Smad6/Hoxc-8 complex. Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA through its MH1 domain, whereas Smad6 MH2 domain recruits HDAC-1. These findings revealed an important functional aspect of I-Smads in the nucleus.Chromatin modification plays a critical role in regulating gene transcription. Acetylation is one of the major modification processes. HATs acetylate lysine residues on histone N-tails, leading to loosening of the chromatin structure and increasing the accessibility of transcriptional factors to the chromosome, whereas HDACs mediate silencing of gene transcription. R-Smads translocate to the nucleus upon BMP or TGF-β stimulation, where they function as transcriptional activators through interacting and recruiting p300/CBP to specific gene promoters (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 41Pearson K.L. Hunter T. Janknecht R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TGIF, a Smad co-repressor in the TGF-β signaling pathway, interacts with HDAC-1 and inhibits target gene expression (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HDACs inhibit gene transcription by tightening the chromosome structure. TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, rescued Smad6- and Hoxc-8-mediated transcription repression. Interaction of Smad6 and Smad7 with HDAC-1 and recruitment of endogenous HDAC activity clearly indicate the nuclear function of I-Smads as transcription repressors or co-repressors. Smad7 does not interact with Hox proteins (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, Smad7 was not shown as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor. However, the interaction of Smad7 with HDAC-1 suggests its potential function as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor in different transcription mechanisms because other cytokines such as TNF-α induce Smad7 expression (49Bitzer M. von Gersdoeff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Smad7 could also mediate cross-talk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways (49Bitzer M. von Gersdoeff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar, 50Lallemand F. Mazars A. Prunier C. Bertrand F. Kornprost M. Gallea S. Roman-Roman S. Cherqui G. Atfi A.

I-Smads contain both MH1 and MH2 domains, which are necessary for full activities of Xenopus Smad6 and Smad7 (51Nakayama T. Berg L.K. Christian J.L. Mech.

Deeds J. Feeley R. Gimeno C. Woolf E. Tayber O. Mays G. Sampson B. Schoen F. Gimbrone Jr., M. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). MH1 domains of R-Smads and Smad4 bind DNA Smad box (GTCT) (41Pearson K.L. Hunter T. Janknecht R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Zawel L.

Indeed, Smad6 MH1 DNA binding activity decreased when the length of Smad6 truncated MH1 domain extended to MH2 domain. This observation suggests that Hoxc-8 induces Smad6 conformation change, in which Smad6 MH1 domain becomes available to bind to DNA. Phosphorylation of Smad6 could be another way to change its conformation for DNA binding activity, which could also serve as a cross-talk with other signaling pathways.Taken together, we demonstrated a specific interaction of I-Smads with HDACs. As a model, we describe a transcription repression mechanism of Smad6. In response to BMP or TGF-β stimulation, Smad6 interacts with Hoxc-8 and binds to DNA as a heterodimer, which inhibits Smad1-induced gene transcription by recruiting HDACs. Importantly, Smad6 is also a DNA-binding protein. Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA through its MH1 domain, and Smad6 MH2 domain interacts with HDAC-1 and Hoxc-8. Consistent with the observation of I-Smads cellular distribution, our data indicate that I-Smads can function as transcription repressors or co-repressors in the nucleus as antagonistic feedback loop of the TGF-β signaling pathway. I-Smads are antagonistic mediators in TGF-β signaling (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Both Smad6 and Smad7 expressions are induced by TGF-β or BMPs as negative feedback responses (8Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P.

Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). I-Smad interacts with the activated type I receptors, blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A.

Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Particularly, Smad6 competes with Smad4 to form an inactive complex with phosphorylated Smad1 (26Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, antagonistic function of I-Smads is not well characterized in the nucleus. I-Smads are localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus, and TGF-β or BMP stimulation does not change the cellular distribution of Smad6. Initially, we reported that Smad6 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor through interacting with Hoxc-8 (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that both Smad6 and Smad7 were co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC-1, which is normally recruited by transcriptional repressors or co-repressors in inhibition of gene transcription. Importantly, we also find that Smad6 is a DNA-binding protein as a partner of Smad6/Hoxc-8 complex. Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA through its MH1 domain, whereas Smad6 MH2 domain recruits HDAC-1. These findings revealed an important functional aspect of I-Smads in the nucleus. Chromatin modification plays a critical role in regulating gene transcription. Acetylation is one of the major modification processes. HATs acetylate lysine residues on histone N-tails, leading to loosening of the chromatin structure and increasing the accessibility of transcriptional factors to the chromosome, whereas HDACs mediate silencing of gene transcription. R-Smads translocate to the nucleus upon BMP or TGF-β stimulation, where they function as transcriptional activators through interacting and recruiting p300/CBP to specific gene promoters (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 41Pearson K.L. Hunter T. Janknecht R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TGIF, a Smad co-repressor in the TGF-β signaling pathway, interacts with HDAC-1 and inhibits target gene expression (34Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HDACs inhibit gene transcription by tightening the chromosome structure. TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, rescued Smad6- and Hoxc-8-mediated transcription repression. Interaction of Smad6 and Smad7 with HDAC-1 and recruitment of endogenous HDAC activity clearly indicate the nuclear function of I-Smads as transcription repressors or co-repressors. Smad7 does not interact with Hox proteins (25Bai S. Shi X. Yang X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8267-8270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, Smad7 was not shown as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor. However, the interaction of Smad7 with HDAC-1 suggests its potential function as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor in different transcription mechanisms because other cytokines such as TNF-α induce Smad7 expression (49Bitzer M. von Gersdoeff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Smad7 could also mediate cross-talk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways (49Bitzer M. von Gersdoeff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar, 50Lallemand F. Mazars A. Prunier C. Bertrand F. Kornprost M. Gallea S. Roman-Roman S. Cherqui G. Atfi A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of Smad7 in the nucleus remains to be characterized. The finding of Smad6 binding to DNA suggests that all of the Smads are DNA binding proteins. I-Smads contain both MH1 and MH2 domains, which are necessary for full activities of Xenopus Smad6 and Smad7 (51Nakayama T. Berg L.K. Christian J.L. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain is highly conserved with other Smads, but the MH1 domain is distinct (44Topper J. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K. Xu Y.-Y. Deeds J. Feeley R. Gimeno C. Woolf E. Tayber O. Mays G. Sampson B. Schoen F. Gimbrone Jr., M. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). MH1 domains of R-Smads and Smad4 bind DNA Smad box (GTCT) (41Pearson K.L. Hunter T. Janknecht R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Zawel L.

Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Like other Smads, Smad6 binds to DNA also through its MH1 domain. The full length of Smad6 does not bind to DNA, whereas, in the presence of Hoxc-8, Smad6 binds to DNA and forms a heterodimer. Importantly, the MH1 domain of Smad6 is required for the Hoxc-8-Smad6 complex formation although it is the MH2 domain of Smad6 that interacts with Hoxc-8. It appears that the MH2 domain of Smad6 masks its MH1 domain DNA binding activity, and that the MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad6 interact reciprocally and inhibit each other's function. Indeed, Smad6 MH1 DNA binding activity decreased when the length of Smad6 truncated MH1 domain extended to MH2 domain. This observation suggests that Hoxc-8 induces Smad6 conformation change, in which Smad6 MH1 domain becomes available to bind to DNA. Phosphorylation of Smad6 could be another way to change its conformation for DNA binding activity, which could also serve as a cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Taken together, we demonstrated a specific interaction of I-Smads with HDACs. As a model, we describe a transcription repression mechanism of Smad6.

https://openalex.org/W2320766625,"We previously reported that transcription-coupled repair (TCR)-deficient human fibroblasts are extremely sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis and this sensitivity correlated with the induction of the p53 tumour suppressor. However, we have also found that p53 can be protective against UV-induced apoptosis. Thus, prior to this study, it was not clear whether the induction of p53 in TCR-deficient fibroblasts contributed to their death. To address this issue, we have expressed human papillomavirus E6 (HPV-E6) in primary fibroblasts derived from patients affected with xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation groups A, B and C) and Cockayne syndrome (complementation group B). We found that TCR-deficient (XP-A, XP-B and CS-B) fibroblasts were more sensitive than TCR-proficient cells (XP-C and normal) to both UV light and cisplatin treatment and this increase in sensitivity was not p53 dependent. Importantly, HPV-E6 expression increased the sensitivity of TCR-proficient normal and XP-C fibroblasts to UV- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. This increase in sensitivity correlated with a decrease in the capacity of HPV-E6 expressing cells to recover mRNA synthesis following UV-irradiation. Therefore, we propose that p53 protects against UV- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a TCR-dependent manner and that p53 does not contribute strongly to the induction of apoptosis in TCR-deficient fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2041941982,"The ability of malarial parasite to deploy proteins at the surface of infected erythrocytes is well known. After their synthesis within the parasite, the cargo proteins are exported from the parasite and carried across the erythrocyte cytoplasm to be delivered at the erythrocyte surface. Our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in this complex trafficking path is limited. We have addressed the involvement of chaperones in traffic across erythrocyte cytoplasm. Our analyses of the chaperones available to the parasite indicated that none of the reported chaperones of the parasite origin are present in the erythrocyte cytoplasm. The chaperones of the host (Hsp70, Hsp90, Hop60), on the other hand, were readily detected in the erythrocyte cytosol. Hypotonic lysis and detergent solubilization experiments indicated that unlike their soluble nature in normal erythrocytes, host chaperones are recruited in membrane-bound, detergent-resistant complexes in infected cells. The association of host-Hsp70 with detergent-resistant complexes was ATP-dependent. Importantly, host chaperones could be detected in knob-enriched fractions and could be cross-linked to the knob subunit, PfHRP1, in a large complex at the surface of the infected erythrocytes. Our results implicate host chaperones in the assembly of parasite proteins such as knob subunits at the erythrocyte surface."
https://openalex.org/W2109805150,"Abstract ATR (ataxiatelangiectasia and Rad-3-related) is a protein kinase required for survival after DNA damage. A critical role for ATR has been hypothesized to be the regulation of p53 and other cell cycle checkpoints. ATR has been shown to phosphorylate p53 at Ser15, and this damage-induced phosphorylation is diminished by expression of a catalytically inactive (ATR-kd) mutant. p53 function could not be examined directly in prior studies of ATR, however, because p53 was mutant or because cells expressed the SV40 large T antigen that blocks p53 function. To test the interactions of ATR and p53 directly we generated human U2OS cell lines inducible for either wild-type or kinase-dead ATR that also have an intact p53 pathway. Indeed, ATR-kd expression sensitized these cells to DNA damage and caused a transient decrease in damage-induced serine 15 phosphorylation of p53. However, we found that the effects of ATR-kd expression do not result in blocking the response of p53 to DNA damage. Specifically, prior ATR-kd expression had no effect on DNA damage-induced p53 protein up-regulation, p53-DNA binding, p21 mRNA up-regulation, or G1 arrest. Instead of promoting survival via p53 regulation, we found that ATR protects cells by delaying the generation of mitotic phosphoproteins and inhibiting premature chromatin condensation after DNA damage or hydroxyurea. Although p53 inhibition (by E6 or MDM2 expression) had little effect on premature chromatin condensation, when combined with ATR-kd expression there was a marked loss of the replication checkpoint. We conclude that ATR and p53 can function independently but that loss of both leads to synergistic disruption of the replication checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W1998885660,"The identification of residues that line neurotransmitter-binding sites and catalyze allosteric transitions that result in channel gating is crucial for understanding ligand-gated ion channel function. In this study, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method and two-electrode voltage clamp to identify novel γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-binding site residues and to elucidate the secondary structure of the Trp92-Asp101region of the β2 subunit. Each residue was mutated individually to cysteine and expressed with wild-type α1subunits in Xenopus oocytes. GABA-gated currents (IGABA) were measured before and after exposure to the sulfhydryl reagent, N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS). V93C, D95C, Y97C, and L99C are accessible to derivatization. This pattern of accessibility is consistent with β2Val93-Leu99 adopting a β-strand conformation. Both GABA and SR95531 protect Y97C and L99C from modification, indicating that these two residues line the GABA-binding site. In D95C-containing receptors, application of MTS in the presence of SR95531 causes a greater effect onIGABA than MTS alone, suggesting that binding of a competitive antagonist can cause movements in the binding site. In addition, we present evidence that β2L99C homomers form spontaneously open channels.

Among members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs1), both allosteric transitions are required, and must be linked together in a coordinated fashion, for the ligand binding to effect channel gating. The association of the neurotransmitter with the receptor represents the initial step in the induction of conformational movements that result in channel activation, deactivation, and desensitization. Therefore, an understanding of the structure of the ligand-binding site is necessary to comprehend these processes. The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) is a member of the LGIC superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors that includes nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine, and serotonin type 3 receptors (see Fig. 1) (1Schofield P.R.

The ligand-binding site is formed at subunit-subunit interfaces with clusters of binding site residues (which are, by arbitrary convention, designated “loops” A–F) found in several distinct regions of neighboring subunits.

To date, no residues in the region defined by Trp92-Asp101 (loop A) of the β2subunit have been implicated in the formation of the GABA-binding site.

SCAM entails introducing cysteine residues at individual positions within the protein and testing the effect (if any) of modifying these introduced cysteines with sulfhydryl-specific reagents. We use two criteria to determine if a cysteine-substituted residue lines part of the binding site: (i) reaction with a sulfhydryl-specific reagent alters function and (ii) binding site ligands (agonists and antagonists) protect the engineered cysteine from covalent modification. In this report, using SCAM analysis of the β2Trp92-Asp101 region of the GABAAR, we found that this domain adopts a β strand conformation and identified two novel amino acid residues, Leu99 and Tyr97, that participate in the formation of the GABA-binding site. These observations mark the initial structural description of this region of the GABAAR β2 subunit. Using the recently determined crystal structure of the related acetylcholine binding protein (35Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) as a template, we present a model of this domain of the GABA-binding site. Furthermore, we illustrate that the binding of a competitive antagonist, SR95531, triggers conformational movement near the binding site and that mutation of a binding-site residue (Leu99) can perturb channel gating. Wild-type rat cDNAs for the α1 and β2 subunits of the GABAA receptor were used. The β2 cysteine mutant constructs were made using recombinant PCR (36Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), as described previously (37Boileau A.J. Czajkowski C. J.

Cysteine substitutions were made in the β2 subunit at positions Trp92, Val93, Pro94, Asp95, Thr96, Tyr97, Phe98, Leu99, Asn100, and Asp101 (Fig.1). The β2cysteine-substituted mutants were subcloned into pGH19 (39Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 40Robertson G.A. Warmke J.M. Ganetzky B. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. All cysteine mutants were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The β2cysteine mutants have been named using the single-letter code, as (wild-type residue) (residue number) (cysteine), e.g.L99C. Oocytes were prepared as previously described (41Boileau A.J. Kucken A.M. Evers A.R. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GABAAreceptor α1 and β2 or β2mutant subunits were expressed by injection of cRNA (0.7–2.7 ng/subunit cRNA) in a 1:1 ratio (α:β) with the exception of L99C, which was injected with excess α subunit cRNA in a 4:1 ratio (see “Results” and “Discussion”). The maximal currents for the majority of the mutant receptors were similar to wild-type receptors (1–5 μA). Expression of P94C and F98C produced receptors in which the peak current amplitudes were significantly reduced (<100 nA), even with 7-ng cRNA injections. The oocytes were maintained in modified ND96 recording solution (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4), that had been supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Oocytes were used 2–14 days after injection for electrophysiological recordings. Oocytes under two-electrode voltage clamp (Vhold = −80 mV) were perfused continuously with ND96 at a rate of ∼5 ml/min. The volume of the recording chamber was 200 μl. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp procedures were carried out using a GeneClamp500 Amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Borosilicate electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–3.0 MΩ in ND96. Stock solutions of GABA (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO) and SR95531 (Sigma) were prepared in water, whereas a 100 mm stock ofN-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin, MTS hereafter; Biotium, Hayward, CA) was dissolved in Me2SO. The MTS molecule (14.5 Å, unreacted; 11.2 Å reacted moiety) is longer than GABA (4.5 Å) but similar in length to SR95531 (13.5 Å). Furthermore, MTS is a relatively membrane impermeant compound (42Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), allowing only for extracellular reactions. Taken together, these properties make MTS a reasonable choice for experimentation on water-soluble ligand-binding regions. All compounds were diluted appropriately in ND96 such that the final concentration of Me2SO in MTS solutions was ≤3%. This concentration of solvent did not affect recombinant GABAAR properties. To measure the sensitivity to GABA, the agonist (0.0001–30 mm) was applied via gravity perfusion (∼5–8 s) or by pipette application (150–200 μl) with a 3- to 15-min washout period between each application to ensure complete recovery from desensitization. Peak GABA-activated current (IGABA) was recorded at each application. To correct for slow drift in the maximum amplitude of the response, concentration-response data were collected by a prior application of a low, non-desensitizing concentration of GABA (EC3–EC5) between which there was an approximate 20-s wash-out period and to which each test concentration of agonist was normalized. Concentration-response curves were generated for each recombinant receptor, and the data were fitted by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, www.graphpad.com). Data were fitted to the equation: I= Imax/(1 + (EC50/[A])n), where I is the peak amplitude of the current for a given concentration of GABA ([A]), Imax is the maximum amplitude of the current, EC50 is the concentration required for half maximal receptor activation, and n is the Hill coefficient. To measure the sensitivity to SR95531, GABA (EC50) was applied via gravity perfusion followed by a brief (20 s) wash-out period before concomitant application of GABA (EC50) and increasing concentrations of SR95531 by pipette application. The response to the application of SR95531 and GABA was normalized to the response elicited by the agonist alone. Concentration-inhibition curves were generated for each recombinant receptor, and the data were fitted by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. Data were fitted to the equation: 1 − 1/(1 + (IC50/[Ant])n), where IC50 is the concentration of antagonist ([Ant]) that reduces the amplitude of the GABA-evoked current by 50% and n is the Hill coefficient.KI values were calculated using the Cheng-Prussof correction: KI = IC50/(1 + ([A]/EC50)), where [A] is the concentration of GABA used in each experiment and EC50 is the concentration of GABA that elicits a half-maximal response for each receptor (44Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar, 45Chou T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 235-247PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing either wild-type or mutant receptors were pulsed with solutions containing GABA concentrations corresponding to approximately EC50 for the particular receptor being studied every 5 min until IGABA varied by <5% for two consecutive pulses. Then, cells were exposed to a high concentration of MTS (3 mm exposure for 3 min) and washed for 10 min, and GABA at EC50 was applied again to determine accessibility to the modified cysteine residue by the MTS reagent. Preliminary experiments showed that this concentration and time of MTS exposure were sufficient to achieve maximum inhibition ofIGABA in all accessible mutant residues. Percent inhibition was calculated as (1 − (IGABAafter MTS/IGABA before MTS)) × 100%. Currents were further examined by multiple pulses of EC50GABA after MTS reaction, and responses remained stable. All accessible residues were also tested for the specificity of the MTS reaction by treating the oocytes with the reducing reagent dithiothreitol (20 mm, 3 min), which reversed the inhibition caused by covalent modification. To determine whether the accessibility of the mutated cysteine could be altered by the presence of agonist (GABA) or antagonist (SR95531), the following protocol was used: After IGABA at EC50 was stabilized, cells were exposed to a concentration of MTS that yielded approximately 50% of the full inhibitory effect seen with maximal MTS exposure. This concentration was determined separately for each accessible mutation. In a different set of cells, accessible residues were “protected” from reaction with the half-maximal concentration of MTS by co-incubation with either GABA (∼500 × EC50) or SR95531 (∼10 ×KI). After measurement of percent inhibition in the presence of protecting ligand, the same cells were then exposed to maximal MTS to ensure that the previously protected mutant cysteines were still accessible. Control experiments with these high concentrations of agonist or antagonist in the absence of the MTS reagent were performed in cells prior to the co-application, and necessary wash times were determined to obtain a <5% change inIGABA. In all cases, a 15-min wash in ND96 was sufficient to ensure complete recovery from desensitization. Statistical comparisons for accessibility or protection employed one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test to determine levels of significance. Accessibility of mutant receptors using maximal MTS exposure was compared with the same treatment for wild-type α1β2 GABAA receptors. For protection assays, the inhibition of peak IGABAafter half-maximal MTS exposure served as the control measurement for the Dunnett's post-test. This average was compared with half-maximal MTS plus the protectant GABA, half-maximal MTS plus SR95531, and to the maximal MTS exposures in the same cells after the respective protection assay was performed. All significant results had p values < 0.001. Cysteine substitutions were made individually at ten positions in the β2 subunit (Trp92, Val93, Pro94, Asp95, Thr96, Tyr97, Phe98, Leu99, Asn100, and Asp101) and tested for functional expression in Xenopus oocytes by co-expression with the wild-type α1 subunit. GABA activated wild-type α1β2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2A), with an apparent affinity of 1.6 μm (Table I). All mutants formed functional channels, with the exception of W92C. This tryptophan residue is invariant in all LGIC subunits and may play an essential structural role for receptor assembly. Most cysteine substitutions shifted the EC50 values for GABA >10-fold, with the exceptions of V93C and L99C, which were not significantly different from the wild-type value (Table I). The largest shift in the concentration dependence of GABA activation occurred on expression of Y97C (>100-fold). The Hill coefficients for all mutants were not significantly different from wild-type receptors (Table I).Table IConcentration-response data for 1) IGABA peak measurements and 2) their antagonism by SR95531 at recombinant GABAAreceptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytesReceptorGABASR95531EC50nHnmut/wtKInHnmut/wtμmμmα1β21.6 ± 0.51.50 ± 0.20310.33 ± 0.060.94 ± 0.0651α1β2(V93C)3.8 ± 1.31.24 ± 0.0232.40.05 ± 0.0021-ap < 0.001.

Log (EC50), log (KI), and nH values were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Dunnett's test to compare mutant and wild-type receptors. The competitive antagonist SR95531 reduced IGABAin a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) with a KI value of 330 nm at wild-type receptors (Table I). Only the Y97C substitution increased SR95531KI. For all other mutations, there was either no change in the KI value for SR95531 or there was a moderate decrease. The KI value was not determined for receptors carrying the F98C mutation, because small currents elicited by GABA at EC50 (≈25 nA) precluded an accurate determination (see “Experimental Procedures”). None of the SR95531 Hill coefficients were significantly different from wild-type (TableI). Overall, these results indicate that cysteine substitution in this region is tolerated. Wild-type and cysteine mutant receptors were then tested for modification by MTS (Fig. 3). After exposure to 3 mm MTS for 3 min,IGABA peaks were measured and compared with current peaks prior to MTS exposure. IGABA was significantly inhibited in only four mutant receptors (Fig.3B); α1β2V93C was inhibited by 71.4 ± 2.1%, α1β2D95C by 98.9 ± 0.4%, α1β2Y97C by 66.9 ± 1.9%, and α1β2L99C by 98.2 ± 0.4%. MTS had no effect on wild-type GABAARs and receptors containing P94C, T96C, F98C, N100C, and D101C. It should be noted that these receptors may have reacted with MTS, but the reactions had no functional effect. Nevertheless, a change in current amplitude following MTS treatment and reversibility of the sulfhydryl-specific reaction by dithiothreitol proves that cysteine modification has occurred. The pattern of accessibility (i.e. every other residue) is indicative of a β strand conformation. MTS inhibition of IGABA could be the result of a direct effect such as steric block and/or an indirect allosteric effect on the binding site. To determine if the accessible residues contribute to the lining of the GABA binding pocket, mutant receptors were tested for “protection” from the MTS reaction using co-application of agonist (GABA) or antagonist (SR95531) as “protectants.” First, we determined a concentration and time of MTS exposure that resulted in an approximately half-maximal inhibition for each of the accessible mutants (Fig. 4). For α1β2V93C, normalized inhibition of 41.9 ± 3.6% (29.9% mean inhibition divided by mean maximal inhibition of 71.4%) required 1-min exposure to 3 mm MTS; α1β2D95C required 67 μm, 1 min (normalized inhibition 47.3 ± 3.6%); α1β2Y97C required 3 mm, 1.25 min (54.8 ± 2.9%); α1β2L99C required 100 μm, 1 min (56.2 ± 2.6%). Then, either GABA (at ∼500× the EC50 value for that mutant) or SR95531 (at ∼10× the KI value) was co-applied with the half-maximal MTS in previously unexposed cells, and the change inIGABA was measured. Mutant receptors containing L99C were completely protected from MTS reaction (0% MTS inhibition) by both agonist and antagonist (Fig. 4, A andB), even at concentrations of MTS (1 mm) that produce maximal inhibition (data not shown). α1β2Y97C receptors were significantly protected by both GABA and SR95531 as well (Fig. 4A). V93C- and D95C-containing receptors were not protected by either ligand, indicating that these residues do not line the binding site. Interestingly, SR95531 enhanced MTS inhibition ofIGABA in D95C-cont"

Members of the LAP (LRR and PDZ) protein family such as LET-413 and Scribble are involved in maintaining epithelial cell polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans andDrosophila melanogaster, respectively. We previously described Erbin as a mammalian LET-413 homologue interacting with ERBB2/HER2, an epidermal growth factor receptor family member. Erbin and ERBB2/HER2 are located in the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. We show here that Erbin interacts with p0071 (also called plakophilin-4), an armadillo repeat protein linked to the cytoskeleton. Erbin binds to p0071 in vitro and in vivo in a PDZ domain-dependent manner, and both proteins colocalized in desmosomes of epithelial cells. Using a dominant negative approach, we found that integrity of epithelial cell monolayer is impaired when interaction between Erbin and p0071 is disrupted. We propose that Erbin is connected by p0071 to cytoskeletal networks in an interaction crucial for epithelial homeostasis.

Organized epithelial cells have an apical membrane in contact with fluids, intercellular lateral membranes, and a basal membrane connected to extracellular matrices. Apical and basolateral compartments are separated by tight and adherens junctions and contain different sets of proteins and lipids (1Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J.

These highly organized structures regulate exchanges between extra- and intracellular compartments in normal situations and may be affected in carcinoma and autoimmune diseases. Asymmetric distributed multiprotein complexes in polarized epithelial cells contain cell adhesion molecules, signaling and structural proteins whose organization relies on protein-protein interactions. They are organized by protein modules that are found in one or more copies in proteins and interact with specific peptides of their binding partner (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Among the protein modules, PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1) domains bind to short peptides and are involved in receptor signaling and targeting. They are conserved from bacteria to mammals (5Fanning A.S.

Multiple copies of PDZ domains in the same protein help scaffold an array of receptors, enzymes, and adaptors, thus creating a functional unit. This is well documented in the case of INAD, a five-PDZ domain protein, gathering a protein kinase C, calmodulin, phospholipase C, rhodopsin, and light-sensitive Ca2+ channel in a stable transducisome machinery crucial for signaling and stability of photoreceptors (13Chevesich J.

LAP proteins are membrane-bound adaptor proteins and contain 16 amino-terminal leucine-rich repeats and one (LET-413, Densin-180, Erbin), four (Scribble), or no (Lano) PDZ domains. Genetic analyses have thoroughly demonstrated the importance of LAP proteins in worm and fly development and their role in cell polarity and epithelial morphogenesis. Loss of function of let-413 (homologue ofErbin and Densin-180) and scribble(orthologue of hScribble) is embryonic lethal and results in disorganization of the cytoskeleton and disruption of epithelial integrity with mislocalization of apical determinants (20Bilder D.

We have characterized the interaction between ERBB2, a mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor family member, and Erbin, which is reminiscent of LET-23/LIN-2-LIN-7-LIN-10 complex interaction. In both cases, PDZ domain interactions are important for receptor localization or retention in epithelial cells (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H.

The Erbin-ERBB2 interaction takes place at the basolateral side of epithelial cells. The Erbin PDZ domain interacts with ERBB2 and controls its basolateral localization in epithelial cells (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E.

Recently, it was demonstrated that Erbin directly binds to BPAG1 (bullous pemphigoidantigen-1), a component of hemidesmosomes, electron dense structures in contact with the basal membrane associated with the cytoskeleton (32Favre B. Fontao L. Koster J. Shafaatian R. Jaunin F. Saurat J.H. Sonnenberg A. Borradori L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32427-32436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). BPAG1 belongs to the plakin family and is involved in cytoskeletal organization (33Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nature (Mol. Cell. Biol.). 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The integrin β4 subunit, a cell adhesion molecule involved in hemidesmosome assembly, also associates with Erbin through a protein interaction domain lying amino-terminal to the Erbin PDZ domain (32Favre B. Fontao L. Koster J. Shafaatian R. Jaunin F. Saurat J.H. Sonnenberg A. Borradori L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32427-32436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether Erbin is present in hemidesmosomes. Although the functional relevance of these novel interactions remains to be appreciated, these data suggest that Erbin is linked to cytoskeleton-associated protein complexes in hemidesmosomes and participates to cell adhesion processes. In this report, using the two-hybrid system in yeast, we identified p0071 (also called plakophilin-4), a member of the armadillo repeat family, as a new interactor for Erbin. Proteins of the p120-catenin family, including p0071, link cadherin adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton (34Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction is mediated by the p0071 carboxyl-terminal sequence and the Erbin PDZ domain. Erbin and p0071 specifically interact in cultured epithelial cells and tissues. By surface plasmon resonance (SPR)1 analysis, we measured a better affinity between p0071 and Erbin than between ERBB2 and Erbin. Erbin is found at the lateral membrane of epithelial cells and colocalizes with p0071 in desmosomes. Disruption of the p0071-Erbin interaction by a dominant negative approach provoked alteration of cell morphology, suggesting that connection of Erbin to cytoskeletal networks is important for epithelial integrity. To prepare the baits used in this paper, proteins or peptides were fused to the LexA-BD subunit using the pBTM116 vector, which carries Trp1. For library screening, an oligo(dT)-primed human cDNA breast library cloned in pACT2 vector (CLONTECH), which carries Leu2 as a selection marker, was screened by using the LexA-Erbin as a bait and the yeast strain L40 following the lithium-acetate protocol. Approximately 106Trp+Leu+ transformants were selected on plates with supplemented minimum medium that lacked tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the primary screening and contained 10 mm 3-aminotriazole and then tested for the β-galactosidase activity by the filter method in the secondary screening. After rescue, the DNA of selected clones was retransformed in L40 yeast containing LexA-Erbin or LexA fused to control proteins. Specific clones were positive for growth in histidine-deficient medium and β-galactosidase activity. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg·ml−1 aprotinin, and 10 μg·ml−1leupeptin. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, lysate protein content was normalized using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added, and immune complexes bound to beads were recovered after 1 h, washed three times with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), boiled in 1× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Transfer and immunoblotting on nitrocellulose using a horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit or horseradish peroxidase-anti-mouse antibody/chemiluminescence method were performed as described (36Borg J.-P. Ooi J.Y. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). COS-1, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, HeLa, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units·ml−1penicillin and 100 μg·ml−1 streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Caco-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 1% nonessential amino acids. All cell transfections were made using Fugene 6 reagent according to manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The human Erbin cDNA was used as a template to create different constructs allowing expression of GST, Myc-tagged, LexA-BD, and GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S.

Ooi J.Y. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

The pGEX-Tag vector was used to produce all GST fusion proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced by Genome Express, SA (Grenoble, France). p0071 headless (aa 509–1193), arm repeats (aa 509–989), and tail (aa 990–1193) domains were cloned by RT-PCR from HeLa cell RNA. PCR products were ligated into the PCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. Constructs were then subcloned into the pCDNA4TOmycHis vector (Invitrogen) or pEGFP vector (CLONTECH) for eucaryotic expression or into pGAD424 for two-hybrid analyses. Monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 and polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies are from Oncogene Research Products andCLONTECH, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and Dako, respectively. Anti-Erbin polyclonal antibody has been previously described (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Erbin antibodies were produced by injecting a soluble GST-Erbin-(914–1371) fusion protein to BALB/C mice. Spleen cells of immunized mice were fused to the nonsecreting myeloma X63-Ag8.653 as previously described (37Rosnet O. Buhring H.J. Marchetto S. Rappold I. Lavagna C. Sainty D. Arnoulet C. Chabannon C. Kanz L. Hannum C. Birnbaum D. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 238-248PubMed Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were tested by immunoprecipitation on Erbin-containing lysates. Positive clones were cloned twice by limiting dilution. Monoclonal anti-p0071 antibodies were obtained by immunization of mice with the purified recombinant tail domain expressed in pRSET andE. coli BL21DE3 cells. Clones 5A4-8-3 and 6D1-10 will be described in detail elsewhere. 2M. Hatzfeld, manuscript in preparation. For immunostaining procedures, MCF-7 cells and Caco-2 cells grown on coverslips for 20 days after confluence were double labeled as described before with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against Erbin (diluted 1:100) (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against p0071 (5A4). Images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM2). Frozen sections (0.5–1.0 μm) of human colon were treated as described (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Immediately after removal, biopsies of human colon (kindly provided by Dr. Monges, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille) were fixed at room temperature in 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS+. Tissues were then infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose in PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were prepared using a cryo-ultramicrotome and collected on Formvar-coated grids. Sections were successively treated for 30 min with PBS, for 20 min with 0.5 mNH4Cl in PBS, and for 30 min with PBS supplemented with 10% goat serum. They were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Erbin and anti-p0071 (5A4) antibodies diluted 1:20 or 1:5 in 5% goat serum in PBS, respectively. The grids were rinsed in PBS, and primary antibodies were revealed by incubation for 1 h with colloidal gold 6- or 15-nm conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, respectively, diluted 1:25 in 5% goat serum in PBS. After extensive washing with double-distilled water, sections were rapidly fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, stained for 6 min with 2% uranyl acetate, rinsed, and treated with 0.3% uranyl acetate and 1.8% methylcellulose in double-distilled water on ice. Sections were air-dried and examined under a Zeiss electron microscope. Biotinylated (Biotin) peptides were synthesized by Neosystem, SA. Peptide sequences were as follows: Biotin-PTAENPEYLGLDVPV (ERBB2), Biotin-TVLPPPPYRHRNTVV (ERBB4), and Biotin-SYRAEQYPGSPDSWV (p0071). SPR studies were performed using an upgraded BIAcore apparatus (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and streptavidin-coupled SA sensor chips (BIAcore). In all experiments, HBS (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20) is used as running buffer. Biotinylated peptides were immobilized at the indicated levels over streptavidin-coupled surfaces. Injection of GST fusion proteins were performed in HBS at a flow rate of 20 or 30 μl/min. Surface regeneration was obtained using injection of HBS supplemented with 0.03% SDS. GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against HBS prior to their use. To avoid aggregates, GST fusion proteins used in SPR experiments were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S-200 column and used within 48 h. Data were interpreted using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore). To identify new ligands for Erbin, we did a two-hybrid screen of a human breast cDNA library using full-length Erbin as a bait. Two overlapping clones of 543 and 126 aa, respectively, strongly interacted with Erbin but not with control Lamin (data not shown) and are identical to the carboxyl-terminal region of p0071. p0071 is a member of the armadillo family and contains 10 armadillo repeats (38Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The p0071 clones bound to constructs encompassing the Erbin PDZ domain (i.e. Erbin, Erbin-(853–1371), and Erbin PDZ domain). Truncation of this region (Erbin.ΔPDZ) abrogated the interaction (Fig. 1A). In the next experiments, we used biochemical assays to confirm the p0071-Erbin interaction. We expressed a Myc-tagged version of Erbin and Erbin.ΔPDZ and performed a pull-down assay with GST-p0071. This fusion protein encompassed the 126 last residues of p0071 fused to the GST protein. Erbin, but not Erbin.ΔPDZ, was precipitated by GST-p0071, confirming that the PDZ domain was sufficient for this interaction (Fig. 1B). We also expressed a Myc-tagged version of p0071 in COS cells and performed a GST pull-down assay with recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli. GST-Erbin PDZ domain precipitated p0071, whereas no interaction was found with GST alone (data not shown) and GST fused to Densin-180, AF6, and LIN-2 PDZ domains (Fig. 1C). The largest clone pulled out of the library encoded the seven last armadillo repeats and the carboxyl terminus of p0071, while the shortest one only encoded the last 126 residues of the protein. The peptide sequence of this latter form, shown in Fig.2A, contains a carboxyl-terminal SWV motif matching with a class I PDZ domain binding site ((S/T)XV) (39Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). We precipitated proteins extracted from a Caco-2 cell lysate by GST-p0071 encompassing the last 126 amino acids of p0071. Erbin was efficiently precipitated by a GST-p0071, but not by GST alone (Fig. 2B). The original paper describing the cloning of p0071 mentioned that the SWV motif of p0071 was not located at the very carboxyl-terminal end of the protein (38Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the p0071 sequence stops with a SWV motif in the two clones pulled out of our two-hybrid screening. Furthermore, we found in databases numerous expressed sequence tags coding for the p0071 carboxyl-terminal sequence that end with the SWV motif. None encoded the longer splice variant described originally. We now know that this discrepancy is due to a sequencing error in the original report describing p0071cDNA. 3M. Hatzfeld, personal communication. The presence of a canonical PDZ binding site in p0071 suggested that this sequence (SWV) is involved in the interaction with the Erbin PDZ domain. To confirm this hypothesis, we fused the p0071 wild-type carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence or mutant forms to LexA-BD. This time, the Erbin PDZ domain was used as a prey and fused to the GAL4 activation domain. The 15 last residues of p0071 or ERBB2 were sufficient to bind to the Erbin PDZ domain (Fig. 2C). Control peptides (ERBB4, MUSK, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Nectin-3) did not interact with Erbin. The AF6 PDZ domain bound to Nectin-3 (40Reymond N. Borg J.-P. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Campadelli-Fiume G. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletion of the DSWV motif (p0071.Δ4) completely abrogated the interaction (Fig. 2D). We also mutated this motif and found that the carboxyl-terminal valine (position 0) and the tryptophan residue (position −1) are crucial for binding, whereas residues in positions −2 (Ser) and −3 (Asp) support a substitution with an alanine. We have shown that the Erbin PDZ domain prefers a (E/D)(S/T/V)XV peptide binding site (30Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15256-15263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DSWV peptide in p0071 fits with this motif, although the Asp−3and Ser−2 amino acids did not appear essential for the interaction in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2D). p0071 belongs to a subclass of armadillo repeat proteins also comprising plakophilins and p120 catenin-related proteins (33Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nature (Mol. Cell. Biol.). 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 38Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The plakophilin 1, 2, and 3 carboxyl termini do not contain a DSWV motif and accordingly did not interact with the Erbin PDZ domain by two-hybrid analysis (Fig.2D). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the Erbin PDZ domain interacts with the p0071 carboxyl terminus. We also co-expressed in COS cells full-length Erbin with Myc-p0071 headless (p0071HL), Myc-p0071 armadillo repeats (p0071Arm), or Myc-p0071 carboxyl terminus (p0071CT). After cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of proteins with anti-Myc antibody, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. Probing the membrane with anti-Erbin antibody showed that p0071HL and p0071CT, but not p0071Arm, coimmunoprecipitated with Erbin (Fig. 2E). We thus confirmed by precipitation assays with purified fusion proteins, two-hybrid analysis in yeast, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments in COS cells that Erbin and p0071 associate through a PDZ domain interaction. To gain insight into the respective affinities between Erbin and its ligands (i.e. ERBB2 and p0071), we used surface plasmon resonance analysis. Biotinylated peptides and recombinant GST fusion proteins fused to PDZ domains were tested in the in vitro binding assays. As expected, we found that GST alone (data not shown) or GST-GRB2 did not interact with ERBB2, ERBB4 (not shown), and p0071 peptides (Fig.3). ERBB2 interacted with the Erbin PDZ domain with a low affinity (KD = 1400 nm). Interestingly, we measured an affinity of 1200 nm between LET-23 and LIN-7 in a similar SPR analysis (data not shown). The affinity between ERBB2 and Erbin is rather low, although both proteins coimmunoprecipitate in cell and tissue extracts (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F.

Our previous reports demonstrated that the Erbin-ERBB2 interaction is disrupted by the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (29Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F.

We believe that a weak interaction between ERBB2 and the Erbin PDZ domain (and perhaps between LET-23 and LIN-7) allows a more dynamic regulation of this interaction to occur in vivo. We measured a better affinity between p0071 and Erbin (KD = 88 nm). This affinity is within the same range as those observed for other PDZ domain-peptide interactions (39Songyang Z. Fanning A.S.

Heide K. Haupt H. Naturwissenschaften. 1961; 48: 719-724Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). β2-GPI is a member of the complement control superfamily of proteins (2Reid K. Day A. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It is composed of five contiguous domains, four of which are highly homologous to one another. Each of the first four domains contains ∼60 amino acids and two disulfide bonds. The fifth domain is aberrant in that it contains ∼80 amino acids, a long C-terminal tail, and an extra disulfide bond (3Kato H. Enjyoji K.

Acta. 1986; 884: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 14Nimpf J. Wurm H. Kostner G.M. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 109-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). β2-GPI also can inhibit the anticoagulant effect of activated protein C (15Mori T. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Gabazza E.C. Suzuki K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Much of the pro- and anticoagulant properties of β2-GPI are mediated via its ability to bind anionic phospholipids. Thus, β2-GPI competes effectively with varied coagulation factors for catalytic surfaces (16Wurm H. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides, the major phospholipid-binding site within β2-GPI has been mapped to the Cys281–Cys288loop that resides in the fifth domain of the protein. Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 have been implicated in the ionic interaction of β2-GPI with phospholipids (17Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sheng Y. Sali A. Herzog H. Lahnstein J. Krilis S.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3744-3751PubMed Google Scholar). However, Mehdi and co-workers (19Schwarzenbacher R. Zeth K. Diederichs K. Gries A. Kostner G.M. Laggner P. Prassl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6228-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Mehdi H. Naqvi A. Kamboh M.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1770-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have shown that optimal interaction additionally requires the integrity of the C-terminal tail and nearby residues Leu313–Trp316. The latter residues are important because they are directly inserted into the phospholipid bilayer as an anchor. β2-GPI will bind to many negatively charged macromolecules, including heparin glycosaminoglycan. The primary function of heparin in normal individuals is to bind to mast cell proteases, and it probably does not interact with β2-GPI under physiological conditions. However, heparin is regularly used in the treatment of APS patients both in acute therapy and prophylaxis (21Khamashta M.A. Cuadrado M.J. Mujic F. Taub N.A. Hunt B.J. Hughes G.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 22Kandiah D.A. Sali A. Sheng Y. Victoria E.J. Marquis D.M. Coutts S.M. Krilis S.A. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 507-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The manner by which β2-GPI binds to heparin has not been deduced. A positively charged, low affinity phospholipid-binding site has been identified in the first domain of β2-GPI (23Hagihara Y. Gato Y. Kato H. Yoshimura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), thereby raising the possibility that this domain is the primary heparin-binding site. It also has not been ascertained whether or not heparin alters the biological activity of β2-GPI. We now demonstrate that the primary heparin-binding site does not reside in the first domain. Rather, it resides in the fifth domain of β2-GPI, which is the same site that interacts with phospholipids. We also demonstrate that heparin promotes the plasmin-mediated inactivation of β2-GPI. Thus, heparin exerts its beneficial effects in APS patients by two distinct mechanisms. Native β2-GPI was purified from normal human plasma using cardiolipin affinity chromatography as described previously (24McNeil H.P. Krilis S.A. Chesterman C.N. Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 641-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Eleven β2-GPI mutants were used in this study to define the heparin-binding site in β2-GPI. Eight of the mutants were generated previously to define the primary phospholipid-binding site and the primary antigenic site recognized by the autoantibodies in APS patients (25Kouts S. Bunn C.L. Steinkasserer A. Krilis S.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Iverson G.M. Victoria E.J. Marquis D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15542-15546Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Three additional β2-GPI mutants were generated to evaluate the relative importance of the first domain in β2-GPI/heparin interactions. Recombinant wild type and domain deletion mutants of β2-GPI were generated as described previously (25Kouts S. Bunn C.L. Steinkasserer A. Krilis S.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Iverson G.M. Victoria E.J. Marquis D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15542-15546Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNAs encoding native human β2-GPI (as well as domains I–IV, domains II–V, domains III–V, and just domain V of β2-GPI) were inserted into the baculovirus vector pBacPAK6 (CLONTECH Laboratories). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were grown in a monolayer, and then the cells were infected with the resulting constructs. The resulting cells were cultured 3–5 days at 27 °C in serum-free medium (Sf-900II; Invitrogen). The resulting recombinant proteins were purified from the conditioned medium by affinity chromatography using a rabbit polyclonal anti-β2-GPI antibody. The obtained recombinant proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis (25Kouts S. Bunn C.L. Steinkasserer A. Krilis S.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Iverson G.M. Victoria E.J. Marquis D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15542-15546Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Wild type and domain deletion mutants of β2-GPI were also subjected to automated Edman sequencing using an Applied Biosystems sequencer (Foster City, CA). A β2-GPI mutant (F307*/C288A) lacking the C-terminal tail was prepared as described previously (27Sheng Y. Kandiah D.A. Krilis S.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2038-2043PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two mutations were introduced simultaneously into the human cDNA that ultimately resulted in a translation termination codon at Phe307 and the conversion of Cys288 to Ala. The latter mutation had to be performed to prevent the spontaneous dimerization of the resulting recombinant protein. An oligonucleotide-directed in vitromutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories) was used to convert Lys286 to Glu; Lys286 and Lys287 to Glu; and Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 to Glu in the fifth domain of the molecule (18Sheng Y. Sali A. Herzog H. Lahnstein J. Krilis S.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3744-3751PubMed Google Scholar). In the first domain the positively charged residue Arg43was mutated to Gly, Gly40 was mutated to Glu, a negatively charged residue, while Thr50 was mutated to Ala, both uncharged residues. The nucleotide sequence of each mutated cDNA was confirmed by standard sequencing technology. Each cDNA was subcloned into the pBacPAK-6 vector, and the recombinant protein was expressed and purified as outlined above. A heparin-BSA complex was prepared by chemically coupling the heparin chains via their reducing ends to BSA according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Sigma). Binding of β2-GPI to immobilized heparin was performed using a modification of the method of Najjam and co-workers (28Najjam S. Gibbs R.V. Gordon M.Y. Rider C.C. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nunc Maxisorp plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with heparin-BSA complex or BSA (Sigma) alone at a concentration of 5.0 μg/ml in 13 mm EDTA and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Each plate was washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 0.05% Tween (v/v). Wild type, domain deletion mutants, and point mutants of β2-GPI were added at equimolar concentrations ranging from 0.2–1.0 μm, and each plate was incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. Each plate was washed, 100 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody to β2-GPI was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the plate was incubated for another 2 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed, and 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was added at a dilution of 1:1000. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed again, and 100 μl of para-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml) in 1m diethanolamine buffer, 0.5 mmMgCl2, pH 9.8 (Sigma) was added to each well. The optical density was read at 405 nm using a PowerWave X Select (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.). The absorbance values of the BSA control wells were similar to background levels. Thus, these values were subtracted from that of the heparin-BSA wells in all cases as a measure of specific binding to heparin. Binding of native β2-GPI and its mutants to cardiolipin was determined using an anti-cardiolipin antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that has been described previously (17Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type β2-GPI was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations (25–200 μm) of a synthetic peptide,281CKNKEKKC288, spanning the phospholipid-binding region on the fifth domain of the molecule or the control peptide, a scrambled peptide containing this region of the fifth domain. Binding of wild type β2-GPI to immobilized heparin in the presence of these peptides was then determined using the protocol described above. The level of inhibition of wild type β2-GPI binding to immobilized heparin was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations (1–20 μg/ml) of heparin in fluid phase or haptoglobin (as an irrelevant control) using the protocol described above. Haptoglobin was chosen as a control because it is a member of the complement control family of proteins similar to β2-GPI. The binding affinity of fluid phase β2-GPI for heparin was calculated according to the method of Friguet and co-workers (29Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the concentration of plasmin required to generate approximately one-third cleaved and two-thirds intact β2-GPI using a variation of the method of Okhura and co-workers (30Ohkura N. Hagihara Y. Yoshimura T. Goto Y. Kato H. Blood. 1998; 91: 4173-4179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was achieved when β2-GPI and plasmin were incubated at a molar ratio of ∼90:1 for 30 min at 37 °C; therefore these conditions were used in all subsequent experiments. The reaction was terminated by snap freezing the digests in dry ice. The samples were diluted 10-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and applied to a HiTrap heparin column (Sigma) equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Both intact and cleaved β2-GPI was eluted from the heparin column using a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0m NaCl in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Cleaved β2-GPI bound the heparin column with a lower affinity than the intact protein and therefore eluted earlier from the column at a lower salt concentration. To examine the effect of heparin on the plasmin-mediated cleavage of β2-GPI, heparin (0.1–10 units/ml) was added to β2-GPI and plasmin at a constant molar ratio, and the resulting sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by snap freezing in dry ice. The samples were diluted 10-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and applied to the heparin column as described above. Aliquots from the reaction mixture were removed at 0- and 30-min time intervals and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on an 8–16% gradient gel (Novex®, Invitrogen BV). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. A β2-GPI mutant lacking domain I bound to heparin in a manner similar to that obtained with native β2-GPI. Although the mutant that lacked both domains I and II bound at a reduced efficiency, the mutant that lacked just domain V failed to bind to heparin at any examined concentration (Fig.1A). When a mutant that contained just the fifth domain of β2-GPI was examined, it was found that this small portion of the protein bound to heparin at a rate of 22–48% of that obtained with wild type β2-GPI depending on the concentration of the mutant used in the assay. These findings indicate that β2-GPI binds to heparin primarily via its fifth domain. β2-GPI cleaved at its Lys317-Thr318 site did not bind to heparin at either 10 or 25 μg/ml. However, a β2-GPI mutant lacking the internal loop in the fifth domain of the molecule (F307*/C288A) bound heparin in a manner similar to that obtained with wild type β2-GPI. The latter finding suggests that the internal loop that is normally inserted into the lipid bilayer is not involved in the recognition of heparin (Fig. 1B). Neither the β2-GPI mutant lacking the C-terminal tail nor the proteolytically processed β2-GPI is able to recognize cardiolipin (Fig. 1C). β2-GPI mutants possessing point mutations in the first domain of this plasma protein bound to heparin effectively (Fig.2A). Thus, in agreement with the above domain deletion mutants, the first domain of β2-GPI does not appear to be essential for the interaction of this plasma protein with heparin. Compared with wild type β2-GPI, a single point mutation at Lys286 in the fifth domain of the molecule resulted in a 69% reduction in the ability of the recombinant protein to bind to heparin. Binding efficiency was reduced to 80% when both Lys286 and Lys287 were mutated, and no binding to heparin occurred when Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 were all mutated. Thus, all three positively charged residues in domain V appear to be involved at varying degrees in the interaction of β2-GPI with heparin (Fig.2B). Binding of wild type β2-GPI to heparin was competitively inhibited using the281CKNKEKKC288 synthetic peptide that corresponds to a portion of the fifth domain that binds to phospholipids. A 50% inhibition was obtained at a peptide concentration of 150 μm (Fig.3). The binding of β2-GPI to heparin also was competitively inhibited with fluid phase heparin, but not haptoglobin, at equimolar concentrations (Fig. 4). An IC50was obtained at 20 μg of heparin/ml. Based on these data, the dissociation constant Kd for the fluid phase interaction of β2-GPI and heparin was estimated to be 4.3 × 10−5m.Figure 4Competitive inhibition of wild type β2-GPI binding to immobilized heparin with fluid phase heparin and haptoglobin. Inhibition of wild type β2-GPI binding to immobilized heparin with fluid phase heparin (■) and haptoglobin (♦) was examined at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 20 μg/ml. ABS, absorbance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incubation of β2-GPI with heparin (10 units) in the absence of plasmin did not induce cleavage of β2-GPI above the control nor did it promote the dissociation of β2-GPI from the heparin column (Fig. 5, A andB). Interestingly heparin, at concentrations from 2.5 to 10 units/ml, greatly enhanced plasmin cleavage of β2-GPI as demonstrated by an increase in the peak area in the chromatograph representing cleaved β2-GPI compared with intact β2-GPI above the control (Fig.5, C and E). The peak area representing cleaved and intact β2-GPI was 10.4 and 16.5 cm2, respectively, for β2-GPI incubated with plasmin alone. However in the presence of heparin (10 units) there was a complete reversal in the chromatographic profile as demonstrated by an increase in peak area for cleaved β2-GPI to 15 cm2 with a concomitant decrease for that representing intact β2-GPI to 12.1 cm2. At lower concentrations of heparin there was no increase in the level of cleavage by plasmin detected above the control without heparin. SDS-PAGE analysis of β2-GPI incubated with plasmin alone showed a slight increase in mobility for β2-GPI cleaved at the Lys317-Thr318 site compared with intact β2-GPI (Fig. 6), while a similar banding pattern was observed when β2-GPI was incubated with plasmin in the presence of heparin suggesting that no further cleavage product was generated. β2-GPI will bind to a number of negatively charged surfaces, including those that contain phospholipids, DNA, or heparin (16Wurm H. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31Kroll J. Laron J.K. Loft H. Ezban M. Wallewick K. Faber M. Biochim. Biophys.

Pergamon Press, Oxford1979: 817-820Google Scholar). β2-GPI is abundant in plasma, and this protein is highly conserved throughout mammalian evolution (33Matsuura E. Igarashi M. Igarashi Y. Nagae H. Ichikawa K. Yasuda T. Koike T. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, its physiological function still has not been deduced. Based on numerousin vitro studies, β2-GPI has both positive and negative effects on coagulation. It enhances the uptake of apoptotic bodies, and it binds oxidized low density lipoproteins (12Schousboe I. Blood. 1985; 66: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nimpf J. Bevers E.M. Bomans P.H.

Immunol. 1997; 107: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The heparin binding property of β2-GPI was first noted in 1979. Although this property is routinely exploited to purify β2-GPI from human plasma (32Polz E. Peeters H. Protides of Biological Fluids. Pergamon Press, Oxford1979: 817-820Google Scholar), the heparin-binding site in β2-GPI has not been defined. Whether or not heparin alters β2-GPI in some way also has not been deduced. The first domain within β2-GPI contains a positively charged region that includes Arg39, Arg43, and Lys44. Because it has been reported that this domain binds negatively charged phospholipids, an expression/site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to evaluate the possible importance of this positively charged domain in heparin interaction. Conversion of Arg43 to Gly did not dramatically alter the ability of β2-GPI to bind to heparin. Furthermore a synthetic peptide spanning residues Val37–Pro48 in domain I failed to inhibit the binding of wild type β2-GPI to heparin at any concentration examined despite its overall positive charge (data not shown). Based on these data, we conclude that the first domain in β2-GPI is not the primary heparin-binding site. Using various mutants of β2-GPI, we instead found that β2-GPI binds to heparin primarily via its fifth domain. We also show that residues at Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 in this domain are of critical importance in the interaction. β2-GPI uses the same three Lys residues in its interaction with phospholipids (18Sheng Y. Sali A. Herzog H. Lahnstein J. Krilis S.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3744-3751PubMed Google Scholar). However, high affinity interaction only occurs when the hydrophobic segment corresponding to residues Leu313–Trp316 are inserted into the phospholipid bilayer as shown in the model depicted in Fig. 7. β2-GPI that had been cleaved at the Lys317-Thr318 site was unable to bind to immobilized heparin. While this finding initially suggested that the hydrophobicity of the C-terminal loop is also important in heparin recognition, a separate mutant that lacked the hydrophobic loop bound to heparin just as efficiently as wild type β2-GPI. The latter finding now suggests that cleavage of β2-GPI at the Lys317-Thr318 site alters the spatial array of the three critical Lys residues. In support of this conclusion, a recent report proposed that cleavage of β2-GPI at the Lys317-Thr318 site disturbs the nearby electrostatic environment (36Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Nishii I. Yamazaki T. Kato H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is believed that the integrity of the 317/318 peptide bond is important in tethering the cluster of positively charged and hydrophobic residues in this region (36Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Nishii I. Yamazaki T. Kato H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). While McNally and co-workers (37McNally T. Cotterell S.E. Mackie I.J. Isenberg D.A. Machin S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) proposed that heparin might enhance the binding of β2-GPI to phospholipids, we conclude that the opposite most likely occurs in vivo because the heparin and phospholipid recognition sites are the same. Horbach and colleagues (38Horbach D.A. van Oort E. Lisman T. Meijers J.C. Derksen R.H. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 81: 87-95Google Scholar) reported that β2-GPI is often cleaved at the Lys317-Thr318 site in the plasma of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and patients treated with streptokinase. The cleaved form of β2-GPI was correlated with varied in vitro markers of fibrinolytic activity. Thus, it has been proposed that the cleaved form of β2-GPI is probably generated during normal fibrinolysis. More recently, the presence of the processed form of β2-GPI was demonstrated in patients with leukemia and with lupus anticoagulant activity (39Itoh Y. Inuzuka K. Kohno I. Wada H. Shiku H. Ohkura N. Kato H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was proposed that plasmin is the likely protease that generates the proteolytically processed form of β2-GPI. Unexplained was the mechanism that restricts the plasmin-mediated attack to a single site in the protein. Thus, we decided to investigate whether or not heparin alters and/or restricts the plasmin-mediated cleavage of β2-GPI. We initially suspected that heparin would sterically inhibit the plasmin-mediated cleavage of β2-GPI because the heparin-binding site is close to the primary plasmin-susceptible site. However, in contrast to what we expected, heparin at concentrations that are reached therapeuticallyin vivo greatly enhanced the plasmin-mediated cleavage of β2-GPI. In addition, the proteolytically processed β2-GPI was no longer able to bind to heparin. There are many potential plasmin cleavage sites in β2-GPI. Thus, the ability of heparin to enhance attack at the Lys317-Thr318 site is quite remarkable. Considering that the cleaved form of β2-GPI cannot bind to phospholipids, interaction with heparin should greatly reduce the prothrombotic effects of anti-β2-GPI antibodies. Finally, it has been proposed that the proteolytically processed form of β2-GPI may be cleared more rapidly from the circulation than native β2-GPI (38Horbach D.A. van Oort E. Lisman T. Meijers J.C. Derksen R.H. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 81: 87-95Google Scholar). In summary, our data indicate at least two distinct mechanisms by which heparin achieves its therapeutic effect in APS patients. In the first mechanism, heparin sterically prevents the binding of β2-GPI to negatively charged phospholipids, which in turn prevents the deposition of the anti-β2-GPI antibodies in tissues. In the second mechanism, heparin potentiates the generation of an inactive form of β2-GPI by plasmin."

Enhanced expression of MYCNconfers growth potential to neuroblastoma cells, and a direct link between MYCN expression and the development of neuroblastoma has been demonstrated in transgenic mice studies. Although the molecular pathways underlying the regulation ofMYCN have not been fully elucidated, post-transcriptional mechanisms appear to be important. Previously, we reported that an embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like (ELAV) protein binds with high specificity to at least two AU-rich elements within theMYCN 3′-untranslated region. In this study, we characterized the ability of cis-acting elements within theMYCN 3′-untranslated region to destabilize mRNA in cells and examined the functional consequences of its interactions with the ELAV protein HuD. We show that at least 4 cis-acting elements within the MYCN 3′-untranslated region are able to signal the degradation of stable heterologous mRNA. Ectopic overexpression of HuD dramatically inhibits RNA decay mediated by the full-length MYCN 3′-untranslated region andcis-acting destabilizing elements that harbor HuD binding sites in vivo.

Ectopic overexpression of MYCN results in enhanced malignant growth (12Schweigerer L. Breit S. Wenzel A. Tsunamoto K. Ludwig R. Schwab M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4411-4416PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bernards R. Dessain S.K. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas MYCN antisense studies performed by our laboratory and others have shown that down-regulation of MYCN in human NB is associated with a decrease in cellular proliferation and inhibited tumor cell growthin vitro (14Schmidt M.L.

Furthermore, a direct link betweenMYCN expression and the development of NB has been demonstrated in transgenic mice studies (17Weiss W.A. Aldape K. Mohapatra G. Feuerstein B.G. Bishop J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2985-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Previously we examined MYCN regulation in N- (neuroblastic, tumorigenic) and S-type (substrate-adherent, non-tumorigenic) subclones (W-N and W-S) of the MYCN-amplified NB cell line NBL-W (18Foley J. Cohn S.L. Salwen H.R. Chagnovich D. Cowan J. Mason K.L. Parysek L.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6338-6345PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to distinct morphology and growth characteristics, the subclones have differential levels of MYCN expression despite having the same genomic MYCN copy number. We found that the disparity in steady-state levels of MYCN mRNA in the W-N and W-S cells was largely determined by differences inMYCN mRNA stability (19Chagnovich D. Cohn S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33580-33586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Lazarova and co-workers (20Lazarova D.L. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) examined MYCN expression in other MYCN-amplified NB cell lines, and similarly found that tumorigenic N-type NB cells express higher levels of MYCN than S-type cells. Their studies indicated that nuclear processing and/or stabilization ofMYCN pre-mRNA species were important events in the regulation of MYCN gene expression (20Lazarova D.L. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Modulation of mRNA stability provides a powerful means for controlling gene expression (for a review see Ref. 21Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Although, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating mRNA turnover are not completely understood, it is known that many labile mRNAs, including MYCN (22Stanton L.W. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1772-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), contain AU-rich elements (ARE) within their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) (23, 24 and reviewed in Ref. 25Moss T.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At least 14 apparently distinct ARE-binding proteins have been identified in eukaryotic cell extracts by UV-cross-linking and gel shift assays (reviewed in Ref. 26Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and there is evidence indicating that binding of these trans-acting factors to AREs influences mRNA degradation (27Levy N.S.

The functional significance of the interactions between AREs and ELAV proteins has been investigated, and a number of studies have demonstrated that ELAV proteins inhibit ARE-mediated mRNA turnover (28Fan X.C.

Previous work from our laboratory has shown that N-type NB cell lines and a subset of primary NB tumors contain abundant quantities of an ELAV family protein that bind in a specific manner to AU-rich sequence elements within the 3′-UTR of MYCN (19Chagnovich D. Cohn S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33580-33586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Chagnovich D. Fayos B.E. Cohn S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33587-33591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, others have reported that the ELAV protein HuD binds to elements within the MYCN3′-UTR (20Lazarova D.L. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that HuD is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of MYCN. The present study was undertaken to functionally characterizecis-acting elements within the MYCN 3′-UTR and to further define the role HuD plays in the post-transcriptional regulation of MYCN expression in NB. Using a series of heterologous mRNAs that span the entire MYCN 3′-UTR, we demonstrate that at least four destabilizing cis-acting elements are present in the MYCN 3′-UTR, and that fragments containing the HuD binding sites are able to signal the cellular degradation of stable heterologous mRNA. We further show that ectopic overexpression of HuD dramatically inhibits MYCNARE-mediated mRNA decay in vivo and that down-regulation of HuD in NB cells results in a significant decrease in MYCNexpression. Genomic DNA was isolated from W-N NB cells and used in a PCR to amplify the 3′-untranslated region of the MYCN gene. The forward primer 5′-GGGAGATCTCACGCTCGGACTTGCTAG-3′ with a BglII site and reverse primer 5′-GGGGAGCTCTTTAATTTTAAGCTATTTATTTTCATAAAC-3′ with aSacI site were used with Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) in a total reaction volume of 100 μl for 31 cycles in a DNA Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 45 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. The PCR product was blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) in a final volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 5 min. The amplified MYCN 3′-UTR DNA fragment was cloned into the unique BglII and SacI sites of the pBBB plasmid that contains the rabbit β-globin gene (43Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr. A. B. Shyu, M.D. Anderson, Houston, TX) immediately downstream of the translation termination codon of the β-globin coding region. The resulting construct, pBBN, contained the β-globin coding region and the MYCN 3′-UTR. Two series of chimeric constructs containing MYCN 3′-UTR fragments were also generated for this study. Short MYCN3′-UTR fragments (100–150 bp in length) were generated by PCR using forward and reverse primers at the following positions: F1, 2015–2136 bp; F2, 2115–2244 bp; F3, 2225–2356 bp; F4, 2337–2474 bp; F5, 2455–2595 bp; F6, 2575–2712 bp; F7, 2693–2824 bp; and F8, 2805–2915 bp. Both the forward and reverse primers used to amplify the fragments for series I contained BglII sites. In the first series of constructs, pBB(F1–F8)B, the MYCN 3′-UTR fragments were cloned into the unique BglII site of pBBB between the β-globin coding region and the β-globin 3′-UTR. Thus, the β-globin 3′-UTR was retained in the first series of constructs. The second series of constructs, pBB(F1–F8) contained the same set ofMYCN 3′-UTR DNA fragments. The forward primers used to generate the series II fragments contained a BglII site and the reverse primer a SacI site to facilitate cloning into the BglII/SacI sites immediately downstream of the β-globin coding region of pBBB. In the second series of constructs, the MYCN fragments replaced the entire β-globin UTR. A FLAG epitope was synthesized by using a forward primer with anNheI site (5′-CTAGCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACA-3′) and a complementary reverse primer with a HindIII site (5′-AGCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATG-3′). After annealing, the double-stranded fragment was cloned into theNheI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). HuD cDNA was generated by PCR using a forward primer with a HindIII site (5′-AGCTTATGGAGCCTCAGGTGTCAAATGG-3′) and a reverse primer with anXbaI site (5′-CTAGAATCGATTCAGGACTTGTGGGCTTTGTTGG-3′) and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 downstream of the FLAG epitope to generate an N′ FLAG-HuD fusion cDNA. Upstream, a viral ribosomal binding site was cloned into the EcoRI site to enhance the translation of the FLAG-tagged HuD protein. The orientation and sequence of the cloned cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing. The murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line (kindly provided by A. B. Shyu) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. The W-N and W-S subclones of the NBL-W NB cell line (18Foley J. Cohn S.L. Salwen H.R. Chagnovich D. Cowan J. Mason K.L. Parysek L.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6338-6345PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of pBBB, pBBN, or chimeric reporter constructs containingMYCN 3′-UTR fragments (pBB(F1–F8)B or pBB(F1–F8)) and 0.2 μg of pSV2neo (ATCC, Rockville, MD) with 10 μl of SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (600 μg/ml) (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), and resistant clones were isolated, characterized, and expanded for further study. Labeled β-globin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probes for the RNase protection assay were prepared by in vitrotranscription. The β-globin template was generated from pBBB by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TGCCAGGTGCTGACTTCTCTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGAGGTCCATGGTGATACAAGGGAC-3′. To yield the 154-nt GAPDH template, the commercially available pTRI-GAPDH-mouse antisense template (Ambion, Austin, TX) was digested with DdeI for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures consisted of 1× T7 RNA polymerase buffer, 10 mmdithiothreitol; 500 μm each ATP, CTP, and GTP; 50 μm UTP; 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mm) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), 1 μg of template DNA, 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 30 units of T7 RNA Polymerase (Promega). Reactions were stopped by the addition of RQ1, an RNase-free DNase I (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel purification over a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The 380-nt β-globin and 154-nt GAPDH probes were excised and eluted at room temperature overnight in 1× elution buffer (0.5m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS). Specific activity was measured in a scintillation counter. NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with pBBB (3T3 BBB), pBBN (3T3 BBN), pBB(F1–F8)B (3T3 BBFB), or pBB(F1–F8) (3T3 BBF) were grown to 60–70% confluence in six-well plates. The pcDNA3.1-HuD (4 μg) plasmid or empty vector (pcDNA3.1) was complexed for 10 min at room temperature with 20 μl of SuperFect transfection reagent in 150 μl of serum and antibiotic-free DMEM media, and transfections were done according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and allowed to recover overnight in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were next serum-starved in 0.5% FBS-DMEM for 24 h and stimulated with 20% FBS-DMEM as described previously (44Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, cells were harvested at various time points, and total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then treated with RQ1 DNase. The degradation or stabilization of β-globin mRNA was analyzed by T1 RNase protection as described (45Lee S.I. Murthy S.C. Trimble J.J. Desrosiers R.C. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1988; 54: 599-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 50,000 cpm of labeled antisense probe (β-globin and GAPDH) was added to 10 μg of total isolated RNA and hybridized at 40 °C for 16 h. The RNA·DNA complex was digested with an RNase A (1 mg/ml)/RNase T1 (20,000 units/ml) mixture (Ambion) at 37 °C for 45 min. The complex was then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 200 μg of Proteinase K and 2% SDS. Nucleic acids were precipitated and protected fragments were resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (8 m urea). The RNA bands were quantitated by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Sense and antisense phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to a sequence in the 5′ region of the HuD cDNA were synthesized by an automated solid-phase synthesizer (Biotech Facility, Northwestern University). Both the sense (5′-TAGCACCATGGAGCCTCAGGTGTC-3′) and antisense (5′-GACACCTGAGGCTCCATGGTGCTA-3′) sequences were specific for HuD. The oligodeoxynucleotides were added to the medium of cultured W-N cells daily at a concentration of 10 μm. Under these experimental conditions the cells remained viable and showed no evidence of toxicity. Medium was changed every 2 days. After 6 days, total RNA was extracted from sense- and antisense-treated cells, and the level of HuD expression was examined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from W-N cells treated with sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The RNA (25 ng) was subjected to real-time RT-PCR analyses using the TaqMan PCR reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 50 μl. Reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 30 min at 48 °C, 15 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles of PCR were done with DNA denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C and primer annealing and extension for 1 min at 58 °C. The gene-specific primers and probes for the MYCNtarget gene sequence and β2-microglobulin endogenous control gene for use in real-time RT-PCR have been described previously (7Cohn S.L. London W.B. Huang D. Katzenstein H.M. Salwen H.R. Reinhart T. Madafiglio J. Marshall G.M. Norris M.D. Haber M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 3604-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the sample was based on the cycle when the amplicon was first detected. A parameter, threshold cycle (CT) was defined for each PCR reaction as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescence generated by the cleavage of the sequence-specific probes passed above a fixed baseline. The expression of MYCN was normalized to β2-microglobulin message levels, and the data are expressed as the CT value relative to β2-microglobulin (β2-microglobulin CT − MYCN CT). To determine if cis-acting elements within the MYCN 3′-UTR mediate mRNA decay, the half-life of chimeric β-globin-MYCN 3′-UTR transcripts was measured. To produce the chimeric transcripts, the human MYCN 3′-UTR was subcloned into the pBBB vector in a unique BglII site within the 3′-UTR of the rabbit β-globin gene to generate pBBN (Fig.1A). pBBN was co-transfected with pSV2neo into NIH 3T3 cells and neomycin-resistant colonies were selected. Control experiments were performed with pBBB. All constructs contained the c-fos promoter, which drives transient induction of the cloned sequences with serum stimulation. Clones that expressed the chimeric β-globin-MYCN-3′-UTR transcript or the control β-globin message following serum stimulation were expanded. To measure mRNA turnover, transcription of β-globin and the chimeric β-globin-MYCN 3′-UTR mRNAs was transiently induced with 20% serum. Total RNA was isolated from cells harvested at defined time intervals, and the quantity of exogenously introduced β-globin and chimeric β-globin-MYCN 3′-UTR transcripts at each time point was analyzed by RNase protection assays using a β-globin probe. The endogenous level of GAPDH mRNA was also measured to control for amounts of RNA analyzed. As shown in Fig.1 (B and C), the chimeric β-globinMYCN-3′UTR transcript underwent rapid decay with a half-life of 80 ± 15 min, whereas no evidence of β-globin mRNA degradation was seen at 300 min. Thus, elements within theMYCN 3′-UTR are able to enhance the degradation of the stable β-globin mRNA. To identify the destabilizing cis-acting elements within the MYCN 3′-UTR, fragments (110- to 150-nt long) spanning the entire length of the 900-nt MYCN 3′-UTR were generated by PCR and cloned downstream of the β-globin coding region in pBBB to create two series of plasmid constructs for this study (Fig. 2). Fragments 1 and 8 (F1 and F8) contained the previously identified HuD binding sites (42Chagnovich D. Fayos B.E. Cohn S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33587-33591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the first series of constructs (pBB(F1–F8)B), the MYCN 3′-UTR fragments were cloned 3′ of the β-globin coding region and the β-globin 3′-UTR was retained. In the second series of constructs (pBB(F1–F8)) the β-globin 3′-UTR was replaced by the MYCN3′-UTR fragments. To investigate if the MYCN 3′-UTR fragments contained functional destabilizing elements, individual chimeric constructs were co-transfected into NIH 3T3 cells with pSV2neo. Neomycin-resistant clones were established and characterized to confirm expression of the exogenously introduced chimeric transcripts following serum stimulation. Total RNA was isolated from the transfected cells at defined time points, and the half-life of each of the chimeric transcripts was determined using RNase protection assays. In the experiments performed with the first series of chimeric transcripts, no significant change in the rate of mRNA degradation was seen compared with the β-globin control, indicating that theMYCN AREs were not sufficient to destabilize the chimeric message when the β-globin 3′-UTR was retained (TableI). However, in the absence of the β-globin 3′-UTR sequences, the turnover of four of the eight chimeric transcripts was enhanced (Table I). Interestingly, both chimeric transcripts (BBF1 and BBF8) that contained the previously identified ELAV protein binding sites (42Chagnovich D. Fayos B.E. Cohn S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33587-33591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) underwent rapid degradation (Fig.3 and Table I). In addition, a pronounced destabilization was seen with BBF5 and BBF6. In contrast, chimeric transcripts in which MYCN fragments F2, F3, F4, or F7 replaced the β-globin 3′-UTR remained stable. Thus, in addition to the previously identified ELAV-protein binding sites, theMYCN 3′-UTR contains additional destabilizingcis-acting elements within nt sites 2455–2595 (F5) and 2575–2712 (F6).Table IHalf-life of chimeric β-globin-MYCN 3′-UTR mRNAChimeric mRNAHalf-life (mean ± S.D.) without HuDHalf-life with HuDminpBBB>300ND1-aND, not done.pBBN80 ± −15>300pBBF1B>300NDpBBF2B>300NDpBBF3B>300NDpBBF4B>300NDPBBF5B>300NDpBBF6B>300NDpBBF7B>300NDpBBF8B>300NDpBBF1120 ± 14>300pBBF2>300NDpBBF3>300NDpBBF4>300NDpBBF589 ± 19No changepBBF6135 ± 15No changepBBF7>300NDpBBF882 ± 18>3001-a ND, not done.

HuD antisense oligomer treatment resulted in a more than 3-fold down-regulation of HuD expression in W-N NB cells (Fig.4A). MYCNexpression was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in the treated cells. The level of MYCN RNA was normalized to β2-microglobulin, and the data are expressed as β2-microglobulin CT -MYCN CT. As shown in the bar graph in Fig.4B, the level of MYCN expression in the W-N cells treated with the HuD antisense oligomers was almost 3-fold less than that measured in the control W-N cells treated with sense HuD oligomers. Thus, down-regulation of HuD in W-N NB cells resulted in a coordinate, significant decrease in MYCN expression. To test our hypothesis that MYCN mRNA stabilization is the functional consequence of interactions between HuD andcis-acting elements within the MYCN 3′-UTR, we overexpressed HuD in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with pBBN (3T3 BBN). A plasmid that constitutively expresses high levels of HuD was transiently transfected into 3T3 BBN cells, and ectopic expression of HuD was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Control experiments were performed with an empty expression vector. Expression of the chimeric β-globin-MYCN 3′-UTR transcript in the control and test cells was induced with serum, and total RNA was isolated from cells harvested at defined times. The RNA was subjected to RNa"

We have previously shown that apoDgene expression in cultured human fibroblasts is up-regulated when the cells undergo growth arrest. Here, we demonstrate that, starting around day 2 of growth arrest, both apoD and apoE mRNA levels increase between 1.5- and 27-fold in other cell types, including mouse primary fibroblasts and fibroblast-like and human astrocytoma cell lines. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of apoD expression, we have usedapoD promoter-luciferase reporter constructs to compare gene expression in growing cells and in cells that have undergone growth arrest. Analysis of gene expression in cells transfected with constructs with deletions and mutations in the apoDpromoter and constructs with artificial promoters demonstrated that the region between nucleotides −174 and −4 is fully responsible for the basal gene expression, whereas the region from −558 to −179 is implicated in the induction of apoD expression following growth arrest. Within this region, an alternating purine-pyrimidine stretch and a pair of serum-responsive elements (SRE) were found to be major determinants of growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression. Evidence is also presented that SREs in the apoE promoter may contribute to the up-regulation of apoE gene expression following growth arrest.

The apoD promoter region and non-coding first exon contain a number of potential regulatory and responsive elements that may be important modulators of apoD mRNA expression (20Milne R.W. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 100-106Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Lambert J. Provost P.R. Marcel Y.L. Rassart E. Biochim. Biophys.

Here, we report a functional analysis of the 5′-flanking region of theapoD gene that was designed to identify elements that are important in the induction of apoD gene expression in cells that undergo growth arrest provoked by serum deprivation. Serum deprivation and the ensuing growth arrest is believed to elicit a stress response in cells. We demonstrate that, within theapoD promoter, a pair of serum-responsive elements (SRE) and an alternating purine-pyrimidine (APP) stretch that is predicted to adopt a Z-DNA conformation, are important regulators of apoD expression in cells in growth arrest. In addition, elements within non-coding exon 1 have an inhibitory effect on apoD gene expression. The complexity of the regulation of apoD gene expression may reflect the multifunctional nature of the apoD protein. The media and supplements used for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Estradiol, used in the MCF7 adenocarcinoma cell line culture, was kindly provided by Dr. Jacques Simard (Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université Lauel Research Center, Québec). The Total RNA Extraction kit was from Qiagen (RNeasy total RNA kit, Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Radiolabeled nucleotides ([α-32P]dATP, 3000 Ci/mmol) were from ICN and Hybond-N nylon membranes for Northern blots from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. as were the restriction endonucleases. Primary murine fibroblasts were derived from C57/Bl and BALB/c mice embryos. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere and were fed every 2 days with fresh medium. Growth arrest was achieved by allowing fibroblasts (after 5–10 passages) to reach confluence (this point was called day 0 post confluence). Immortalized cell lines were obtained from ATCC, Rockville, MD (except when mentioned), and grown in the following media: mouse NIH/3T3 cells and COS cells, DMEM-10% calf serum; human 293 cells, DMEM-10% fetal calf serum; human breast cancer MCF7 cells (obtained from J. Simard), DMEM/F12K-5% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 nm estradiol; human astrocytoma U373MG cells, RPMI/1640–10% fetal calf serum; human breast cancer ZR75–1 cells (obtained by J. Simard), phenol red-free RPMI/1640–10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For the analysis of gene expression in sparsely growing cultures, cells maintained in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (5% in the case of MCF7 cultures) were harvested at 50% of confluence. For analysis of cells in growth arrest, immortalized cell lines at confluence were subjected to serum starvation. When cells reached 80% of confluence, the serum concentration was reduced from 10 to 0.2% (or 5 to 0.1% in the case of the MCF7 cultures). After 24 h, medium (containing 0.2% or 0.1% of serum) was renewed. This time point was considered as day 0 of serum starvation. Cells were kept in this medium and harvested at 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days post serum starvation when possible. For each time point, cells were trypsinized, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until all time points for a cell line were collected. For Northern blots, total RNA was extracted and denatured in formaldehyde/formamide and electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel containing MOPS (20 mm) and formaldehyde (17%) (adapted from Ref. 41Lehrach H. Diamond D. Mosney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Integrity of RNA was controlled by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. Nucleic acids were transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane and UV-fixed for 3 min. For slot blots, lyophilized RNA was resuspended in a denaturing solution containing SSC (150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), 50% formamide, and 6.5% formaldehyde. The mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 68 °C and cooled on ice before addition of 2 volumes of 20× SSC to each sample. Denatured RNA was then filtered under vacuum on a Hybond-N nylon membrane, and each well was washed with 10× SSC twice (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters were treated as for the Northern blots. The membranes were prehybridized 1 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 3× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's reagent and incubated overnight with the probe ([α-32P]dATP-labeled apoD, apoE, or β-actin cDNAs) at 42 °C in hybridizing solution, containing 50% formamide, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 3× Denhardt's reagent. Blots were rinsed for 20 min in 2× SSC at room temperature (two rinses), washed at 60 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 45 min, then rinsed in SSC at room temperature before exposure. Membranes were exposed overnight to Kodak XAR-5 X-Omat films at −80 °C with an intensifying screen (Coronex Lighting Plus, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, DE). Autoradiographs were scanned on a Personal Densitometer from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA), and optical densities were measured. For each value, the optical density measured for each apolipoprotein tested was divided by that of the β-actin mRNA. The ratio obtained from sparse cultures was given an arbitrary value of one. Heterologous luciferase (LUC) reporter gene constructs containing progressive deletions of the apoD gene 5′-flanking region were made by classic methods. The cloning of 10 kbp of upstream sequences has already been reported (40Lambert J. Provost P.R. Marcel Y.L. Rassart E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The −1176 construct was first digested by combinations of restriction endonucleases as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 to remove portions of the sequence. Position +1 corresponds to the transcription start site. The truncated apoD promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase coding region into the pXP2 promoter-less vector. Constructs −2128 and −1676 were obtained by adding, respectively, fragmentsXbaI/HindIII orEcoRV/HindIII of the 5′-flanking region ofapoD upstream to the −1176 construct.Figure 5A series of heterologousluciferase reporter constructs was made that contain progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking regions of the apoD gene. These constructs were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells, and luciferase activities were assayed 4 days after transfection in cells maintained in media with (gray bars) or without (black bars) 10% serum. Induction represents the ratio of luciferase activities of cells maintained without serum to that of cells maintained with serum. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PCR-amplified portions of the apoD promoter corresponding to the regions −816/−597, −676/−471, −548/−321, −397/−176, and −266/−51 were cloned in the correct orientation upstream of position −179 in the −179 construct, thereby, creating the deletion constructs illustrated in Fig. 5. Primer sequences for generation of the segments were as follows. The 5′ limit of each primer and the 3′ limit of the complementary primer are indicated at the left of the sequence: −816, CCT GGG TTT AAG TCC ACA CT, and −617, CTT TCT CCA CCA GAG CCA GA; −676, TTAGCCCCAGTTGTTAGAGA, and −487, CTG ACT CCA CTA ATG GGA GT; −548, GAG AAA GCC AGC TTT GAC TC, and −351, TTT TTT TGG TCA GAA TGC AC; −397, TGC AAC ACG TCC TGC TGG AA, and −206, TTT CGC GCG TGT GTG TGT GT; −266, TCT CTC GCA CAC ATA CCC AC, and −71, ACT TTT CAT GCA TGC CAC GC. Constructs containing exon 1 were made using the same approach. ApoE promoter constructs containing five or three SRE-like sequences, apoE-5SRE and apoE-3SRE, were created by cloning, respectively, SmaI/BamHI (−620 to −15) andBamHI (−366 to −15) fragments of pLIV10 plasmid (John Taylor, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA) into the pXP2 polylinker region. Constructs presented in Fig. 6 B containing permutations of one or more SRE and APP were made as follows: The APP sequence was obtained by PCR from the −558 construct using oligonucleotides −286, TCT CTC GCA CAC ATA CCC AC, and −206, TTT CGC GCG TGT GTG TGT GT. SREs were excised from the commercial plasmid p5SRE (Stratagene). Both were cloned upstream of −179 construct in pXP2 vector. The two SREs present in the apoD promoter were mutated by oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis (Table I). The GG residues of the core sequence (CCA/TN5GG) have been changed to TT as described previously (43Ding W. Witte M.M. Scott R.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 1: 3795-3802Google Scholar). Four complementary mutated primers and two vector-specific primers were used in two-step PCR. SRE1 (−474 to −465) was mutated using two complementary oligonucleotides CAT GTT CCA CTT CAT TAA ATG A and TCA TTT AAT GAA GTG GAA CAT G. SRE2 (−502 to −493) was mutated using TGA CTC CCA TTA GTT TAG TCA G and CTG ACT AAA CTA ATG GGA GTC A.

One of the oligonucleotides (GTT AAC ACT CGC GAA TAG AGA GAG AGA GAG TA) also included a segment that was complementary to sequences upstream of the APP, whereas the oligonucleotide (ATT CGC GAG TGT TAA CAA AAC AAT ATC TCA TT) included a segment that was complementary to a sequence that was downstream of the APP. The two vector-specific primers were the reverse and universal primers of pBluescript. Double and triple mutants were constructed by the same technique using sequential mutagenesis. All of theluciferase reporter constructs were sequenced to confirm that the desired mutation was present and that no other alterations had occurred. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on single-stranded plasmid templates using the Sanger method (44Sanger F. Coulson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) and T7 polymerase enzyme as recommended by the suppliers (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). NIH/3T3 and 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (45Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar) with sterile plasmids (10 μg total: 9 μg of the tested plasmid plus 1 μg of the control plasmid pRSVβGAL). Twenty-four hours later, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and culture medium was changed for medium supplemented with 10 or 0% serum. Cells were harvested 4 days after transfection for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. A time-course analysis showed that this delay was optimal for apoD expression analysis (see Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 2ApoD mRNA expression in immortalized cell lines after growth arrest caused both by serum starvation and cellular confluence. In each lane, 50 μg of total RNA was loaded. The first is RNA from growing cultures in 10% serum; the following lanes are, respectively, RNA from cultures at day 0 (i.e. serum at 0,2%), days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21. Blots were hybridized with mouse or human apoD cDNA, rat apoE cDNA, and rat β-actin cDNA as a control. Graphic representation is as in Fig. 1. The cell lines tested are: A, NIH/3T3 murine fibroblasts; B, human 293 fibroblast-like; C, COS, simian kidney cells;D, U373MG, human astrocytoma; E, MCF7, human mammary cancer cells; and F, ZR75–1, human mammary cancer cells.

Cells were then scraped with a cell lifter, transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing as described previously (46Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, lysates were stored at −20 °C. Luciferase assays were performed with a Wallac 1404 luminometer using the conditions and buffers recommended by the Luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were done as follows: each sample (30 μl) was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mm MgCl2, 45 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.88 mg/mlo-phenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Na2CO3 to a final concentration of 625 mm, and the optical density was read at 420 nm (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pSV2LUC was included as a control promoter. The results were standardized by calculating promoter activity relative to that of the co-transfected internal control plasmid pRSVβGAL. Each value is the average of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. 50 ng of sense oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with 200 ng of the complementary oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts from growing or from 4-day serum-starved NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9157) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were analyzed by gel shift assays as described previously (48Benson B.A. Jonsen M. Benedict S.H. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 170: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 5 μg of nuclear extract were added to 0.8 ng of the labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, and, after a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was run on a 6% acrylamide, non-denaturing gel in 0.5× TBE, at 150 V for 90 min. The dried gels were autoradiographed on Kodak X-Omat films. For competition assays, a 25-fold excess (20 ng) of cold double-stranded oligonucleotide was added before addition of the nuclear extract. The sense strand sequences of the oligonucleotides used are: SRE1, TGA CTC CCA TTA GTG GAG TCA G; SRE2, CAT GTT CCA CTT CAG GAA ATG A; c-fos SRE, GGA TGT CCA TAT TAG GAC ATC TGC; UNR (unrelated sequence), CCA AAC AGG ATA TCT GTA ATA AGC AG. The mutated SRE1 and SRE2 oligonucleotides, called mSRE1 and mSRE2, respectively, are identical to those used for the mutagenesis (section here above). The expression of both apoD and apoE was first analyzed in primary cell lines. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures from BALB/c and C57/Bl mice were collected in growing conditions (50% of confluence), and at different times after they reached confluence. For both strains, apoD mRNA expression was very low in growing cells and reached a peak at day 4 of growth arrest (Fig.1). There was no apoE mRNA expression in sparse culture and detectable expression appeared at day 4 in BALB/c and in C57/Bl primary fibroblasts, although apoE expression was much lower in the latter. Immortalized cell lines were also tested for apoD and apoE expression in growth arrest. In murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.2), the expression pattern was very similar to that of the primary mouse fibroblasts, reaching a peak at day 10 with a 15-fold induction. ApoE expression was quite similar to that observed in C57/Bl fibroblasts. Several other cell lines were also tested but, to better quantify apoD and apoE mRNA expression, total RNA from various cell lines were slot-blotted and expression of apoD and apoE relative to β-actin gene expression was measured on a densitometer (Fig. 2). In ATCC 293 human fibroblast-like cells, both apoD and apoE expression increased continuously to reach a 5-fold induction by day 21 of growth arrest. In COS cells (Fig. 2),apoD gene expression increased by 3- and 12-fold at 4 and 10 days, respectively, after growth arrest. ApoE expression in COS cells showed a similar response to serum deprivation. We also measured mRNA expression in several cancer cell lines. ApoD expression has been detected in mammary carcinomas (34Díèez-Itza I. Vizoso F. Merino A.M. Sanchez L.M. Tolivia J. Fernandez J. Rubial A. Lopez-Otin C. Am. J.

Differential display analysis of gene expression revealed consistent and reproducible overexpression of a transcript in the transformed cells compared with the nontransformed cells. The full-length cDNA corresponding to the differentially expressed transcript was cloned and was identified as mouse translation elongation factor-1 δ subunit (TEF-1δ; GenBankTMaccession number AF304351). Nucleotide sequence analysis of TEF-1δ cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding the predicted protein of 281 amino acids and exhibited significant conservation with the corresponding protein of human, Xenopus laevis, and Artemia.

Cadmium is ranked seventh on the “Top 20 Hazardous Substances Priority List” by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1Fay R.M. Mumtaz M.M. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1996; 34: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Significant quantities of cadmium compounds are used in various industries (2Friberg L. Kjellstrom T. Nordberg G.F. Friberg L. Nordberg G.F. Vouk V. Handbook of the Toxicology of Metals. Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam1986: 130-237Google Scholar), and a large number of workers are potentially exposed to toxic levels of the metal (3Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P. Barter R.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Waalkes M.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 79: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Furthermore, large quantities of this highly toxic metal are detected in the atmosphere, as well as in food and water, that result in nonoccupational exposure in humans (3Waalkes M.P. Coogan T.P.

Cadmium compounds have been detected in significant quantities in the tissues and various organs of individuals exposed to the metal, and the toxicological responses of exposure to cadmium include kidney damage, respiratory diseases, and neurologic disorders (3Waalkes M.P.

Med. 1983; 40: 293-300PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sorahan T. Br. J. Ind. Med. 1987; 44: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium as a type I human carcinogen based on experimental and epidemiological evidence documenting its carcinogenic potential (9Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 10International Agency for Research on CancerBeryllium, Cadmium, Mercury and Exposures in the Glass Manufacturing Industry. 58. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1993: 119-238Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for cadmium-induced malignant transformation are not known. We are conducting studies to test the hypothesis that cadmium-induced deregulation of expression of cancer-related genes may account for the cell transformation and carcinogenesis induced by this industrially and environmentally important metal. Recently, we have reported that the proto-oncogenes, c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, are overexpressed in Balb/c-3T3 cells morphologically transformed with CdCl2 (11Joseph P. Muchnok T.K. Klishis M.L. Roberts J.R. Antonini J.M. Whong W-Z. Ong T.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 61: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed differential display analysis of gene expression to investigate the involvement of novel cadmium-responsive genes in the cell transformation and tumorigenesis brought about by this carcinogenic metal.

Furthermore, we provide evidence for the oncogenic potential of TEF-1δ by its transfection-mediated overexpression, resulting in transformation of NIH3T3 cells and tumorigenesis in nude mice. The oncogenic potential of the CdCl2 transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells was reversed significantly by expression of the antisense TEF-1δ mRNA.

Zhou G. Hubbs A.F. Ensell M-X. Ong T.M. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, early passages of Balb/c-3T3 cells exhibiting contact inhibition were treated with 6–12 μmCdCl2 for 72 h, and the transformed foci were isolated. Cell lines derived from these foci were confirmed for their tumorigenic potential in nude mouse and were grown in minimum essential medium (Sigma) containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Total RNA, free from DNA, was isolated from the nontransformed cells, spontaneously transformed cells, and the CdCl2-transformed cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The purity and integrity of the RNA isolated were determined by UV absorbance spectrophotometry and by agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Restriction fragment differential display-polymerase chain reaction (RFDD-PCR) was employed to analyze gene expression in nontransformed and transformed cells. The RFDD-PCR was done using the Display ProfileTM kit (Display Systems Biotech, Vista, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from RNA was digested withTaqI restriction enzyme and was ligated to specifically constructed DNA adaptors of the Display ProfileTM kit. The DNA templates thus prepared were subsequently PCR-amplified using Cy5-labeled 5′-primer in combination with each of the 64 display probe primers of the kit, facilitating amplification of ∼25,000 distinct cDNA fragments (Display Systems Biotech). The amplified cDNA was size fractionated by 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, gels were scanned with a Storm Fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Differentially expressed cDNA fragments were excised and eluted from the gel and PCR-reamplified using the original set of primers used in RFDD-PCR. PCR-reamplified cDNA was subcloned into the TA cloning vector of the TOPOTM TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Differential expression of the TEF-1δ cDNA fragment in the nontransformed and the transformed cells was confirmed by Northern hybridization analysis following standard procedures (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.58Google Scholar). The differentially expressed TEF-1δ cDNA fragment was labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by random prime labeling and was used as the probe for hybridization. The hybridized target gene was detected using the DIG-easy detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the procedure provided by the manufacturer. The full-length cDNA of TEF-1δ was cloned by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, using the SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. TEF-1δ cDNA-specific primers used in the RACE cloning procedure were designed using the Gene Runner software (Hastings Software Inc., Hastings, NY) based on the DNA sequence of the differentially expressed cDNA fragment isolated from the RFDD-PCR gel. The sequences of the primers used in the RACE cloning are as follows: 5′-RACE, 5′-GCAGGTCCTCACACACATGAAACCACACTC-3′; 3′-RACE, 5′-GCAGCTTTCGACAAGATCTGAATGTCCGAGAG-3′. The 5′- and 3′-RACE products synthesized were directly cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA sequence of the RACE products was determined using T3 and T7 sequencing primers, and the data were analyzed to confirm that the sequence was same as the original cDNA fragment that was differentially expressed in the cell lines. The 5′- and 3′-RACE products were digested with the restriction enzyme,BspMI, and the resulting fragments were ligated to obtain the full-length cDNA. DNA sequencing of the TEF-1δ cDNA at various stages of its isolation and cloning was done with an ABI PRISM automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA sequence homology searches were conducted using the BLASTN program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). The open reading frame of the TEF-1δ cDNA was fused in frame with the V5 epitope and His6 tag of the expression vector, pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The nucleotide sequence, 5′-CACC-3′, was added 5′ to the start codon of the cDNA, and the stop codon was removed. Plasmid DNA prepared using Qiagen maxi preparation kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary and monkey kidney COS7 cells by the calcium phosphate procedure (CLONTECH). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in medium containing G418 (200–400 μg/ml), and cell lines were developed individually from surviving colonies. Overexpression of the cDNA-encoded protein was determined by Western blot analysis using antibody for the V5 epitope of the fusion protein. The fusion protein cross-reacting with the V5 epitope antibody was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). NIH3T3 cells exhibiting contact inhibition (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected with the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO expression vector containing the entire open reading frame of TEF-1δ cDNA by the CaPO4 procedure (CLONTECH). The transfected cells were allowed to grow in control growth medium for 4–6 weeks for the development of transformed foci. Cell lines were developed from several independent transformed foci, and expression of TEF-1δ mRNA was determined by real time quantitative PCR using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequences of the primers used to amplify TEF-1δ for the real time PCR analysis were as follows: 5′-AATTGGACGGGCTGGTTTGG-3′ and 5′-AGCAAGTCGGTGCCCACTTTG-3′. Tumorigenic potential of the transformed cells was determined from their ability to grow as anchorage-independent colonies on soft agar (14Nanni P. Pupa S.M. Nicoletti G., De Giovanni C. Landuzzi L. Rossi I. Astolfi A. Ricci C., De Vecchi R. Invernizzi A.M., Di Carlo E. Musiani P. Forni G. Menard S. Lollini P. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as well as to grow as subcutaneous tumors in athymic nude mice. For the nude mouse tumorigenesis assay, 2 × 106cells were subcutaneously injected per mouse, and the animals were observed for a maximum period of 2 months for the development of tumors. Procedures using mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were done according to institutional policies and regulations including the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The TEF-1δ cDNA was subcloned in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vector in the reverse (3′–5′) orientation to construct the antisense plasmid (TEF-1δ-AS). Subcloning of the TEF-1δ cDNA in the reverse orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis analysis of the digested plasmid DNA. Balb/c-3T3 cells morphologically transformed with CdCl2 and overexpressing TEF-1δ were transfected with the antisense plasmid DNA. Stable transfectants were selected using G418 at a concentration of 400 μg/ml, a dose that causes 100% death of the untransfected cells. Since antibody for TEF-1δ protein was not available, efficacy of the antisense mRNA to block the translation of TEF-1δ mRNA could not be assessed. However, expression of the antisense TEF-1δ mRNA in the G418-resistant cells was analyzed by RT-PCR using one primer specific for the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector sequence downstream to the putative transcription start and the other primer for the TEF-1δ mRNA in the antisense orientation. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: 5′-CTGGCTTATCGAAATTAATACG-3′ and 5′-TACCGGGTCGATCTCTGAAC-3′. RT-PCR amplification of a transcript of 300 nucleotides is considered as the proof for the expression of TEF-1δ antisense mRNA. Reversal of the oncogenic potential of the transformed cells expressing TEF-1δ antisense mRNA was assessed on the basis of their ability to grow as anchorage-independent colonies on soft agar as well as subcutaneous tumors in immunodeficient nude mice as described above. Statistical significance of the data presented as mean ± S.E. was analyzed by Student's ttest or by one-way analysis of variance. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results of the differential display analysis of gene expression revealed differential expression of several genes in the cadmium-transformed cells compared with the nontransformed cells (data not shown). Consistent and reproducible overexpression of a 125-bp-long cDNA fragment in the cadmium-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells compared with the nontransformed cells was noticed (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of DNA sequence of the differentially expressed cDNA fragment showed marked similarity to human TEF-1δ. Northern hybridization of the differentially expressed cDNA fragment to RNA isolated from control and transformed cells detected a transcript of ∼1.0 kb that was found overexpressed in the transformed cells. Furthermore, overexpression of the transcript was detected in 100% of the transformed cell lines (10 of 10) that were developed from individual transformed foci (Fig. 1 B). Similar overexpression of the transcript was also observed in the cell lines derived from tumors developed in nude mice injected subcutaneously with the cadmium-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells (data not presented). Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment by BLASTN analysis of NCBI identified the differentially expressed cDNA as TEF-1δ. Cloning the full-length cDNA by SMART-RACE technique resulted in isolation of a 5′-RACE product consisting of 956 nucleotides and a 3′-RACE product consisting of 109 nucleotides. Subsequent restriction enzyme digestion of the 5′- and 3′-RACE products and ligation of the digested DNA fragments resulted in cloning the full-length cDNA consisting of 1004 nucleotides. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed a reading frame encoding for the predicted protein consisting of 281 amino acids (the nucleotide and amino acid sequences that are not presented here are available in the GenBankTM, accession number AF304351). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a leucine zipper (Fig. 2). Transfection of monkey kidney COS7 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells with pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid containing the entire reading frame for the TEF-1δ cDNA resulted in the expression of a protein with an approximate molecular mass of 31 kDa (Fig. 3).Figure 3Transfection and expression of mouse TEF-1δ cDNA in mammalian cells.Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected either with the vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO alone (+Vector) or with the vector containing the entire open reading frame of TEF-1δ cDNA (+TEF) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysates prepared from the cells were analyzed for expression of the fusion protein by Western blotting using antibody for the V5 epitope. The actual size of the fusion protein cross-reacting with the antibody is ∼34.2 kDa, of which 3.6 kDa corresponds to the V5 epitope and the polyhistidine region derived from the vector. TEF3, TEF6, and TEF14 are three different cell lines permanently expressing the TEF-1δ-V5 epitope fusion protein.

Overexpression of the cDNA-encoded protein, furthermore, resulted in morphological transformation of NIH3T3 cells as evidenced by the appearance of transformed foci (Fig. 4, B and C). The oncogenic potential of the transformed foci was confirmed by anchorage-independent growth of cell lines derived from the foci (Fig.5 A). Similarly, these cells also exhibited tumorigenic potential as evidenced by their development to subcutaneous tumors in nude mice (Fig. 5,B and C).Figure 5Oncogenic potential of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing mouse translation elongation factor-1δ. NIH3T3 cells were transfected either with the vector pcDNA 3.1D/V5-His-TOPO alone (Vector) or with the vector containing the TEF-1δ cDNA (TEF) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transfected cells were tested for their capacity to grow as anchorage-independent colonies on soft agar (A) as well as for their potential to grow as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice (B andC).

Transfection of the cells with the pcDNA 3.1 vector either alone or containing the TEF-1δ cDNA in the antisense orientation provided protection to the cells from the cytotoxicity of G418 as evidenced by the absence of cell death in the transfected cells. Thus, the ability to grow in medium containing G418 was considered as an indication for the presence and the subsequent expression of the plasmid DNA in the transfected cells. Results of RT-PCR analysis detected the antisense transcript of TEF-1δ in the cells transfected with the antisense plasmid DNA (Fig.6 A). Expression of the antisense RNA against TEF-1δ mRNA in the CdCl2-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells overexpressing TEF-1δ resulted in a significant reversal of the oncogenic potential of the cells. This was evidenced by a 40% decrease in the number of anchorage-independent colonies growing on soft agar (Fig.6 B) as well as by the significant decline in the tumorigenic potential in nude mice injected with the cells (Fig. 6 C). In addition to a significant delay in the onset and visual appearance of tumors, a significant reduction in size of the tumors was also observed in the mice injected with the TEF-1δ antisense mRNA-expressing cells compared with the corresponding controls (Fig.6 D). Alterations in the expression of genes, especially those regulating the cell cycle, are critical in the development of malignant transformation (15Vogelstein B. Kinzler R.W.

Modifications in the translational machinery of cells, including changes in both eukaryotic translation initiation factors and elongation factors, can also result in susceptibility to transformation and the acquisition of transformed and oncogenic properties by cells (17Riis B.

Results of this study that agree with these reports indicate that alteration in expression of the translation elongation factors, including mouse TEF-1δ, contribute to cell transformation and cancer development.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have cloned and characterized the mouse TEF-1δ cDNA, and comparison of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence revealed that the mouse TEF-1δ cDNA exhibits the highest similarity to human TEF-1δ cDNA, 92 and 76% similarity to the amino acid and to the nucleotide sequence, respectively. The open reading frames of both mouse and human TEF-1δ cDNAs possess 843 nucleotides encoding for the predicted peptide consisting of 281 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 31 kDa. Similar to human TEF-1δ, mouse TEF-1δ also possesses an EF-1β conserved domain, an EF-1 guanine nucleotide exchange domain, and a leucine zipper motif. Similarity between the mouse TEF-1δ and human TEF-1δ proteins is more conserved in the C terminus, especially in the EF-1β domain and in the guanine nucleotide exchange domain. With the exception of the leucine zipper region, the N-terminal sequence is less conserved between human and mouse TEF-1δ. A similar observation has been reported for TEF-1δ protein of human, Xenopus, andArtemia (25Sanders J. Raggiaschi R. Morales J. Moller W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Results of the various experiments conducted in the present study have clearly demonstrated that TEF-1δ is a cellular proto-oncogene. Significant overexpression of TEF-1δ was observed in all (10 of 10) CdCl2-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cell lines analyzed. Similar overexpression of TEF-1δ was also observed when these cells were injected into nude mice and cell lines were developed from the tumors (data not presented). Further evidence for the oncogenic potential of TEF-1δ is obtained from experiments involving NIH3T3 cell transformation. Transformation of NIH3T3 cells in conjunction with nude mouse tumorigenesis assay is a very well established procedure to confirm the oncogenic potential of genes (27Su Z. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with the expression plasmid containing TEF-1δ cDNA resulted in overexpression of the encoded protein and this was associated with cell transformation as evidenced by the appearance of transformed foci. The oncogenic potential of TEF-1δ-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells was further confirmed by their potential for anchorage-independent growth on soft agar and for tumorigenesis in nude mice. Furthermore, blocking the translation of TEF-1δ mRNA with its antisense mRNA resulted in significant reversal of the oncogenic potential of the CdCl2-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells. These results suggest that the overexpression of TEF-1δ was in fact the causative factor for CdCl2-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis rather than simply being a consequence of the metal-induced malignant transformation. Despite the data presented in this paper documenting the involvement of elevated expression of TEF-1δ in the cadmium-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis, neither the mechanisms of its overexpression nor those responsible for the resulting malignant transformation are known. In general, cadmium-induced deregulation of gene expression is mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (11Joseph P. Muchnok T.K. Klishis M.L. Roberts J.R. Antonini J.M. Whong W-Z. Ong T.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 61: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), alterations in cellular calcium levels (11Joseph P. Muchnok T.K. Klishis M.L. Roberts J.R. Antonini J.M.

Teratol. 1987; 3: 407-416Google Scholar). Whether any of the aforementioned mechanisms are actually involved in the cadmium-induced up-regulation of transcription of TEF-1δ is open for investigation. Results of previous studies have shown that qualitative and quantitative changes in expression of translation elongation factors, in general, are responsible for their role in carcinogenesis. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations of EF-1α lead to loss of proofreading potential, resulting in translational infidelity (31Carr-Schmid A. Durko N. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30297-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Song J.M. Picologlou S. Grant C.M. Firoozan M. Tuite M.F. Liebamn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4571-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that is known to result in carcinogenesis (33Cavallius J. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Exp. Gerontol. 1986; 21: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The reported involvement of elongation factors in senescence and mitosis may also be relevant in understanding their proposed role in chemical carcinogenesis. In Drosophila melanogaster, for example, the cellular level and catalytic activity of EF-1α are lower during senescence (34Gopalakrishnan R.V., Su, Z-Z. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and forced expression of EF-1α results in extension of life span compared with control flies (35Sheperd J.C.W. Waldorf U. Hug P. Gehring W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7520-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that overexpression of elongation factors can result in a proliferative response that is characteristic of cell transformation during chemical carcinogenesis. This is further supported by the role of elongation factors in cell division through their association with the mitotic spindle apparatus (36Edmonds B.T. Wyckoff J. Yeung Y.G. Wang Y. Stanly E.R. Jones J. Segall J. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 109: 2705-2714Google Scholar). Thus, in summary, our results demonstrate that TEF-1δ is a novel cellular proto-oncogene, although the actual cellular/molecular mechanisms responsible for its oncogenic function need to be clarified. The results of our study may have potential clinical value. It may be worth exploring the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of our results demonstrating the role of TEF-1δ overexpression in cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by CdCl2. This will involve studies designed to clarify whether the overexpression of TEF-1δ is unique to cadmium-induced carcinogenesis or is a general feature of any malignant transformation. A positive correlation between the overexpression of TEF-1δ and the incidence of tumorigenesis may facilitate the use of TEF-1δ overexpression as a diagnostic indicator or as a biological marker for carcinogenesis. The observation that expression of the antisense TEF-1δ mRNA could reverse the tumorigenic potential of the CdCl2-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells is of potential therapeutic value. Intervention of TEF-1δ overexpression may represent an effective approach for the therapy of tumors overexpressing TEF-1δ.

https://openalex.org/W2026413350,"Using the established quail cell line Q/d3 conditionally transformed by the v-jun oncogene, cDNA clones (TOJ2, TOJ3, TOJ5, TOJ6) were isolated by representational difference analysis (RDA) that correspond to genes which were induced immediately upon conditional activation of v-jun. One of these genes, TOJ3, is immediately and specifically activated after doxycycline-mediated v-jun induction, with kinetics similar to the induction of well characterized direct AP-1 target genes. TOJ3 is neither activated upon conditional activation of v-myc, nor in cells or cell lines non-conditionally transformed by oncogenes other than v-jun. Sequence analysis revealed that the TOJ3-specific cDNA encodes a 530-amino acid protein with significant sequence similarities to the murine or human microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1, MSP58), a nucleolar protein that directly interacts with the ICP22 regulatory protein from herpes simplex virus 1 or with p120, a proliferation-related protein expressed at high levels in most human malignant tumor cells. Similar to its mammalian counterparts, the TOJ3 protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization motif and a forkhead associated domain (FHA). Using polyclonal antibodies directed against a recombinant amino-terminal TOJ3 protein segment, the activation of TOJ3 in jun-transformed fibroblasts was also demonstrated at the protein level by specific detection of a polypeptide with an apparent M(r) of 65 000. Retroviral expression of the TOJ3 gene in quail or chicken embryo fibroblasts induces anchorage-independent growth, indicating that the immediate activation of TOJ3 in fibroblasts transformed by the v-jun oncogene contributes to cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2008054158,"Ded1 is a fission yeast DEAD box protein involved in translation. We isolated Ded1 in a screen for multi-copy suppressors of a cold-sensitive, loss-of-function mutant of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2. The checkpoint protein kinase Chk1, required for cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, was also isolated in this screen. Ded1 interacts with Chk1 in a two-hybrid screen, and this physical interaction can be recapitulated inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. The Ded1 polypeptide is modified in response to heat shock and depletion of carbon source. These two stressors appear to cause different modifications. Thus, the Ded1 protein appears to respond to particular types of cellular stress and may influence the activity of Cdc2 as a result. Ded1 is a fission yeast DEAD box protein involved in translation. We isolated Ded1 in a screen for multi-copy suppressors of a cold-sensitive, loss-of-function mutant of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2.

The Ded1 polypeptide is modified in response to heat shock and depletion of carbon source. These two stressors appear to cause different modifications. Thus, the Ded1 protein appears to respond to particular types of cellular stress and may influence the activity of Cdc2 as a result. hemagglutinin camptothecin Cdc2, a universally conserved protein kinase, is the primary cyclin-dependent kinase that regulates progression through the cell cycle in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (1Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Cdc2 is subject to regulation at multiple levels, including association with a cyclin subunit and phosphorylation at several sites that confer activation or inhibition (2Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Association with a B-type cyclin such as the one encoded by fission yeastcdc13 is critical for Cdc2 activity, as is phosphorylation on a threonine residue (Thr167). Cdc2 is maintained in an inactive state by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue at position 15 by the kinases Wee1 and Mik1. Activation of Cdc2 at the time of mitotic entry is achieved via dephosphorylation of tyrosine 15 by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Cdc25. Elimination of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2 causes cells to enter a catastrophic mitosis (3Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). This can be achieved in fission yeast by creating a strain in which the nonessential mik1 gene is disrupted and a temperature-sensitive allele of wee1 is inactivated by incubating cells at the restrictive temperature (Ref. 4Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1A). Even cells that are blocked in S phase because of depletion of nucleotide pools by treatment with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea will enter mitosis if Mik1 and Wee1 function are simultaneously lost. The phenotype of mitotic catastrophe caused by loss of Mik1 and Wee1 function can be suppressed by a conditional, cold-sensitive, loss-of-function allele ofcdc2, known as cdc2-r4 (4Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In an effort to further our understanding of Cdc2 regulation inS. pombe, a multi-copy plasmid library was introduced into the cdc2-r4 strain to identify multi-copy suppressors of the cold-sensitive phenotype. The protein kinase Chk1, which plays a critical role in the checkpoint response to DNA damage, was identified in this screen (5Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, a plasmid encompassing a gene,ded1, with homology to the DEAD box family of RNA helicases conferred suppression. The amino acid sequence aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, and aspartic acid (dEAD) is characteristic of this family of proteins. Members of this family have been proposed to carry out functions ranging from splicing to chromatin remodeling to translational initiation (6de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The most closely related homologue ofded1 in the budding yeast is DED1, which has been shown to be important in initiation of translation (7de la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Chuang R.Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recently,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ded1 has been shown to possess RNA helicase activity (9Iost I. Dreyfus M. Linder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In both yeasts, ded1/DED1is essential (data not shown and Ref. 10Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8587-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The S. pombe ded1 gene subsequently emerged from a number of genetic screens (11Grallert B. Kearsey S.E. Lenhard M. Carlson C.R. Nurse P. Boye E. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Forbes K.C. Humphrey T. Enoch T.

Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1361-1375PubMed Google Scholar) identifiedded1 (sum3) in a screen for dosage suppressors of the lethality caused by overexpression of Cdc25 in the presence of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea. Kawamukai (13Kawamukai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) identified ded1 (moc2) in a screen for dosage suppressors of sterile S. pombe mutants. The ded1gene suppressed a strain in which sterility resulted from elevated levels of cAMP, as well as a strain in which sterility resulted from deregulated Ras function. Finally, Grallert et al.(11Grallert B. Kearsey S.E. Lenhard M. Carlson C.R. Nurse P. Boye E. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified mutant alleles of ded1 in two different genetic screens. In one, cold-sensitive ded1 alleles suppressed the temperature-sensitive loss of function ofcdc19, an MCM protein family member. In a separate screen, temperature-sensitive alleles of ded1 were identified that caused cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, inactivation of ded1 causes arrest of cells at two points in the cell cycle, with either a 1 or a 2 n DNA content, reminiscent of the phenotype of cdc2 mutants. In a two-hybrid screen to search for proteins that interact with Chk1 (14Chen L. Liu T.-H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we identified the gene encoding Ded1. Thus, two proteins that independently confer survival on a mutant lacking Cdc2 function are able to physically interact with one another. High copy suppression of the cdc2-r4 mutant uncovered a checkpoint response protein as well as a translation factor. The DNA damage checkpoint pathway clearly impinges on cell cycle control through the regulation of Cdc2. Ded1 is an essential gene, the loss of function of which leads to cell cycle arrest in a manner that is reminiscent of cells lacking Cdc2 function (11Grallert B. Kearsey S.E. Lenhard M. Carlson C.R. Nurse P. Boye E. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the Ded1 polypeptide is responsive to stress conditions that affect translation and that could impact on cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the modified form of Ded1 that is generated in response to heat shock stress is still found in cells with mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase stress response signal transduction pathway, suggesting that the Ded1 response is independent of that pathway or operates upstream of it. The S. pombestrains used in this study are listed in TableI. The cells were grown in YEA medium (15Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar) at 30 °C except as described.

Millar Open table in a new tab The genomic ded1 gene was first cloned from a pWH5-based genomic library in a screen of multicopy suppressors ofcdc2-r4 described elsewhere (5Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A 3-kbHindIII/NsiI fragment was cloned into the pSP1 vector (16Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at the HindIII and PstI sites and was shown to suppress the cold sensitivity of cdc2-r4. Genomic alleles of cdc2 and cdc13 used incdc2-r4 rescue experiments were also cloned in pSP1. The full-length chk1 plasmid and protocol for the two-hybrid screen were described previously (14Chen L. Liu T.-H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing an N-terminally truncated allele of the ded1 cDNA was identified from the two-hybrid screen with Chk1 (14Chen L. Liu T.-H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resulting protein lacks the first 170 amino acids of Ded1. The full-lengthded1 cDNA was isolated from an S. pombecDNA library and amplified by PCR for cloning into pACT. For overexpression of ded1, the cDNA was cloned into the pREP81 vector containing the thiamine-repressible nmt1promoter at the NdeI and SalI sites. To induce expression, yeast bearing the plasmid were grown on minimal medium containing thiamine to mid-log phase, washed three times in thiamine-free medium, and then resuspended in medium without thiamine for 18–22 h. For the cell cycle synchronization experiment, a temperature-sensitive cdc25-22 strain was used. Mid-log phase cells were arrested for 4 h at 36 °C and then shifted to 25 °C. Aliquots were taken every 20 min for the preparation of lysates and for fixation and staining with Calcofluor (Sigma-Aldrich) to determine the septation index. The full-lengthded1 cDNA was cloned in-frame into the pGEX-3X vector at the BamHI site. The resulting glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was purified on and eluted from glutathione-Sepharose, as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Soluble protein was used to generate rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cocalico Biologicals). For Western blot analysis of total cell extracts, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 684Google Scholar) using glass beads. The cells were broken using the FastPrep machine (Bio101, Savant) at a setting of 6.5 for two bursts of 15 s. Following a 3,000 rpm spin in a microcentrifuge for 2 min, the supernatant was collected for protein determination using the Bradford assay method (Bio-Rad). Aliquots were run on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, BA83), and probed with antibody. Blocking of the membranes and all antibody incubations and washes were done with 1% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences were used to detect the immune complexes. The polyclonal Ded1 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:50,000. HA-tagged1 Chk1 (18Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) was detected with 12CA5 antibody to the HA epitope at a 1:1000 dilution. Cdc2 was detected with anti-PSTAIRE antibody (Santa Cruz). For immunoblotting of Cdc13 protein, lysates were prepared in 8m urea and boiled in water for 5 min before lysing with glass beads as described above. The antibody to Cdc13 (SP4) was generously provided by Sergio Moreno (University of Salamanca). For heat shock treatment, the cells were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C and then transferred to a preheated 42 °C water bath for the time indicated. The cells were either collected by centrifugation or returned to 30 °C for the time indicated before harvesting. To test the response to osmotic stress, mid-log phase cells were washed once in rich medium containing either 5m KCl or 1 m sorbitol, resuspended in the same medium, and incubated for the time indicated. For nutrient starvation cells were grown to mid-log phase in minimal medium. Cells harvested by centrifugation were washed twice and then resuspended in minimal medium lacking either nitrogen source or carbon source (15Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). The cultures were incubated for the time indicated and harvested by centrifugation, and lysates were made as described above. For exposure to DNA damage generated by camptothecin (CPT), cells were grown to mid-log phase, then 40 μm CPT was added, and incubation was continued for 3 h. Camptothecin lactone was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. CPT was dissolved in Me2SO to 10 mm, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. For exposure to UV light, mid-log phase cells were plated on rich medium and exposed to 100 J/m2 of UV light, collected from the plate, and then incubated for 30 min in liquid culture before harvesting. To block DNA replication, mid-log phase cells were exposed to 12 mm hydroxyurea for 2 h and then harvested. To generate oxidative stress, mid-log phase cells were incubated in 5 mmH2O2 for 30 min and then harvested. To block protein synthesis, the cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30, 60, or 120 min prior to heat shock treatment. Suppression of mitotic catastrophe conferred by the loss of Mik1 and Wee1 function can be achieved with a mutation incdc2 (Ref. 4Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar and Fig.1A). The cdc2-r4allele was cloned by PCR and sequenced. The only mutation incdc2-r4 is a G to A nucleotide change resulting in an amino acid change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 90. Interestingly, the same cold-sensitive mutant allele of cdc2was uncovered in an independent genetic screen for suppressors of mitotic catastrophe caused by the overexpression of cdc25 in combination with a temperature-sensitive wee1-50 allele (19Ayscough K. Hayles J. MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The histone H1 kinase activity of the Cdc2D90N protein is reduced relative to wild-type Cdc2 protein when assayed at a permissive (29 °C) or nonpermissive (20 °C) temperature (19Ayscough K. Hayles J. MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify additional regulators of the Cdc2 cell cycle control pathway, we looked for dosage suppressors of the cold-sensitivecdc2-r4 allele (Fig. 1A and “Experimental Procedures”). Plasmids that allowed the cdc2-r4 strain to form colonies at 18 °C were recovered and sequenced. One plasmid encoded the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk1 (5Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Another gene, originally dubbed soc1 (for suppressorof cdc2) but now calledded1, encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. In addition, a plasmid containing the cdc13 gene confers very good suppression as measured by colony formation (data not shown). To test whether the ability of ded1 to rescue the cold-sensitive phenotype of cdc2-r4 was acting through the chk1 pathway, plasmids were introduced into acdc2-r4 chk1::ura4 strain and tested for growth at 20 °C. The ability of ded1 to support colony formation in this strain background was variable (data not shown). Therefore, we used an alternative method to evaluate suppression. The cdc2-r4 and cdc2-r4 chk1::ura4 strains were transformed with plasmids containing genomic alleles of cdc2,cdc13, ded1, or chk1 or vector alone. Transformants were grown in liquid culture, and aliquots were plated. The plates were incubated at 20 °C for various periods of time and then transferred to the permissive temperature of 30 °C to allow colony formation. This assay measures the ability of the plasmids to allow the strains to survive exposure to restrictive temperature. As shown in Fig. 1B, Ded1, Chk1, and Cdc13 all rescue with about the same efficiency. Furthermore, Ded1 and Cdc13 rescue ofcdc2-r4 does not require Chk1 function (Fig.1B). The B-type cyclin Cdc13 is periodically synthesized and destroyed during the cell cycle. S. pombe Ded1 is a putative RNA helicase that may play an important role in protein translation. We therefore considered the possibility that increased expression of Ded1 rescued cdc2-r4 indirectly by increasing the level of Cdc13 protein. Indeed, Grallert et al. (11Grallert B. Kearsey S.E.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that loss of Ded1 function in S. pombe results in a preferential reduction in the amount of Cdc13 as compared with bulk proteins. Levels of Cdc13 are also disproportionately sensitive to inactivation of another DEAD box helicase, the translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) homologue of fission yeast, Tif1 (20Daga R.R. Jimenez J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3137-3146PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Ded1 might rescue cdc2-r4 by increasing the amount of Cdc13 protein in the cell, we made lysates of cdc2-r4 strains transformed with plasmids to express Ded1, Cdc13, Cdc2, and Chk1 and measured the amount of Cdc13 in the cells by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 1C, neither expression of Chk1 nor Ded1 affects Cdc13 levels. The fact that Ded1 and Chk1 both rescue the cold-sensitive phenotype ofcdc2-r4 might indicate that they participate on a common pathway. In a search for proteins that interact with Chk1, we identified a clone that expresses a truncated allele of Ded1 that is missing the first 170 amino acids. Full-length Ded1 fused to the Gal4 activation domain interacts with a Chk1-Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion as well (Fig. 2A). Using a series of truncated versions of Chk1 that separate the conserved kinase domain from the C-terminal noncatalytic domain, we determined that Ded1 interacts with the noncatalytic domain of Chk1. Furthermore, the N-terminal, nonhelicase domain of Ded1 is not required for this interaction. To confirm that Chk1 and Ded1 can interact in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. When Ded1 and HA-tagged Chk1 were expressed in single copy from the genome, no reproducible interaction could be detected. Failure to observe an interaction may be the result of the low abundance of Chk1 in fission yeast. Therefore, we employed a multi-copy vector (pSP1 (16Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) to increase expression of HA-tagged Chk1 ∼20-fold (data not shown). When Chk1 was immunoprecipitated from these cells with antibody to the HA epitope, Ded1 was found to co-precipitate by immunoblot (Fig.2B). Thus, Ded1 and Chk1 are capable of interacting in fission yeast cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that Chk1 is phosphorylated following DNA damage (18Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Wan S. Capasso H. Walworth N.C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 821-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, two forms of Chk1 are present in cells treated with the topoisomerase I poison CPT. Chk1 association with the 14-3-3 protein Rad24 is stimulated by DNA damage (14Chen L. Liu T.-H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, the association of Ded1 with Chk1 was not significantly affected by DNA damage (Fig.2B). Furthermore, no change in mobility or abundance of Ded1 is apparent after DNA damage. Standard genetic procedures were used to generate a disrupted allele ofded1 in a diploid. Tetrad analysis indicates thatded1 is an essential gene (data not shown and Ref. 13Kawamukai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ded1 causes cell elongation (Ref. 12Forbes K.C. Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1361-1375PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown) similar to the effect of overexpression ofchk1 (5Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, cells tolerate overexpression ofded1, whereas overexpression of chk1 is lethal. To test whether chk1 function is required forded1 to cause cell elongation, ded1 was overexpressed in a chk1 disruption strain. No visible difference between wild-type andchk1::ura4 cells was observed whended1 was overexpressed (data not shown). To determine whether the abundance or mobility of Ded1 varies during the cell cycle, a synchronous culture of cells was prepared (“Experimental Procedures”). Aliquots of cells were examined for septation index as an indicator of passage through the cell cycle. Lysates were prepared at each time point and probed with antibody to Ded1 and to Cdc2, a protein whose abundance does not vary during the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 3, Ded1 abundance and mobility are stable, with no dramatic variation during the cell cycle. Studies from other investigators suggest that Ded1 plays an important role in the initiation of translation (8Chuang R.Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Translation is regulated in response to various stress conditions. For example, transient exposure to high temperature (42 °C, heat shock) inhibits translation in eukaryotic cells (22Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 271-293Google Scholar). To determine whether Ded1 might be responsive to stress conditions that affect translation, we examined the behavior of the Ded1 protein following heat shock treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, an alternative form of Ded1 is apparent within 30 min of exposure to high temperature that is revealed as an alteration of mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). The alternative form of Ded1 gradually disappears when cells are shifted back to a normal growth temperature of 30 °C (Fig.4B). The appearance and disappearance of the alternative form of Ded1 are not dependent on the presence of Chk1 (Fig. 4,A and B). To determine whether Chk1 is required for cell survival upon exposure to heat shock, a strain with thechk1 gene deleted was compared with wild-type cells and a heat shock-sensitive strain,sty1::ura4, for colony forming ability following transient exposure to high temperature. As shown in Fig.4C, the chk1::ura4 strain behaves like the wild-type strain, suggesting that Chk1 is not required for survival following heat shock. A number of proteins have been identified that are involved in the cellular response to stress in S. pombe (23Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway regulates a pair of transcription factors that control the cellular response to stress, including heat shock (Fig.5A). To test whether this pathway might be required for the Ded1 response to heat shock, strains with mutations in components of the pathway were examined for the behavior of Ded1 following transient exposure to high temperature. As shown in Fig. 5B, the additional Ded1 band is generated in response to heat shock in all strains tested, indicating that this modification does not require the function of the mitogen-activated protein kinase stress response pathway. The lower mobility form of Ded1 could be either a newly synthesized form or a modified form of existing protein. To determine whether accumulation of the heat shock-induced form requires active translation, the cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide prior to heat shock treatment. As shown in Fig.5C, the appearance of the altered mobility form of Ded1 is blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis. To determine whether alternative forms of Ded1 appear in response to other types of cellular stress, the cells were exposed to a variety of conditions and lysates examined by immunoblot for the Ded1 protein. As shown in Fig. 6A, no response of Ded1 is detected in response to DNA damage (treatment with CPT or UV), oxidative stress (treatment with H2O2), or osmotic stress (KCl or sorbitol). The behavior of Ded1 was also examined upon depletion of the nitrogen or carbon source. Nitrogen depletion causes fission yeast cells to enter a stationary phase from which cells of opposite mating type can conjugate and sporulate. Between 2 and 4 h of shifting cells to nitrogen-free medium, the Ded1 protein disappears, whereas the Cdc2 protein is still present at 4 h (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, in an independent experiment, Kawamukai (13Kawamukai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the message for Ded1 is stable after 4 h in nitrogen-depleted medium. Thus, it is likely that the effect of nitrogen starvation on Ded1 stability occurs post-transcriptionally. Carbon source depletion causes fission yeast cells to enter a stationary phase following genome duplication. Within 1 h of carbon source depletion, Ded1 is modified in such a way as to alter its mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6C). A comparison of samples prepared from carbon source-depleted and heat-shocked cells indicates that the altered mobility forms of Ded1 generated in each instance are distinct (Fig. 6D). Currently there is no direct connection between the regulation of protein translation and the checkpoint response of fission yeast to DNA damage. Nonetheless, we have uncovered an interaction at two levels between the checkpoint kinase Chk1 and the DEAD box helicase, Ded1. Both Chk1 and Ded1 can suppress the inviability of a cold-sensitive loss of function allele of Cdc2. Secondly, Chk1 and Ded1 can physically interact in vivo. We were unable to detect any modification of the Ded1 protein in response to DNA damage. It is possible that the activity of Ded1 as a helicase or ATPase or in general protein translation could be affected following DNA damage. Experiments to test these possibilities could be revealing. Likewise, loss-of-function of Chk1 clearly affects the cellular response to DNA damage but does not appear to compromise the ability of cells to survive heat shock. Thus, the functional interaction between Chk1 and Ded1 remains elusive at this time. Connections between translation and checkpoints have begun to emerge in other systems. The Drosophila transforming growth factor-α-related protein Gurken controls dorsoventral patterning during oogenesis (24Ray R.P. Schupbach T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Expression of Gurken protein requires Vasa, theDrosophila homologue of the translation factor eIF4A, a DEAD box helicase related to but distinct from Ded1 (25Styhler S. Nakamura A. Swan A. Suter B. Lasko P. Development. 1998; 125: 1569-1578PubMed Google Scholar). In response to persistent double-stranded breaks generated during meiosis, Vasa undergoes modification, and Gurken fails to accumulate (26Ghabrial A. Schupbach T. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both of these events require the presence of the Mei-41 protein, a member of the ATM/ATR family of checkpoint kinases. Thus, it has been proposed that Vasa responds to the meiotic checkpoint and results in decreased translation of Gurken. A second example indicating a connection between translational control and checkpoints comes from mammalian cells. A subtractive library approach was taken to identify protein intermediates associated with the heavy polysome fraction from cells overexpressing eIF4E, the mRNA cap recognition protein. A subunit of ribonucleotide reductase was identified in this fraction (27Abid M.R. Li Y. Anthony C. DeBenedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35991-35998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the RNR2 protein was enriched under these conditions, the RNR2 transcript was not. Yeast cells with simultaneous mutations in the eIF4E homologue,CDC33, and RNR2 are synthetically lethal at temperatures permissive for either single mutant. These results suggest a link between translation and the regulation of nucleotide pools for DNA replication. Our examination of the Ded1 protein suggests that the polypeptide is not modified in response to checkpoint activation caused by DNA damage or DNA replication blocks. The Ded1 protein itself is stable and unmodified throughout the vegetative cell cycle. However, exposure of cells to heat shock or removal of carbon source from the medium results in the appearance of modified forms of Ded1. The forms that appear on SDS-PAGE after these treatments are different. The mobility of the band that appears following heat shock is more distinct from unmodified Ded1 than is the band that appears following carbon starvation (Fig. 6D). Treatment of cells with cycloheximide demonstrates that the appearance of the slower mobility form of Ded1 after heat shock is blocked when translation is inhibited. This result is consistent with the possibility that the slower mobility form is a new translation product. However, it is also possible that the new form is a covalently modified version of Ded1 whose modification is dependent on the activity of a short-lived protein. Alternatively, the slow mobility form may require the activity of a signaling pathway that is inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide. Why Ded1 and Chk1 rescue the loss of function of the Cdc2-r4 protein remains a mystery. A recent study indicates that loss of function of Ded1 results in a decrease in the level of the B-type cyclins Cdc13 and Cig2 (11Grallert B. Kearsey S.E. Lenhard M. Carlson C.R. Nurse P. Boye E. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Ded1 does not appear to rescuecdc2-r4 by increasing Cdc13 levels. Nonetheless, it is possible that modestly increased levels of Ded1 up-regulate other positive regulators of cell cycle progression or down-regulate the expression of negative regulators of cell cycle progression. Future studies should reveal the mechanism through which Ded1 contributes to mitotic progression and may indicate the relevance of the physical interaction of Ded1 with Chk1.

https://openalex.org/W2331525462,"The proto-oncogene ErbB2 is known to be amplified and to play an important role in the development of about one-third of human breast cancers. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is often activated in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, is known to regulate cell proliferation and cell survival. Selective inhibitors of the PI3K pathway were used to assess the relevance of PI3K signaling in the anchorage-independent growth of a series of human mammary carcinoma cell lines. Wortmannin, LY294002, and rapamycin at concentrations that did not affect MAPK phosphorylation but substantially inhibited PI3K, Akt, and p70(S6K) significantly suppressed the soft agar growth of tumor cell lines that overexpress ErbB2 but not the growth of tumor lines with low ErbB2 expression. A similar growth inhibition of ErbB2-overexpressing carcinoma lines was observed when a dominant negative p85(PI3K) mutant was introduced into these cells. Forced expression of ErbB2 in breast cancer lines originally expressing low ErbB2 levels augmented receptor expression and sensitized those lines to LY294002- and rapamycin-mediated inhibition of colony formation. Furthermore, treatment with LY294002 resulted in the selective increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Cip1) or p27(Kip1) and suppression of cyclin E-associated Cdk2 kinase activity in ErbB2-overexpressing lines, which may account for their hypersensitivity toward inhibitors of the PI3K pathway in anchorage-independent growth. Our results indicate that the PI3K/Akt/p70(S6K) pathway plays an enhanced role in the anchorage-independent growth of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, therefore providing a molecular basis for the selective targeting of this signaling pathway in the treatment of ErbB2-related human breast malignancies."

BRCT, BRCA1 C terminus In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the REV1gene is required for damage-induced and spontaneous mutagenesis (1Glassner B.J. Rasmussen L.J. Najarian M.T. Posnick L.M. Samson L.D.

A defect in the REV1 gene has in fact been found to decrease the translesion replication of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1 sites, T-T (6-4) UV photoproducts, and N-2-acetylaminofluorene-modified guanine (8Baynton K.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The encoded protein, containing a BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domain at its N terminus, possesses deoxycytidyl transferase activity (10Callebaut I. Mornon J.P.

Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The activity of Rev1 protein could be important for the bypass of AP sites in yeast (9Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) because cytidine is preferentially inserted opposite these lesionsin vivo (9Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Gibbs P.E. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, a number of observations have suggested that the Rev1 protein may possesses a second function. First, when the REV1 gene is required for the bypass of a T-T (6-4) UV photoproduct, dCMP incorporation occurs only very rarelyin vivo (9Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Second, translesion DNA synthesis and mutagenesis are greatly reduced in a rev1 mutant,rev1–1, with a BRCT domain alteration that does not affect the deoxycytidyl transferase activity in vitro (9Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11Larimer F.W. Perry J.R. Hardigree A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 230-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, during bypass of N-2-acetylaminofluorene-modified guanine, the REV1 gene is needed only for non-slipped translesion DNA synthesis, suggesting that the uncharacterized Rev1 activity is UmuDC-like in nature (8Baynton K. Bresson-Roy A. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fourth, methyl methanesulfonate-induced mutagenesis was shown to be normal in a site-directed mutant lacking deoxycytidyl transferase activity (14Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Fifth, +1 frameshift mutations accompanying base substitutions are dependent on the REV1 gene (15Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1491-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, cloning of a human homologue of the REV1 gene (16Gibbs P.E. Wang X.D. Li Z. McManus T.P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) revealed good conservation from yeast to humans. The humanREV1 gene encodes a deoxycytidyl transferase, similar to the Rev1 protein of the yeast, S. cerevisiae (17Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with activity localized to the central domain that is conserved in the UmuC superfamily (18Masuda Y.

Mutations in conserved residues but not the BRCT domain completely abolish the transferase activity (18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteins in the UmuC superfamily, except for the Rev1 protein, are novel DNA polymerases, capable of replicating damaged DNA (19Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D.

Only for the Rev1 protein has no polymerase activity been detected so far. It has been reported that its transferase activity is limited to the insertion of a dCMP residue (12Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme is capable of incorporating a dCMP residue not only opposite G but also A, U, and AP sites (12Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is not clear how the Rev1 protein plays a role in mutagenesis. In the present study, we cloned and characterized the Rev1gene of the mouse, an animal commonly used for models of human disease. We found that the mouse Rev1 protein transfers a dCMP residue not only opposite template G but also A, T, C, U, and AP sites and extends a mismatched terminus by the addition of a dCMP residue. We further showed this mismatch-extension ability to be strongly enhanced by the presence of a guanine residue (but not an AP site) on the template near the mismatched terminus. Kinetic analysis of the dCMP transferase reaction provided evidence for the high affinity of dCTP with template G. Furthermore, the mouse Rev1 protein could be shown to insert dGMP and dTMP residues opposite template guanine and AP sites. The same activity was also detected with recombinant human REV1 protein but not an inactive mutant protein. Mice of the C57BL/6N and C3H/He strains were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Inc., Atsugi, Japan. All experiments followed the guidelines of the Animal Experimental Facility Committee of Hiroshima University. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from the liver of an inbred mouse, strain C3H/He, using a poly(A) tract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Takara), and PCR primers corresponding to the human REV1 gene were used to amplify fragments of mouse Rev1 cDNA. The amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. From the sequence information, several primer sets were designed and tested. Consequently, mouse Rev1 cDNA was successfully amplified as three overlapping cDNA fragments usingPyrobestTM DNA polymerase (Takara). A promoter proximal fragment (fragment I) was amplified with primers (5′-GAAGCTCCCATATGAGGCGA-3′ and 5′-CTGAAGTTGAGCTGTTTGGC-3′) at 55 °C for annealing with 30 cycles. A fragment of the central region (fragment II) was amplified with primers (5′-AATCCTGTGTGCAAACCTGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCGTCTCTGCAAGGATGTC-3′), and a promoter distal fragment (fragment III) was amplified with primers (5′-TGCGATGAAGCACTGATTGAC-3′ and 5′-TCAGGTCACTTTCAGTGTGCT-3′) under the same conditions. These fragments were cloned into a pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Several independently isolated clones were sequenced, and mutant clones with different sequences from the others were rejected. A plasmid containing wild-type fragment I was digested with NdeI andBamHI, a plasmid containing fragment II was digested withBamHI and AatII, and a plasmid containing fragment III was digested with AatII and KpnI and assembled into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector. To make a bacterial expression plasmid, the human REV1 fragment of pBADREV1 (18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was replaced with the mouse Rev1 fragment. The resulting plasmid, pBADmRev1, encodes full-length mouse Rev1 protein tagged with hexa-histidine residues at its N terminus (h6-mRev1). The tagged sequence is identical with that of pET15b (Novagen). Gene expression was induced by arabinose. The sequence data for the mouseRev1 cDNA have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM data bases under accession numberAB057418. A Northern blot membrane with 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNAs from tissues of C57BL/6N × C3H/He mice was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe generated by PCR using primers 5′-TCCCAGATTGACCAGTCTGTT-3′ and 5′-TCAGGTCACTTTCAGTGTGCT-3′ in ExpressHybTM Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) at 65 °C and washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at the same temperature.

Subsequent column chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Two-ml aliquots of lysate were applied at 0.1 ml/min to a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), which had been flushed with 2 ml of 0.1 m NiSO4 and then equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mNaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and then with 12 ml of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mmMgCl2. The h6-mRev1 was eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mmMgCl2. Five hundred μl of the peak fraction of the h6-mRev1 was concentrated using an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter device, Biomax-10 (Millipore), and then applied at 0.01 ml/min to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), equilibrated with buffer A, and 40-μl fractions were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Bio-Rad) as a standard. The recombinant human REV1 protein and its mutant, D569A/E570A, were purified by nickel-chelating column and gel filtration chromatography as described (18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N.

The purified h6-mRev1 protein (4 μg) was sedimented through 2 ml of 10–40% sucrose gradient in buffer A by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 15 h in a TLS 55 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. Fractions (70 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel bands were stained with Colloidal Blue (NOVEX) and quantified using NIH image 1.60 software. The sedimentation coefficient was determined relative to those of standard proteins sedimented in parallel gradients. Deoxycytidyl transferase assays were performed as described previously (12Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Lin W. Xin H.

The primers were labeled using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and annealed to the templates. To generate an AP site-containing substrate, a primer-template containing a deoxyuracil residue was treated with 0.1 units of Escherichia coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction mixture just before the addition of enzyme. The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmdNTP, 100 nm primer-template, and 1 μl of protein sample diluted with buffer A containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA as indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated time, reactions were terminated with 10 μl of stop solution (30 mm EDTA, 94% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol), and products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 murea and autoradiographed at −80 °C. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The cloned mouseRev1 cDNA encodes a putative protein of 1249 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 137 kDa. The sequence alignment of the human and mouse Rev1 proteins is shown in Fig.1. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two proteins revealed an overall amino acid identity of 84% and similarity of 90% with all of the motifs found in the human REV1 protein conserved in the mouse counterpart (Fig. 1). The BRCT domain, motif I, and motif VIII are specific to the Rev1 family. Motifs II–VII are conserved in polymerases of the UmuC superfamily. We (18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T.

This region was highly conserved with 88% identity and 94% similarity. Expression of the mouse Rev1 gene in various tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2), and the mouse Rev1 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined. Expression of the Rev1 gene was relatively high in the heart, skeletal muscle, and testis. To purify the mouse Rev1 protein, we expressed a recombinant protein tagged with hexa-histidine at its N terminus inE. coli cells. The tagged Rev1 protein (h6-mRev1) was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-chelating column, and the fraction containing h6-mRev1 was applied to a gel filtration column. The h6-mRev1 protein eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 330 kDa with a Stokes' radius of 58 Å (Table I). As shown in Fig. 3, analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed a full-length h6-mRev1 protein of 139 kDa, and smaller forms were also detected specifically when the h6-mRev1 protein was induced in E. coli cells, indicating that these bands are degradation products (data not shown). The properties were found to be identical with those of the human REV1 protein (18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol.

The determined sedimentation coefficient was 5.7 S. Employing the method described by Siegel and Monty (22Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), we calculated the molecular mass at 138 kDa (Table I). These results suggested that the h6-mRev1 protein was asymmetrically shaped, existing as a monomer in solution. Using six different primer-templates, we examined the substrate specificity of the transferase activity of the h6-mRev1 protein in the presence of 100 μm dGTP, dATP, dTTP, or dCTP (Fig. 4). In this experiment, the respective primer-templates differed only at the template nucleotide immediately downstream from the annealed primer. When a G template was incubated with the h6-mRev1 protein and each of the dNTPs, we surprisingly detected a one-base-extended product in the presence of not only dCTP but also dGTP and dTTP (Fig. 4A, panel a). We also found an ability to insert dGMP and dTMP residues opposite the template AP site (Fig. 4A, panel f). Although the efficiency was very low, significant activity was confirmed by reactions with higher concentrations of the h6-mRev1 protein (data not shown). We could not detect dGMP insertion opposite template C or dTMP insertion opposite template A (Fig. 4A, panels b andd), and the results clearly indicated that activity from contaminating bacterial DNA polymerases was less than the detectable level. The mobility of the reaction products and defined oligonucleotide markers was compared (Fig. 4B). Those with dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP migrated exactly like the respective markers (Fig.4B). These results indicate that the h6-mRev1 protein has a potential to transfer dGMP and dTMP residues, albeit with only a fifth of the activity with dCMP residues (Fig. 4C). In the presence of all four dNTPs, the dCMP transfer reaction predominated over the dGMP and dTMP transfer reactions (Fig. 4A,panel a, lane 6). Only the ability to transfer dCMP has been reported for the human REV1 protein (17Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, when dGMP and dTMP transferase activities of the human REV1 protein were examined (Fig. 4D), it incorporated not only dCMP but also dGTP and dTTP residues opposite template G. The activity was completely eliminated with an inactive mutant protein, D569A/E570A (18Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). When all of the templates were tested, the h6-mRev1 protein inserted a dCMP residue opposite not only the template AP site but also all bases examined (Fig. 4A,panels b–f, lane 5). The enzyme activity for insertion reactions opposite the template AP site was slightly higher than that opposite templates G, A, and U (1.2–1.5-fold) and six times higher than that opposite templates T and C (Fig. 4C). When G, A, T, and U templates were incubated with h6-mRev1 and dCTP, a faint two base longer band was detected (Fig. 4A,panels a–c and e), and it was concluded that the h6-mRev1 protein might possess the ability to add a dCMP residue to the mismatched 3′ terminus resulting from the first insertion of a dCMP residue. We investigated this preliminary observation further by performing reactions using another set of primer-templates having mismatched primer-template termini (Fig.5, A and B) differing only in the attachment of a cytidine residue at the 3′ terminus from the set of primer-templates described in Fig. 4. As illustrated in Fig. 5, A and B, the transferase extended C·A, C·T, and C·U (primer·template) mismatched termini by only one nucleotide (Fig. 5A,panels b, c, and e) but failed to extend C·C and C·AP (primer·template) termini (Fig.5A, panels d and f). The ability did not arise from a potential of the enzyme to extend the 3′ terminus of the single-stranded DNA (Fig. 5C). In the sequence context, it should be noted that the enzyme activity for extension of the mismatched primer termini was 10 times lower than that of the matched C·G primer (primer·template) terminus (Fig. 5B and TableII).Table IIExtension activity with matched and mismatched 3′ terminiPrimer/template2-a5′-32P-labeled P13G, P13A, P13T, and P13C primers were each annealed with the templates: 30G, 30A, 30T, and 30C.

In the brain, srcasmmRNA distribution correlates with that of fyn, with both being highly expressed in the hippocampal and cerebellar Purkinje neurons.

Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal regulatory tyrosine leads to an intramolecular association between the phosphotyrosine residue and the SH2 domain; this interaction decreases substrate access to the active site, thereby inhibiting kinase activity (8Xu W.

Keratinocytes from Fyn-deficient mice exhibit impaired squame formation and decreased expression of differentiation markers such as filaggrin and transglutaminase, suggesting that these cells display an aberrant differentiation program. This may be the result, in part, of impaired adhesion caused by decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin-associated catenins (17Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated Fyn expression in primary murine keratinocytes induces a number of markers characteristic of early differentiation events. This includes decreased cell proliferation, increased transglutaminase expression, and inhibition of EGF signaling (20Cabodi S. Calautti E. Kuroki T. Stein P. Dotto G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1121-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, Sik and Rak, which comprise a tyrosine kinase subfamily that shares some structural features with SFKs, are also activated during calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation, and increased Sik activity appears to correlate with increased filaggrin expression (22Vasioukhin V. Tyner A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14477-14482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, completion of the keratinocyte differentiation program may rely on the concerted action of a variety of tyrosine kinases. To determine whether Fyn may exert some of its effects by interacting with and phosphorylating other molecules, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen with a murine keratinocyte library using Fyn as the bait. In this report, we describe the initial cloning and characterization of a molecule capable of interacting with Fyn and other Src family members. We have termed this protein Srcasm:Srcactivating and signalingmolecule. Srcasm is a 52.7-kDa molecule that contains motifs consistent with a substrate for SFKs (23Songyang Z.e.a. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Srcasm contains an amino-terminal VHS membrane binding domain (24Poussu A. Lohi O. Lehto V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7176-7183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and motifs predicted to interact with the SH2 and SH3 domains of SFKs, and the SH2 domains of Grb2, and p85 PI3K (3Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 5Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, Srcasm can serve as a Fyn substrate and activate Fyn kinase activity. In situanalysis for mRNA reveals that srcasm and fynshow coincident yet distinct expression patterns in the skin and brain. The characteristics of Srcasm make it a good candidate molecule for transducing some signals from SFKs in the brain and during keratinocyte differentiation. The bait vector was constructed by cloning murine FynT in-frame and distal to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (G4DB) using the pPC97 vector (25Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A cDNA library derived from cultured primary murine keratinocytes was cloned into the pPC86 vector using SalI-MluI linkers to generate a fusion with the GAL4 activation domain (25Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The bait vector was transformed into the yeast strain MAV103 using the lithium acetate method (27Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) and selection on synthetic medium lacking leucine. Expression of G4DB-FynT fusion protein did not stimulate β-galactosidase production as measured in a filter assay with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. The yeast transfected with the bait vector was subsequently transfected with the cDNA library; transformants were selected on synthetic medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. β-Galactosidase activity in ∼7 × 104 transformants was measured by a filter assay, yielding 15 positive clones. DNA containing the positive clones was isolated and sequenced. The original Srcasm nucleic acid sequence was subjected to BLAST analysis in the GenBank data bases at NCBI. Nucleotide and protein sequence analysis was performed using PALIGN and CLUSTAL from Intelligenetics or AlignX (InforMax, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from murine tissues using RNA STAT 60 (Tel Test “B”, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA (10 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis in formaldehyde buffer and blotted to Hybond-N filter (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). A 2.1-kilobaseSalI-NotI DNA fragment containing the complete Srcasm clone served as template for synthesizing a random primed probe (Megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After washing, autoradiographic images of the hybridized filter were obtained. A polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment containing nucleotides 238–474 (unique region) of the murinefyn coding region was cloned into pKS− (Stratagene); digestion with ClaI and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase were used to generate the antisense probe, and digestion withXbaI and transcription with T3 RNA polymerase were used to generate the sense probe. A HincII-BglII fragment covering the 5′ 520 bp of the coding region of murine srcasmwas cloned into the EcoRV-BamHI sites of pKS−; digestion with ClaI and transcription with T7 polymerase were used to generate the antisense probe, and digestion withXbaI and transcription with T3 polymerase were used to generate the sense probe. The RNA probes were prepared using [α-35S]UTP. In situ hybridization was conducted as described (28Keeton M. Eguchi Y. Sawdey M. Ahn C. Loskutoff D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar) using paraffin sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed murine tissue. The Srcasm 3′-noncoding region was sequenced from C57BL/6 and Mus spretus genomic DNA, and an 8-bp insertion was identified in M. spretus relative to C57BL/6. The primers used to amplify the region around the polymorphism were 5′-TACCTTCCAGCCTTTCTG-3′ and 5′-AAATAAAGAGAAGACATTGG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed on a 4% NuSieve (FMR) agarose gel to resolve the 75-bp C57BL/6 and 83-bp M. spretus alleles. Approximately 10 ng of DNA from each sample of the Jackson Laboratory (C57BL/6JEi × SPRET/Ei)F1 × SPRET/Ei (BSS) interspecific back-cross panel were genotyped and analyzed (29Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H.

A SalI-NotI fragment isolated from the pPC86 murine Srcasm clone was cloned into HA-pKS, a plasmid that inserts the hemagglutinin epitope in-frame onto cDNAs isolated from pPC86 libraries. The HA-tagged Srcasm fragment was excised with KpnI and NotI, then cloned into the corresponding sites of pCDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The 3.1HA-Srcasm d388 (deletion of amino acids 389–474) construct was created by excising an XhoI fragment from pCDNA3.1 HA-Srcasm vector followed by religation. Both murine FynB and a kinase-defective variant were cloned into pCDNA3.1. The following point mutations were introduced into pCDNA3.1HA-Srcasm using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene): Y392F (ablation of Grb2 binding site), Y441F, and Y440F/Y441F (ablation of p85 binding site). The following mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction to disrupt the putative SH2 and SH3 ligands. Y457F (-SH2L) and 420LPPLP to LAALA (-SH3L) were constructed in pCDNA3.1HA-Srcasm. A pCDNA3.1HA-Srcasm molecule with both the Y457F and420LPPLP to LAALA mutations was also constructed (-SH2L,-3L). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The following GST fusion proteins were obtained: GST-Grb2 and GST-p85 (gifts of M. Chou); GST-Fyn (amino acids 1–255), GST-Hck (amino acids 4–236), and GST-Hck SH2 (gifts of S. Anderson); GST-Src SH2 (gift of R. Rickles). The Fyn SH2 (nucleotides 631–982), SH3 (nucleotides 484–630), and SH2+SH3 (484) domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-primer with a BamHI site and a 3′-primer containing a termination codon and a EcoRI site, cloned in-frame into pGEX-4T1. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotic (200 units/ml ampicillin and 200 mg/ml streptomycin). COS-7 cells at ∼60–70% confluence were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). In general, a 10-cm plate of cells was transfected with 7 μg of Mock (pCDNA3.1) or HA-Srcasm DNA ± 1–2 μg of the appropriate Fyn expression vector. Cells were transfected for 5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using a ratio of 1 μg of DNA/6 μl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were allowed to recover in medium with serum for 18 h before lysis. α-Phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, 4G10) was used at 1/1,000 for Western blotting. Low affinity α-HA antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 1/2,500 for Western blotting. High affinity α-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at ∼2 μg/ml for immunoprecipitations. Cell lysates were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4). The lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and assayed for protein content using the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Aliquots of lysate or washed immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PolyScreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blots were conducted in a standard manner with the indicated antibodies and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit as described by the manufacturer (Lumilight Plus, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). GST fusion proteins were induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h; most proteins were produced in DH5α cells. The GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione agarose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The concentration of protein/bead volume was determined using a bromosulfalein protein assay (30McGuire J. Taylor P. Greene L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purity and integrity of the fusion proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cell lysates were incubated with a ∼1 μm concentration of the indicated GST fusion protein for 14 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with glutathione-agarose. The bead-bound complexes were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the appropriate antibody. Partially purified Fyn (Upstate Biotechnology) was incubated with purified GST fusion proteins, and kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Srcasm fusion proteins containing amino acid 389–474 were used because this region contained the Fyn phosphorylation sites. Typical reactions utilized 5 units of Fyn and 0.25 μmindicated fusion proteins: GST, Wt (GST-Srcasm; amino acids 389–474); -SH2L (GST-Srcasm Y457F); -SH3L (GST-Srcasm 421PPLP to421AALA). Phosphorylation was monitored by isotopic labeling with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Fold stimulation is reported relative to background values from the Fyn + GST lane. A murine keratinocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid assay with Fyn as the bait. The screen yielded 12 positive clones; these clones were sequenced, and one was selected for further analysis (Fig.1A). Data base sequence analysis of the murine cDNA showed significant homology with a human gene called TOM1-like (GenBank AJ010071). The designation TOM1-like is based on limited amino acid homology to the amino-terminal third of the TOM1 molecules (GenBank hTOM1, AJ006973; mTOM1, AJ006972; cTOM1, Y08741); to our knowledge, no experimental characterization of the human TOM1-like molecule has been published. We suggest that the cDNA that was isolated in the screen probably represents the mouse ortholog of human TOM1-like based on the following data. The open reading frame of murine clone encodes a 52.7-kDa molecule containing 474 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence and alignment of murine and human cDNA demonstrate 81% homology at the amino acid level, and these molecules share a number of conserved motifs (Fig. 1B). The amino-terminal region amino acids 1–155 comprises a VHS domain (Fig. 1, A andC); VHS domains are found on the amino termini of a number of proteins that are known to associate with endosomal membranes (24Poussu A.

The VHS domain may help to localize TOM1-like molecules to the cytoplasmic face of endosomal membranes where the acylated SFKs are found (33Van der Heyden M.A. Oude Weernink P.A.

In addition, the carboxyl terminus contains the motifs392YDNF and 441YEVM, which, when phosphorylated, are predicted to interact with the SH2 domains of Grb2 and PI3K p85, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C) (3Songyang Z.

All four motifs are conserved between the mouse and human molecules (Fig. 1B). The predicted primary structure of the TOM1-like molecule is suggestive of an adaptor molecule; based on the experimental data presented, we propose to rename it Srcasm. Chromosomal mapping using the Jackson Laboratory mouse BSS interspecific species back-cross panel (29Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Eppig J.T. Ko M.S. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) demonstrated thatsrcasm localized to the distal segment of mouse chromosome 11. The srcasm gene cosegregates with Chad and D11Mit122, resulting in a gene order of D11Mit179 → Srcasm(R 1.06, S.E. 1.06) → Crk7 (R 1.06, S.E. 1.06) → Brca1 (R 1.06, S.E. 1.06), whereR is the percent recombination between adjacent loci, and S.E. is the standard error for each R (Fig.2). Comparison with the human genome confirms that the syntenic organization is conserved between species and maps to the region around human chromosome 17q21–22. Taken together, these data suggest that murine Srcasm and human TOM1-like are orthologs and may function as an adaptor molecule linking signals from SFKs to downstream events. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues identified a single transcript of ∼2.1 kilobases (Fig.3). Srcasm mRNA is prevalent in brain and kidney (Fig. 3). An intermediate level ofsrcasm expression is observed in skin and heart (Fig. 3). This pattern of srcasm expression correlates with the tissues that exhibit phenotypes in fyn mutants, namely abnormal brain development/function and defective keratinocyte differentiation (15Grant S.G.

To determine whether fyn and srcasm were expressed in the same cells, in situ hybridization forfyn and srcasm mRNA was performed on sections of skin and brain, tissues containing intermediate and high levels of this transcript, respectively. Within the epidermis, srcasmmRNA is expressed most prominently within the lower layers (Fig.4A, arrows); hybridization for fyn mRNA yielded a weak but consistent signal within the suprabasilar region (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2316218740,"Although activation of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli including singlet oxygen, the step at which PKC activation interferes with apoptotic signaling is not well defined. We have shown previously that caspase-8 and p38 mediate singlet oxygen-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In this study, we investigated the influence of PKC on regulation of the caspase and p38 pathways initiated by singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen induced Fas clustering and subsequent recruitment of FADD and caspase-8. Treatment of cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, did not affect the binding of caspase-8 to the aggregated Fas. Surprisingly, under the same conditions PKC activation was still able to prevent singlet oxygen-induced activation of caspase-8 and block its downstream signaling events including cleavage of Bid and caspase-3, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Inhibition of PKC by GF109203 or H7 counteracted the TPA-mediated effects on the cleavage of caspases -3 and -8. However, neither activation nor inhibition of PKC affected p38 phosphorylation. These data indicate that PKC inhibits singlet oxygen-induced apoptosis by blocking activation of caspase-8."

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4071-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Dizdaroglu M. Laval J. Boiteux S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12105-12111Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The third E. coli BER glycosylase that removes oxidized bases is endonuclease VIII (endoVIII) (10Melamede R. Hatahet Z. Kow Y. Ide H. Wallace S.

J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EndoVIII has highly overlapping substrate specificity with endoIII, as evidenced through biochemical analyses (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the analyses of mutator phenotypes of E. colistrains deficient in one or both of these enzymes (11Jiang D.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although cells lacking functional genes for either endoIII (nth gene) or endoVIII (nei gene) have a weak mutator phenotype (13Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,14Cunningham R.P. Weiss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wallace S. J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a greater H2O2sensitivity (13Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There is evidence that endoVIII also has slight substrate overlap with Fpg. Studies using oligonucleotides with site-specific damage have shown that there are common substrates between the two enzymes, including OG and 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) (6Boiteux S.

However, recent work showed that endoVIII does not remove OG in any detectable amount from radiation-damaged DNA but that FapyAde was indeed a substrate for endoVIII (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite differences in substrate specificity, endoVIII and Fpg have significant similarities in their catalytic activities. Both glycosylases possess lyase activity, catalyzing β-δ elimination to generate a single-strand break at the site of the removed base with both 5′- and 3′-phosphates (18Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Melamede R. Kow Y. Wallace S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32230-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Bailly V. Verly W.G. O'Connor T. Laval J. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which the enzyme uses an amine as an active site nucleophile to break the glycosyl bond at the C1′ of the sugar moiety. As a result, the enzyme and DNA form an imino Schiff base intermediate, and this protein-DNA complex can be covalently trapped in the presence of a reducing agent, such as NaBH4. Both endoVIII and Fpg use the secondary amine of their N-terminal proline residues as the nucleophile (21Rieger R. McTigue M. Kycia J. Gerchman S. Grollman A. Iden C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition to an active site nucleophile, glycosylase/lyase enzymes require acidic side chains to perform catalysis on damaged bases. Mutagenesis of acidic residues in two pyrimidine dimer glycosylases andE. coli Fpg severely diminishes or eliminates enzymatic activity of these enzymes (23Manuel R.C. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2652-2661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Garvish J.F. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), even with the active site nucleophile intact. EndoVIII does not share sequence homology with its functional homologue, endoIII, but its sequence is significantly homologous to members of the Fpg family. In particular, we have found that the conserved glutamates and aspartates in Fpg that are critical for catalysis (25Lavrukhin O.V. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are also conserved in endoVIII proteins from E. coli and from other microorganisms. Fig. 1 (see below) shows an alignment between E. coli endoVIII and five Fpg proteins, illustrating the conservation of several amino acids. Thus far, no amino acids have been experimentally confirmed as critical for endoVIII catalysis. The purpose of this study is to identify amino acids in endoVIII that are necessary for glycosylase and lyase activities, focusing on conserved acidic residues and the N-terminal proline. Potentially important acidic side chains within endoVIII were identified by multiple sequence alignments, and the roles of the N-terminal proline and five completely conserved glutamates and aspartates were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. A total of seven mutations were made in the primary sequence of endoVIII, and each mutant protein was assayed for lyase activity on abasic (AP) sites and glycosylase/lyase activity on modified bases. Uracil- and 5-hydroxyuracil-containing oligonucleotides and their complements were synthesized and purified by Midland Certified Reagent Co. The pBR322 plasmid was purified by University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), NIEHS/National Institutes of Health, Center Molecular Biology Core. The pET22b-neiplasmid construct was a gift from Dr. Tapas Hazra (UTMB, Galveston, TX) (17Hazra T. Izumi T. Venkataraman R. Kow Y. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27762-27767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Point mutations were made in the pET22b-nei construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per kit instructions. The residues to be altered were identified by multiple sequence alignments using ClustalW (BCM Search Launcher, available at searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu). Mutations were made at the N-terminal proline, at glutamates 3, 6, and 174, and at aspartates 129 and 160. The nei gene sequence was verified by dideoxy sequencing at SeqWright (Houston, TX). Expression and purification of all endoVIII proteins was performed as previously described (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the neigene in the pET22b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) was transformed intoE. coli DE884nei−mutM− cells. Cells were grown in 1 liter of LB broth containing 5 μmZnCl2 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At anA550 of 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown overnight at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min. Pelleted cells were lysed by BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was treated with 0.1% Polymin P, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% final saturation). The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended and dialyzed overnight into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl). The dialysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap-SP column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), followed by extensive washing with buffer A. EndoVIII was eluted in a 0.1–0.5 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. Fractions were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE. Pure fractions were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (same as buffer A but with 50% glycerol) and then stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The fraction of active molecules for each enzyme preparation was determined following the procedure previously outlined (26Ikeda S. Biswas T. Roy R. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Kurosky A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 nm AP-containing DNA (see the 26-mer below) was incubated with 25, 20, 100, 150, or 200 nm enzyme in the presence of 50 mm NaCNBH3, 85 mm sodium Hepes, pH 7.5, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min. Maximum complex formation was determined by quantitating trapped complex for each enzyme concentration. Enzyme AP site activity was tested on a 26-mer oligonucleotide with the following sequence: 5′-ACCATGCCTGCAAGAAUTAAGCAATG-3′, whereU = uracil. AP sites were generated by incubation with uracil DNA glycosylase immediately prior to activity assays. Glycosylase activity was tested on a 30-mer oligonucleotide with the following sequence: 5′-CATGCCTGCACGACXTAAGCAATTCGTACC-3′, where X = 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OH-Ura). The substrate DNA strand was radioactively labeled at the 5′ end and then annealed to its complementary strand. Oligonucleotide nicking and trapping reactions were carried out in 85 mm sodium Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 nm DNA, with the indicated amount of the various enzymes at 37 °C for 30 min. All enzyme concentrations were based on the determined concentration of active enzyme for that preparation. For trapping reactions, NaCNBH3 was added to a final concentration of 50 mm at the start of the reactions, simultaneously with the addition of the enzyme; at the end of the reaction time, NaBH4 was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. Reducing agents were added from freshly prepared stock solutions. All reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 95% formamide/1% SDS loading buffer and immediately loaded onto a denaturing 8 m urea/15% polyacrylamide gel; substrate and product DNAs were separated by electrophoresis at 20 watts for 4.5 h. Images were generated and quantified PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Thymine glycols were introduced into supercoiled pBR322 plasmid by the method of Kow and Wallace (27Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8354-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was incubated with 0.05% OsO4for 10 min at 70 °C. The mixture was then cooled on ice and dialyzed overnight into 1× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. To remove any possible AP sites that may have been created as a consequence of the OsO4treatment, the DNA was dialyzed into 50 mmNaBH4 overnight at 4 °C to reduce AP sites. The DNA was then dialyzed into 1× TE overnight to remove the reducing agent. For plasmid nicking assays, ∼1.5 μg of DNA was incubated with 1, 5, or 10 nm enzyme for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 0.5× volume of agarose gel loading buffer (40% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue), and samples were electrophoresed in a 0.85% agarose gel in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). Preparation of γ-irradiated DNA and enzymatic assays were performed as previously described (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 100 μg of DNA samples were incubated with 1 μg of enzyme at 37 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant fractions from the assays were analyzed by GC/IDMS as previously described (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,28Dizdaroglu M. Bauche C. Rodriguez H. Laval J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5586-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To identify amino acids that may be important for enzyme catalysis, multiple sequence alignments were generated from sequences of E. coli endoVIII, putative endoVIII proteins from other microorganisms, and several Fpg proteins. A representative alignment between E. coli endoVIII and five Fpg proteins is shown in Fig. 1, and the five completely conserved aspartates and glutamates are highlighted, as well as the conserved N-terminal proline. The following mutant endoVIII proteins were constructed: Pro-2 → Thr (P2T), Glu-3 → Asp (E3D), Glu-3 → Gln (E3Q), Glu-6 → Gln (E6Q), Asp-129 → Asn (D129N), Asp-160 → Asn (D160N), and Glu-174 → Gln (E174Q). While verifying the sequence of each of the mutated pET22b-nei plasmid constructs, an additional, yet identical, sequence change was detected in each of the constructs. The previously published nei sequence codes for a leucine at position 90 (11); however, all of our constructs had a T → C transition that changed amino acid 90 from Leu to Ser. Upon further sequencing, we discovered that in fact our templatenei gene had this transition, and this appeared to be a naturally arising variant of endoVIII. A recent study (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) compared the relative catalytic activities of the L90S variant with the previously published endoVIII protein, and the results show that this variation does not alter enzyme activity or substrate specificity, although there were slight variations in kinetic parameters on some substrates. Thus all of the mutated proteins within this study are in the endoVIII-L90S variant background. The activities of the mutants listed above are compared with endoVIII-L90S, which in this paper will be designated endoVIII. The endoVIII proteins were purified from afpg−nei−E. coli strain to avoid contaminating activities. Each of the constructs overexpressed well and behaved normally during the standard purification used for all of the endoVIII proteins. However, despite good purification yields, some proteins had a very low percentage of active molecules as determined by AP site trapping, such as E3Q at ∼30% and E174Q at ∼20%. Each protein has been determined to be ≥95% pure (data not shown) by SDS-PAGE analysis. Two oligonucleotide substrates were used in this study: AP sites to test for lyase activity and 5-OH-Ura to test for glycosylase/lyase activity. Each mutant was tested for its ability to nick or trap on both substrates. Each assay was performed in three separate experiments, and the mean values with standard deviations were calculated. To simplify data presentation, mutant enzyme responses in oligonucleotide assays were clustered into groups that gave similar responses, and each cluster is presented by a separate figure. In each data set, AP trapping data are represented by three lines: AP DNA in trapped complex (closed circles), AP DNA cleaved via β-δ-elimination (open circles), and the sum of the DNA trapped and nicked (inverted, solid triangles). As mentioned above, NaCNBH3 was used as the reducing agent of the Schiff base intermediate, which is a much slower reductant than NaBH4. Therefore, significant numbers of Schiff base intermediates escaped the reducing step and proceeded to β-δ-elimination product. The sum of both trapped DNA and nicked DNA represents the number of Schiff base intermediates formed in that reaction. Determining both trapped and product DNA shows the propensity of each Schiff base to either β-eliminate or be reduced, depending on the enzyme involved. The data in Fig. 2 compares the activities of endoVIII (top row) and P2T (bottom row) on AP sites and 5-OH-Ura lesions in double-stranded oligonucleotides. Changing the N-terminal proline to a threonine eliminates almost all of the lyase activity on AP sites (first column). For instance, endoVIII at 0.1 nm cleaves 37% of the AP DNA, but at the same concentration, P2T cleaves less than 1% of the substrate. This mutant, however, readily forms the Schiff base intermediate, as shown by the large percentage of trapped AP DNA in the second column. P2T has a much larger percentage of DNA trapped relative to endoVIII, presumably because the imine intermediate does not proceed to β-elimination. The summation of Schiff bases formed is approximately equal between endoVIII and P2T. The N-terminal proline of endoVIII is necessary for glycosylase activity; no significant amount of cleaved product was generated by P2T from a 5-OH-Ura lesion (column 3), and Schiff base formation was severely reduced (column 4). Fig.3 compares the results of endoVIII and the three mutated enzymes with no significantly altered activity: D129N, E6Q, and D160N. The data for endoVIII are the same as presented in Fig. 2 but are shown again for comparison. The D129N results were nearly identical to endoVIII (top two rows of graphs), and the D160N results were nearly identical to E6Q (bottom two rows of graphs). The mutants in this grouping all cleaved AP sites with an efficiency equal to endoVIII, as shown in the first column. All four enzymes had an equal propensity to form Schiff bases on AP sites, as shown by the summation lines in the second column of graphs. EndoVIII and D129N both had approximately equal amounts of trapped and nicked DNA, while E6Q and D129N had a higher fraction of the DNA trapped than nicked. E6Q, D129N, and D160N all retain significant 5-OH-Ura glycosylase/lyase and trapping activity as compared with endoVIII, as illustrated in the third andfourth columns of Fig. 3. The data in Fig. 4illustrate the importance of Glu-3 and Glu-174 for endoVIII activity. Again, the endoVIII data are duplicated here for comparison. E3D, E3Q, and E174Q all retain lyase activity on AP sites (first column), although E3Q has a reduced efficiency. An interesting result that was consistently observed was that E3D gave significant amounts of β-elimination products (∼30–40%) in addition to β-δ-elimination products (∼60–70%) on AP sites. As shown in thesecond column, all three of these mutants have diminished capacity for forming the Schiff base intermediate on AP sites; E3Q is the most deleterious mutation among these enzymes. Both changes at position 3 to aspartate (E3D) and glutamine (E3Q) almost completely abolish the nicking and trapping activities of endoVIII on 5-OH-Ura (third and fourth columns). E174Q retains slight 5-OH-Ura nicking activity but does not appreciably trap on this substrate. Thymine glycols were introduced into supercoiled pBR322 DNA, and the ability of the proteins to nick form I (supercoiled circular) DNA was monitored by the relaxation of supercoiled DNA via single-strand breaks. The percentage of incised DNA was determined by summing the amounts of form II (relaxed circular) and form III (linear) DNAs, and calculating that value as a percentage of total DNA in the reaction. Fig.5 shows the results of this assay, which closely parallel 5-OH-Ura-containing oligonucleotide assays. Mutations at the aspartates (D129N and D160N) did not affect enzyme activity on thymine glycol containing DNA, which agrees with the 5-OH-Ura data presented in Fig. 3. Both E6Q and E174Q have significant, albeit diminished, glycosylase activity as compared with endoVIII. P2T, E3D, and E3Q have negligible thymine glycol nicking activity; the ∼20% level of incised DNA in these three reactions was not dependent on enzyme concentration. Aqueous solutions of calf thymus DNA were γ-irradiated under N2O to create a multitude of oxidatively damaged bases. Upon incubation with active enzyme, those lesions that are substrates for the enzyme are released from the DNA and can be identified and quantified by GC/IDMS as previously described (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Dizdaroglu M. Bauche C. Rodriguez H. Laval J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5586-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fig. 6shows the results obtained for excision of FapyAde by the each enzyme, which is representative of analyses of various lesions. E6Q, D129N, and D160N retain glycosylase activity, although E6Q and D129N have significantly diminished activity. P2T, E3D, E3Q, and E174Q do not release any FapyAde residues above the background levels of the controls that have either no enzyme or heat-inactivated endoVIII. Analysis of the release of other substrates of endoVIII (12Dizdaroglu M. Burgess S.M. Jaruga P. Hazra T.K. Rodriguez H. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12150-12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed trends similar to that of FapyAde for each enzyme. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of absolutely conserved amino acids in endoVIII catalysis. To better understand the results obtained and the contribution of these side chains, we have developed a minimal kinetic scheme for endoVIII, which is shown in Scheme FS1. The formation of the Schiff base intermediate ([E*S]SB) from enzyme (E) and substrate (S) is represented by the rate constantk1, which encompasses many steps, including binding, damage recognition, base flipping, and the nucleophilic attack to form the covalent intermediate. From the Schiff base intermediate there are three pathways: k−1, reversal of the imine to enzyme and substrate that are no longer covalently joined;k2, hydrolysis of the Schiff base leading to the β-δ elimination product (P), and dissociation from product; ork3, reduction of the Schiff base to produce a stable covalently trapped complex (EScov). The propensity of an enzyme to follow any of these paths is governed by the rate constants of each path for that enzyme. Reaction rates can be dependent on the pKa values of the ionizing side chains involved in the chemistry. Creating mutations in the active site can alter the electrostatic environment of the active site pocket and modulate the pKa values of neighboring functional groups, thus altering enzyme rate constants. The fourth path shown (k4) is the rate of reduction of the AP site prior to enzymatic processing, which renders the reduced abasic DNA non-cleavable (designated rAP). In our experiments, NaCNBH3was used as a reducing agent, because it has a smallerk4 value than NaBH4; the half-life of an AP site in NaCNBH3 is ∼9 h, 2A. Kurtz, personal communication. whereas the half-life of an AP site in NaBH4 is only about 12 s (29McCullough A.K. Sanchez A. Dodson M.L. Marapaka P. Taylor J.S. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results presented here can also be interpreted relative to their likely location in the structure of endoVIII. Recently, the crystal structure of a member of the endoVIII-Fpg family, Fpg fromThermus thermophilus, was determined previously (30Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Assuming structural similarity between these two enzymes, we can approximate where the residues investigated here are likely to be located within endoVIII. The side chains of the correlating conserved residues from T. thermophilus Fpg are illustrated and colored on the structure shown in Fig. 7. The N-terminal proline (in red) sits in the proposed active site, and this residue has already been identified in endoVIII as the residue that cross-links to DNA (21Rieger R. McTigue M. Kycia J. Gerchman S. Grollman A. Iden C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the role of this proline inE. coli Fpg activity has been well documented (22Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9924-9929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that indeed the N-terminal proline of endoVIII is necessary for lyase and glycosylase activity as shown in Figs. 2, 5, and 6. Substituting the secondary amine of proline with the primary α-amine of threonine greatly decreases cleavage at AP sites and at three damaged bases, 5-OH-Ura, thymine glycol, and FapyAde. Although the P2T mutant was unable to efficiently catalyze β-elimination, it was very efficient at forming Schiff base intermediates on AP sites. It appears that the P2T mutation creates a very smallk2 value, shunting the covalent intermediate to either the k3 or k−1pathway, while retaining a k1 value approximately equal to endoVIII. These data do not provide sufficient information to know if the k3 ork−1 values for P2T are altered from endoVIII. P2T must have a significant k−1 value (greater than or equal to k1) in the absence of reductant, because no covalent complex was observed in reactions without NaCNBH3 or NaBH4. These results are consistent with the findings of mutations at the N-terminal proline ofE. coli Fpg (31Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9924-9929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fpg P2G and P2T proteins did not possess lyase or glycosylase activities, demonstrating no significant nicking on oligonucleotides with either an AP site or OG lesion. However, Fpg P2G showed very efficient trapping on AP sites (31Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9924-9929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Three of the conserved acidic residues, Glu-6, Asp-129, and Asp-160, appear to be dispensable for catalytic activity on AP sites, 5-OH-Ura, thymine glycols, and FapyAde (Figs. 3, 5, and 6). This agrees well with mutations at these corresponding residues in E. coli Fpg (25Lavrukhin O.V. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in which mutations at analogous sites retain significant OG glycosylase/lyase and AP lyase activity. Despite being clustered near the active site (Fig. 7), the Asp-129 and Asp-160 residues do not appear to be in the active site, and apparently do not participate directly in either glycosylase or lyase reactions. Glu-6 may be more directly involved in catalysis or substrate recognition. Activity on 5-OH-Ura within oligonucleotides was unchanged for E6Q, but with multiply damaged DNA, excision of FapyAde (Fig. 6) was only about 30% of endoVIII. Disturbing the negative charge on the Glu-6 and Asp-160 side chains may directly or indirectly alter active site electrostatics, as evidenced by the AP trapping data in Fig. 3. For instance, D129N, as endoVIII, has approximately equal amounts of trapped and product AP DNA formed, suggesting thatk2 ≈ k3 for these two enzymes. Both E6Q and D160N, however, have significantly more AP DNA trapped than cleaved via β-elimination, suggesting thatk3 > k2 for these two mutants. The glutamate at position three is critical for enzyme glycosylase catalysis. The results presented here for the E3D and E3Q mutants are expected, given the proximity of Glu-3 to the active site (Fig. 7). This glutamate side chain inserts directly into the active site of the enzyme and is right next to the active site nucleophile. Mutating Glu-3 to either aspartate or glutamine retains AP lyase activity, suggesting that Glu-3 is not directly involved in simple lyase reactions. However, Schiff base formation is hindered in E3D and E3Q, suggesting a lowerk1 rate for these enzymes (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the shorter yet still negatively charged aspartate at position 3 (E3D) consistently gives a significant amount of β-elimination product (∼30–40%) on AP sites, in addition to the typical β-δ-elimination product (∼60–70%, data not shown). These data suggest that moving the carboxyl group by the distance of a methylene group may allow a water molecule to occupy the vacated space. The water molecule may then hydrolyze the imine more rapidly than if a glutamate occupied this position, effectively stopping the β-δ-elimination at only β-elimination. EndoVIII cannot tolerate alterations at Glu-3 and still retain glycosylase/lyase activity on 5-OH-Ura, thymine glycols, or FapyAde as shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6. These results are in agreement with Glu-3 mutational analysis of E. coli Fpg (25Lavrukhin O.V. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In endoVIII, eliminating this negative charge (E3Q) or shortening the side chain by one methylene group (E3D) prevents the enzyme from removing damaged bases from their deoxyribose rings. Hence, Glu-3 must be directly involved in the glycosylase activity of endoVIII. The role of acidic side chains in glycosylase enzymes is not clear, and several proposals have been made (32Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8200-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Fuxreiter M. Warshel A. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9577-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Werner R.M. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14054-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the negative charge serves to stabilize a positively charged oxocarbenium ion intermediate, or to stabilize the positively charged Schiff base glycosylase product. Another possibility is that the acidic side chains serves to directly protonate either the damaged base or the O4′ of the sugar to facilitate glycosidic bond cleavage. An interesting result is the effect of the E174Q mutation on endoVIII, which appears to be significantly deleterious. E174Q enzyme preparations consistently have a low percentage of active molecules, and even after correcting for the concentration of active sites, we still observe low activity of this enzyme on oligonucleotides. Structurally, the corresponding glutamate (Glu-166) in T. thermophilus is in the D helix of the helix-two-turns-helix motif (Fig. 7), which is removed from the active site. The side chain of Glu-166 points away from the pocket and appears that it would not interact with the substrate lesion at all. Nonetheless, this residue is completely conserved in this family, and the results of this study and of Lavrukhin and Lloyd (25Lavrukhin O.V. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15266-15271Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) show that glycosylase/lyase activity of both endoVIII and Fpg are dependent on an intact glutamate at this position. Because it is unlikely that Glu-174 in endoVIII participates directly in the catalytic chemistry, we suggest two possible roles: to maintain structural integrity within the enzyme through interactions with other residues or to alter the electrostatics and pKa values within the active site. The results of this study confirm the involvement of the N-terminal proline as the active site nucleophile and identify two conserved glutamates that are critical for the glycosylase activity of endoVIII. Pro-2 is necessary for both the glycosylase reaction and the lyase reaction, and our results are consistent with the role of the nucleophile in glycosylase enzymes. The most catalytically important amino acids of the conserved aspartates and glutamates are Glu-3 and Glu-174, which mediate the removal of a damaged base in the glycosylase reaction but are not necessary for the enzyme to perform the lyase mechanism on AP sites. Additionally, this work strongly underscores the similarities in catalytic mechanism between members of the endoVIII-Fpg family, despite broad differences in substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2120832133,"Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, affects keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. However, little is known about the mechanisms of activin action in keratinocytes, and its target genes have not been identified. In this study, we demonstrate that activin A and TGF-beta1 directly induce the expression and activity of Mad1, an antagonist of the c-Myc transcription factor, in the human HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. Expression and activity of Mad1 was strongly induced by both factors in keratinocytes, although the intensity of induction was different for activin A and TGF-beta1. To determine a possible role of activin and TGF-beta in the regulation of mad1 expression in vivo, we analysed its expression during cutaneous wound repair when high levels of these factors are present. Expression of mad1 mRNA and protein, but not of other mad genes, increased significantly after skin injury, particularly in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and in suprabasal keratinocytes of the hyperproliferative epithelium. Elevated levels of mad1 mRNA were also detected in the hyperthickened epidermis of psoriatic patients. Since Mad1 regulates proliferation and/or differentiation of various cell types, our results suggest that this transcription factor mediates at least in the part the anti-mitotic and/or differentiation-inducing activities of TGF-beta and activin in keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2010707114,"KorB is a regulatory protein encoded by the conjugative plasmid RP4 and a member of the ParB family of bacterial partitioning proteins. The protein regulates the expression of plasmid genes whose products are involved in replication, transfer, and stable inheritance of RP4 by binding to palindromic 13-bp DNA sequences (5′-TTTAGC(G/C)GCTAAA-3′) present 12 times in the 60-kb plasmid.

The KorB-C crystal structure extends the range of protein-protein interactions known to be promoted by SH3 and SH3-like domains. C-terminal domain (amino acids 297–358) of KorB protein N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–294) of KorB protein root mean square Src homology 3 KorB is encoded on the central control region of the plasmid RP4. This plasmid is a member of Escherichia coliincompatibility group P (IncP-1α), and it is indistinguishable from plasmids R18, R68, RK2, and RP1. The IncP-1α plasmids RP4/RP1/RK2 were the first to be studied in great molecular detail (1Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G. Haas D. Helinski D.R. Schwab H. Stanisich V.A. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 623-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). RP4 is a self-transmissible resistance plasmid of about 60 kb. Broad host-range IncP-1α plasmids are of particular interest due to their promiscuity, which is exhibited as their capacity to transfer and stably maintain themselves in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacterial species (2Thomas C.M. Smith C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4453-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A major role in the ability of these plasmids to survive is played by plasmid regulators that control and coordinate replication, transfer, and partitioning functions (3Jagura-Burdzy G. Thomas C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10571-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Jagura-Burdzy G. Thomas C.M. J. Mol.

KorB plays a direct role in the partitioning of the plasmid, acting together with another protein. KorB also functions as a transcriptional repressor of RP4 genes. It is a member of the ParB family of proteins that are involved in genome partitioning and encoded on plasmids and bacterial chromosomes (8Lobocka M. Yarmolinsky M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Motallebi-Veshareh M. Rouch D. Thomas C.M. Mol.

Macartney D.P. Thomas C.M. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purified KorB exists as a dimer in solution (12Balzer D. Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Kruft V. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and even formation of a homo-oligomer was described (13Williams D.R. Motallebi-Veshareh M. Thomas C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). KorB has a size of 358 amino acids (39,011 Da) with an abundance of about 2000 molecules/cell. Despite its negative charge at neutral pH, KorB recognizes and binds specifically to the operator sequence, OB (5′-TTTAGC(G/C)GCTAAA-3′), which occurs 12 times on the RP4 genome. The positions of these 12 operator sites (measuring from the middle of the OB site) relative to RP4 promoters can be classified as follows. Class I sites are 39/40 bp upstream of a transcription start point, class II sites are further upstream or downstream of promoters but within 80–190 bp of a transcription start site, and class III sites are more than 1 kb away from any known promoter (14Jagura-Burdzy G.

KorB can repress the RP4 promoters carrying class I or class II OB sites (4Jagura-Burdzy G. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Motallebi-Veshareh M. Balzer D. Lanka E. Jagura-Burdzy G. Thomas C.M. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its role in the regions where class III operators occur has not been elucidated. However, the conservation of these sites on the IncP-1 relative of RP4, plasmid R751, whose complete sequence was compiled (17Thorsted P.B. Macartney D.P. Akhtar P. Haines A.S. Ali N. Davidson P. Stafford T. Pocklington M.J. Pansegrau W. Wilkins B.M. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 969-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggests that even class III OB sites play an important role in the expression of the genome. In conjunction with KorA, KorB represses the transcription of the kilA,trfA, and korAB operons. It is also involved in the negative control of kilB operons. KorA and KorB act cooperatively in transcriptional repression. Detailed studies on the binding of KorB to the 12 operators present in RP4 showed that they fall into three groups according to the binding strength of KorB. The highest affinity site is OB10, which occurs in the promoter transcribing genes for replication,trfAp. Purified IncC1 enhanced KorB binding to all OB sites except OB3, a site involved in partitioning (18Kostelidou K. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 5-bp sequences flanking the 13-mer OB site were found to affect KorB binding and IncC1 stimulatory activity. Flanking sequences on one side only were sufficient to specify the difference between OB10 and OB3. These differences also eliminated potentiation by IncC1. It was suggested that KorB contacts OB flanking sequences and that IncC1 may alter the conformation of multimeric KorB so that it is better able to make these contacts, thus stabilizing the complexes once formed. To elucidate the structural basis of KorB's DNA-binding properties and the interaction with other proteins, a crystallographic analysis was initiated. Here we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain, KorB-C,1 consisting of 62 amino acids. This is the first crystal structure of a protein encoded by the RP4 plasmid. We have solved the structure in two different crystal forms observing a SH3-like monomer fold and closely similar dimeric arrangements in three crystallographically independent copies. Based on the structure, we argue that the C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for stabilizing the dimeric form of KorB, thus enhancing specific operator binding by the repressor. korB was overexpressed in E. coli, and the protein was purified as described by Balzer et al. (12Balzer D. Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Kruft V. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The highly soluble protein (>100 mg ml−1) was subjected to crystallization experiments. After several months, a crystal with a hexagonal unit cell of a = 51.8 Å, c = 88.3 Å was obtained. Even under the most favorable assumptions of one KorB molecule per asymmetric unit and point symmetry 6 of the crystal, this unit cell is too small to accommodate intact KorB, yielding an unlikely Matthews coefficient (19Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar), VM, of 0.88 Å3 Da−1. Therefore, the crystal was dissolved and analyzed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. The result was that the crystal contained only a C-terminal KorB fragment extending from residue 297 to the end. The corresponding 3′-terminal fragment of korB was molecularly cloned, and the product KorB-C was overproduced in E. coli in the same way as the intact protein (12Balzer D. Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Kruft V. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). KorB-C was purified in a four-step procedure. In an initial step, the cell extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The pooled fractions were put on a heparin column (Amersham Biosciences HiTrap Heparin HP) and eluted with a 0–0.25 m NaCl gradient. The collected fractions were purified again with MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences HR 5/5). Finally, KorB-C was purified to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences Superdex G75). A 5′-terminal fragment ofkorB was cloned analogously, and the product, KorB-N (residues 1–294 of KorB), was overproduced in E. coli. For crystallization, KorB-C was dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 50 mm NaCl and concentrated. Different crystal forms were obtained under several conditions in hanging drop vapor diffusion setups, sometimes even in the same drop. Crystals used for data collection were grown under the following conditions. Hexagonal crystal (P65) with a= 51.8 Å, c = 88.3 Å grew from 30% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 200 mm ammonium acetate in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6. These crystal parameters are the same as those found for the KorB-C crystals obtained from degraded KorB. A second crystal form was obtained from 36% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 200 mm sodium chloride in 100 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.6. These crystals belong to space group P212121 with a = 42.1 Å, b = 82.1 Å, c = 87.9 Å. For data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen directly from the crystallization droplet. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking orthorhombic crystals with platinum tetrachloride andcis-diamminplatinum chloride until the crystals displayed the color of the heavy atom salt solution. X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house and at beamline X31 of EMBL/DESY in Hamburg and processed with DENZO/HKL (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved in the orthorhombic space group using a MIRAS approach based on three diffraction data sets collected for two platinum derivatives (TableI). One derivative data set was collected at the Pt LIII peak wavelength as established from a fluorescence scan to optimize the anomalous signal. Four heavy atom sites present in each derivative but differing in relative occupancy and anomalous contribution were identified by SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The phases were refined with MLPHARE, and the quality of the density was improved by solvent averaging using DM as implemented in the CCP4 package (22Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). A first inspection of the electron density revealed the noncrystallographic symmetry present in the asymmetric unit and permitted the subsequent phase improvement by noncrystallographic symmetry averaging in DM. This yielded an easily interpretable electron density map. An atomic model of KorB-C was built in O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and initially refined in XPLOR 3.7 (24Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). Finally, the structure was refined to convergence in REFMAC (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) using isotropic B values for all nonhydrogen atoms. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were gradually decreased and completely removed in the last refinement cycles. All solvent peaks were modeled as fully occupied water oxygens. Alternative conformations were modeled for a number of side chains and occupancies adjusted to yield similar B values for both conformers.Table ICrystallographic data and phasing statisticsNativeDerivativeOrthorhombicHexagonalPtCl4PtCl4Cis-platin(II) diamminchlorideSpace groupP212121P65P212121P212121P212121Wavelength (Å)1.07211.54181.07211.54181.5418Unit cell (Å)a = 42.13a = 51.68a = 43.05a = 42.05a = 43.04b = 82.15c = 87.42b = 81.39b = 81.29b = 81.79c = 87.86c = 87.58c = 87.65c = 88.01Resolution (Å)22–1.7722–2.1540–2.5536–2.5036–2.75Unique reflections32,1607,1579,81210,8978,515Completeness1-aValues for whole dataset/highest resolution bin.(%)98.9/95.799.0/87.994.9/87.998.3/89.998.7/86.5Redundancy1-aValues for whole dataset/highest resolution bin.3.4/3.33.4/2.54.0/3.93.8/3.52.7/2.3I/ς(I)1-aValues for whole dataset/highest resolution bin.19.5/3.88.5/3.94.0/1.79.9/2.89.7/2.0〈B〉 from Wilson plot19.525.242.645.643.7R(sym)1-bR(sym) = ∑i∑j‖〈Ii〉 − Ii,j‖/∑i∑jIi,j, where Ii,j are the measurements of contribution to the mean reflection intensity 〈Ii〉.(%)4.4/20.37.1/19.510.95.710.6R(iso)1-cR(iso), phasing power, R(Cullis), and figure or merit (f.o.m.) are according to MLPHARE (21).(%)46.245.620.7No. of sites444Phasing power1-cR(iso), phasing power, R(Cullis), and figure or merit (f.o.m.) are according to MLPHARE (21).acen./cen.1.76/1.222.04/1.461.20/0.98R(Cullis)1-cR(iso), phasing power, R(Cullis), and figure or merit (f.o.m.) are according to MLPHARE (21).acen./cen./anom.0.69/0.73/0.830.64/0.68/0.870.83/0.77/0.98f.o.m.1-cR(iso), phasing power, R(Cullis), and figure or merit (f.o.m.) are according to MLPHARE (21).0.51601-a Values for whole dataset/highest resolution bin.1-b R(sym) = ∑i∑j‖〈Ii〉 − Ii,j‖/∑i∑jIi,j, where Ii,j are the measurements of contribution to the mean reflection intensity 〈Ii〉.1-c R(iso), phasing power, R(Cullis), and figure or merit (f.o.m.) are according to MLPHARE (21Terwilliger T.C.

Open table in a new tab The structure of KorB-C in the hexagonal space group was solved by molecular replacement with AMORE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using a protein dimer from the orthorhombic KorB-C structure as a model. The structure of hexagonal KorB-C was refined essentially as the orthorhombic structure. KorB-C protein (15 μm) was treated with increasing concentrations of glutardialdehyde in a buffer consisting of 20 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5% glycerol. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, to a concentration of 100 mm. The products were reduced, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed on a 17.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Complex formation of KorB proteins with OB DNA was assayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A DNA digest containing equimolar amounts of fragments was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 3 or 9 pmol of KorB or with 2.5–45 pmol of either KorB-C or KorB-N and electrophoresed at 8 V cm−1 on a nondenaturing 3.5% PAGE containing 40 mm Tris-acetic acid, pH 7.9, 20 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA according to Balzer et al. (12Balzer D. Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Kruft V. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DNA bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The crystal structure of KorB-C, the C-terminal domain of the RP4-encoded repressor protein KorB, was determined in two space groups. After refinement, all residues lay in the allowed or favored region in the Ramachandran plot for both structures. Stereochemical parameters were calculated by PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (28Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 391: 272Crossref Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) and were in the range expected for structures with similar resolution. The orthorhombic structure was solved by multiple isomorphic replacement with contribution from the anomalous scattering of the platinum atoms. The asymmetric unit contains four copies of KorB-C. The final model consists of 1803 atoms and 250 solvent atoms. Of the expected 62 residues (297–358 of KorB), not all are visible in the electron density for each molecule. The N-terminal polypeptide region varies most, with molecule A starting from residue 305, molecules B and C from 302, and molecule D from 300. A number of side chains are not visible in the N-terminal region as well: the side chains of Lys305 and Lys306 of molecule A; those of Asp302, Lys303, and Lys306 of molecule B; those of Asp302, Lys303, and Lys305 of molecule C; and finally those of Asp300, Lys303, Lys305, Lys306, and Glu315 of molecule D. The flexibility of this part of the structure is also reflected in highB values in this area. The atomic displacement parameters assume values close to the mean B for all protein atoms at the start of strand β1.

The two KorB-C chains in the final model start with residues Asp300 and Pro299, respectively, in molecules A and B. As in the orthorhombic structure, some side chains in the N-terminal region are not visible, namely those of Lys305 in molecule A and those of Pro299, Lys305, and Lys306 in molecule B. The final model contains 968 protein and 120 solvent atoms. In P65, this structure was determined at 2.15-Å resolution with finalR/Rfree values of 15.2/22.7% and a diffraction component precision index of 0.28 Å. The following presentation of the KorB-C structure refers to chain D of the orthorhombic crystal form and the associated B/D dimer unless otherwise indicated, since they represent the most complete models seen at the higher resolution. KorB-C is folded into a five-stranded antiparallel all-β structure (Fig. 1). Strands β1, β2, β3, and β4 are arranged as an antiparallel up-and-down β-sheet with intervening loops of different length. The curvature of the strands and the pronounced left-handed twist of the sheet permit strand β5 to complete the fold by an antiparallel interaction on the free side of β1. Strands β1 and β2 are connected by loop L1 comprised of a β-turn (His313–Arg316), whereas a 10-residue loop (L2) links β2 to β3. This loop contains two β-turns, from Ile321 to Arg324 and from Ala328 to Tyr331. The short loop L3 is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds linking Tyr336oxygen with Gly340 nitrogen, Asp338Oδ1 with Asp339 nitrogen, and Asp339 Oδ2 with Gln341 nitrogen. Finally, the connection L4 between strands β4 and β5 contains a 310 helix of three residues (Leu347–Asp349). The KorB-C monomer is observed in six crystallographically independent copies, four times in the orthorhombic structure and twice in the hexagonal structure. All six copies share the general structural organization described above. This is evident from the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations between equivalent atoms in the six molecules after least-squares superposition (Table III). α-Carbon positions superimpose with r.m.s. distances of 0.5 ± 0.2 Å and all equivalent atoms with 0.95 ± 0.2 Å for all chains with the exception of chain A of orthorhombic KorB-C. This chain clearly differs in the conformation of its three C-terminal residues, but it is structurally similar to the other five elsewhere. The unique conformation of the C-terminal tripeptide of molecule A is not caused by unusual crystal contacts. Instead, it seems that the disorder of this molecule's N-terminal part, for which electron density is observed only from residue Lys305 onward, is correlated to the altered C-terminal structure of molecule A of KorB-C. Otherwise, the most pronounced differences between KorB-C monomers are in the N-terminal peptide region, which, in the orthorhombic structure, adopts an extended conformation for chains C and D (see Fig. 3a), whereas it is less ordered in chains A and B. The extended N-terminal peptide of monomers C and D is stabilized by interactions with loop L2 from the other subunit of a dimer (see below) and interacts with the C-terminal strand β5.Table IIIStructural comparison of KorB-C monomersP65P212121ABABCDP65A0.7901.4360.9751.1250.971B0.3011.5321.1721.1081.015P212121A1.1881.2101.4881.6231.437B0.5550.6421.2261.0110.911C0.5470.6601.3080.4110.994D0.5360.5621.2600.3650.326The least-squares superposition used residues 306–358 for each monomer.

This search clearly indicated significant similarity of the KorB-C structure with the SH3 fold, predominantly known from protein domains involved in eukaryotic signal transduction (31Musacchio A. Wilmanns M. Saraste M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 61: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) but occasionally also encountered in proteins from prokaryotes (32Baumann H. Knapp S.

Zheng J. äali A. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1995; 3: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Least-squares superpositions of KorB-C with these domains yield r.m.s. deviations between corresponding Cα atoms of 2.4 Å for the tyrosine kinase domain, 1.8 Å for the dihydrofolate reductase domain, 2.0 Å for HIV-1 integrase, and 1.8 Å for the SH3 domain from c-Crk. All of these structures are characterized by the typical antiparallel up-and-down β-sheet arrangement, which, in some cases, appears split in two sheets (one three-stranded and the other two-stranded) crossing each other at right angles. In addition, a three-residue 310 helix is often present between strands β4 and β5. These features are perfectly conserved in the crystal structure of KorB-C (Fig. 2). Missing in the KorB-C structure is the long loop between strands β1 and β2 that is known to be responsible for the binding of eukaryotic SH3 domains to the proline-rich motifs of other proteins during signal transduction (31Musacchio A. Wilmanns M. Saraste M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 61: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A second difference is the elongated strand β5 of KorB-C. This strand is crucial for the dimerization of KorB-C (see below). In addition, there is an N-terminal elongation of the polypeptide chain of KorB-C, which will make the connection to the preceding KorB domain and is very flexible in the isolated C-terminal domain. In the structure of KorB-C determined from orthorhombic crystals, the molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by noncrystallographic dyad axes. The KorB-C molecules in pairs A/C and B/D each are related by a 2-fold axis. A third 2-fold axis is found between the molecules A and C and, respectively, B and D. This axis is nearly, but not perfectly, parallel to the other axes and does not, therefore, establish 222-point symmetry. Instead, there are two similar pairs of KorB-C molecules, A/C and B/D (Fig.3a). In the hexagonal crystal form, two KorB-C molecules comprise the asymmetric unit. These two molecules (A and B) share the same arrangement with respect to each other with the molecule pairs A/C and B/D from the orthorhombic structure. The arrangement of six independent KorB-C molecules in two different crystal forms (P212121 and P65) thus follows one common pattern: a dimer formation involving molecule pairs A/C and B/D of orthorhombic KorB-C and A/B of hexagonal KorB-C, which is promoted mainly by interactions of residues from the C-terminal strand, β5. To examine which intermolecular interactions stabilize the observed dimer-like arrangement of KorB-C molecules (Fig.3b), the subunit interface was analyzed by the approach of Jones and Thornton (40Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 41Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

According to this analysis, 990 ± 90 Å2 of accessible surface are buried in the subunit interface for each of the six independent KorB-C subunits, corresponding to 23 ± 1% of the total accessible surface.

We have examined the effects of human heat shock proteins (Hsp40 and Hsp70) on the interaction of the herpes simplex virus type-1 initiator protein (UL9) with oriS, one of the viral origins of replication. Hsp40 and Hsp70 act substoichiometrically to increase the affinity of UL9 for oriS. The major contributor to this effect is Hsp40. Heat shock proteins also stimulate the ATPase activity of UL9 with oriS and increase opening of the origin. In contrast, heat shock proteins have no effect on the origin-independent activities of UL9 suggesting that their role is not merely in refolding denatured protein. These observations are consistent with a role for heat shock proteins in activating UL9 to efficiently initiate viral origin-dependent DNA replication. The action of heat shock proteins in this capacity is analogous to their role in activating the initiator proteins of other organisms.

HSV-1 encodes its own complement of DNA replication enzymes that promotes replication from discrete viral origins. It therefore provides a eukaryotic-based system in which to study the mechanism of origin unwinding. The virus-encoded proteins required for origin-dependent replication are: a heterodimeric DNA polymerase (UL30 and UL42), a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase (UL5, UL8, and UL52), a single strand DNA-binding protein, referred to as ICP8 (Infected Cell Polypeptide8) (UL29), and an initiator protein (UL9) that specifically recognizes elements within the origins and possesses ATPase and helicase activities (for reviews, see Refs. 1Boehmer P.E.

The origins are small (<100 bp) palindromic sequences that consist of a central A/T-rich region flanked by UL9-binding sites (5′-CGTTCGCACT) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that unwinding of oriS proceeds as follows. UL9 binds first to the high affinity recognition site, box I, followed by cooperative binding to the lower affinity site, box II (8Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol.

Protein-protein interactions between oriS-bound UL9 lead to bending of the origin and opening of the A/T-rich region (5Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, UL9 uses ATP to fuel its helicase activity to extrude single-stranded template from the base of the UL9 complex (5Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that ICP8 is an essential cofactor in this process (13Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14He X. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5726-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesize that host chaperones also play an important role in this process by modulating the oligomerization state of UL9 with possible implications on binding affinity and protein-protein interactions that lead to origin opening. Molecular chaperones have been classified into several families among which heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) are involved in several fundamental cellular processes such as protein folding, translocation across membranes, and assembly and disassembly of protein complexes. Hsp70 is a weak ATPase whose activity is increased upon interaction with short peptides of 8–9 residues (15Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4563-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Hsp40 family of proteins acts as co-chaperones of Hsp70, stimulating the intrinsic and peptide-dependent ATPase activities of Hsp70 via a conserved protein interaction domain (J-domain) (15Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4563-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but also exhibits independent activities (for review, see Ref. 16Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Studies on the involvement of chaperones in DNA replication have revealed that they can activate certain initiator proteins and influence the DNA binding activity of many proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 17Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar and 18Konieczny I. Zylicz M. Genet. Eng. 1999; 21: 95-111Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DnaK and DnaJ are homologs of eukaryotic Hsp70 and Hsp40, respectively. Both DnaK and DnaJ play important roles in the initiation of chromosomal replication from oriC and are essential for origin-specific initiation of replication of bacteriophage λ and plasmid P1 (19Malki A. Hughes P. Kohiyama M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Zylicz M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

The recent identification of an interaction between Hsp70 andSaccharomyces cerevisiae Orc4p suggests that regulation of eukaryotic initiator proteins may also require molecular chaperones (22Giraldo R. Díaz-Orejas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4938-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) during the replication of several viruses such as adenovirus and cytomegalovirus suggests that molecular chaperones function in viral replication (23Glotzer J.B. Saltik M. Chiocca S. Michou A.I. Moseley P. Cotten M. Nature. 2000; 407: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interactions between the human papillomavirus-11 (HPV-11) initiator protein (E1 helicase) and cellular chaperones occur through the J-domain of Hsp40 and stimulate formation of E1 double hexamers at the origin as well as viral replication in vitro (24Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Makhov A.M. Cyr D.M. Griffith J.D. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30704-30712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the role of chaperones in the initiation of viral replication is provided by the observation that simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen contains a functional J-domain that is required for efficient replication (25Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Studbal H. Zalvide J. Pipas J.M. Silver P.A. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. DeCaprio J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1098-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The heat shock response has also been implicated in herpes simplex virus replication. Thus, infection of rodent cells with HSV-1 and HSV-2 elevates Hsp70 mRNA levels within 4 h postinfection (26Kobayashi K. Ohgitani E. Tanaka Y. Kita M. Imanishi J. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 38: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, heat shock induces reactivation of latent HSV-1 in cultured cells (27Moriya A. Yoshiki A. Kita M. Fushiki S. Imanishi J. Arch. Virol. 1994; 135: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Halford W.P. Gebhardt B.M. Carr D.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5051-5060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that HSV-1 immediate early proteins ICP4, ICP0, and ICP27 are involved in Hsp70 induction (29Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5680-5692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, DNA microarray technology has been used to show the accumulation of transcripts for the stress-response protein GADD45 in HSV-1-infected human cells (30Khodarev N.N. Advani S.J. Gupta N. Roizman B. Weichselbaum R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12062-12067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Little is known about the consequences of induction of HSPs during HSV-1 infection. In the present work, we describe novel interactions between the HSV-1 initiator protein, UL9, and two major inducible products of the heat shock response, Hsp70 and Hsp40. These studies may help to understand the mechanisms by which replication initiates at an HSV-1 origin and of viral reactivation and have bearing on the initiation of replication in other systems.

M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was obtained from New England Biolabs. oriS-containing pGEM822 was as described previ- ously (31Sampson D.A. Arana M.E. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides PB-9 (22-mer, 5′-ACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC), PB-12 (80-mer, 5′-AATTCAAAAGAAGTGAGAACGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAATATATATATATTATTAGGGCGAAGTGCGAGCACTG), and PB-21 (20-mer, 5′-CCGGGCCTTTATGTGCGCCG) were obtained from Operon Technologies. (dT)60 was as described previously (37Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). oriS* DNA was formed by heating PB-12 in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl to 95 °C followed by gradual cooling to >30 °C (38Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The DNA helicase substrate was generated by annealing PB-9 to M13 mp18 ssDNA. PB-21 is complementary to positions 686–705 of HSV-1 oriS (39Wong S.W. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oriS-containing probe for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was a 176-bp EcoRI restriction fragment derived from pCG5 (40Hernandez T.R. Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. Gustafsson C. Elias P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was 3′-end-labeled with exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, [α-32P]dATP, and unlabeled dTTP. The concentration of the probe was determined by densitometry using the Alpha Innotech AlphaImager 2000 imaging system and a known amount of the same DNA as a standard. UL9-DNA complexes were formed in 10 μl containing 20 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl. The binding reactions were performed for 15 min at 37 °C with 100 fmol of oriS DNA. For experiments containing HSPs, the indicated amounts of HSPs and UL9 were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of DNA. Reactions were mixed with 3 μl of 80% glycerol containing 0.25% bromphenol blue and resolved by 1% agarose-Tris-acetate-EDTA gel electrophoresis at 4 °C and 5 V/cm. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman). The reaction products were analyzed and quantitated by storage phosphor analysis with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840. UL9-DNA complexes are expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity and are corrected for background by subtracting the activity obtained in the absence of UL9. ATP hydrolysis was determined using an enzyme-linked assay as described previously (37Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C and contained 20 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.3, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 200 μm NADH, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 40 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase, 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm UL9, 25 nm Hsp40 and Hsp70, and 250 nm ICP8, and 10 μm (nucleotide) DNA cofactor as indicated. The absorbance at 340 nm was converted to moles of ATP hydrolyzed using an extinction coefficient of 6,220 m−1 cm−1 for NADH. Assays were performed essentially as described previously (41Arana M.E. Haq B. Tanguy Le Gac N. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6840-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C and contained 25 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.3, 5.5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 nm (molecules) M13:PB-9 substrate, and proteins as indicated. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.3 volumes of 90 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K followed by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide-Tris-borate-EDTA gels. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman). The reaction products were analyzed and quantitated by storage phosphor analysis with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840. Distortion of the A/T-rich region of oriS was detected by the susceptibility of unpaired thymines to oxidation by potassium permanganate (11Koff A. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3284-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm EPPS-NaOH pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 100 nm Hsp40 and Hsp70, and UL9 as indicated. UL9 was preincubated in the absence or presence of Hsp40 and Hsp70. After 5 min at 37 °C, 1 μg of pGEM822 was added. Following a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, KMnO4 was added to 30 mm, and incubation continued for 3 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to 1 m. DNA samples were purified using the Wizard DNA clean-up system from Promega. Primer PB-21 was annealed to alkali-denatured DNA. Primed DNA was labeled with 2.5 units of Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA polymerase in the presence of 0.4 μm dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP and 25 μm [α-32P]dATP for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, DNA products were extended with 75 μm dNTP for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were resolved by 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reaction products were analyzed and quantitated by storage phosphor analysis with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840. The positions of primer extension products were compared with a sequencing ladder of PB-21-primed pGEM822. An EMSA was used to examine whether Hsp40 and Hsp70 had an effect on the origin binding activity of UL9. Fig.1 A shows that the mobility of the 176-bp oriS-containing probe was retarded with increasing concentrations of UL9. Depending on the duration of electrophoresis, two discernible UL9-DNA complexes were detected (see also Figs.2 A and 5 A). Based on previous studies, we believe these to be due to binding of UL9 first to the high affinity binding site box I followed by binding to box II (8Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the faster migrating UL9-DNA complex, which is formed at lower UL9 concentrations, is due to binding of UL9 to box I, while the slower migrating species, which is formed at higher UL9 concentrations, is due to binding of UL9 to both boxes I and II. Addition of Hsp40 and Hsp70 to the reactions led to efficient complex formation at lower concentrations of UL9. Careful resolution of the UL9-DNA complexes showed that HSPs did not affect the distribution of the two species (e.g. Fig. 2 A). Quantitation of the UL9-DNA complexes indicates that addition of HSPs reduced the amount of UL9 required for half-maximal binding from ∼200 to ∼40 nm, a factor of ∼5-fold (Fig. 1 B). Consequently, HSPs appear to increase the affinity of UL9 for the origin. Importantly, stimulation of the origin binding activity of UL9 was specific for HSPs since a concentration of BSA equivalent to that of total monomeric HSPs produced only a modest effect (∼2-fold), indicating that HSPs do not merely act by stabilizing the origin binding activity of UL9 (Fig. 1, C and D). However, addition of BSA enhanced the stimulation by HSPs, suggesting that nonspecific proteins contribute to the effect presumably by increasing protein stability (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, the data in Fig. 1, C and D, indicate that HSPs stimulated the origin binding activity of UL9 with a probe (oriS*) that contains only a single recognition site (38Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Figure 2HSPs have no effect on the stability of UL9-oriS complexes. A, EMSA was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with 50 nm UL9 in the absence or presence of 50 nm Hsp40 and Hsp70 as indicated. Ten minutes after addition of the probe, a 20-fold molar excess of oriS* DNA was added, and incubation continued at room temperature for the times indicated followed by immediate electrophoresis. The positions of free probe and of UL9-DNA complexes corresponding to binding of UL9 to box I (I) or to both boxes I and II (I+II) are as indicated. B, quantitation of the UL9-DNA complexes shown in A formed in the absence (empty circles) or presence (filled circles) of HSPs. Given the stimulation elicited by HSPs, the values were normalized to the level prior to addition of competitor DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5The monomeric C-terminal origin-binding domain of UL9 binds to the origin with high affinity and is not further stimulated by HSPs. A, EMSA was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with increasing concentrations of HisΔUL9 (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 nm, respectively) in the absence or presence of 100 nm Hsp40 and Hsp70 as indicated. The positions of free probe and of HisΔUL9-DNA complexes corresponding to binding of HisΔUL9 to box I (I) or to both boxes I and II (I+II) are as indicated. B, quantitation of the HisΔUL9-DNA complexes shown in Aformed in the absence (empty squares) or presence (filled squares) of HSPs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HSPs had no significant effect on the dissociation of UL9 from the origin. Fig. 2 shows that the half-life of the UL9-oriS complex in the absence or presence of HSPs was ∼5 min at room temperature in the presence of 20-fold excess oriS* competitor. This finding supports the notion that HSPs serve to increase the association of UL9 with oriS. Fig. 3 shows that near-maximal stimulation of the origin binding activity of UL9 was achieved at a concentration of HSPs that was 50-fold lower than that of UL9 (1 nm Hsp40 and Hsp70 versus 50 nm UL9, assuming that protein determination was accurate), suggesting that HSPs act substoichiometrically. Curve-fit analysis showed that the concentration required for half-maximal stimulation was 0.6 nm HSPs. Moreover, HSPs were more effective in stimulating origin binding when preincubated with UL9 than if the proteins were added simultaneously or if UL9 was permitted to bind to the origin prior to addition of HSPs (data not shown). The previous experiments were performed with equimolar Hsp40 and Hsp70. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 addresses the effect of each protein with 50 nm UL9. At this UL9 concentration, origin binding activity is far below saturation (see Fig. 1 B) and therefore allows detection of maximal stimulation. The data show that the major contributor to the stimulatory effect was Hsp40 with a small effect from Hsp70. Maximal stimulation was observed in the presence of both Hsp40 and Hsp70. Given the high degree of evolutionary conservation between HSPs, the action of equivalent concentrations of E. coli HSPs was compared with that of their human homologs. Interestingly, the stimulatory effects of the E. coli HSPs was similar to that of the human proteins with the major effect due to DnaJ and maximum stimulation produced by the combined action of DnaJ and DnaK. Moreover, E. coli GrpE, which has also been implicated in the initiation of λ and P1 replication (42Wyman C. Vasilikiotis C. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Echols H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25192-25196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sozhamannan S. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also stimulated the origin binding activity of UL9 and further increased the effect brought about by DnaJ and DnaK. Overall, depending on the concentration of UL9, Hsp70/DnaK stimulated origin binding activity ∼2-fold, while Hsp40/DnaJ produced a 3-fold effect. The combined action of both Hsp70/DnaK and Hsp40/DnaJ stimulated binding up to 5-fold. As already shown in Figs. 1 and 3, none of the HSPs alone or in combination exhibited any significant origin binding activity. As previously demonstrated, addition of ATP stimulated the origin binding activity of UL9 ∼2-fold but had no effect on the stimulation by Hsp40 and/or Hsp70 (data not shown) (44Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of techniques, including gel-filtration chromatography, glycerol-gradient sedimentation, and electron microscopy have been used to demonstrate that UL9 exists as a dimer in solution (3Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J.

Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HSPs have previously been shown to activate the initiator proteins of other systems by converting oligomeric species into monomeric protein (21Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Banecki B. Kaguni J.M. Marszalek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is possible that HSPs modulate the oligomerization state of UL9, thereby stimulating its origin binding activity. As a first attempt to address this possibility, the effect of HSPs on the origin binding activity of a monomeric UL9 deletion mutant (HisΔUL9) was examined. HisΔUL9 encompasses only the C-terminal origin-binding domain of UL9 and has been shown to be monomeric in solution (8Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the function of HSPs is to monomerize UL9 to generate high affinity origin-binding protomers, HisΔUL9 should not be affected by HSPs and behave similarly to HSP-stimulated wild-type UL9. Fig. 5shows that there was no effect of HSPs on the origin binding activity of HisΔUL9. HisΔUL9 reached half-maximal binding at ∼10 nm, indicating that it binds to the origin with even higher affinity than wild-type UL9 stimulated by HSPs (Fig.5 B). The above experiments demonstrate that HSPs can enhance the binding of UL9 to the origin. To determine whether HSPs can stimulate the function of UL9 at the origin, their effect on the origin-dependent ATPase activity of UL9 was examined. The origin-containing DNA cofactor used in these experiments was oriS*, a putative intermediate in origin unwinding, that has previously been shown to act efficiently as a substrate for the origin binding and ATPase activities of UL9 (38Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The data in Fig.6 A show that oriS* stimulated the ATPase activity of UL9. Importantly, addition of Hsp40 and Hsp70 significantly increased the ATPase activity of UL9 with oriS*. In contrast, there was no effect of HSPs on the DNA-independent ATPase activity of UL9. Moreover, under the specified reaction conditions, HSPs alone did not exhibit significant ATPase activity either in the absence or presence of oriS*. ICP8, the HSV-1-encoded single strand DNA-binding protein, has previously been shown to specifically stimulate the nonspecific ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of UL9 (37Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Arana M.E. Haq B. Tanguy Le Gac N. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6840-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 B shows that ICP8 also stimulated the origin-dependent ATPase activity of UL9. Consistent with the data in Fig. 6 A, addition of HSPs to a reaction with UL9 and ICP8 further stimulated ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6 B). The effect of HSPs on the origin-dependent ATPase activity of UL9 was also examined in the presence of K+, which is an essential cofactor for the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (47Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schonfeld H.J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, substitution of 50 mm NaCl with 50 mm KCl stimulated the activity of UL9 (Fig. 6 B). Likewise, KCl elicited a larger stimulation in the presence of ICP8 and HSPs (Fig. 6 B). However, the magnitude of the effect of HSPs was similar in the presence of NaCl or KCl, indicating that the main function of K+ was in stimulating UL9 and not for the effect of HSPs. Substitution of 50 mm NaCl with 50 mm KCl also led to 5.5-fold stimulation in the origin binding activity of UL9. The increase in ATP hydrolysis observed in the presence of HSPs was probably due to the ATPase activity of UL9 rather than that of Hsp70 since at 25 μm ATP, which is ∼20-fold lower than theK m for ATP of UL9 (41Arana M.E. Haq B. Tanguy Le Gac N. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6840-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but sufficiently high to elicit near V max ATPase activity of Hsp70 (15Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4563-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the effect of HSPs on ATP hydrolysis was greatly reduced (Fig.6 C). There was no effect of Hsp40 and Hsp70 on the nonspecific ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of UL9 (Fig.7 A). Both in the absence and presence of HSPs the rate of ATP hydrolysis with (dT)60 was 1.8 pmol/s. Similarly, HSPs did not affect the nonspecific DNA helicase activity of UL9 (Fig. 7 B). The findings that HSPs only stimulate origin-dependent activities but have no effect on the nonspecific activities of UL9 indicate that they do not merely act as chaperones to refold denatured protein. UL9 has previously been shown to bend and distort the origin as a first step in the unwinding process (5Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Koff A. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3284-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Distortion of the A/T-rich region in the origin may be detected by the susceptibility of unpaired bases to single strand-specific nucleases or reagents such as potassium permanganate, which oxidizes unpaired thymine residues thereby creating stop sites for a DNA polymerase in a primer extension assay (11Koff A. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3284-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.8 A shows that there was no potassium permanganate sensitivity in the A/T-rich region in the absence of UL9 or with HSPs alone. However, increasing UL9 concentrations led to potassium permanganate-induced stop sites. Addition of Hsp40 and Hsp70 enhanced the UL9-dependent sensitivity of the A/T-rich region to potassium permanganate. Quantitation of the signal corresponding to the A/T-rich region indicates that HSPs induced their maximal effect (2.5-fold stimulation) at low UL9 concentrations at which the signal is not saturated (Fig.8 B). In the present work, we describe that Hsp40 and Hsp70 act catalytically and in concert to increase the affinity of UL9 for oriS. The major contributor to this effect is Hsp40. We also observe that HSPs stimulate the activities of UL9 at the origin (origin-dependent ATPase and opening of the origin). It is unlikely that the stimulation by HSPs is merely the result of refolding of denatured UL9 since there was no effect of Hsp40 and Hsp70 on the origin-independent DNA helicase and ATPase activities of UL9. These findings illustrate a potential mechanism, similar to what has been described for plasmid P1 replication among others, whereby HSV-1 origin-dependent replication is regulated by the action of HSPs. Plasmid P1 is a system in which the role of HSPs in origin-dependent initiation has been studied in great depth. In this system, the first regulatory step entails the dissociation of RepA dimers into active monomers by the action ofE. coli Hsp40 (DnaJ) and Hsp70 (DnaK) homologs (21Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE function in the initiation pathway of bacteriophage λ by releasing DnaB helicase from the initiation complex to enable unwinding of the origin (42Wyman C. Vasilikiotis C. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Echols H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25192-25196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case oforiC-dependent replication in E. coli, HSPs have been shown to play a multifaceted role. For example, DnaK prevents self-aggregation of the initiator protein, DnaA (45Banecki B. Kaguni J.M. Marszalek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Involvement of HSPs in the initiation of origin-dependent replication has recently been realized with eukaryotic viruses. Hence, in the case of SV40, efficient replication depends on the presence of a J-domain in large T antigen, which presumably serves in the assembly of a functional hexamer at the origin, and may be further aided by Hsp70 (25Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Studbal H. Zalvide J. Pipas J.M. Silver P.A. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. DeCaprio J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1098-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings, the origin binding activity of the HPV-11 initiator E1 is stimulated preferentially by Hsp40 and to a lesser extent by Hsp70 (24Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Makhov A.M. Cyr D.M. Griffith J.D. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30704-30712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fact, a peptide encompassing the J-domain of Hsp40 was sufficient in stimulating E1. Consequently, the J-domain of Hsp40 may also mediate interactions between Hsp40 and UL9. By analogy to other replication systems, a possible mechanism by which HSPs stimulate UL9 may be by modulating its dimerization status, activating its binding to the origin by formation of monomers. This notion is supported by our finding that HSPs have no effect on the origin binding activity of a monomeric mutant UL9 that exhibits origin binding properties similar to those of HSP-stimulated wild-type UL9. The importance of the oligomerization status of initiator proteins was recently addressed with the π plasmid initiator protein. In that study it was shown that π monomers preferentially bound to the γ origin and facilitated opening of its A/T-rich region (48Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, HSPs also play an active role in converting RepA dimers into active monomers and prevent aggregation of DnaA (21Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Banecki B. Kaguni J.M. Marszalek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, the J-domain of Hsp40 was shown to induce the formation of double hexamers of E1 at the HPV-11 origin (24Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Makhov A.M. Cyr D.M. Griffith J.D. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30704-30712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that origin opening (potassium permanganate sensitivity) is directly related to the amount of UL9 bound to the origin. Maximal stimulation of origin opening by HSPs was observed at low UL9 concentrations, indicating that the effect of HSPs on origin opening is secondary and that their main function is to increase origin binding. This notion is supported by our observation that, given the resolution of our assay, interactions between HSPs and UL9 affected neither the mobility of the UL9-DNA complexes nor their stability. Therefore, it is unlikely that the interactions between HSPs and UL9 affect the conformation of the initiator complexes once bound to the origin. Since no specific induction of Hsp40 during HSV-1 infection has previously been reported, we do not know at this point whether Hsp40 actually participates in HSV-1 initiation in vivo. The stimulation of UL9 binding to the origin by E. coli DnaJ suggests that the functional interaction we observe is not limited to the inducible form of Hsp40 used in the present study. It is possible that different members of the Hsp40 family or other J-domain-containing proteins could fulfill this function in vivo. In any case, in light of the requirement for efficient viral replication of a J-domain in SV40 large T antigen and the stimulation of HPV-11 replication by the J-domain, it appears that Hsp40 may be a conserved theme in the replication of eukaryotic DNA viruses. Our results implicate the direct participation of HSPs in the interaction of UL9 with the origins and thereby suggest a mechanism by which the initiation of viral replication may be regulated. We propose that our current results with the HSV-1 system corroborate previous findings with other eukaryotic viruses (SV40 and HPV-11) and may have general implications for the role of HSPs in the initiation of eukaryotic chromosomal replication as indicated by the interaction of Hsp70 with S. cerevisiae Orc4p (22Giraldo R. Díaz-Orejas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4938-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, it is noteworthy to mention that while the participation of host chaperones in the replication of SV40 and HPV-11 may not be unexpected, given their dependence on host enzymes, the proposed role of HSPs in herpesvirus replication is unexpected since this class of virus encodes it own DNA replication machinery."

MEG2 activity, as determined by immunoprecipitation and in vitro phosphatase assays, is inhibited after exposure of cells to the particulate stimulant opsonized zymosan or to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but largely unaffected by the chemoattractantN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyalanine. Studies using bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase MEG2 fusion protein indicate that cysteine 515 is essential for catalytic activity, whereas the noncatalytic (N-terminal) domain of MEG2 negatively regulates the enzymatic activity of the C-terminal phosphatase domain. The activity of MEG2 is enhanced by specific polyphosphoinositides with the order of potency being phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-diphosphate > PI 3,4,5-triphosphate > PI 4-phosphate. MEG2 associates at an early stage with nascent phagosomes. Taken together, our results indicate that MEG2 is a polyphosphoinositide-activated tyrosine phosphatase that may be involved in signaling events regulating phagocytosis, an essential antimicrobial function in the innate immune response. Signaling pathways involving reversible tyrosine phosphorylation are essential for neutrophil antimicrobial responses. Using reverse transcriptase PCR, expression of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase MEG2 by peripheral neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was identified.

To function in host defense, they have evolved a variety of mechanisms, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing of invading microbial pathogens. Paradoxically, unregulated activation of these responses can result in tissue injury, as is believed to occur in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (1Weissmann G. Korchak H.

The level of tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by the reciprocal activities of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK)1 and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP).

MEG2 is a nonreceptor PTP originally cloned from human endothelial cell and megakaryocyte cell lines (21Gu M. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The C-terminal region of MEG2 contains the conserved PTP catalytic domain whereas the N-terminal domain has significant homology to yeast SEC14p (24Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J.

The expression of MEG2 by peripheral blood neutrophils in concert with the homology of MEG2 with the lipid binding proteins SEC14p and CRALBP suggested to us a potential functional role for MEG2 in membrane transport or fusion events involved in myeloid cell function. The objectives of the current study were to characterize the subcellular localization of MEG2 and to begin to elucidate its function in myeloid cells. Our results indicate that MEG2 is present in both the cytosol and granules and becomes incorporated into nascent phagosomes. The activity of MEG2 is enhanced by the polyphosphoinositides PI 4,5-P2, PI 3,4,5-P3, and PI 4-P. These observations suggest a role for MEG2 in the regulation of signaling pathways involved in phagocytosis.

Human neutrophils were isolated from whole blood obtained by venipuncture and anticoagulated with citrate. Dextran sedimentation and discontinuous plasma-Percoll gradients were used as previously described (31Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining monocyte-lymphocyte band was collected and passed through a human CD4 immunocolumn (Cedarlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) to isolate CD4+T-lymphocytes. The purity of the neutrophils isolated exceeded 98% as determined by modified Wright-Giemsa staining of cytocentrifuge preparations. The purity of the CD4+ T-lymphocytes exceeded 85% as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. After isolation, cells were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate dextrose buffer with glucose at a concentration of 8 × 106 cells/ml and gently rotated at room temperature until used (generally within 1 h). HL-60 and U937 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 0.5 mm l-glutamine. Total RNA was isolated from human peripheral blood neutrophils and HL-60 cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride protocol (32Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar, 33Groppe J.C. Morse D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Degenerate primers were designed targeting highly conserved sequences in the catalytic domain of PTP. The primer sequences correspond to the amino acid sequences DYINAS and VHCSAG and were as follows: forward primer (5′-GCGGGATCCGA(T/C)TA(T/C)AT(T/C)AA(T/C)GCIAG(T/C)TT-3′); reverse primer (5′-GCGGAATTCA(T/C)ICCIGC(A/G)CT(A/G)CA(A/G)TGIAC-3′). Two sets of primers were also designed for PTP MEG2 (GenBankTM accession number M83738). Primers for set 1 corresponded to base pairs 943–1124 of the cDNA sequence and were as follows: forward primer (5′-GAGGAATGGACTGGTGTTTATC-3′); reverse primer (5′-GGAGGAGACTGATGATGGAATA-3′). Primers for set 2 corresponded to base pairs 1402–1589 of the cDNA sequence and were as follows: forward primer (5′-GCAAAAGCAAGGAATCTATGAG-3′); reverse primer (5′-TGGCATTGATGTAATCTGTCTG-3′). cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA isolated from human peripheral blood neutrophils and HL-60 cells. Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) reverse transcriptase, and random hexamers from the Gene Amp RNA PCR kit were used for the reaction, which was carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Emeryville, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transcribed cDNA was then amplified using the degenerate primers for an initial five cycles with the following parameters: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 42 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Another 30 cycles followed with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Transcribed cDNA was amplified using MEG2 primer sets 1 and 2 for 35 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. All components of the amplification mixtures were tested for contamination by running 35 PCR cycles in absence of the template RNA. Genomic DNA contamination was tested for by performing the RT-PCR in absence of the MuLV reverse transcriptase. All reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide staining. Amplified cDNA sequences from the RT-PCR were cloned into the Invitrogen TA vector. Sequencing of inserts from 150 individual clones was performed using the Pharmacia T7 sequencing kit. Automated fluorescence sequencing was additionally performed on selected sequences at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Toronto. The cloned MEG2 cDNA in pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) was received as a gift from P. Majerus (Washington University School of Medicine). The MEG2 insert was then transferred to the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). An XhoI restriction site was added to 5′-end of the MEG2 insert. A 3′-primer (CCCCCTCGAGTTACGCATAGTCAGGAACATCGTATGGGTACTGACTCTCCACGGCCAGCAGG) was constructed containing the final 24 bp of the coding MEG2 sequence, the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence, a stop codon, and an XhoI restriction site. A 5′-primer (GGCAGAAACGCCAGGTGACCC) was synthesized that targeted an upstream region in the MEG2 cDNA containing aBstEII restriction site. Twenty-five cycles of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed with denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min using Pfu polymerase. The PCR product was double-digested (BstEII, XhoI) and ligated into the MEG2-pcDNA3 construct in place of the existingBstEII-XhoI sequence in the native MEG2 sequence. A 5′-primer (TTTTCGGAATTCATGGAGCCCGCCACCGCG) was synthesized containing anEcoRI site immediately followed by the first 18 bp of the coding MEG2 sequence. A 3′-primer (ACTTGCGAATTCTTACTGACTCTCCACGGC) was synthesized containing the final 15 bp of the coding MEG2 sequence immediately followed by a stop codon and an EcoRI site. Twenty-five cycles of PCR were performed with denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing at 53 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min using Pfu polymerase and the MEG2-Bluescript construct as a template. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Bai D'Urfey, Quebec). A catalytically inactive pGEX-MEG2 construct was constructed using a 3′-primer (CAGAAGGTACCTGTCCTGCCAATGCCTGCACTGCTATGGA), which coded for a T to A substitution at position 1543 of the MEG2-coding cDNA sequence thus converting the cysteine 515 to serine. PCR was performed (as above) using a 5′-primer (TTTTCGGAATTCATGTATGAAGACATTCGTCGT) targeting bp 919–936 and the pGEX-wild type MEG2 construct as template DNA. TheBstEII-KpnI region of the PCR product was used to replace the corresponding region in the pGEX-wild type MEG2 construct. A pGEX construct containing the MEG2 noncatalytic domain and a histidine tag was developed using a 5′-primer (TTTTCGGAATTCATGGAGCCCGCGACCGCG) containing a EcoRI site immediately followed by the first 18 bp of the coding MEG2 sequence. The 3′-primer (CCCCCTCGAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGATCCTCTGGTCATAGCATGGGGACCTGG) contained bp 841–861 of the MEG2 coding sequence, a 6xHis tag, a stop codon, and an XhoI site. The pGEX-WTMEG2 construct was used as a template. The PCR product was double-digested withEcoRI and XhoI and ligated with the corresponding sites of the pGEX-4T1 vector. A pGEX construct containing the MEG2 phosphatase domain and a hemagglutinin tag was developed using a 5′-primer (TTTTCGGAATTCATGACCATCCAAGAGTTG) containing aEcoRI site immediately followed by the bp 859–873 of the coding MEG2 sequence. The 3′-primer (CCCCCTCGAGTTACGCATAGTCAGGAACATCGTATGGGTACTGACTCTCCACGGCCAGCAGG) contained the final 24 bp of the coding MEG2 sequence, the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence, a stop codon, and an XhoI restriction site. The pcDNA3-wild type MEG2-HA tag construct was used as a template. The PCR product was double-digested withEcoRI and XhoI and ligated with the corresponding sites of the pGEX-4T1 vector. Bacteria were cultured in LB media (containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin) and grown to an OD of 0.6–0.8. Samples were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, shaking at room temperature. Bacteria were centrifuged (3500 rpm in a Beckman GPR centrifuge), washed once in STE buffer (10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and stored overnight as pellets at −80 °C. The following day the pellets were resuspended in a lysozyme buffer (100 μg/ml hen egg-white lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin in STE buffer) for 15 min. DTT (5 mm) and Triton X-100 (1%) were added, then samples were incubated for 15 min. MgCl2 (10 mm) and DNase I (10 μg/ml) were added, and samples were allowed to incubate for a final 15 min. After centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was recovered and combined with glutathione-Sepharose (1 ml of packed beads per liter of bacteria) for 30 min. The Sepharose beads were sedimented (500 × g, 5 min) and washed three times in STE buffer. Fusion protein was eluted by resuspension of the beads in a buffer containing 75 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. All steps were done at 4 °C. A whole-molecule MEG2 antibody was produced as follows: The GST-wild type MEG2 protein was used to immunize three rabbits. Primary immunizations consisted of 1 mg of fusion protein combined with Freund's complete adjuvant. Subsequent boosts were performed at 3-week intervals using 0.5 mg of protein mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The rabbits were bled at 4- to 8-week intervals, and the resulting serum was tested by probing immunoblots of MEG2-transfected cell lysates. A peptide antibody targeting the MEG2 N terminus was produced as follows: The Kyte-Doolittle, Hopp-Woods, and Surface algorithms were used to select a 20-amino acid region of the MEG2 sequence for immunization. The sequence consisting of amino acids 63–82 (ELFHSYRETRRKEGIVKLKP) was identified. This peptide was synthesized and used for immunization of two rabbits. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was coupled as a carrier protein through a cysteine added at the peptide N terminus. Three bleeds (including a preimmune bleed) were obtained from the rabbits, from which the serum was prepared. Immunoreactivity against the immunizing peptide was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by the manufacturer (Synpep Corp., Dublin, CA). Specific tyrosine phosphatase activities were determined for MEG2 present in the immunoprecipitates as follows: optical densities were converted to units of phosphate released per 1 × 106cells by using a standard curve based on known phosphate concentrations. Background values for nonimmune IgG immunoprecipitates were subtracted from the values. GST-wild type MEG2 fusion protein was covalently linked onto a glutathione-agarose column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For each antibody purification, 1 ml of immune serum was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and then diluted with an equal volume of binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl). The sample was loaded onto the column and allowed to incubate in the gel matrix for 1 h at room temperature. The column was then washed with 100 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 5.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) after which the antibody was eluted into 1-ml fractions using Gentle Elution Buffer (Pierce). After analyzing the samples at 280 nm, fractions with high protein concentrations were pooled and dialyzed extensively against binding buffer. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (34Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Western blots were then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Prior to fixation, neutrophils were pretreated in 2.5 mm DFP for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were fixed in 1.6% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then washed with PBS. Cells (75,000) were cytospun for 5 min at 800 rpm onto glass slides and then incubated in a permeabilization/blocking buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% skim milk in PBS) for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were incubated with primary antibody (diluted in 10% skim milk, 0.2% Tween 20, in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then washed 3 × 5 min in wash buffer (10% skim milk, 0.2% Tween 20, in PBS) and then incubated with secondary antibody diluted in wash buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed three times with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS and then mounted (Dako mounting medium). Fluorescent images were captured using a Hamamatsu Orca cooled charge-coupled device camera mounted on a Leica DMIRB inverted fluorescence microscope. For each condition, 1 × 107 neutrophils were pretreated in 2.5 mm DFP for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were disrupted in cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 1 mmPMSF) and cleared of insoluble material by two successive centrifugations (22,000 × g × 15 min, 4 °C). Complexes of anti-MEG2 antibody pre-bound to Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads were added to the cleared supernatant. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, after which the beads were separated and extensively washed. One-fifth of the bead volume was removed and used for immunoblot analysis by resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The blots were probed with a 1:2000 dilution of MEG2 63–82 antibody followed by washing and then incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled Protein A (Bio-Rad). The remaining beads were sedimented and resuspended in assay buffer containing 0.1 mmphosphopeptide (RRLIEDAEpYAARG) and 60 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Samples were shaken for 3 h at 37 °C and centrifuged briefly. For endogenous phosphatase assays, Malachite Green was used to detect free phosphate released from the phosphopeptide by measurement of absorbance at 650 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Malachite Green was used in these assays due to its sensitivity. Neutrophil subcellular fractionation was performed according to the method of Kjeldsenet al. (35Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Lollike K.

Briefly, neutrophils were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, and the postnuclear supernatant applied on top of a three-layer Percoll gradient (1.05/1.09/1.12 g/ml). Centrifugation at 37,000 × gfor 30 min yielded four separate bands corresponding to the primary, secondary, and tertiary granules and a mixture of secretory vesicles and plasma membranes. Each fraction was assayed for markers of the corresponding subcellular compartment as described previously (36Sengelov H. Kjeldsen L. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Borregaard N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Percoll was removed from the samples by centrifugation, and the remaining biological material was mixed with boiling, 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Phosphatase activity was assessed by incubation of the fusion protein in an assay buffer containing: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) substrate, and 10 mm DTT. Samples were incubated for 30 min shaking at 37 °C, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. To test the effect of lipids on phosphatase activity, lipids were dissolved in methanol (10 μg/ml) and used to coat octyl-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in water and six times with assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and incubated with 10 pmol of each fusion protein for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, pNPP (10 mg/ml) and DTT (10 mm) were added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected and the absorbance at 405 nm determined. Phosphatidylcholine liposomes containing additional test lipids as a minor molar constituent (5% molar concentration) were prepared by evaporating lipid mixtures in a rotary evaporator followed by resuspension in an assay b"

Cyclin D1, which regulates cell proliferation in many cells, also drives the proliferation of photoreceptor progenitors. In the mouse retina, cyclin D1 protein normally decreases as photoreceptors mature. To study the importance of the down-regulation of cyclin D1 during photoreceptor development, we generated a transgenic mouse in which cyclin D1 was persistently expressed in developing photoreceptor cells. We observed numerous abnormalities in both photoreceptors and other nonphotoreceptor cells in the retina of these transgenic mice. In particular, we observed delayed opsin expression in developing photoreceptors and alterations in their number and morphology in the mature retina. These alterations were accompanied by disorganization of the inner nuclear and plexiform layers. The expression of cyclin D1 caused excess photoreceptor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene decreased cyclin D1-induced apoptosis and led to microscopic hyperplasia in the retina. These findings are distinct from other mouse models in which the retinoblastoma gene pathway is disrupted and suggest that the IRBP-cyclin D1 mouse model may recapitulate an early step in the development of retinoblastoma."

Regulated assembly and sequential phosphorylation of their components transduce signals through these pathways, leading to the phosphorylation, activation, and translocation to the nucleus of the effector MAP kinases, whose major examples in mammals are the ERK1/2, p38s, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAP kinases (1English J.

The genetic analysis of nonmammalian organisms has been instrumental in the definition of the role of MAP kinases in cell development. For example, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two major MAP kinases, FUS3 and HOG1 (homologous of mammalian ERK2 and p38α, respectively), regulate mating and the response to osmotic stress, respectively (6Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the D. melanogaster Rolled MAP kinase (homologous to mammalian ERK2) is required for the correct determination of the R7 photoreceptor cell fate in the eye disc, and D-p38 MAP kinases have been involved in wing and egg development, as well as on the stress and antimicrobial responses of the fly (8Wassarman D.A.

Genetic screenings have been performed inS. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster to identify gain-of-function FUS3 and rolled alleles on the basis of hypersensitivity to mating pheromone in the yeast or overabundance of R7-like cells in the fly. From these studies, conserved gain-of-function mutations of these MAP kinases have been identified, D317N (or D317G) in Saccharomyces and the analogous D334N (sevenmaker) in Drosophila, which result in hyperactive MAP kinases (11Brill J.A.

An analogous gain-of-function mutation, D319N (mouse sequence) has also been defined in mammalian ERK2 and found to be insensitive to inactivation by phosphatases (15Bott C.M. Thorneycroft S.G. Marshall C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). More recently, a second gain-of-function,sevenmaker-like mutation (D175N), has also been identified in Drosophila (14Lim Y.-M. Nishizawa K. Nishi Y. Tsuda L. Inoue Y.H. Hishida Y. Genetics. 1999; 153: 763-771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A major checkpoint to control the signaling through the MAP kinase pathways involves the direct regulation of both the catalytic activity and the subcellular location of the effector MAP kinases. Thus, although the enzymatic activity and the nucleocytoplasm transport of MAP kinases are independent processes, their regulation occurs simultaneously under physiologic circumstances. For example, the catalytic activity of ERK2 is up-regulated by phosphorylation of their threonine and tyrosine regulatory residues by the MEK1/2 MAP kinase kinases (17Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar); in addition, as a consequence of such phosphorylation, the translocation of ERK2 into the nucleus is triggered, likely by favoring ERK2 dimerization and/or by modifying its association with cytoplasmic or nuclear anchoring proteins (18Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 19Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). On the other hand, down-regulation of the catalytic activity of ERK2 is achieved by dephosphorylation of the kinase regulatory residues by specific phosphatases, including dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) and the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL, STEP, and HePTP/LC-PTP (22Camps M.

Remarkably, these ERK2 effectors not only modulate the enzymatic activity of ERK2 but also anchor this MAP kinase to specific subcellular compartments, influencing their nuclear translocation and signaling (25Blanco-Aparicio C.

Recently, the amino acid determinants involved in the direct association between the MAP kinases and the activating MAP kinase kinases or inactivating phosphatases have begun to be identified. In ERK2 and p38α, a C-terminal docking groove, that contains a common docking motif highly conserved between MAP kinases has been shown to mediate binding to effectors (30Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 31Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E.

Catling A.D. Assanah M.C. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the gain-of-function mutations of ERK2 identified in yeast and Drosophila target the C-terminal docking motifs of the molecule. In addition, conserved docking sites for ERK1/2 and p38α have been identified in the noncatalytic domains of MAP kinase kinases, MKPs, and the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL, STEP, and HePTP/LC-PTP (29Zúñiga Á.

It is postulated that the selective docking of MAP kinases with their effectors through these conserved motifs may play a major role in the definition of the specificity of the MAP kinases signal outputs (1English J.

In this report, we have identified the molecular determinants at the docking grooves of ERK2 and p38α that are important for their association with the PTP-SL and STEP tyrosine phosphatases. In addition, we have investigated the biological properties of putative gain-of-function-like mutations of mammalian ERK2 and p38α and their physical and functional association with PTP-SL and STEP. Our results provide an insight into the molecular basis of the physiological regulation of the MAP kinases functions by their physical association to effectors.DISCUSSIONConstitutively active forms of signal-regulated protein kinases may play a determinant role in the unbalancing of pivotal cell signaling pathways, leading to abnormal cell growth- and development-related diseases. Although constitutively active variants of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 have not been identified, gain-of-function mutations have been defined on the S. cerevisiae FUS3 gene, homologous to the mammalian ERK2 gene, that confer hypersensitivity to the yeast mating pheromone that activates the FUS3 pathway. FUS3 gain-of-function dominant alleles include the mutations D48N, I161L, D227N, and D317N (or D317G), which have been associated, at the molecular level, with tyrosine hyperphosphorylation of the FUS3 protein (11Brill J.A. Elion E.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 5: 297-312Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Hall J.P. Cherkasova V. Elion E. Gustin M.C. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, two gain-of-function mutations, D175N and D334N, have been identified on theERK2-homologous rolled gene of D. melanogaster, which accounts for the abnormalsevenmaker eye phenotype of the fly (12Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 14Lim Y.-M. Nishizawa K. Nishi Y. Tsuda L. Inoue Y.H. Hishida Y. Genetics. 1999; 153: 763-771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the D334N rolled mutation is also hyperphosphorylated in tyrosine, and both the D317G FUS3 and the D334N Rolledmutations have been found to be insensitive to an inhibitory mechanism, likely mediated by tyrosine or dual specificity phosphatases (13Hall J.P. Cherkasova V. Elion E. Gustin M.C. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 45Oellers N. Hafen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24939-24944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the effect of putative mammalian ERK2 gain-of-function-like mutations (14Lim Y.-M. Nishizawa K. Nishi Y. Tsuda L. Inoue Y.H. Hishida Y. Genetics. 1999; 153: 763-771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) on its regulable phosphorylation and kinase activity, as well as on its capability to bind and to be inactivated by the mammalian tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL and STEP, two docking-dependent substrates and regulators of ERK1/2 and p38α MAP kinases (29Zúñiga Á. Torres J. Úbeda J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Pulido R. Zúñiga Á. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (a summary of our results is shown in Table II). The ERK2 mutations E58Q, V171L, and H230N (analogous to the gain-of-function FUS3 mutations D48N, I161L, and D227N, respectively) or the ERK2 mutation D160N (analogous to the gain-of-function Rolled D175N mutation) did not show an overactive phenotype in our studies. Furthermore, the ERK2 mutation V171L, although properly phosphorylated in the ERK2 regulatory residues, displayed very low kinase activity, indicating that this mutation behaves as a loss-of-function ERK2 allele in mammals, likely by influencing the folding of the nearby activation loop, as has been proposed for other ERK2 loss-of-function mutations (46Krishnan I.S. Kovacs E.D. Sass P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Variations on the physiological regulation of the MAP kinases activities may exist between yeast and mammalian cells that account for these differences in gain-of-function-related mutations. As previously reported by others (15Bott C.M. Thorneycroft S.G. Marshall C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), the mouse ERK2 D319N mutation (analogous to the D334Nsevenmaker mutation of the fly) conferred a gain-of-function-like phenotype to the molecule. In addition, our mutagenesis analysis revealed that other amino acid substitutions of the Asp319 ERK2 residue, such as the conservative and nonconservative mutations D319E and D319A, as well as an amino acid substitution of the Asp316 residue (D316N mutation), also rendered a modest gain-of-function-like phenotype.A common docking site has been identified in the C-terminal domain of MAP kinases that binds substrates, activators, and regulators (Ref. 30Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholarand Fig. 7). This docking motif includes the Asp316 and Asp319 residues important for the gain-of-function ERK2 phenotype, and mutations at these residues abrogate the association of ERK2 with its effectors. We have found that the Asp319 residue of ERK2 (and to a lesser extent, the Asp316 and the Pro321 ERK2 residues), as well as the Asp316 residue of p38α, is important for binding to the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL and STEP. Interestingly, both conservative and nonconservative substitutions at the Asp319 residue of ERK2 abrogated PTP-SL binding, indicating that this residue is necessary for binding to PTP-SL. In addition, we have identified the Asp160, as well as the Leu161, as important residues mediating ERK2 binding to PTP-SL and STEP. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of MAP kinase family members, adjacent to the Asp319 and Asp160 residues (Fig. 7) shows that the Asp319residue is conserved on several MAP kinases, including those (ERK2 and p38α) known to bind to PTP-SL but not on those (c-Jun N-terminal kinase isoforms) that do not associate with this PTP. On the other hand, the ERK2 Asp160 residue is substituted by Glu163 in p38α, and we show that the ERK2 D160E mutation is permissive for the association with PTP-SL. It is conceivable that modifications of the Asp319 residue affect more dramatically the association of ERK2 with some of its effectors than modifications of the Asp160 residue, which could serve as a secondary docking element conferring additional specificity to the interaction. These could explain the milder gain-of-function phenotype observed in the Drosophila D175N mutation, compared with the D334N mutation (14Lim Y.-M. Nishizawa K. Nishi Y. Tsuda L. Inoue Y.H. Hishida Y. Genetics. 1999; 153: 763-771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the lack of hyperactivity observed in the mouse D160N mutation (this study; see also below). In this regard, we have observed that the effect of the D160N ERK2 mutation on the association of ERK2 with PTP-SL and STEP is consistently less strong than that of the D319N mutation (Fig. 4B). A recent report has identified p38α residues (ED motif), adjacent to the Glu163 residue that are involved in the docking interaction between p38α and its upstream activator MAPKAPK-3/3pk; together with the C-terminal common docking motif, these residues would generate the major determinants of specificity that are present in the MAP kinase common docking groove (31Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our results are in concordance with this model and further emphasize the importance of at least two clusters of residues at the MAP kinases docking grooves in the specific binding to both activators and inactivators. Deficient PTP-SL binding to the Asp319 ERK2 mutations impaired tyrosine dephosphorylation and cytosolic retention and inactivation of ERK2 by PTP-SL, and a correlation was found between the degree of the gain-of-function phenotype in the distinct Asp319 ERK2 mutations and the lack of association with PTP-SL; however, the Asp160 ERK2 mutations, as well as the p38α D316N mutation, associated poorly to both PTP-SL and STEP and were weakly inactivated by PTP-SL but did not show a gain-of-function-like phenotype (Table II). Thus, other MAP kinases-specific factors, in addition to the impairment of their association with inactivating phosphatases, might exist that account for the final gain-of-function phenotypes of MAP kinases mutations. In this regard, hyperactive HOG1 mutations have been identified that affect residues close to the ED and C-terminal common docking motifs (48Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and a discordance between the binding affinity of distinct MAP kinases to MKP-2 and MAP kinase inactivation has been documented (49Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X. Gorospe M. Davis R.J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29440-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The interaction of PTP-SL with ERK1/2 is mediated, at the level of PTP-SL, through a KIM located in the regulatory domain of this PTP, and major determinants for ERK1/2 recognition of the KIM include two positively charged Arg residues (29Zúñiga Á.

Thus, electrostatic interactions between the acidic Asp residues at the docking groove of ERK2 (Asp160, Asp316 and Asp319 in the mouse sequence) and basic residues at the KIM of PTP-SL (Arg228 and Arg229 in the mouse sequence), as well as hydrophobic interactions between these regions (Refs. 29Zúñiga Á.

The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of PTP-SL (lacking the MAP kinases interaction domain) has been recently solved (50Szedlacsek S.E. Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Renault L. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); further insight into the characterization of the ERK1/2-PTP-SL interaction will have to wait until the solving of the crystal structure of the ERK1/2-PTP-SL complexes. Remarkably, phosphorylation of the KIMs of PTP-SL and HePTP/LC-PTP by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase disrupts the association of these tyrosine phosphatases with ERK1/2 and p38α (25Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Saxena M. Williams S. Taskén K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated hyperphosphorylation of these KIMs could indirectly confer a gain-of-function-like phenotype to ERK1/2 and p38α in certain cell types. Whether some post-transcriptional or post-translational regulatory modification of the MAP kinases could affect the capability of their docking motifs to discriminate between distinct effectors remains uncertain. In this regard, an alternatively spliced variant of ERK1 has been identified that contains an insert that disrupts the ERK1 C-terminal common docking motif, hampering the association of ERK1 with both MEK1 and PTP-SL (51Yung Y. Yao Z. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15799-15808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 52Yung Y. Yao Z. Aebersold D.M. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35280-35289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Also, the phosphorylation of the ERK2 activation loop has been shown to alter the conformation of the ERK2 C-terminal extension that contains the common docking motif (53Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent association of ERK2 to the tyrosine phosphatase HePTP/LC-PTP has been documented (54Pettiford S.M. Herbst R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 858-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is likely that distinct levels of regulation exist that modulate the affinity of the different MAP kinases and their isoforms toward their cognate activating and inactivating effectors.The expression of PTP-SL and STEP is developmentally regulated in the brain (55Hendriks W. Schepens J. Brugman C. Zeeuwen P. Wieringa B. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 56Lombroso P.J. Naegele J.R. Sharma E. Lerner M. J.

Ulias L. Boynton A. Trebasky L.D. Medlock E.S. Anat. Rec. 2000; 258: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the PTP-SL-related tyrosine phosphatase HePTP/LC-PTP is expressed on cells of hematopoietic lineage (61Adachi M. Sekiya M. Isobe M. Kumura Y. Ogita Z.-I. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, in tissues that express these PTPs, the impairment of their association with ERK2 could confer an altered phenotype associated with hyperactivity of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. For example, a PTP-SL-related tyrosine phosphatase fromD. melanogaster, PTP-ER, is involved in the R7 photoreceptor differentiation of the fly, and the deficient association between PTP-ER and Rolled partially accounts for theDrosophila sevenmaker mutant phenotype (63Karim F.D. Rubin G.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, thymocyte developing is affected in transgenic mice expressing the ERK2 D319N gain-of-function mutation (64Sharp L.L. Schwarz D.A. Bott C.M. Marshall C.J. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 1997; 7: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), likely because of the impairment of ERK2 regulation by HePTP/LC-PTP or other effectors (35Oh-hora M. Ogata M. Mori Y. Adachi M. Imai K. Kosugi A. Hamaoka T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1282-1288PubMed Google Scholar). Additional work, including specific targeting of the PTP-SL and STEP genes on mice, will be necessary to ascertain the role of these PTPs in mammalian tissue development. No homologous of PTP-SL are found on the yeast S. cerevisiae; instead, two distantly related tyrosine phosphatases, PTP2 and PTP3, down-regulate the activity of HOG1 (homologous of mammalian p38α) and FUS3 in yeast (65Jacoby T.

In addition, MAP kinase-specific dual specificity phosphatases are also major regulators of mammalian MAP kinases activities (22Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the D317G and D317N gain-of-function FUS3 mutations also fail to interact with PTP3 (68Zhan X.-L. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2811-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the D316N and D319N mammalian MAP kinases gain-of-function mutations bind defectively to the dual specificity phosphatases MKP-1 and MKP-3 (26Brunet A.

https://openalex.org/W1970773177,"Messenger RNA contains untranslated 3' and 5' regions (3' and 5' UTRs) with sequence elements that are essential for the regulation of gene expression. A systematic search of GenBank revealed a large number of mononucleotide repeats within these UTRs. We selected 35 such mononucleotide repeats ranging in length from 15 bp to 32 bp and analysed their size in a series of 60 normal individuals. The conservation of repeats correlated inversely to their length, with longer repeats generally being more polymorphic than shorter repeats, irrespective of 3' or 5' location. Several long repeats were identified however to be monomorphic and we postulate that their conservation may be due to selective pressures relating to a possible functional role. We analysed 19 conserved UTR repeats in 117 colorectal cancers (CRC), 43 of which had defective mismatch repair characterized by widespread microsatellite instability (MSI-H). The UTR repeats were very often deleted in MSI-H tumors, with the length of deletion being proportional to the size of the repeat. Because of the high frequency of deletion observed in the conserved UTR repeats of MSI-H tumors, these could serve as a useful model for the study of possible changes in gene expression resulting from such mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2316795431,"Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of Kit by stem cell factor (SCF), its natural ligand, or by gain-of-function point mutation in its intracellular domain, confers significant protection against apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation or radiation. However, the effects of Kit activation on the cellular response to anti-tumor agents have not been so extensively documented. This study shows that daunorubicin-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity were reduced in the murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with Kit (Ba/F3-Kit) in the presence of SCF and in Ba/F3 cells transfected with a constitutively active Kit variant (Ba/F3-KitΔ27), compared to either parental Ba/F3 (Ba/F3-wt) or unstimulated Ba/F3-Kit cells. In Ba/F3-wt and in Ba/F3-Kit cells, daunorubicin stimulated within 8–15 min neutral sphingomyelinase and ceramide production but not in SCF-stimulated Ba/F3-Kit or in Ba/F3-KitΔ27 whereas all Ba/F3 cells were equally sensitive to exogenous cell-permeant C6-ceramide. In Ba/F3-Kit, SCF-induced Kit activation resulted in a rapid phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) tyrosine phosphorylation followed by diacylglycerol release and protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation. U-73122, a PLCγ inhibitor, not only blocked diacylglycerol production and PKC stimulation but also restored daunorubicin-induced sphingomyelinase stimulation, ceramide production, and apoptosis. These results suggest that Kit activation results in PLCγ-mediated PKC-dependent sphingomyelinase inhibition which contributes to drug resistance in Kit-related malignancies."

It is also clear that all levels of mRNA production are highly regulated, including mRNA turnover. A number of elements contribute to the stability of a given mRNA and these include the m7G cap at the 5′ termini of the mRNA and the poly(A) tail at the 3′ termini of the transcript (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) which provide a basal level of stability. Specific cis elements, in addition to these general factors, also contribute to mRNA turnover rates. Stability elements of many mRNAs are often located within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR)1 of the transcript, including the stable globin genes, α-globin and β-globin, as well as very short-lived transcripts such as c-Myc (3Jackson R.J.

The pathways responsible for mRNA decay have been primarily worked out in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, the predominant mechanism of mRNA decay involves deadenylation followed by decapping by DCP1p and subsequent 5′-3′ exoribonuclease decay of the transcript by the exoribonuclease XRN1p (8Larimer F.W. Hsu C.L. Maupin M.K. Stevens A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 120: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem.

Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another pathway in which the transcript is deadenylated and then digested in the 3′-5′ direction has also been identified (14Anderson J.S.J. Parker R.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Recently, due mainly to the development of reliable in vitrodecay assay systems utilizing mammalian cell extracts, the pathways of mRNA turnover in higher eukaryotes are becoming clearer. A poly(A)-specific 3′-5′ exoribonuclease has recently been cloned and encodes a protein termed poly(A) ribonuclease (16Korner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Poly(A) ribonuclease 3′-5′ exoribonuclease has been shown to be the major deadenylase responsible for deadenylation in some in vitrodecay systems (17Gao M. Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A mammalian homolog of XRN1 has been identified which preferentially digests G4 tetraplex substrates, however, its role in mRNA turnover is unclear (18Bashkirov V.I. Scherthan H. Solinger J.A. Buerstedde J.M. Heyer W.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A complex of 3′-5′ exoribonucleases, termed the exosome, were recently discovered in yeast and appear to be involved mainly in ribosomal RNA processing, however, a subset have been shown to be important in mRNA turnover (14Anderson J.S.J. Parker R.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D.

Cell. 2000; 102: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Homologs for 9 of the 11 yeast exosome proteins have been identified in mammals and two of them correspond to autoantigens for antibodies produced by patients with polymyositis-schleroderma overlap syndrome (20Allmang C. Petfalski E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Mitchell P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2148-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 21Brouwer R. Allmang C. Raijmakers R. van Aarssen Y.

Two distinct decapping activities have also been identified in mammalian cell extracts including a putative DCP1-like activity (22Gao M. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as well as a second decapping activity that functions as a scavenger which hydrolyzes the residual cap structure following exoribonucleolytic decay of the mRNA (23, 24,46). It appears that following deadenylation, the major decay pathway in mammalian cells proceeds through 3′ to 5′ exoribonucleolytic degradation while, degradation from the 5′ end is a minor contributor (24Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Endoribonucleases have also been identified to play a role in the turnover of specific mRNA transcripts. To date, endoribonucleolytic cleavage intermediates have been described for RNAs including the transferrin receptor, 9E3, IGF-II, ApoII, Xenopus Xlhbox2B mRNA, albumin, c-Myc, vitellogenin, hepatitus B virus, and α-globin (25Binder R.

Of these endoribonucleases, two have been cloned which are GAP-SH3-binding protein that cleaves c-Myc and PMR-1, the endoribonuclease that cleaves Xenopus albumin mRNA as well as the vitellogenin mRNA (34Cunningham K.S.

Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. Rna. 1998; 4: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The globin mRNAs are among the more stable transcripts and much has been learned about components involved in their stability. The α-globin mRNA has been shown to contain a C-rich region in its 3′-UTR which confers stability on the transcript (37Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A ribonucleoprotein complex which binds to this C-rich region, termed the α-complex, has been shown to stabilize the α-globin 3′-UTR (α3′-UTR) through an interaction with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) that is bound to the poly(A)-tail of the transcript (37Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 39Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the α-complex protects the α3′-UTR from cleavage by an erythroid enriched endoribonuclease termed ErEN (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Protection of an mRNA from endoribonuclease cleavage by trans factors is likely to emerge as a common theme. The vitellogenin mRNA has recently been shown to be protected from endoribonucleolytic cleavage by PMR-1 when bound by the RNA-binding protein vigilin (34Cunningham K.S. Dodson R.E. Nagel M.A. Shapiro D.J. Schoenberg D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12498-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, specific protein factors also appear to bind and shield the transferrin receptor, c-Myc, and Xlhbox2A mRNAs from endoribonuclease attack (26Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 27Brown B.D. Zipkin I.D. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1620-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). There are several aspects about ErEN activity that are unusual when compared with other endoribonucleases. First is its dependence on the poly(A)-tail. ErEN cleavage of the α3′-UTR requires deadenylation of the RNA prior to endoribonuclease cleavage (37Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Deadenylation is essential to disrupt the α-complex-poly(A)-binding protein interaction and reduce the affinity of the α-complex for the α3′-UTR thus allowing ErEN to displace the α-complex and cleave the RNA (37Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For other mRNAs that have thus far been characterized, deadenylation does not seem to be a prerequisite for endoribonucleolytic cleavage (26Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 27Brown B.D. Zipkin I.D. Harland R.M.

Second, the cleavage of the α3′-UTR by ErEN appears to be a sequence-specific cleavage and has been mapped to nucleotide 63 within the α3′-UTR (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M.

A mutation of 6 nucleotides (nt) surrounding the α3′-UTR cleavage site completely blocks targeting of ErEN to the α3′-UTR (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Among the other vertebrate endoribonucleases characterized, only one other has been shown to be sequence-specific when multiple binding sites were reiterated into a heterologous RNA and that is the 120-kDa protein which cleaves the Xlhbox2 mRNA (27Brown B.D. Zipkin I.D. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1620-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the gene encoding this protein remains to be identified. GAP-SH3-binding protein cleaves the c-Myc 3′-UTR at CA dinucleotides and PMR-1, which cleaves theXenopus albumin mRNA, has been shown to be sequence selective, in that it preferentially cleaves at AYUGA sequences but is not sequence-specific since it also cleaves at other single stranded regions (31Dompenciel R.E.

We have initiated the purification of ErEN, have identified the minimal cleavage site requirements, and characterized the conditions of ErEN cleavage. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) and HeLa cells were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml/108 cells of buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm KOAc, 1.5 mm MgOAc, 2 mmdithiothreitol. Cells were lysed with 25 strokes of a type-B Dounce homogenizer and nuclei were pelleted with a 15-min 4,000 ×g centrifugation. The supernatant was layered over buffer A containing 30% (w/v) sucrose and centrifuged at 130,000 ×g for 1[1,2] h. The resulting supernatant (S130) was removed without disturbing the S130-sucrose interface, supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and frozen at −70 °C in aliquots. The template for the α-globin 3′-UTR was PCR amplified from the pSV2Aneo-α2 plasmid as previously described (41Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) with primers that introduce a T7 bacteriophage promoter at the 5′ end. Templates for the α3′-UTR HindIII mutants were PCR amplified using the corresponding mutant template plasmid and the same set of primers used for the wild type 3′-UTR. The H13, H15, H17, H19, H21, and H23 PCR templates were amplified from the plasmids pSV2A-αH13, -αH15, -αH17, -αH19, -αH21, and -αH23, respectively (kindly provided by Dr. S. Liebhaber; University of Pennsylvania). These plasmids have been previously described (38Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Truncations of the α3′-UTR were PCR amplified from pSV2Aneo-α2 using 5′ primers that incorporated a T7 bacteriophage promoter and are listed as follows: 37–81 (CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCTCCCAACGGGC); 44–81 (CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACGGGCCCTCC); 50–81 (CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCTCCTCCCC); 56–81 (CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCCCCTCCTTGC) and the following 3′ primer (CAGGAAGGGCCGGTG). The GA mutant templates were PCR amplified using extended 3′ primers which replaced the wild type sequence with GAGAGA at the indicated positions. The PCR products were phenol/chloroform extracted twice and chloroform extracted twice, ethanol precipitated, and washed with 70% ethanol. RNA transcripts were generated using T7 polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's conditions using 500 ng of template. The full-length α3′-UTR and HindIII RNAs were uniformly labeled by including [α-32P]UTP in the reaction and the truncated transcripts and GA mutants were labeled by including [α-32P]CTP in the reaction. All RNAs were gel purified as described in Wang et al. (41Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To generate 5′ end-labeled RNA, unlabeled RNA without a 5′ cap was made and vaccinia virus capping enzyme was used to label the 5′ end with [α-32P]GTP as previously described (41Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). An alkaline RNA ladder was prepared by incubation of 104 cpm of 5′ end-labeled RNA in 50 mm NaOH and 10 mm EDTA for 20 s at 95 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 9.5 m urea, 80 mm NaOAc, and 170 mm HOAc. Decay reactions were carried out as previously described (41Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) using 0.1 pmol of 32P uniformly labeled RNA. The RNA was incubated with 20 μg of the indicated protein for 20 min at room temperature (unless otherwise noted) in IVDA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 0.1 mmspermine) containing 8 units of RNasin. In experiments to test optimal salt concentrations IVDA buffer without KOAc was used and KOAc was added to the final concentrations indicated. In experiments to test cation requirement, EDTA was omitted as indicated, IVDA buffer lacking MgOAc was used and cations were added as labeled. To determine the nature of the cleavage product, RNA that had been cleaved with 20 μg of protein from the octyl-Sepharose fraction and phenol/chloroform extracted was incubated with 50 ng of either the Int II/FL primer (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGCCGCCCACTCAGACTTT-3′) or the Int I primer (5′-GAGGAGGGGAGGAACATGTTCGAACG-3′) with 40 units of RNasin (Promega) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 7.5 mm dithiothreitol at 65 °C for 10 min, cooled slowly to room temperature to allow annealing of the primer to the RNA and then incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 0.25 mm dNTPs and 0.2 unit of Klenow (New England BioLabs). Gel filtration under denaturing conditions was carried out using ∼750 μg of MEL S130 extract adjusted to 2 m urea. The denatured protein was loaded onto a HiPrep 16/20 Sephacryl S-200 column (Pharmacia Corp.) that had been equilibrated in HG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol) with 40 mm KCl (HG-40) containing 2 m urea. For all column purifications an LCC-500 HPLC was used (Pharmacia Corp.). Half-milliliter fractions were collected and half of every third fraction was dialyzed and concentrated against HG-40 in microcon YM-10 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) prior to use in decay assays. Gel filtration under native conditions was carried out using ∼750 μg of MEL S130 extract that was adjusted to 1 mmCaCl2 and incubated with 200 units of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia Cor.) per ml of extract at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 5 mm EGTA and spun at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Corp.) that had been equilibrated in HG-40 and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Half of every second fraction was concentrated as described above and used directly in decay assays. Separately, gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) were loaded onto the above columns under the same conditions to determine the correlation between molecular weight and fraction number. MEL S130 extract was isolated as described above. Extract was adjusted to 1 m (NH4)2SO4 and precipitated protein was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded directly onto a HiPrep octyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Corp.) that had been equilibrated in 1 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted in steps with 0.6 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, buffer and then 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, buffer. The 0.6 m (NH4)2SO4fraction was adjusted to 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4 and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation as above. The supernatant was dialyzed to HG-40 and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Corp.). Proteins were eluted in steps at HG-200 and HG-600. The 0.6m KCl fraction was dialyzed against HG-40 and loaded onto a HiPrep Heparin column (Pharmacia Corp.), washed with HG-200 followed by a 15-ml gradient from 0.2 to 0.7 m KCl. One-milliliter fractions were collected, dialyzed against HG-40, and assayed for ErEN activity after which the fractions containing activity were pooled and adjusted to 50 mm KCl and 10 mmNa2HPO4. The resulting protein was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in HAB (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) with 10 mm Na2HPO4. Bound protein was eluted with a 15-ml gradient from 10 to 300 mmNa2HPO4. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, dialyzed against HG-40, and a portion was used in activity assays as well as separated by SDS-PAGE and the protein profile visualized by silver staining. We have identified a sequence-specific erythroid-enriched endoribonuclease (ErEN) which specifically targets and regulates the α-globin mRNA. The cleavage site within the α3′-UTR has previously been mapped to nucleotide 63 within the 110-nt α3′-UTR (Fig. 1A) (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This site falls within the region of the α3′-UTR that is bound by the α-complex (42Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Binding of the α-complex to this region prevents access of ErEN to the cleavage site and results in stabilization of the RNA (37Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 45-nt region spanning nucleotides 37–81 (shaded in Fig. 1A) was shown to be an autonomous element which, when placed onto a heterologous RNA, could still be recognized and specifically cleaved by ErEN (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify the minimal ErENrecognition and cleavage sequence (MERCS) we first tested whether ErEN is able to cleave a 45-nt RNA from nucleotides 37 to 81 of the α3′-UTR directly without it being in the context of a longer RNA. The expected 5′ fragment of the ErEN cleavage product would be 27 nt and the expected 3′ fragment would be 18 nt (Fig. 1B). Since HeLa cells do not contain ErEN activity (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), HeLa S130 extract was used as a negative control to identify any background nuclease activity. As expected, no cleavage was detected with HeLa S130 extract (Fig. 1C, lane 2), however, two fragments of the expected sizes were detected with MEL S130 extract (lane 3). A series of truncations which removed sequences from the 5′ end of this 45-nt region were generated (Fig.1B) and each tested in a decay assay (Fig. 1C). All of the constructs gave the expected cleavage fragments. Surprisingly, the smallest probe tested, which encompasses 26 nt, was also recognized and cleaved by ErEN albeit at a reduced efficiency (Fig. 1C, lane 12). Addition of random sequence to the 5′ end of the 26-nt RNA, enhanced cleavage of this longer RNA (data not shown) suggesting that there is a minimal size constraint for ErEN. To determine the essential sequences for ErEN cleavage, we tested the ability of ErEN to cleave mutant α3′-UTR sequences. A series of scanning substitution mutants that change 6 nt at a time to aHindIII (38Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) throughout the α3′-UTR were initially tested. The positions of the mutations are shown in Fig. 1A and the nomenclature is that used by Weiss and Liebhaber (38Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The numbers represent sets of triplicate nucleotides that have been substituted by a HindIII recognition sequence within the α3′-UTR following the stop codon. For example, H13 substitutes nucleotides 37–42 of the α3′-UTR which would correlate to the 13th and 14th codon in the α3′-UTR if it were translated. Uniformly labeled α3′-UTR RNAs were made from each construct and tested in decay assays with MEL S130 cell extract. No products are detected using HeLa S130 extract with any of the α3′-UTR substrates (Fig.2A, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20). Four of the mutations have no detectable effect on ErEN cleavage and only the H19 and H21 mutants, which span nucleotides 55–66, alter ErEN cleavage of the α3′-UTR (lanes 15 and18). Consistent with the deletional analysis in Fig. 1, these two mutations fall within the above identified 26-nt MERCS. Surprisingly, cleavage is not completely abolished by these mutants but rather the specificity of the cleavage appears to be altered. A possible explanation is that since the HindIII mutation retains a CUU in this CU-rich region, ErEN recognition and cleavage of the α3′-UTR is only modestly altered. To test whether more severe mutations could disrupt ErEN cleavage activity, a second set of substitution mutants were generated in which a series of hexanucleotide substitution mutations within the 26-nt MERCS region were made. The mutants were generated within the context of the 45-nt RNA to ensure the detection of sufficient cleavage activity. The substitutions introduced the sequence GAGAGA. This sequence was chosen because it was previously shown to disrupt ErEN cleavage activity when positioned at the cleavage site within the context of the full-length α-globin 3′-UTR (30Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2B, introduction of any of these mutations completely abolished ErEN cleavage by MEL S130 extract (Fig. 2B,lanes 6, 9, 12, and 15). These data suggest that the entire 26-nt MERCS region is necessary and sufficient for cleavage by ErEN in MEL S130 extract. In an effort to characterize ErEN, we determined the approximate size of the protein containing ErEN activity. Gel filtration was carried out with MEL S130 extract under denaturing conditions with 2 m urea. The proteins were separated on a Sephacryl S-200 column which allows the separation of proteins from 5 to 250 kDa. Fractions from the column were dialyzed to remove the urea and renature the proteins. Decay assays were then carried out on the individual fractions using the α3′-UTR as substrate (Fig. 3). Protein standards were also separated by gel filtration in the presence of 2m urea and compared with the ErEN fractions to assess the approximate size of the protein. As seen in Fig. 3, ErEN activity peaks in the fractions that correspond to ∼40 kDa (lanes 8 and9) indicating that ErEN is likely to be a single protein in that size range. We undertook a biochemical approach to purify ErEN activity from cells. The starting material was MEL cells in which ErEN activity is readily detectable. The purification scheme is outlined in Fig.4A and proteins from each of the fractions containing ErEN activity are shown on a silver-stained gel in Fig. 4B along with the activity assay from each fr"
https://openalex.org/W2318732193,"To search for anti-cancer agents, a screening system for Ras signal inhibitors was developed using a NIH3T3 cell line with an introduced reporter gene which is controlled by the Ras-responsive element (RRE). With this screening system, malolactomycin D was identified as a selective inhibitor of transcription from the RRE. This compound was found to preferentially inhibit the anchorage-independent growth rather than the anchorage-dependent growth of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-9, which have RRE in their promoters, were reduced by treatment with malolactomycin D at the translational and transcriptional levels. Analysis of the activity of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, which play important roles in transduction of the Ras signal, showed that malolactomycin D inhibits the activation of p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal-kinase (JNK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 or 2 (ERK1 or 2). These findings suggest that by inhibiting the pathway that leads to the activation of p38 MAP kinase and JNK, malolactomycin D suppresses the expression of MMPs. Since MMPs play important roles in metastasis and maintenance of the microenvironment of tumor cells, both of which facilitate tumor growth, the inhibition of MMPs by malolactomycin D is believed to contribute to its ability to inhibit Ras-mediated tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2329588646,"The contribution of oncogene amplification and/or overexpression to T-cell lymphoid neoplasms has only of late been established with the implication of the TCL1 and MTCP1 genes in T-cell malignancies. Our laboratory has recently discovered a novel oncogene, MCT-1, amplified in a T-cell lymphoma and mapped to chromosome Xq22-24. MCT-1 has been shown to decrease cell-doubling time, dramatically shortening the duration of G(1) transit time and/or G1-S transition, and transforms NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Constitutive expression of MCT-1 results in a strong proliferative signal and is associated with deregulation of protein kinase-mediated G1/S phase checkpoints. In this study we analysed the level and subcellular localization of this novel cell cycle regulatory molecule as a function of cell cycle phase. In human lymphoid tumors expression of MCT-1 is constant throughout the cell cycle and remains cytoplasmic. Cells overexpressing MCT-1 have increased expression of cyclin D1 with dysregulation of the G(1)-S checkpoint. Both cyclin D1 and MCT-1 are involved in regulating passage of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Since prior work has shown that gamma irradiation induces cyclin D1 expression we investigated the induction of MCT-1 to DNA damaging agents. We demonstrate that increases in MCT-1 protein in irradiated human lymphoid cells do not occur at the mRNA level and do not require new protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965584256,"Repetitive tracts within the coding regions of TGFBR2 and BAX are frequently mutated in mismatch repair deficient tumours and are implicated in tumour progression. However, there has been little study of the balance between selection pressure and inherent instability at sequences within these genes. To determine whether TGFBR2 and BAX are inherently prone to mutations in the presence of MMR defects, we studied MMR deficient cells derived from B-lymphocytes. By analysing cells derived from normal tissue we aimed to minimize the effects of selection pressures that bias the apparent frequency of mutation. We definitively show that certain sequences, usually repaired by MMR, are inherently unstable. Using a small pool PCR technique we confirmed these cells exhibit microsatellite instability. Additionally, we demonstrate that MMR deficiency results in an excess of mutations, specifically at the poly(A)(10) tract compared to other regions of the TGFBR2 gene (P<0.001). Conversely, an excess of mutations does not appear to arise at the poly(G)(8) tract of the BAX gene. These studies provide insight into the mechanism by which TGFBR2 and BAX genes become mutated during tumorigenesis. These findings invoke the notion of ""unmasking"" specific hypermutable sequences in particular genes adding further complexity to the concept of the mutator phenotype."
