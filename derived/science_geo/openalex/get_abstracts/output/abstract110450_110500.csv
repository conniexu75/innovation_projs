https://openalex.org/W1680053970,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages produce large quantities of interleukin (IL)-1 beta but in the absence of a secondary stimulus little of this cytokine is proteolytically processed to its mature biologically active state and externalized. The potassium-proton ionophore nigericin and ATP are known to promote the maturation and release of IL-1 beta from LPS-stimulated cells. We investigated the mechanisms by which these agents act in an attempt to understand requirements of the post-translational processing. Like nigericin, the ionophores A204 and lasalocid induced the release and maturation of IL-1 beta. The electrogenic potassium ionophore valinomycin, however, did not stimulate these post-translational events. Addition of nigericin or lasalocid to LPS-stimulated cells produced a rapid intracellular acidification; A204, however, did not alter pH, indicating that an acidification was not necessary for activation of IL-1 beta maturation. Macrophages treated with ATP became rounded and swollen, and after 30 min of treatment their appearance was comparable with cells treated with nigericin. Post-translational maturation and release of IL-1 beta began immediately after ATP addition. The majority of the 17-kDa mature IL-1 beta produced within the first 30 min of treatment was recovered extracellularly; in contrast, during this same time period the 35-kDa IL-1 beta precursor and the cytoplasmic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and the lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase remained cell-associated. ATP, therefore, promoted both the proteolytic maturation of IL-1 beta and the release of the biologically active species in the absence of cell lysis. Longer incubations with ATP caused cytolysis as judged by the release of the cytoplasmic enzymes. ADP was less active than ATP at initiating the post-translational maturation and release of IL-1 beta and AMP, GTP, and UTP were totally inactive, ATP, nigericin, A204, and lasalocid promoted a rapid and complete loss of the potassium analog 86Rb+ from cells that were preloaded with this cation; valinomycin-treated cells released only a portion of the radiolabeled cation. Agents that promoted the maturation and release of IL-1 beta from LPS-stimulated macrophages, therefore, shared an ability to mobilize intracellular potassium. Macrophages treated with ATP or nigericin in medium that contained KCl rather than NaCl failed to proteolytically activate and to release IL-1 beta. These data suggest that ATP and nigericin induce a net decrease in intracellular levels of K+ which is necessary for activation of the post-translational maturation of IL-1 beta."
https://openalex.org/W1580590749,"We have characterized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaM kinase IV), expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, to assess its potential role in Ca2+-dependent transcriptional regulation. CaM kinase IV was strongly inhibited in vitro by KN-62, a specific CaM kinase inhibitor which suppresses Ca2+-dependent transcription of several genes, so we tested whether CaM kinase IV could stimulate transcription. Co-transfection of COS-1 cells by cDNA for CaM kinase IV gave 3-fold stimulation of a reporter gene expression, whereas co-transfection with CaM kinase II gave no transcriptional stimulation. Since this transcriptional response was mediated by phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), we determined the kinetics and site specificities of CaM kinases IV and II for phosphorylating CREB in vitro. CaM kinases IV and II and cAMP kinase (protein kinase A) all had similar Km values for CREB (1-5 microns), but the Vmax of CaM kinase IV was 40-fold lower than those of CaM kinase II and protein kinase A. Although all three kinases phosphorylated Ser133 in CREB, CaM kinase II also gave equal phosphorylation of a second site which was not Ser98. The two CREB phosphorylation sites were separately 32P-labeled, and the abilities of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B (calcineurin) to dephosphorylate them were tested. Our results show that all three phosphatases could dephosphorylate both sites, and calcineurin was a stronger catalyst for dephosphorylating site 1 (Ser133) than for site 2. These results indicate that CaM kinase IV may be important in Ca2+-dependent transcriptional regulation through phosphorylation of Ser133 in CREB. The fact that CaM kinase II phosphorylates another site in addition to Ser133 in CREB raises the possibility that this second phosphorylation site may account for the suppressed phosphorylation site may account for the suppressed ability of CaM kinase II to enhance transcription through the CRE/CREB system. In addition multiple protein phosphatases, including calcineurin, may exert a modulatory effect on transcription depending on which site they dephosphorylate."
https://openalex.org/W1487930529,"In this study we have used homogenates of human atheromatous plaque as immunogen to establish a murine monoclonal antibody which recognizes oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL). This monoclonal antibody, FOH1a/DLH3, reacted with oxidized LDL, but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that it had no reaction with native, acetylated, or malonaldehyde-treated LDL. The antibody cross-reacted with oxidized high density lipoprotein, suggesting that specific sequences of the apolipoprotein B are not essential for antigen recognition by the antibody. Immunohistochemical analysis of thin paraffin sections from human coronary arteries showed that foam cells derived from macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions were heavily stained by this antibody. Several other structures in the lesions, including swollen collagen fibers, cellular debris in necrotic cores, and endothelial cells, were moderately stained. The epitope of this antibody was characterized by a model antigen-generating system using ferrous ion-induced peroxidation of lipids. When the total lipid fraction extracted from LDL was treated with the ferrous ion-induced peroxidation system, the reaction mixture was recognized by the antibody. Antigenic product(s) was produced only when phosphatidylcholine (PC) was treated with the ferrous ion-induced peroxidation, other lipids failed to react to the antibody. To investigate the possible formation of a complex of antigenic product with a polypeptide, a synthetic peptide and a rabbit antiserum against the peptide were used. Reaction mixture of ferrous ion-induced peroxidation of PC in the presence of the peptide was added to a microtiter well precoated with the monoclonal antibody FOH1a/DLH3. After washing, the peptide remaining in the well was detected with rabbit antiserum against the peptide, whereas no reactivity was observed when peptide alone was added to the well. Binding of the antigenic complex to the precoated monoclonal antibody was competed by oxidized PC produced in the absence of any polypeptide. We conclude that oxidized phospholipid product(s) is the epitope of the monoclonal antibody and that the oxidized phospholipid forms complexes with polypeptides. The antigenic materials are detected in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1664326306,"Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) is a potent and selective slow binding inhibitor of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (Street, I. P., Lin, H.-K., Laliberte, F., Ghomashchi, F., Wang, Z., Perrier, H., Tremblay, N. M., Huang, Z., Weech, P. K., and Gelb, M. H. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5935-5940). AACOCF3 and a number of its structural analogues have been used to investigate the role of cPLA2 in the cellular generation of free arachidonic acid (AA) and in eicosanoid biosynthesis. AACOCF3 inhibited the release of AA from calcium ionophore-challenged U937 cells (IC50 = 8 microM, 2 x 10(6) cells ml-1) and from platelets (IC50 = 2 microM, 4 x 10(7) cells ml-1). Arachidonyl methyl ketone (AACOCH3) and AACH(OH)CF3, both of which are noninhibitory to the purified cPLA2, did not inhibit the production of AA in the ionophore-challenged cells. In addition to the release of AA, AACOCF3 also inhibited the production of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and thromboxane B2, two of the major metabolites of AA produced by platelets. The inhibition of 12-HETE biosynthesis showed a dose dependence similar to that of AA release in ionophore-challenged platelets; however, when platelet 12-HETE production was stimulated with 10 microM AA to circumvent the PLA2-dependent step, AACOCF3 no longer inhibited the production of 12-HETE. In contrast, AACOCF3 blocked thromboxane B2 formation by both calcium ionophore- and AA-challenged platelets, indicating that the compound affects the cyclooxygenase pathway in addition to AA release. The crude cytosol and membrane fractions from platelets were assayed for calcium-dependent and calcium-independent PLA2 activities and for the susceptibility of each to inhibition by AACOCF3. At AACOCF3 concentrations as high as 10 mol %, only one of the observed PLA2 activities was inhibited by more than 25%. The AACOCF3-susceptible PLA2 (77% inhibition at 1.6 mol %) was found in the cytosolic platelet fraction and showed the functional characteristics of the cPLA2. These results suggest that the cPLA2 plays an important role in the generation of free AA for 12-HETE biosynthesis in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1540849804,"Phospholipase activation has been considered rate-limiting for ligand-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Constitutive prostaglandin synthase EC 1.14.99.1 (PGS-1) has been thought to convert arachidonate released following ligand stimulation to PGH2. However, a second prostaglandin synthase, TIS10/PGS-2, is inducible in many cell types, including fibroblasts and macrophages. We have used antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of TIS10/PGS-2 induction to investigate the role of this enzyme in ligand-induced prostaglandin production in fibroblasts and macrophages. Antisense TIS10/PGS-2 oligonucleotides block mitogen-induced prostaglandin production and TIS10/PGS-2 protein synthesis in both Swiss 3T3 cells and murine embryo fibroblast cultures, without inhibiting either constitutive PGS-1 activity or mitogen-stimulated arachidonic acid release. TIS10/PGS-2 antisense oligonucleotides also block production of PGE2 from endogenous arachidonate following endotoxin stimulation of both RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and murine peritoneal macrophages. In contrast, the constitutive prostaglandin synthase present in macrophages is unable to convert arachidonate released following endotoxin stimulation into prostaglandin. TIS10/PGS-2 expression is necessary for both mitogen-induced prostaglandin production in murine fibroblasts and endotoxin-induced prostaglandin synthesis in macrophages. PGS-1 present in these cells cannot utilize arachidonic acid released in response to mitogen or endotoxin stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1600394682,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a finite life span that is measured by the number of times the individual cell divides. The gene coding for one of several transcripts that are differentially expressed during the replicative life span has been cloned. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a transmembrane protein of 411 amino acids that displays no significant similarities to any known proteins. Nevertheless, sequences similar to this gene were found in several mammals, including humans. The transcript levels decreased with replicative age of yeast cells. A gene deletion in haploid cells resulted in a pronounced increase (approximately 50%) in mean and in maximum life span. These results indicate that this gene, which we call LAG1, plays a role in determining yeast longevity."
https://openalex.org/W1513598783,"A 20-kDa protein (p20) that had internal amino acid sequences highly similar to those of alpha B crystallin was purified from rat and human skeletal muscle. p20 co-eluted with alpha B crystallin and HSP27/28 during column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and on Bio-Gel A-5m. p20 was separated from alpha B crystallin and HSP27/28 and was resolved into two fractions, a minor first peak and a major second peak, by column chromatography on S-Sepharose in the presence of 7 M urea. During chromatography on a column of Superdex 75pg, even in the presence of 7 M urea, p20 in the second peak was eluted as aggregates near the exclusion volume of the column, whereas p20 in the first peak was eluted in fractions that corresponded to a lower molecular mass. Further chromatography on a TSK-SP-5PW column yielded pure preparations of each of the two forms of rat and human p20. The fragmentation patterns of the two forms of the respective p20 proteins generated by digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N were identical. The primary structures of rat and human p20, determined with an NH2-terminal sequenator, were highly homologous to those of alpha B crystallin and HSP27/28. p20 was present in all rat tissues examined and at high levels (> 1 micrograms/mg protein) in the soleus muscle, heart, and diaphragm, as are alpha B crystallin and HSP27. Centrifugation on sucrose density gradients allowed detection of the aggregated form and the small form of p20, as well as of HSP27, in extracts of rat muscle tissues. During heating at 45 degrees C of tissue in vitro, p20 in rat diaphragm was redistributed from the cytoplasm to the insoluble fraction, and dissociation of the aggregated p20 to the small form was enhanced. These results suggest that p20 is related to stress proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1512090235,"zif268/egr-1 is an immediate early response gene that is involved in regulation of growth and differentiation. Its mRNA encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional activator containing three zinc fingers that act as the DNA-binding domain. Although zif268/egr-1 is expressed in the nervous system during neuronal excitation, no target gene has yet been identified. Here we report that the zif268/egr-1 protein bound in vitro to two sites in the proximal regulatory region of the human synapsin I gene. The zif268/egr-1 protein was also shown to stimulate transcription from this control region in transactivation assays. Additionally, the presence of a putative neural-restrictive silencer element next to one of the zif268/egr-1-binding sites interfered with transactivation in a tissue-independent manner. An analysis of the temporal expression pattern of zif268/egr-1 and synapsin I during neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells revealed that zif268/egr-1 mRNA was induced on day 5 and synapsin I mRNA on day 8 after retinoic acid treatment. From this data we conclude that the synapsin I gene is a target of the zif268 transcription factor; however, intermediate factors may also be involved in the activation."
https://openalex.org/W1588445101,"The INO4 gene encodes a protein required for derepression of a number of structural genes encoding enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ino4p shows structural similarity to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of regulatory proteins (Hoshizaki, D. K., Hill, J. E., and Henry, S. A. (1990) J. Biol Chem. 265, 4736-4745). In this report we demonstrate that Ino4p translated in vitro forms a complex with Ino2p, another positive regulator of phospholipid biosynthesis that contains a bHLH domain. The Ino2p.Ino4p complex binds to a fragment of the INO1 promoter containing two copies of the consensus binding site for the bHLH family of proteins. The complex formed when this DNA fragment is incubated with in vitro translated Ino2p and Ino4p is identical in mobility to the complex formed when this DNA fragment is incubated with whole cell extracts. The binding of DNA by the Ino2p.Ino4p complex is competed by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding sequence for bHLH proteins. Neither Ino2p nor Ino4p translated alone is capable of forming a complex with the INO1 promoter fragment. The two products, translated separately and mixed, show only reduced capability to form a complex compared with cotranslated proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that Ino2p and Ino4p interact in the absence of DNA. Ino2p and Ino4p are, thus, both necessary and sufficient for formation of a complex with the INO1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1516262714,"An analogue of arachidonic acid in which the COOH group is replaced by a trifluoromethyl ketone group (COCF3) has recently been shown to be a tight binding inhibitor of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 that is found in platelets and other cells (Street, I. P., Lin, H.-K., Laliberte, F., Ghomashchi, F. G., Wang, Z., Perrier, H., Tremblay, N. M., Huang, Z., Weech, P. K., and Gelb, M. H. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5935-5940). This trifluoromethyl ketone inhibits most of the arachidonate release from the phospholipid pool in thrombin-stimulated human platelets at concentrations of 0-40 microM with 4 x 10(8) platelets/ml. A structure-function analysis of related compounds reveals a good correlation between the inhibition of the purified phospholipase A2 and the blockage of arachidonate release in platelets. A number of recently described potent inhibitors of the 14-kDa phospholipase A2 that is secreted from activated platelets have no effect on the level of free arachidonate production. Furthermore, the addition of a large amount of recombinant 14-kDa phospholipase A2 to platelets does not produce free arachidonate, and it does not alter the amount of arachidonate released following platelet activation with thrombin. These studies provide strong pharmacological evidence for the role of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 in producing most, if not all, of the liberated arachidonate in thrombin-stimulated human platelets, and they show that tight binding membrane-residing inhibitors of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 can block the eicosanoid cascade in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588573376,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing Shc proteins p52shc and p46shc become phosphorylated upon activation of several tyrosine kinases and are implicated in mitogenic signal transduction. Ligand stimulation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor leads to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues, which is known to mediate interactions with several SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules. In this study, we have characterized the interaction between the PDGF beta-receptor and Shc. PDGF beta-receptor coprecipitation in Shc immunoprecipitates was dependent on stimulation with PDGF-BB. The Shc SH2 domain expressed as a bacterial fusion protein bound the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor. Moreover, the Shc SH2 domain could bind the autophosphorylated purified baculovirus-expressed PDGF beta-receptor intracellular domain, which indicates a direct association of Shc with the PDGF beta-receptor. Activation of the PDGF beta-receptor induced the preferential phosphorylation of p52shc. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, in turn, formed a complex with the signaling molecule Grb2. Synthetic peptide analysis revealed that certain autophosphorylation sites in the PDGF beta-receptor (Tyr-579, Tyr-740, Tyr-751, and Tyr-771) were able to mediate the specific binding of the Shc SH2 domain as well as intact Shc proteins. A mutant PDGF beta-receptor in which Tyr-579 was replaced with phenylalanine showed 40% impaired association of Shc in vivo, but phosphorylation of Shc proteins was not affected. We conclude that multiple autophosphorylation sites in the PDGF beta-receptor are responsible for the binding of Shc. This is in contrast to previously characterized interactions between the PDGF beta-receptor and SH2 domain-containing proteins, which generally involve one high affinity binding site in the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1544992723,"Metallothioneins (MT) are ubiquitous low molecular weight metal-binding proteins that may act as antioxidants. We examined the sensitivity of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with a plasmid containing mouse metallothionein-I gene (NIH3T3/MT) to the membrane permeant oxidant, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH). NIH3T3/MT cells had a 4-fold increase in intracellular metallothionein as compared to cells transfected with a plasmid containing an inverted gene (NIH3T3/TM). Newly expressed metallothionein appeared to be localized to the cytoplasm as determined by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. NIH3T3/MT cells were 6 times more resistant than NIH3T3/TM cells to the cytotoxic effects of tBH. The antioxidant activity of NIH3T3/MT cells was greater than NIH3T3/TM cells, since exposure to tBH resulted in significantly less: (a) thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and (b) fluorescence after loading cells with the oxidant-sensitive dye, 2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Furthermore, homogenates of NIH3T3/MT cells were more capable of scavenging in vitro generated phenoxyl radicals as quantified by electron spin resonance detection. In contrast, overexpression of cytoplasmic MT did not protect against tBH-induced DNA damage, suggesting that subcellular location of MT is important for its function and that DNA damage is not a key determinant of cytotoxicity. These data provide direct support for an antioxidant role for MT, since physiologically relevant elevations in cytoplasmic MT interfere with tBH-induced cytotoxic peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1522283730,"The effect of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) on phospholipid metabolism was investigated in HL-60 cells. Treatment of cells with ara-C resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the mass of ceramide and diglyceride. When cells were treated with 10 microM ara-C, an increase in the mass of ceramide and diglyceride was detectable at 5 min and reached a plateau at 30 min with a 2-fold increase compared to control cells. Treatment of cells with 10 microM ara-C resulted in the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase with a peak at 30 min that represented a 2-fold increase in specific activity. ara-C also increased expression of the transcription factor NF-kappa B which is related to the control of monocyte differentiation. These findings suggest that ara-C activates phospholipid hydrolytic pathways to generate second messengers that control gene expression and differentiation in the HL-60 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1499206140,"Cofilin is an actin-modulating protein of 20 kDa, which is widely distributed throughout muscle and non-muscle cells. By means of immunoblotting combined with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that two cofilin variants, muscle type (M-type) and non-muscle type (NM-type), exist in mammals, while a single isoform exists in chickens. During in vitro myogenesis of mouse C2 cells, expression of the M-type cofilin was upregulated. To better understand the nature of the M-type cofilin, we cloned cDNAs encoding M-type cofilin from the cDNA library of C2 myotubes and determined the entire sequence. The deduced peptide sequence contained a nuclear localization signal and a putative actin-binding sequence as reported in NM-type cofilin. The sequence showed 81% identity in the amino acid residues with the mouse NM-type cofilin sequence and, interestingly, higher homology (96% identity) with that of chicken cofilin. The mRNA encoding M-type cofilin, though it contains two variants that differ in the size of their 3'-non-coding sequences, was detected predominantly in heart, skeletal muscle, C2 myotubes, and testis by Northern blotting, while the mRNA for NM-type cofilin was seen in a variety of non-muscle tissues. The presence of the muscle type isoform of cofilin strongly suggests that cofilin is deeply involved in the regulation of actin function not only in non-muscle cells but also in muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1560388617,"Ole e I, the major allergen from the olive tree (Olea europaea), is one of the main causes of allergy in Mediterranean countries and some areas of North America. The cloning and sequencing of several cDNAs coding for the olive allergen have been achieved. cDNA has been synthesized from total pollen RNA and amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence data demonstrate the existence of microheterogeneities in at least 37 positions out of the 145 amino acids of Ole e I, thus explaining the high degree of polymorphism exhibited by the natural protein. One of the sequenced cDNAs encoding a full-length isoform was inserted into the plasmid vector pGEX-2T and overexpressed. The recombinant Ole e I has been produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase of Schistosoma japonicum. This chimeric protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column and digested with thrombin to release the recombinant allergen. Both the fusion protein and the recombinant Ole e I were recognized in Western blot analysis by rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antisera raised against native Ole e I as well as by the IgE of olive pollen-sensitive human sera. This indicates that the recombinant production of individual isoforms may be useful for the improvement of reagents to be used in diagnosis and therapy of IgE-mediated disorders. In addition, Ole e I mRNA has been observed to be pollen-specific as shown in a Northern blot analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1589750045,"Erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) is an erythroid-specific transcription factor that binds a CACCC motif found in the human beta-globin gene promoter. We have studied the promoter of the EKLF gene and identified binding sites for the transcription factors GATA-1 and CCAAT-binding Protein 1 (CP1). We show that both types of binding sites are required for full activity, and that the GATA motif at -60 is essential. The EKLF promoter can be directly activated in nonerythroid cells in cotransfection experiments by forced expression of GATA-1. These results suggest that EKLF is dependent on GATA-1 for its expression and lies downstream of, or coincident with, GATA-1 in a regulatory hierarchy in erythroid development."
https://openalex.org/W2134693989,"Intestinal uptake of dietary glucose and galactose is mediated by the SGLT1 Na+/glucose cotransporter of the brush border. An SGLT1 missense mutation underlies hereditary glucose/galactose malabsorption, characterized by potentially fatal diarrhea; conversely, oral rehydration therapy exploits normal transport to alleviate life-threatening diarrhea of infectious origin. We have mapped the entire human SGLT1 Na+/glucose cotransporter gene from cosmid and lambda phage clones representing a genomic region of 112 kilobases. Transcription initiation occurred from a site 27 base pairs 3' of a TATAA sequence. All exon-flanking regions were sequenced, and the entire 112-kilobase region mapped with four restriction enzymes. SGLT1 is comprised of 15 exons (spanning 72 kilobases); a possible evolutionary origin from a six-membrane-span ancestral precursor via a gene duplication event is suggested from comparison of exons against protein secondary structure and from sequence considerations. A new missense mutation in exon 1 causing glucose/galactose malabsorption is also described. This is the first Na(+)-dependent cotransporter gene structure reported. These data facilitate the search for new glucose/galactose malabsorption-related mutations in this important gene and provide a basis for future evolutionary comparisons with other Na(+)-dependent cotransporters."
https://openalex.org/W1576975148,"The phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine residues is critical in cellular signal transduction and neoplastic transformation. These mechanisms are regulated by the activities of both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Recent studies have identified a novel protein-tyrosine phosphatase, termed Syp, that is widely expressed in various tissues. Syp encodes a cytoplasmic phosphatase that contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Since SH2 domains have been shown to target the association of signal-transducing molecules to activated tyrosine kinases, experiments were performed to determine whether Syp might form specific complexes with p210bcr-abl, a fusion protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and, thus, possibly alter or mediate p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity. We found that Syp was highly and constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in three different murine cell lines transfected with a p210bcr-abl expression vector. Furthermore, p210bcr-abl, Syp, and Grb2 formed stable complexes in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Complex formation between p210bcr-abl and Syp was mediated in vitro by the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of Syp. Last, p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase was effectively dephosphorylated by Syp in vitro. These results suggest an interaction between Syp and BCR-ABL protein, which might play a role in cellular transformation of BCR-ABL."
https://openalex.org/W1502303408,"The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii resides within a specialized, nonfusogenic vacuole termed the parasitophorous vacuole. We are exploring the hypothesis that parasite proteins contained in dense core granules and secreted into the vacuole after cell invasion contribute to the modification of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). The dense granule protein GRA3 associates preferentially with the PVM. Here we show that GRA3 liberated from dense granules is a soluble protein. Following secretion, one-third or more of GRA3 in the parasitophorous vacuole becomes stably associated with the vacuole membrane as judged by sucrose flotation gradients and Triton X-114 phase partitioning experiments. GRA3 cannot be removed from the membrane by extraction with sodium carbonate at pH 11.0, nor can it be labeled in infected cells with [1-14C]acetate. In sucrose velocity sedimentation gradients, GRA3 from vacuolar membranes solubilized in Triton X-100 sediments as an oligomer. Membrane-associated GRA3 cross-links to itself, migrating as a ladder of bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No other parasite or cell proteins co-precipitate with cross-linked GRA3. We conclude that a portion of GRA3 secreted from the parasite as a soluble protein directly inserts into the vacuole membrane in an oligomeric form. This is the first report in Toxoplasma or related parasites of a protein which inserts into the vacuole membrane for some purpose other than to lyse that membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1564717216,"Mas20p and Mas70p are integral proteins of the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane that appear to function as receptors for precursor proteins imported from the cytosol. Loss of either receptor alone does not block import or kill the cells, but deletion of Mas20p causes loss of respiration (Ramage, L., Junne, T., Hahne, K., Lithgow, T., and Schatz, G. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4115-4123). Here we show that this respiratory deficiency is only temporary; given time to adapt, virtually all cells lacking MAS20p regain respiration without regaining MAS20p. The respiratory defect can also be suppressed (at a frequency of about 10(-6)) by a dominant mutation of a single nuclear gene. The suppressed cells, unlike the unsuppressed ones, tolerate disruption of the MAS70 gene. The resulting double disruptants lack both Mas20p and Mas70p, yet are viable and able to respire. Protein import into mitochondria isolated from these cells is efficient, specific, and highly sensitive to protease treatment. We propose that at least one additional mitochondrial surface protein can function as a protein import receptor and that the activity of this component is up-regulated by a stress response or by an extragenic suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1597602621,"The molecular mechanisms for signaling by receptor serine/threonine kinases are incompletely understood. To test the potential involvement of p21 H-Ras proteins in signal transduction for type beta transforming growth factors (TGF beta), TGF beta-responsive and constitutive reporter genes were cotransfected into cardiac myocytes and mink lung epithelial cells, with dominant inhibitory (Asn-17) or activated (Arg-12) Ras expression vectors. Asn-17 Ras inhibited both TGF beta-dependent and basal expression of inducible promoters (skeletal alpha-actin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), with equivalent dose-response relations. All seven reporter constructs were comparably sensitive to down-regulation by Asn-17 Ras, including those driven by nominally constitutive viral control regions or a TATA-less initiator element. All constructs were up-regulated by Arg-12 Ras more variably. Wild-type Ras had intermediate effects and could rescue a minimal thymidine kinase promoter from inhibition by dominant negative Ras. Thus, a Ras-dependent event is required for efficient expression of an unexpectedly global or inclusive set of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1542205318,"Phosphorylation of Ser residues in the NH2-terminal extension unique to cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is known to occur through protein kinase A and to alter myofilament Ca2+ activation (Robertson, S. P., Johnson, J. D., Holroyde, M. J., Kranias, E. G., Potter, J. D., and Solaro, R. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 260-263). Yet, how the NH2-terminal extension may itself affect thin filament Ca2+ signaling is unknown. To approach this question we have used molecular cloning, mutagenesis, and bacterial synthesis of a full-length cTnI and a truncated mutant (cTnI/NH2) missing the 32 amino acids. Using reconstituted preparations we could show no differences between cTnI and cTnI/NH2 either in inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity, in Ca(2+)-reversible inhibitory activity, or in the relation between pCa and Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site of cTnC at either pH 7.0 or 6.5. There were also no significant differences at either pH in the pCa-MgATPase activity relation of myofibrils into which the various species of TnI has been exchanged. Our results indicate: 1) that phosphorylation most likely induces a new state of TnI activity rather than altering an intrinsic effect of the NH2-terminal peptide on Ca2+ activation; and 2) that domains outside the NH2-terminal extension are important with regard to differences in effects of acidic pH on Ca2+ activation on cardiac and skeletal myofilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1585511281,"Proteolytic modifications of amyloid precursor protein (APP) play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease. However, each specific in vivo process has not yet been fully resolved in spatial terms because the orthodox approach employing electrophoretic analysis requires homogenization of samples and thus provides limited information on the localization of the process. To acquire such spatial information for the primary process involved in beta-amyloidogenesis, we have designed and developed a novel antibody exclusively specific to APP fragments possessing the exact amino terminus of the major beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide. Use of this antibody revealed that cleavage of APP at the amino terminal position of the A beta sequence is a normal steady-state process in gerbil hippocampus. Furthermore, nonfatal transient (10 min) forebrain ischemia followed by reperfusion enhanced the initial beta-amyloidogenic reaction mainly in pyramidal cells of CA1 sector and of dentate gyrus prior to and along with delayed neuronal degeneration. The APP fragments accumulated in cell bodies and dendrites of the neurons. These results suggest that beta-amyloidogenesis may involve a process that is also activated in postischemic brain and that ischemia-like conditions may contribute to pathogenic A beta accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1514283280,"Rab proteins occur in the cytosol bound to Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). We demonstrate here that cytosolic complexes of Rab9 bound to GDI represent a functional pool of Rab9 protein that can be utilized for transport from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network in vitro. Immunodepletion of GDI and Rab proteins bound to GDI led to the loss of cytosol activity; readdition of pure Rab9-GDI complexes fully restored cytosol activity. Delipidated serum albumin could solubilize prenylated Rab9 protein, but unlike Rab9-GDI complexes, Rab9-serum albumin complexes led to indiscriminate membrane association of Rab9 protein. Rab9 delivered to membranes by serum albumin was functional, but GDI increased the efficiency of Rab9 utilization, presumably because it suppressed Rab9 protein mistargeting. Finally, GDI inhibited transport of proteins from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network, likely because of its capacity to inhibit the membrane recruitment of cytosolic Rab9. These experiments show that GDI contributes to the selectivity of Rab9 membrane recruitment and presents functional Rab9 to the endosome-trans Golgi network transport machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1605952551,"A cysteine proteinase that preferentially hydrolyzes carbobenzyloxy-Phe-Arg-MCA (MCA, methylcoumaryl-7-amide) was purified from the culture medium of NIH-Sape-4 cells. The molecular mass of this enzyme was easily changed from 50 to 35 kDa, without appreciable loss of enzyme activity. From the analysis of its cDNA, this enzyme was concluded to be a procathepsin L of Sarcophaga. Only procathepsin L was found in the medium, while the mature 35-kDa cathepsin L was found exclusively in the cells, indicating that the cells have a mechanism to secrete procathepsin L selectively. An antibody against procathepsin L was found to inhibit the differentiation of imaginal discs cultured in vitro in the presence of 20-hydroxyecdysone. In fact imaginal discs were shown to secrete procathepsin L into the culture medium. These results suggest that procathepsin L is an essential proteinase for differentiation of imaginal discs. Northern blotting analysis revealed that unfertilized eggs contain a significant amount of mRNA for the procathepsin L as a maternal mRNA."

Using NHE-3-specific antibody, immunoblots of luminal membranes from LLC-PK1 and OK cells specifically labeled proteins with molecular masses 90 and 95 kDa, indicating that NHE-3 is the isoform expressed on the luminal membranes of these epithelia. Proximal tubular suspensions from rabbit kidney cortex were incubated in control (310 mosm/liter) or high osmolality (510 mosm/liter) medium for 45 min and utilized for brush border membrane vesicle preparation.

https://openalex.org/W1598275536,"Meprins are oligomeric cell surface metalloproteinases of the astacin family. They consist of two types of subunits (alpha and beta), which are evolutionarily related and whose cDNA sequences predict a similar domain structure. The present work shows that reducing agents solubilized meprin alpha subunits (approximately 90%), but not beta subunits, from mouse kidney brush border membranes. In addition, immunoblotting of membranes or purified meprins with an antibody raised to the alpha subunit epidermal growth factor-like domain, predicted to be near the COOH terminus from the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence, indicated that this domain is not present in the mature alpha subunit. By contrast, an epitope predicted to be near the COOH terminus of the beta subunit was present in the mature form of beta. When meprins were solubilized from brush border membranes by papain, the size of the alpha subunit (approximately 90 kDa) did not change, while the beta subunit decreased from 110 to 90 kDa with concomitant loss of the COOH-terminal epitope. These data indicate that beta is a type I transmembrane protein, while alpha does not transverse the membrane and its association is dependent on disulfide bonds. The oligomeric organization of purified meprin A (EC 3.4.24.18), examined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis and native gradient gel electrophoresis, is that of disulfide-bridged dimers which aggregate noncovalently to form higher molecular weight complexes, predominantly tetramers. Western blotting of ICR kidney brush border membrane proteins identified alpha 2 homodimers and alpha beta heterodimers. Treatment of mouse or rat kidney brush border membranes with 7 M urea solubilized alpha 2, but not alpha beta dimers. Thus, the mature alpha subunit exists in alpha 2 and alpha beta disulfide-linked dimers which form tetramers, and the alpha 2 homodimers associate with the membrane through noncovalent interactions with alpha beta."
https://openalex.org/W1547313148,"Several genes of the src family encode protein-tyrosine kinases that associate with the B-cell antigen receptor complex and are activated upon receptor cross-linking, including blk, lyn, and fyn. The blk gene is the only member of this family whose expression is restricted to B-lymphoid cells. In the B lineage, blk is developmentally regulated: blk transcripts are first detected in pro-B-cells and persist until the differentiation of mature B-cells to plasma cells. We have found that the blk promoter is a target for a specific DNA-binding protein whose activity in B-lymphoid cell lines is positively correlated with blk expression. By three criteria, we have identified this DNA-binding protein as the transcription factor B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP): 1) oligonucleotides containing known BSAP recognition sites were found to compete specifically with blk for binding to the protein detected in B-lymphoid extracts; 2) authentic BSAP was shown to bind the same site within the blk promoter as the protein identified in B-lymphoid extracts; and 3) the specific DNA-protein complex formed in B-lymphoid extracts was shown to react with an anti-BSAP antiserum. BSAP has been implicated previously in the transcriptional regulation of CD19, whose pattern of expression in B-cell development coincides with that of blk. These observations, and the correlation between expression of BSAP and expression of blk, suggest that BSAP is a positive regulator of blk transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1601254282,"Although cAMP-dependent epithelial chloride secretion is largely regulated via apical membrane chloride channels, cAMP also remodels basolateral F-actin and activates basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransport. Whether activation of cotransport is a primary event or secondary to activation of chloride efflux is not established, and the basis for the cytoskeletal dependence is unknown. We studied cotransport in the intestinal line HT29 (which lacks cAMP-regulated chloride efflux) and in its subclone Cl.19A (in which this pathway is present). Cotransporter activity was enhanced by forskolin in both lines but to a considerably greater extent in subclone Cl.19A, in which the number of bumetanide binding sites was also observed to increase. The F-actin stabilizer phalloidin markedly attenuated cAMP-stimulated cotransport in Cl.19A monolayers, but the increase in bumetanide binding was preserved. These studies identify two mechanisms for activation of Na-K-2Cl cotransport by cAMP: components independent and dependent of cAMP-elicited chloride efflux. Additional Na-K-2Cl cotransporters become accessible to the cell surface coincident with the salt efflux-dependent activation of cotransport. While F-actin rearrangements influence salt efflux-dependent up-regulation of the cotransporter, this influence occurs independently of increases in bumetanide-accessible cotransporters."
https://openalex.org/W1485571860,"Fc receptor-antibody interactions are key mechanisms through which antibody effector functions are mediated. The low affinity receptor for IgG, Fc gamma RII, is expressed on most hematopoietic cells, and through the binding of immune complexes mediates a large spectrum of biological responses vital for resistance to infection and the regulation of immunity. In this study the key residues of human Fc gamma RII involved in the interaction with IgG1 have been identified. Chimeric receptors composed of extracellular regions of Fc gamma RII and the Fc epsilon RI alpha chain have been used to localize the IgG1 binding site of Fc gamma RII to an 8-residue stretch in the second extracellular domain, Asn154 to Ser161. Site-directed mutagenesis of this region revealed that substitution of Ile155 or Gly156 with alanine ablated the binding of human and mouse IgG1, whereas replacement of Leu159, Phe160, or Ser161 with alanine enhanced binding. Molecular modeling has been used to generate a putative 3-dimensional model structure of the second extracellular domain of Fc gamma RII, suggesting that the binding site lies in an exposed loop region at the interface of domains 1 and 2."
https://openalex.org/W1569239054,"Abstract The all-type nicking enzyme (ATE) from human HeLa cells or calf thymus can nick DNA at the first phosphodiester bond 5' to all 8 possible mismatched bases. The strand disparity of this nicking is influenced by the neighboring nucleotide sequences. After nicking, the ATE covalently binds to the 3' end of the DNA product to form a cleavable complex, whose formation is insensitive to camptothecin, a specific inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I (Topo-I). During the purification of ATE from calf thymus, a Mg(2+)-independent relaxation activity, characteristic of eukaryotic Topo-I, copurifies with the mismatch-nicking activity. The ATE from calf thymus may be a breakdown product of Topo-I. N-terminal amino acid analysis indicates that one of the polypeptides with ATE activity contains the C-terminal portion of Topo-I. Moreover, active human Topo-I, expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, is also capable of nicking all 8 base mispairs in the absence of Mg2+. This mismatch-specific nicking activity may be a novel property of the mammalian Topo-I."
https://openalex.org/W1568575616,"The VAMPs/synaptobrevins (Vp/Sybs) are small integral membrane proteins. Two isoforms, Vp/Syb 1 and Vp/Syb 2, are considered to be specific to neural tissue. They are associated with synaptic vesicles and are believed to play an important role in neurotransmitter release. A third isoform, cellubrevin, has recently been found in non-neural tissues. We now report that the distribution of Vp/Syb 1 and Vp/Syb 2 is wider than previously thought. RNA transcripts for both Vp/Syb 1 and Vp/Syb 2 were found in rat skeletal muscle and in several other rat non-neural tissues, and antibodies specific for Vp/Syb 2 detected a protein in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi area of skeletal muscle. Thus Vp/Sybs 1 and 2 are not restricted to the nervous system but appear to be co-expressed with cellubrevin in many different tissues. This redundancy of Vp/Sybs in a single cell may be required to control the specificity of vesicle-target interaction in the several pathways of intracellular vesicle traffic that are operative within each cell."
https://openalex.org/W2135886741,"The bacteriophage Mu in vitro transposition reaction proceeds through several higher order nucleoprotein intermediates (transpososomes). One of the requirements for complex assembly is the Escherichia coli sequence-independent DNA-binding protein, HU. This protein has an affinity for Mu transpososomes, which is at least 100 times greater than for supercoiled DNA (Lavoie and Chaconas, 1990). We have recently identified one such high affinity binding site at the Mu left end by converting HU into a chemical nuclease (Lavoie and Chaconas, 1993). Using immunoelectron microscopy, we now report high affinity HU binding to a region(s) distinct from the previously characterized left end site. HU can be removed from this region by a 0.5 M NaCl wash and subsequently reassembled into the complex with high efficiency. Furthermore, chemical modification of the Mu A protein in the Type 1 complex does not block HU reassembly into the transpososome; the high affinity HU binding observed is therefore unlikely to result from A-HU interactions. These findings are corroborated by the ability of eukaryotic HMG-1 to functionally replace HU in transpososome formation and to efficiently assemble into HU-depleted complexes. We propose that HU recognition of an altered DNA structure, rather than protein-protein interactions, mediates high affinity HU binding to Mu transpososomes."
https://openalex.org/W1496827932,"In addition to thermal stress, a large variety of physical and chemical treatments are known to induce heat shock gene expression. Denatured protein, thought to result from the stress condition, has been postulated to act as the common signal. Accordingly, of three pairs of native and denatured proteins injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, only the denatured derivatives induced expression of a reporter gene from a heat shock promoter (Ananthan, J., Goldberg, A. L., and Voellmy, R. (1986) Science 232, 522-525). These observations are extended here. Protein denaturation per se is shown to be insufficient for heat shock induction; although reduced and carboxymethylated bovine serum albumin (rcm-BSA) and alpha-crystallin elicited a stress response, many other denatured proteins had no effect. Methylation of protein lysines, done to prevent ubiquitination, suppressed heat shock induction by rcm-BSA, but enhanced induction by alpha-crystallin. Thus, the potential for a protein to be ubiquitinated is independent of its ability to induce the stress response. Instead, aggregation distinguished the proteins that were effective stress inducers, and the formation of large aggregates correlated with the magnitude of the response. This correlation may derive in part from decreased in vivo degradation rates of the inducer proteins. An apparent requirement for stress response induction that the inducer proteins be injected directly into the oocyte nucleus may relate to this issue of in vivo stability. The dependence of the stress response on the amount of injected protein is non-linear and of a form consistent with the titration of a factor that otherwise suppresses heat shock gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1543505880,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is the most ubiquitously expressed peptide in the mammalian nervous system. Transcription of the NPY gene in PC12 cells is regulated by a number of agents, including the neurotrophic peptide nerve growth factor (NGF). In this paper, we define the cis-acting promoter elements which respond to NGF and characterize the trans-acting factors which interact with these sequences. The NGF-responsive elements of the NPY gene lie between nucleotides -87 and -36. At least four proteins interact with this promoter region. One of these proteins interacts with a CT-rich sequence centered at position -51, which closely abuts a binding site for transcription factor AP-2 centered at position -63. Two newly characterized factors bind between positions -87 and -58. These proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and, together with the other binding activities, modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPY gene. These results suggest that the concerted interplay of these proteins, in response to NGF, increases the transcriptional activity of the NPY gene."
https://openalex.org/W1634934935,"Ion microscopy was employed to investigate intracellular total calcium concentrations and calcium influx, and efflux in resting and antigen-stimulated tumor mast cells (RBL-2H3 cells). The nucleus, a perinuclear region which included the Golgi apparatus (Golgi region), and the remaining cytoplasm were spatially resolved with the Cameca IMS-3f ion microscope in cryogenically prepared cells. In resting cells the nucleus contained about 0.60 mM, the Golgi region about 1.2 mM, and the remaining cytoplasm about 1.0 mM total calcium. Antigen stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia cells resulted in a significant loading of calcium in all three cellular compartments. Antigen stimulation in the absence of extracellular calcium resulted in a significant loss of total calcium from all three intracellular compartments. Influx and efflux of calcium were measured simultaneously in resting and stimulated cells by using stable 44Ca in the extracellular solution, and by imaging mass 40 to determine the native intracellular calcium (40Ca) and mass 44 to localize the 44Ca that entered the cell from extracellular solution. After a 10-min incubation, 0.240 fmol of the total calcium per cell had been replaced with 44Ca, which amounts to about 33% of the total cell calcium. If antigen was present during this incubation there was an additional loss of 0.229 fmol of 40Ca and an added gain of 0.476 fmol of 44Ca per cell, which corresponds to a net increase in total intracellular calcium of 0.247 fmol."
https://openalex.org/W1552192690,"Injections of hsc70 protein into Xenopus oocytes lowered the stress response to both a thermal shock and to co-injected protein inducers. Binding of hsc70 to native and modified forms of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were tested by two assays. In one, nitrocellulose-bound proteins were incubated with hsc70, cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, and then bound hsc70 was probed with a monoclonal anti-hsc70 antibody. In the second, peroxidase-conjugated hsc70 was employed as a more direct probe for binding to proteins displayed on nitrocellulose membranes. hsc70 binding to the BSA derivatives correlated with their abilities to induce a stress response upon microinjection into oocytes. Reduced and carboxymethylated (rcm) BSA, the most potent stress inducer tested, was bound most tightly by hsc70, whereas hsc70 had moderate affinity for N-methylated rcm-BSA and very little affinity for the native protein. No binding was observed with iodinated BSA. The results suggest a mechanism whereby the cell employs hsc70 or other proteins of the hsp70 family both to trigger the response to an environmental stress and to provide a feedback mechanism to attenuate the response."
https://openalex.org/W1579809197,"From yeast nuclear extract, we have identified several DNA-protein complexes using the T-rich strand of core consensus sequence of autonomously replicating sequence by gel shift assay. One of them showed preferential binding to the T-rich sequence of the DNA. We have partially purified a protein constituent of this complex and cloned its gene. The gene has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 380 amino acids (M(r) = 42,100) which is processed to a mature protein of 371 amino acids (M(r) = 40,900). The protein has neither significant amino acid homology with any previously reported proteins nor characteristic motifs. A putative HAP2/HAP3/HAP4 binding sequence was found at about 1 kilobase upstream of the gene. Disruption of the chromosomal gene revealed that the gene was neither essential for cell viability nor involved in DNA replication, but was essential for mitochondrial respiratory function. We therefore named the gene MRF1 for mitochondrial respiratory function 1. In a mrf1 null mutant the absorption spectra of cytochromes b, a, and a3 were undetectable, although mitochondrial DNA and protein synthesis in mitochondria were intact. Antibodies against MRF1 detected the antigen localized predominantly in the nucleus in vivo. These results suggest that MRF1 is a transcriptional regulatory protein of some genes whose products are necessary for the functional assembly of mitochondrial respiratory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1599786703,"The rat GABAA receptor delta subunit gene has been isolated and its promoter mapped to facilitate studies of neuron-specific gene transcription. The gene is transcribed from a single promoter with several clustered transcriptional initiation sites. The major start site maps to a prototype initiator sequence located in the center of a TATA-less CpG-rich island. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the GABAA receptor delta subunit gene revealed a novel tandemly repeated purine sequence element. Furthermore, gel retardation assays identified several tissue-specific and ubiquitous proteins that bind to this sequence. One of these factors, brain-specific factor (BSF) 1, was only observed in extracts from brain and was distinct from BETA and PAL, two DNA-binding proteins with similar purine-rich recognition sequences. The distribution of BSF1 in brain closely matched the expression pattern previously determined for the delta subunit mRNA, and its binding activity appeared simultaneously with GABAA receptor delta subunit mRNA during differentiation of cerebellar granule cells in vitro. Our data therefore suggest that BSF1 is a novel brain-specific and neuronal cell type-enriched factor possibly involved in differential transcription of the GABAA receptor delta subunit gene."
https://openalex.org/W1556266098,"Relatively high ATP concentrations show an unexpected lack of inhibition of the hydrolysis of low concentrations of trinitrophenyl ATP (TNP-ATP) by mitochondrial F1-ATPase. In striking contrast low TNP-ATP concentrations markedly inhibit the hydrolysis of much higher ATP concentrations. The three catalytic sites undergoing sequential conformational changes have different conformations at any instant of catalysis, and only two need to be filled for rapid, steady-state ATP hydrolysis. The remaining site has low affinity for ATP (Kd 2 mM) but about 10(4) greater affinity for TNP-ATP (Km and Kd about 0.2 microM). Thus 500 microM ATP does not prevent binding of less than 1 microM TNP-ATP. As the site binding the TNP-ATP undergoes sequential conformational changes the TNP-ATP undergoes sequential conformational changes the TNP-ATP is hydrolyzed and products are released. The results give strong support to the view that all three catalytic sites proceed equivalently in ATP as well as TNP-ATP hydrolysis. The conformation that has the lowest affinity for ATP has over a 10-fold greater affinity for ADP (Kd 150 microM) and may be akin to the conformation to which ADP binds during net ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase. The recognition of these features was made possible by new information obtained from detailed studies of the interactions of Mg2+, TNP-ADP, TNP-ATP, ATP, and noncatalytic sites on initial and steady-state hydrolysis rates."
https://openalex.org/W174552899,"Plasma membranes of soybean cells actively engaged in sucrose transport have a sucrose binding protein (SBP) that does not appear to be an integral membrane protein. Experiments were undertaken to analyze the topographical association of this protein with the membrane. Treatment of purified plasma membrane vesicles with either 1 M KCl or KI released less than 35% of the sucrose binding protein from the membrane whereas treatment with either 4 M urea or 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.5, disassociated between 50 and 70%, respectively, of this protein from the membrane. SDS, at either 0.5x, 1x, or 10x of its critical micelle concentration, effectively solubilized the sucrose binding protein. The nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and CHAPS, at either 0.5x, 1x, or 10x of their critical micelle concentration, solubilized between 65 and 75% of this protein. When either native plasma membrane-associated or in vitro-transcribed and -translated SBP were subjected to Triton X-114 phase separation, 80% partitioned into the detergent-poor aqueous phase. These results indicate that the SBP is a peripheral membrane protein but also suggest that there is a population of this protein that is tethered to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1534277217,"Transcription of the TRP3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by GCN4p from a position proximal to the transcriptional initiation sites. The promoter's apparent lack of a conventional TATA element sequence has led it to be used as a model for TATA-less promoters. Through mutational analysis of the TRP3 promoter, we have identified two additional regulatory elements required for expression. The first, located 57 base pairs (bp) upstream of the GCN4p binding site, binds ABF1p in vitro. The ABF1p binding site was required for maximal levels of GCN4p-activated transcription in vivo; however, the -fold activation by GCN4p was not altered by ABF1p. The second element, positioned 23 bp downstream of the GCN4p binding site, contained the TATA-like sequence, TATTAA. This element was required for both basal and activated expression and almost certainly functions as a TATA-binding protein interaction site. Mutations that improved its TATA character for native or an altered specificity mutant of TATA-binding protein correspondingly improved its function. Interestingly, basal expression induced by ABF1p was virtually unchanged in the presence of point mutations in the TATTAA element. Furthermore, unlike the case for HIS3 where only a limited subset of TATA-like sequences can activate transcription in conjunction with GCN4p, many divergent TATA-like sequences allowed GCN4p activation of TRP3. We suggest that the apparent promoter specific use of these TATA elements by GCN4p results from ABF1p amplifying the GCN4p-induced expression to a detectable level."
https://openalex.org/W1510599234,"While it has been known that supercoiling of the DNA template can be induced by transcription, the mechanism and the efficiency of this process in vivo is not fully understood. We report here that transcription of genes encoding 16 S rRNA, a stable RNA species, or cytoplasmic polypeptides leads to very little or no detectable DNA supercoiling even under the optimum conditions in Escherichia coli. This indicates that hydrodynamic drag on the transcription complex (including RNA polymerase, nascent RNA, ribosomes, and nascent polypeptides) is not sufficient to anchor RNA polymerase during coupled transcription-translation. On the other hand, transcription of membrane-associated genes encoding integral inner membrane or exported periplasmic polypeptides leads to apparent DNA supercoiling. Transcription of genes encoding integral inner membrane polypeptides leads to significantly greater anchoring of RNA polymerase than does transcription of genes encoding periplasmic polypeptides. This may reflect differences in the coupling of transcription-translation with membrane association during expression of these two classes of polypeptides. Evidence is further presented to suggest that the anchoring of RNA polymerase is probably achieved through the interaction of nascent polypeptides with the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane during coupled transcription-translation. Moreover, transcriptions of a membrane-associated gene can, under certain circumstances, induce topological anchoring of an RNA polymerase transcribing a neighboring gene that ordinarily is not membrane-associated. Finally, the potential biological consequences of our findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1582162146,"Abstract A modified rat liver cytochrome P-450IA1, lacking amino acids 2-30, a proposed membrane anchor for cytochrome P-450, was expressed genetically in yeast microsomal membranes. This truncated cytochrome is practically active in the deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin. A full-length cytochrome P-450IA1 was also expressed in yeast microsomes. Rotational diffusion of P-450IA1 was examined by observing the flash-induced absorption anisotropy r(t) of the P-450.CO complex. The anisotropy decayed to a time-independent value within a 2-ms time range. Since the decay curve has the characteristics of a slow rotation of membrane-embedded cytochrome, the theoretical analysis of r(t) was performed based on a rotation-about-membrane normal model. 41% of the shortened P-450IA1 was rotating with the rotational relaxation time phi of 1020 microseconds, whereas 27% of the full-length P-450IA1 was mobile with phi = 1101 microseconds. The high salt treatment did not remove the shortened cytochrome from the membrane and also did not drastically weaken the interactions of the cytochrome with the membrane, as judged from the slow rotation characteristics (phi = 830 microseconds). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal shortened P-450IA1 is incorporated properly into the yeast microsomal membrane and that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment is not solely responsible for attachment to the membrane, providing evidence that additional segments of P-450IA1 are involved in the membrane binding."
https://openalex.org/W1504441283,"Abstract Traditionally, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been isolated and the corresponding gene cloned from drug-resistant cell lines which have amplified DHFR genes after selection. A Dhfr sequence has now been obtained by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from Drosophila bearing a single gene copy. Using the PCR-amplified partial cDNA as a probe, Dhfr was cloned by screening a Drosophila genomic library. It consists of regulatory regions as well as a 599-nucleotide coding region with a single 50-base pair (bp) intron and encodes a protein of 182 amino acids. Previously we have shown that the enzyme has kinetic properties characteristic of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DHFRs. Here we show that the organization of Drosophila Dhfr is strikingly different from its mammalian counterparts and most similar to that of mosquito. A 790-bp transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis, with a single transcription start site located 27 bp upstream of ATG codon. The Drosophila genome contains a single Dhfr copy at 89E and a selected cell line has not amplified the gene. Confirmation of the identity of this gene has been obtained by kinetic studies of recombinant DHFR over-expressed in Escherichia coli cells."
https://openalex.org/W141273177,"The narrow spectrum mercury-resistant (mer) operons of transposons Tn21 and Tn501 are inducible by inorganic mercury salts. The major regulatory gene merR is transcribed divergently from the other mer genes, which are cotranscribed. The MerR protein represses its own expression, as well as the expression of the other mer genes in the absence of the inducers. The synthesis of the polycistronic mer message is stimulated by MerR in the presence of the inducers. The MerRBS protein encoded by the broad spectrum mer operon of plasmid pDU1358 was characterized as a novel organomercurial receptor, distinguishing it from the narrow spectrum MerRNS proteins, described above. Several organomercurial compounds directly effected cellular activation of the mer operon transcription via the receptor protein MerRBS, but not by MerRNS. The merR gene from pDU1358 was cloned under the tac promoter, and the overexpressed MerRBS protein was soluble in buffer solutions containing 0.5 M NaCl at pH 7.5, but precipitated when NaCl concentration was reduced to 0.1 M (MerRBS concentrations at or above 0.1 mg/ml). MerRBS was purified to near homogeneity by selective precipitation and solubilization by varying the salt concentration in buffer solutions, followed by Sephadex G-75 column chromatography. Both MerRBS and Tn21-encoded MerRNS bound with DNA fragments containing the pDU1358 mer operator sequence with comparable affinities. In vitro run-off transcription studies revealed that MerRBS activated mer operon expression in the presence of Hg2+ or phenylmercuric acetate. Phenylmercuric acetate did not induce mer operon expression when the MerRNS was used in the assay."
https://openalex.org/W123455076,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, which, like other members of the ras superfamily, are activated by exchanging bound GDP for GTP and inactivated through hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate of bound GTP to form GDP in a highly regulated cycle. ARF 6, a class III ARF, was expressed in Escherichia coli with its amino terminus fused to maltose-binding protein. Following release from maltose-binding protein, recombinant ARF 6 (rARF 6) exhibited maximal activity with or without GTP. Such constitutive activation was due to the predominance of ARF-GTP over ARF-GDP, as demonstrated by nucleotide analysis. rARF 6 expressed in E. coli without amino-terminal extension was bound primarily to GDP and exhibited typical GTP-dependent activity. After release from maltose-binding protein, rARF 6-GTP was stable; only a fraction of the nucleotide was removed using EDTA, whereas urea denaturation restored complete GTP dependence. [alpha-32P]GTP bound to rARF 6 was in part protected from hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase and resulted in the formation of [alpha-32P]GTP, -GDP, and -GMP, whereas unbound nucleotide was completely hydrolyzed to guanosine. Thus, amino-terminal extension of rARF 6, by maltose-binding protein, promoted the formation of a constitutively activated GTP-bound species. By analysis of this species, we confirmed that rARF 6 lacks the intrinsic ability to hydrolyze bound GTP and speculate that maltose-binding protein may inhibit hydrolysis by extrinsic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1482669722,"It was previously shown that the reductive debromination of BrCCl3 to trichloromethyl radical by human hemoglobin leads to formation of dissociable altered heme products, two of which are identical to those formed from myoglobin and one which is novel. In this study, we have elucidated the structure of this novel adduct with the use of mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 13C NMR as a substitution product of a -C(Cl) = CCl2 moiety for a beta-hydrogen atom on the prosthetic heme's ring I vinyl group. From studies with the use of 13C-enriched BrCCl3, it was determined that the added carbon atoms were derived from 2 eq of BrCCl3. A mechanism that involves multiple reductive events and a radical cation heme intermediate is proposed. Consistent with this mechanism, cellular reductants were found to selectively enhance the amount of this novel dissociable heme adduct. These studies reveal fine differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin in the accessibility of reactive intermediates to the ring I vinyl group, as well as the potential importance of cellular reductants on the course of heme alteration."
https://openalex.org/W1590903536,"The human interferon-gamma receptor (hIFN-gamma R) extracellular domain interacts in a species-specific manner with both its ligand and an accessory factor encoded on human chromosome 21. Mutant interferon-gamma receptors were constructed by homolog-scanning mutagenesis, replacing segments of the human extracellular domain with the corresponding murine sequence. Replacement of hIFN-gamma R amino acids 1-100, 100-132, 134-183, or 183-245 abolished binding to human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma). However, replacement of hIFN-gamma R amino acids 134-209, 183-209, 134-153, 153-167, or 167-183 or deletion of residues 156-165 affected hIFN-gamma binding only partially or not at all. Receptors that bound hIFN-gamma were tested for their ability to signal a functional response, induction of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression. Replacement of residues 134-209 greatly reduced the ability of the receptor to signal. This signaling defect could not be attributed solely to a reduction in affinity for ligand and could not be localized to any subregion."
https://openalex.org/W1500182883,"Introduction of the murine resistance (Levenson, R., Racaniello, V., Albritton, L., and Housman, D. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1489-1493) into African Green monkey CV1 cells reportedly resulted in one cell line, OR6 cells, which was found to be resistant to > 1 mM ouabain (English, L., Epstein, J., Cantley, L., Housman, D., and Levenson, R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1114-1119). The present analysis of the genomic sequence of the alpha 1-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase from OR6 cells reveals copies of the gene for the murine and human alpha 1-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase and not the monkey gene, indicating that the cells have been misidentified. The sequence of the murine alpha 1-subunit from OR6 cells reveals a single point mutation encoding a T797-I797 amino acid substitution at the H6 membrane border. Transfection of CV1 cells with a murine alpha 1 cDNA containing this point mutation resulted in cells with an IC50 for ouabain of approximately 5 mM. These data show that the super ouabain-resistant phenotype of OR6 cells is due to expression of a mutant form of the murine alpha 1-subunit of the sodium pump (rather than the ouabain resistance gene) and further support the recent data suggesting involvement of the H5-H6 domain in ouabain inhibition of the sodium pump."
