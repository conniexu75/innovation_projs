https://openalex.org/W2043756611,"Small-vessel vasculitis (SVV) is a chronic autoinflammatory condition linked to antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCAs). Here we show that chromatin fibers, so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), are released by ANCA-stimulated neutrophils and contain the targeted autoantigens proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Deposition of NETs in inflamed kidneys and circulating MPO-DNA complexes suggest that NET formation triggers vasculitis and promotes the autoimmune response against neutrophil components in individuals with SVV."
https://openalex.org/W2144534164,"Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by reward or sensory stimuli predicting reward. These excitatory responses increase as the reward value increases. This response property has led to a hypothesis that dopamine neurons encode value-related signals and are inhibited by aversive events. Here we show that this is true only for a subset of dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of dopamine neurons in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a Pavlovian procedure with appetitive and aversive outcomes (liquid rewards and airpuffs directed at the face, respectively). We found that some dopamine neurons were excited by reward-predicting stimuli and inhibited by airpuff-predicting stimuli, as the value hypothesis predicts. However, a greater number of dopamine neurons were excited by both of these stimuli, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Some dopamine neurons were also excited by both rewards and airpuffs themselves, especially when they were unpredictable. Neurons excited by the airpuff-predicting stimuli were located more dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta, whereas neurons inhibited by the stimuli were located more ventromedially, some in the ventral tegmental area. A similar anatomical difference was observed for their responses to actual airpuffs. These findings suggest that different groups of dopamine neurons convey motivational signals in distinct manners."

https://openalex.org/W1967937835,"It has been well shown that NF-κB has a crucial role in promoting the maturation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Now, Cun-Yu Wang and his colleagues show that it also has a role in inhibiting the function of mature bone-forming osteoblasts. They go on to show that deficiency of NF-κB specifically in osteoblasts increases bone formation and protects against bone loss in experimentally-induced osteoporosis in mice. An imbalance in bone formation relative to bone resorption results in the net bone loss that occurs in osteoporosis and inflammatory bone diseases. Although it is well known how bone resorption is stimulated, the molecular mechanisms that mediate impaired bone formation are poorly understood. Here we show that the time- and stage-specific inhibition of endogenous inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)–nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in differentiated osteoblasts substantially increases trabecular bone mass and bone mineral density without affecting osteoclast activities in young mice. Moreover, inhibition of IKK–NF-κB in differentiated osteoblasts maintains bone formation, thereby preventing osteoporotic bone loss induced by ovariectomy in adult mice. Inhibition of IKK–NF-κB enhances the expression of Fos-related antigen-1 (Fra-1), an essential transcription factor involved in bone matrix formation in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting IKK–NF-κB may help to promote bone formation in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2080585999,"Changes in gene expression contribute to the long-lasting regulation of the brain's reward circuitry seen in drug addiction; however, the specific genes regulated and the transcriptional mechanisms underlying such regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with promoter microarray analysis to characterize genome-wide chromatin changes in the mouse nucleus accumbens, a crucial brain reward region, after repeated cocaine administration. Our findings reveal several interesting principles of gene regulation by cocaine and of the role of DeltaFosB and CREB, two prominent cocaine-induced transcription factors, in this brain region. The findings also provide comprehensive insight into the molecular pathways regulated by cocaine-including a new role for sirtuins (Sirt1 and Sirt2)-which are induced in the nucleus accumbens by cocaine and, in turn, dramatically enhance the behavioral effects of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2136326352,"Age at menarche and age at natural menopause are associated with causes of substantial morbidity and mortality such as breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. We conducted a joint analysis of two genome-wide association studies of these two traits in a total of 17,438 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, N = 2,287) and the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS, N = 15,151). For age at menarche, we identified ten associated SNPs (P = 1 × 10(-7)-3 × 10(-13)) clustered at 6q21 (in or near the gene LIN28B) and 9q31.2 (in an intergenic region). For age at natural menopause, we identified 13 associated SNPs (P = 1 × 10(-7)-1 × 10(-21)) clustered at 20p12.3 (in the gene MCM8), 19q13.42 (in or near the gene BRSK1), 5q35.2 (in or near genes UIMC1 and HK3) and 6p24.2 (in the gene SYCP2L). These newly identified loci might expand understanding of the biological pathways regulating these two traits."

https://openalex.org/W2084621409,"The delivery to primary cells is a major challenge in the application of siRNAs in biological research. Using a fusion protein consisting of a double-stranded RNA binding domain and a protein transduction domain, Eguchi et al. are able to transfect siRNAs into a wide variety of cells with very high efficiency without cytotoxicity. RNA interference (RNAi) induced by short interfering RNA (siRNA) allows for discovery research and large-scale screening1,2,3,4,5; however, owing to their size and anionic charge, siRNAs do not readily enter cells4,5. Current approaches do not deliver siRNAs into a high percentage of primary cells without cytotoxicity. Here we report an efficient siRNA delivery approach that uses a peptide transduction domain–double-stranded RNA-binding domain (PTD-DRBD) fusion protein. DRBDs bind to siRNAs with high avidity, masking the siRNA's negative charge and allowing PTD-mediated cellular uptake. PTD-DRBD–delivered siRNA induced rapid RNAi in a large percentage of various primary and transformed cells, including T cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human embryonic stem cells. We observed no cytotoxicity, minimal off-target transcriptional changes and no induction of innate immune responses. Thus, PTD-DRBD–mediated siRNA delivery allows efficient gene silencing in difficult-to-transfect primary cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2094323986,"Ken Ong and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for age at menarche. They find LIN28B associated with age at menarche, as well as several traits related to onset of puberty in both females and males. The timing of puberty is highly variable1. We carried out a genome-wide association study for age at menarche in 4,714 women and report an association in LIN28B on chromosome 6 (rs314276, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.33, P = 1.5 × 10−8). In independent replication studies in 16,373 women, each major allele was associated with 0.12 years earlier menarche (95% CI = 0.08–0.16; P = 2.8 × 10−10; combined P = 3.6 × 10−16). This allele was also associated with earlier breast development in girls (P = 0.001; N = 4,271); earlier voice breaking (P = 0.006, N = 1,026) and more advanced pubic hair development in boys (P = 0.01; N = 4,588); a faster tempo of height growth in girls (P = 0.00008; N = 4,271) and boys (P = 0.03; N = 4,588); and shorter adult height in women (P = 3.6 × 10−7; N = 17,274) and men (P = 0.006; N = 9,840) in keeping with earlier growth cessation. These studies identify variation in LIN28B, a potent and specific regulator of microRNA processing2, as the first genetic determinant regulating the timing of human pubertal growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2048270592,"Although it is firmly established that neuronal activity is a prime determinant of animal behavior, relationships between astrocytic excitation and animal behavior have remained opaque. Cerebellar Bergmann glia are radial astrocytes that are implicated in motor behavior and exhibit Ca(2+) excitation. However, Ca(2+) excitation in these cells has not previously been studied in behaving animals. Using two-photon microscopy we found that Bergmann glia exhibit three forms of Ca(2+) excitation in awake, behaving mice. Two of these are ongoing within the cerebellar vermis. During locomotor performance concerted Ca(2+) excitation arises in networks of at least hundreds of Bergmann glia extending across several hundred microns or more. Concerted Ca(2+) excitation was abolished by anesthesia or blockade of either neural activity or glutamatergic transmission. Thus, large networks of Bergmann glia can be activated by specific animal behaviors and undergo excitation of sufficient magnitude to potentially initiate macroscopic changes in brain dynamics or blood flow."

We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data to detect genes influencing age at menarche in 17,510 women. The strongest signal was at 9q31.2 (P = 1.7 × 10−9), where the nearest genes include TMEM38B, FKTN, FSD1L, TAL2 and ZNF462. The next best signal was near the LIN28B gene (rs7759938; P = 7.0 × 10−9), which also influences adult height. We provide the first evidence for common genetic variants influencing female sexual maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2141731733,"Inferior olive neurons regulate plasticity and timing in the cerebellar cortex via the climbing fiber pathway, but direct characterization of the output of this nucleus has remained elusive. We show that single somatic action potentials in olivary neurons are translated into a burst of axonal spikes. The number of spikes in the burst depends on the phase of subthreshold oscillations and, therefore, encodes the state of the olivary network. These bursts can be successfully transmitted to the cerebellar cortex in vivo, having a significant impact on Purkinje cells. They enhance dendritic spikes, modulate the complex spike pattern, and promote short-term and long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses in a manner dependent on the number of spikes in the burst. Our results challenge the view that the climbing fiber conveys an all-or-none signal to the cerebellar cortex and help to link learning and timing theories of olivocerebellar function."

https://openalex.org/W2106758010,"Synaptotagmin-IV (syt-IV) is a membrane trafficking protein that influences learning and memory, but its localization and role in synaptic function remain unclear. We found that syt-IV localized to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-containing vesicles in hippocampal neurons. Syt-IV/BDNF-harboring vesicles underwent exocytosis in both axons and dendrites, and syt-IV inhibited BDNF release at both sites. Knockout of syt-IV increased, and overexpression decreased, the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis from presynaptic terminals indirectly via changes in postsynaptic release of BDNF. Thus, postsynaptic syt-IV regulates the trans-synaptic action of BDNF to control presynaptic vesicle dynamics. Furthermore, selective loss of presynaptic syt-IV increased spontaneous quantal release, whereas a loss of postsynaptic syt-IV increased quantal amplitude. Finally, syt-IV knockout mice showed enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), which depended entirely on disinhibition of BDNF release. Thus, regulation of BDNF secretion by syt-IV emerges as a mechanism for maintaining synaptic strength in a useful range during LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2171628897,"Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV)-hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) is an adult-onset, moderately progressive autosomal recessive myopathy; eventually, affected individuals become wheelchair bound1. It is characterized clinically by skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness, and pathologically by rimmed vacuoles, which are actually accumulations of autophagic vacuoles2, 3, 4, scattered angular fibers and intracellular accumulation of amyloid and other proteins5. To date, no therapy is available for this debilitating myopathy, primarily because the disease pathomechanism has been enigmatic. It is known that the disease gene underlying DMRV-hIBM is GNE, encoding glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase and N-acetylmannosamine kinase6, 7, 8--two essential enzymes in sialic acid biosynthesis9. It is still unclear, however, whether decreased sialic acid production causes muscle degeneration, as GNE has been proposed to have roles other than for sialic acid biosynthesis10, 11, 12. By showing that muscle atrophy and weakness are completely prevented in a mouse model of DMRV-hIBM after treatment with sialic acid metabolites orally, we provide evidence that hyposialylation is indeed one of the key factors in the pathomechanism of DMRV-hIBM. These results support the notion that DMRV-hIBM can potentially be treated simply by giving sialic acids, a strategy that could be applied in clinical trials in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2010076661,"Cell proliferation requires the coordinated activity of cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways to provide ATP and building blocks for DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Many metabolic pathway genes are targets of the c-myc oncogene and cell-cycle regulator. However, the contribution of c-Myc to the activation of cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic networks during cell-cycle entry is unknown. Here, we report the metabolic fates of [U-(13)C] glucose in serum-stimulated myc(-/-) and myc(+/+) fibroblasts by (13)C isotopomer NMR analysis. We demonstrate that endogenous c-myc increased (13)C labeling of ribose sugars, purines and amino acids, indicating partitioning of glucose carbons into C1/folate and pentose phosphate pathways, and increased tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover at the expense of anaplerotic flux. Myc expression also increased global O-linked N-acetylglucosamine protein modification, and inhibition of hexosamine biosynthesis selectively reduced growth of Myc-expressing cells, suggesting its importance in Myc-induced proliferation. These data reveal a central organizing function for the Myc oncogene in the metabolism of cycling cells. The pervasive deregulation of this oncogene in human cancers may be explained by its function in directing metabolic networks required for cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2068184290,"In hair cells, mechanotransduction channels are gated by tip links, the extracellular filaments that consist of cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and connect the stereocilia of each hair cell. However, which molecules mediate cadherin function at tip links is not known. Here we show that the PDZ-domain protein harmonin is a component of the upper tip-link density (UTLD), where CDH23 inserts into the stereociliary membrane. Harmonin domains that mediate interactions with CDH23 and F-actin control harmonin localization in stereocilia and are necessary for normal hearing. In mice expressing a mutant harmonin protein that prevents UTLD formation, the sensitivity of hair bundles to mechanical stimulation is reduced. We conclude that harmonin is a UTLD component and contributes to establishing the sensitivity of mechanotransduction channels to displacement."
https://openalex.org/W1964578632,"The tumor suppressor p53 preserves genome integrity by inducing transcription of genes controlling growth arrest or apoptosis. Transcriptional activation involves nucleosomal perturbation by chromatin remodeling enzymes. Mammalian SWI/SNF remodeling complexes incorporate either the Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) or Brahma (Brm) as the ATPase subunit. The observation that tumor cell lines harboring wild-type p53 specifically maintain expression of BRG1 and that BRG1 complexes with p53 prompted us to examine the role of BRG1 in regulation of p53. Remarkably, RNAi depletion of BRG1, but not Brm, led to the activation of endogenous wild-type p53 and cell senescence. We found a proline-rich region unique to BRG1 was required for binding to the histone acetyl transferase protein, CBP, as well as to p53. Ectopic expression of a proline-rich region deletion mutant BRG1 that is defective for CBP binding inhibited p53 destabilization. Importantly, RNAi knockdown of BRG1 and CBP reduced p53 poly-ubiquitination in vivo. In support of p53 inactivation by the combined activities of BRG1 and CBP, we show that DNA damage signals promoted disassociation of BRG1 from CBP, thereby allowing p53 accumulation. Our data demonstrate a novel function of the evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodeling subunit BRG1, which cooperates with CBP to constrain p53 activity and permit cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2133647900,"Making successful decisions under uncertainty due to noisy sensory signals is thought to benefit from previous experience. However, the human brain mechanisms that mediate flexible decisions through learning remain largely unknown. Comparing behavioral choices of human observers with those of a pattern classifier based on multivoxel single-trial fMRI signals, we show that category learning shapes processes related to decision variables in frontal and higher occipitotemporal regions rather than signal detection or response execution in primary visual or motor areas. In particular, fMRI signals in prefrontal regions reflect the observers' behavioral choice according to the learned decision criterion only in the context of the categorization task. In contrast, higher occipitotemporal areas show learning-dependent changes in the representation of perceived categories that are sustained after training independent of the task. These findings demonstrate that learning shapes selective representations of sensory readout signals in accordance with the decision criterion to support flexible decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2073770337,"Thiol reactive cyclopentenone prostaglandin, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), induced a novel, nonapoptotic and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1 LC3) dependent but nonautophagic form of cell death in colon, breast and prostate cancer cell lines, characterized by extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation with dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Disruption of sulfhydryl homeostasis, which resulted in ER stress, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and subsequent ER dilation, contributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)-independent cell death by 15d-PGJ2. Absence of intracellular organelles in these vacuoles, shown by electron microscopy and unique fragmentation of lamin B, suggested this form of cell death to be different from autophagy and apoptosis. Cell death induced by 15d-PGJ2 is prevented by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, suggesting a requirement of new protein synthesis for death with cytoplasmic vacuolation. Here, we report for the first time that upregulation and processing of autophagy marker LC3 is an important event in nonautophagic cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death. Notably, knockdown of LC3 conferred significant protection against 15d-PGJ2-induced cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death, suggesting a novel role of LC3 in a death process other than autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2003981789,"Protein kinase A (PKA) plays multiple roles in neurons. The localization and specificity of PKA are largely controlled by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). However, the dynamics of PKA in neurons and the roles of specific AKAPs are poorly understood. We imaged the distribution of type II PKA in hippocampal and cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vitro and in vivo. PKA was concentrated in dendritic shafts compared to the soma, axons, and dendritic spines. This spatial distribution was imposed by the microtubule-binding protein MAP2, indicating that MAP2 is the dominant AKAP in neurons. Following cAMP elevation, catalytic subunits dissociated from the MAP2-tethered regulatory subunits and rapidly became enriched in nearby spines. The spatial gradient of type II PKA between dendritic shafts and spines was critical for the regulation of synaptic strength and long-term potentiation. Therefore, the localization and activity-dependent translocation of type II PKA are important determinants of PKA function."
https://openalex.org/W2080193153,"Inappropriate kinase expression and subsequent promiscuous activity defines the transformation of many solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thus, the expression of novel tumor-associated kinases has the potential to dramatically shape tumor cell behavior. Further, identifying tumor-associated kinases can lend insight into patterns of tumor growth and characteristics. Here, we report the identification of the RTK-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2), a new tumor-associated kinase in RCC cell lines and primary tumors. Ror2 is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase with physiological expression normally seen in the embryonic kidney. However, in RCC, Ror2 expression correlated with expression of genes involved at the extracellular matrix, including Twist and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). Expression of MMP2 in RCC cells was suppressed by Ror2 knockdown, placing Ror2 as a mediator of MMP2 regulation in RCC and a potential regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling. The suppression of Ror2 not only inhibited cell migration, but also inhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model. These findings suggest a novel pathway of tumor-promoting activity by Ror2 within a subset of renal carcinomas, with significant implications for unraveling the tumorigenesis of RCC."

Here we show that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) promotes the expression of CLIC4 and Schnurri-2 as well as their association in the cytoplasm and their translocation to the nucleus. In the absence of CLIC4 or Schnurri-2, TGF-beta signalling is abrogated. Direct nuclear targeting of CLIC4 enhances TGF-beta signalling and removes the requirement for Schnurri-2. Nuclear CLIC4 associates with phospho (p)-Smad2 and p-Smad3, protecting them from dephosphorylation by nuclear phosphatases. An intact TGF-beta signalling pathway is essential for CLIC4-mediated growth-arrest. These results newly identify Schnurri-2 and CLIC4 as modifiers of TGF-beta signalling through their stabilization of p-Smad2 and 3 in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1964072600,"Vc1.1 is a disulfide-rich peptide inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that has stimulated considerable interest in these receptors as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Here we present an extensive series of mutational studies in which all residues except the conserved cysteines were mutated separately to Ala, Asp, or Lys. The effect on acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked membrane currents at the alpha9alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which has been implicated as a target in the alleviation of neuropathic pain, was then observed. The analogs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy to determine the effects of mutations on structure. The structural fold was found to be preserved in all peptides except where Pro was substituted. Electrophysiological studies showed that the key residues for functional activity are Asp(5)-Arg(7) and Asp(11)-Ile(15), because changes at these positions resulted in the loss of activity at the alpha9alpha10 nAChR. Interestingly, the S4K and N9A analogs were more potent than Vc1.1 itself. A second generation of mutants was synthesized, namely N9G, N9I, N9L, S4R, and S4K+N9A, all of which were more potent than Vc1.1 at both the rat alpha9alpha10 and the human alpha9/rat alpha10 hybrid receptor, providing a mechanistic insight into the key residues involved in eliciting the biological function of Vc1.1. The most potent analogs were also tested at the alpha3beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha7 nAChR subtypes to determine their selectivity. All mutants tested were most selective for the alpha9alpha10 nAChR. These findings provide valuable insight into the interaction of Vc1.1 with the alpha9alpha10 nAChR subtype and will help in the further development of analogs of Vc1.1 as analgesic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1973731865,"The serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) plays a pivotal role in diverse cellular functions. Elevated expression of activated Akt has been detected in a wide variety of human cancers; however, the mechanism of Akt protein stability regulation remains unclear. In this study, we showed a strong correlation between the expression levels of an oncogenic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 and levels of Akt phosphorylation at S473 in multiple cancer types (P<0.0001). Akt-pS473 status combined with Pin1 expression levels predicted a poorer prognosis than did either one alone in patients with breast cancer (P=0.0052). We further showed that Pin1 regulated Akt stability and phosphorylation on S473 through the phosphorylated Thr-Pro motifs of Akt. These motifs are conserved evolutionary and are required for the maintenance of Akt stability and its interaction with Pin1. In addition, repressing Pin1 expression through either homologue Pin1 knockout or small interfering RNA-mediated knockingdown compromised its ability to protect Akt from degradation. Our results show how Akt protein stability is regulated by the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 and highlight the importance of this oncogenic network in human disease pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2088904527,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a lethal disease and early death usually occurs as a result of local invasion and regional lymph node metastases. Current treatment regimens are, to a certain degree, inadequate, with a 5-year mortality rate of around 50% and novel therapeutic targets are urgently required. Using expression microarrays, we identified the eps8 gene as being overexpressed in OSCC cell lines relative to normal oral keratinocytes, and confirmed these findings using RT–PCR and western blotting. In human tissues, we found that Eps8 was upregulated in OSCC (32% of primary tumors) compared with normal oral mucosa, and that expression correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis (P=0.032), suggesting a disease-promoting effect. Using OSCC cell lines, we assessed the functional role of Eps8 in tumor cells. Although suppression of Eps8 produced no effect on cell proliferation, both cell spreading and migration were markedly inhibited. The latter cell functions may be modulated through the small GTP-ase, Rac1 and we used pull-down assays to investigate the role of Eps8 in Rac1 signaling. We found that αvβ6- and α5β1-integrin-dependent activation of Rac1 was mediated through Eps8. Knockdown of either Eps8 or Rac1, inhibited integrin-dependent cell migration similarly and transient expression of constitutively active Rac1 restored migration of cells in which Eps8 expression had been suppressed. We also showed that knockdown of Eps8 inhibited tumor cell invasion in an organotypic model of OSCC. These data suggest that Eps8 and Rac1 are part of an integrated signaling pathway modulating integrin-dependent tumour cell motility and identify Eps8 as a possible therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2022810828,"Located at the important tumor suppressor locus, 3p22, PLCD1 encodes an enzyme that mediates regulatory signaling of energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis and intracellular movements. We identified PLCD1 as a downregulated gene in aerodigestive carcinomas through expression profiling and epigenetic characterization. We found that PLCD1 was expressed in all normal adult tissues but low or silenced in 84% (16/19) gastric cancer cell lines, well correlated with its CpG island (CGI) methylation status. Methylation was further detected in 62% (61/98) gastric primary tumors, but none of normal gastric mucosa tissues. PLCD1 methylation was significantly correlated with tumor high stage. Detailed methylation analysis of 37 CpG sites at the PLCD1 CGI by bisulfite genomic sequencing confirmed its methylation. PLCD1 silencing could be reversed by pharmacological demethylation with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, indicating a direct epigenetic silencing. Ectopic expression of PLCD1 in silenced gastric tumor cells dramatically inhibited their clonogenicity and migration, possibly through downregulating MMP7 expression and hampering the reorganization of cytoskeleton through cofilin inactivation by phosphorylation. Thus, epigenetic inactivation of PLCD1 is common and tumor-specific in gastric cancer, and PLCD1 acts as a functional tumor suppressor involved in gastric carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2170711561,"When eukaryotic cells are transcribing at a high rate, it has been noted that genomic stability suffers, and mutational events are elevated. In this work, Nayun Kim and Sue Jinks-Robertson show that in yeast, highly transcribed DNA accumulates sites lacking a purine or pyrimidine base due to the removal of misincorporated uracil. This finding suggests that the fidelity of DNA synthesis can be affected by the level of transcription, and provides indirect evidence for nucleotide pool compartmentalization within the nucleus. High transcription rates in eukaryotic cells are associated with genomic instability, resulting in increased numbers of mutational events. In yeast, highly transcribed DNA is now shown to accumulate apurinic/apyrimidinic sites due to the removal of uracil, suggesting that the fidelity of DNA synthesis can be affected by the level of transcription. Highly activated transcription is associated with eukaryotic genome instability, resulting in increased rates of mitotic recombination and mutagenesis. The association between high transcription and genome stability is probably due to a variety of factors including an enhanced accumulation of DNA damage, transcription-associated supercoiling, collision between replication forks and the transcription machinery, and the persistence of RNA–DNA hybrids1. In the case of transcription-associated mutagenesis, we previously showed that there is a direct proportionality between the level of transcription and the mutation rate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae2, and that the molecular nature of the mutations is affected by highly activated transcription2,3. Here we show that the accumulation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites is greatly enhanced in highly transcribed yeast DNA. We further demonstrate that most apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in highly transcribed DNA are derived from the removal of uracil, the presence of which is linked to direct incorporation of dUTP in place of dTTP. These results show an unexpected relationship between transcription and the fidelity of DNA synthesis, and raise intriguing cell biological issues with regard to nucleotide pool compartmentalization."

In the present study, we found that inactivation of EF-G (Slr1463) by H(2)O(2) was attributable to the oxidation of two specific cysteine residues and formation of a disulfide bond. Substitution of these cysteine residues by serine residues protected EF-G from inactivation by H(2)O(2) and allowed the EF-G to mediate translation in a translation system in vitro that had been prepared from Synechocystis. The disulfide bond in oxidized EF-G was reduced by thioredoxin, and the resultant reduced form of EF-G regained the activity to mediate translation in vitro. Western blotting analysis showed that levels of the oxidized form of EF-G increased under strong light in a mutant that lacked NADPH-thioredoxin reductase, indicating that EF-G is reduced by thioredoxin in vivo. These observations suggest that the translational machinery is regulated by the redox state of EF-G, which is oxidized by reactive oxygen species and reduced by thioredoxin, a transmitter of reducing signals generated by the photosynthetic transport of electrons."
https://openalex.org/W2037961777,"Bladder cancer is one of the most common causes of death in industrialized countries. New tumor markers and therapeutic approaches are still needed to improve the management of bladder cancer patients. Choline kinase-α (ChoKα) is a metabolic enzyme that has a role in cell proliferation and transformation. Inhibitors of ChoKα show antitumoral activity and are expected to be introduced soon in clinical trials. This study aims to assess whether ChoKα plays a role in the aggressiveness of bladder tumors and constitutes a new approach for bladder cancer treatment. We show here that ChoKα is constitutively altered in human bladder tumor cells. Furthermore, in vivo murine models, including an orthotopic model to mimic as much as possible the physiological conditions, revealed that increased levels of ChoKα potentiate both tumor formation (P⩽0.0001) and aggressiveness of the disease on different end points (P=0.011). Accordingly, increased levels of ChoKα significantly reduce survival of mice with bladder cancer (P=0.05). Finally, treatment with a ChoKα-specific inhibitor resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth (P=0.02) and in a relevant increase in survival (P=0.03)."
https://openalex.org/W1985802554,"Measles-associated mortality can be decreased in response to treatment with vitamin A. Our goal was to understand the mechanism by which vitamin A and other retinoids reduce measles virus (MeV) replication in vitro. MeV is known to inhibit type I interferon (IFN) signaling, and retinoids are increasingly implicated in modulating innate immunity. Type I IFN blocking antibodies abrogated the inhibitory effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on MeV replication (EC(50) of ATRA: 3.17 x 10(-8) M). IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are up-regulated by ATRA in MeV-infected U937 cell cultures starting at 12 h and reaching a plateau at 24 h postinfection when compared to either treatment or infection alone. We found that this increased gene expression occurs in uninfected cells by using a transwell system where the uninfected cells were separated from infected cells by a membrane with 0.02-muM pores. Uninfected bystander cells from the ATRA-treated transwells did not support substantial viral replication when subsequently infected with MeV. In the absence of ATRA, the cells from the uninfected chamber did not up-regulate ISG expression and were not protected from subsequent challenge with virus. These results demonstrate that retinoids inhibit MeV replication by up-regulating elements of the innate immune response in uninfected bystander cells, making them refractory to productive infection during subsequent rounds of viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W2018367175,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key organelle regulating intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Oxidants and mitochondria-derived free radicals can target ER-based Ca(2+) regulatory proteins and cause uncontrolled Ca(2+) release that may contribute to protracted ER stress and apoptosis. Several ER stress proteins have been suggested to counteract the deregulation of ER Ca(2+) homeostasis and ER stress. Here we showed that knockdown of Herp, an ubiquitin-like domain containing ER stress protein, renders PC12 and MN9D cells vulnerable to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced cytotoxic cell death by a mechanism involving up-regulation of CHOP expression and ER Ca(2+) depletion. Conversely, Herp overexpression confers protection by blocking 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced CHOP up-regulation, ER Ca(2+) store depletion, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation in a manner dependent on a functional ubiquitin-proteasomal protein degradation pathway. Deletion of the ubiquitin-like domain of Herp or treatment with a proteasomal inhibitor abolished the central function of Herp in ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Thus, elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism(s) whereby Herp counteracts Ca(2+) disturbances will provide insights into the molecular cascade of cell death in dopaminergic neurons and may uncover novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and ameliorate Parkinson disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2067874589,"Proteinase 3 (Pr3), the main target of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, is a neutrophil serine protease that may be constitutively expressed at the surface of quiescent circulating neutrophils. This raises the question of the simultaneous presence in the circulation of constitutive membrane-bound Pr3 (mPr3) and its plasma inhibitor α1-protease inhibitor (α1-Pi). We have looked at the fate of constitutive mPr3 at the surface of circulating blood neutrophils and of induced mPr3 on triggered neutrophils. We found significant Pr3 activity at the surface of activated neutrophils but not at the surface of quiescent neutrophils whatever the constitutive expression. This suggests that constitutive mPr3 is enzymatically inactive or its active site is not accessible to the substrate. Supporting this conclusion, we have not been able to demonstrate any interaction between constitutive mPr3 and α1-Pi, whereas induced mPr3 is cleared from the cell surface when activated cells are incubated with this inhibitor. But, unlike membrane-bound elastase that is also cleared from the surface of activated cells, mPr3 remained bound to the membrane when inhibited by elafin or by a low molecular weight chloromethyl ketone inhibitor, which shows that it binds more tightly to the neutrophil membrane. mPr3 may thus be present at the surface of circulating neutrophils in an environment replete with α1-Pi. The permanent presence of inactive Pr3 at the surface of quiescent neutrophils may explain why Pr3 is a major target of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, whose binding activates neutrophils and triggers inflammation, as in Wegener granulomatosis.

Pathol. 1990; 137: 1113-1120PubMed Google Scholar) and has been more recently located within secretory vesicles (3Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pr3, like its homologues neutrophil elastase (HNE) and cathepsin G (CG), participates in the intracellular degradation of phagocytized pathogens at inflammatory sites in combination with microbicidal peptides and the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase system (4Pham C.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). All three NSPs are also released from activated neutrophils and help destroy extracellular matrix components and regulate innate immunity, inflammation, and infection (5Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 171: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although NSPs are structurally and functionally related and are synthesized similarly (6Korkmaz B. Moreau T. Gauthier F. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), Pr3 differs from the other two by its bimodal, genetically determined, expression on the cell surface of quiescent neutrophils (7Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Lopez S. Witko-Sarsat V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Schreiber A. Busjahn A. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, each individual has two subsets of neutrophils, mPr3high and mPr3low, whereas HNE and CG are not present in significant amount at the surface of resting neutrophils. Pr3 also differs from the other two NSPs by its storage within secretory vesicles that readily fuse with the plasma membrane (3Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But it is not clear that this explains why Pr3 is constitutively expressed at the surface of a subpopulation of quiescent neutrophils. Supporting this hypothesis, it has been recently demonstrated that CD177 (also called NB1), which is also stored in secretory vesicles and has a bimodal membrane expression, is present on the plasma membrane of the same subset of neutrophils as Pr3 (9Bauer S.

The presence of Pr3 on the surface of quiescent neutrophils would favor neutrophil activation by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) during Wegener granulomatosis (WG) (11van Rossum A.P.

This explains why this protease, unlike HNE and CG, is a risk factor for this autoimmune disease characterized by necrotizing inflammation particularly of the respiratory tract, kidneys, and by small vessel vasculitis (12Schreiber A. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 2172-2183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Binding of anti-Pr3 antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-α-primed neutrophils is impaired by α1-Pi (13Rooney C.P. Taggart C. Coakley R. McElvaney N.G. O'Neill S.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which suggests that mPr3 activity and the protease-antiprotease balance are involved in neutrophil activation during WG. Measuring the Pr3 activity on the cell surface of quiescent and activated neutrophils requires specific substrates of Pr3 that were not available until recently (14Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Hazouard E.

Because of the storage of Pr3 in both secretory vesicles and primary granules and the presence of constitutive Pr3 at the surface of resting neutrophils, we have determined whether both constitutive and induced Pr3 are enzymatically active when bound to the cell surface, and how they are regulated by protease inhibitors. Pr3 activity is controlled by a variety of natural inhibitors, the most important of which are α1-Pi, elafin/trappin-2, and monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor. But none is specific for this protease, so it cannot be specifically targeted in vivo or ex vivo. We have previously shown that mHNE is rapidly cleared from the surface of activated neutrophils by α1-Pi and by EPI-hNE4, a low molecular weight recombinant inhibitor, with which it forms soluble, inactive complexes (16Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Attucci S. Gauthier A. Korkmaz B. Delépine P. Martino M.F. Saudubray F. Diot P. Gauthier F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how mPr3 can be targeted by autoantibodies in the presence of α1-Pi, which efficiently inhibits its soluble form, although more slowly than it does HNE (18Korkmaz B. Poutrain P. Hazouard E. de Monte M. Attucci S. Gauthier F.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We answered this question by investigating the enzymatic properties of mPr3 and its sensitivity to inhibitors. The behavior of mPr3 clearly differs from that of mHNE, which explains why it may be a preferential target for autoantibodies and so contributes to the pathogenicity of Wegener disease. Human proteinase 3 (EC 3.4.21.76), human neutrophil elastase (EC 3.4.21.37), and human α1-Pi were obtained from Athens Research & Technology (Athens, GA). The calcium ionophore A23187, elafin, and EGTA were from Sigma. The specific elastase inhibitor EPI-hNE4 was a kind gift from F. Saudubray (Debiopharm, Lausanne, Switzerland). N,N-Dimethylformamide was from Merck. MeO-Suc-AAPA-CMK was from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). PolymorphprepTM and LymphoprepTM were purchased from AbCys (Paris, France). Mouse IgG1 and goat F(ab′)2 fragment anti-mouse IgG (Fcγ)-FITC were from Beckman Coulter (Roissy, France). Anti-Pr3 mAbs (clone MCPR3-2) were purchased from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). Human neutrophils were purified from 16-ml samples of peripheral blood collected from healthy volunteers into EDTA-containing tubes essentially as reported previously (19Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Juliano M.A. Kalupov T. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The neutrophil pellet recovered after lysing the erythrocytes was washed twice in PBS containing 4 mm EGTA. Cell viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion. Neutrophils were activated by suspending ∼3 × 106 cells/ml in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and incubating them with A23187 (1 μm final) for 15 min at 37 °C (19Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Juliano M.A. Kalupov T. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The resting and activated neutrophils were suspended in PBS/EGTA. We used activation with the calcium ionophore A23187 to optimize mPr3 exposure at the cell surface (20Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Owen C.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and to avoid production of neutrophil extracellular traps, as occurs when interleukin-8 or phorbol esters are used, because they may interfere with flow cytometry analyses and enzyme assays (21Brinkmann V. Reichard U. Goosmann C. Fauler B. Uhlemann Y. Weiss D.S. Weinrauch Y. Zychlinsky A. Science. 2004; 303: 1532-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (6357) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed on a Beckman Coulter XL flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser, and analyses were performed essentially as described in Ref. 19Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Juliano M.A. Kalupov T. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar. To analyze specifically interaction of inhibitors with mPr3, mHNE was cleared from the cell surface by preincubating cells (2 × 105 to 5 × 105 quiescent or activated neutrophils) with a molar excess of EPI-hNE4 (5 × 10−8 to 5 × 10−7m) (17Attucci S. Gauthier A. Korkmaz B. Delépine P. Martino M.F. Saudubray F. Diot P. Gauthier F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Any mPr3 antigen at the neutrophil surface was then detected prior to and after α1-Pi or elafin (5 × 10−7 to 10−6m final) or CMK treatment (10 mm final), incubating the cells with monoclonal anti-Pr3 antibodies (clone MCPR3-2, Euromedex) diluted 1:50 for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments from goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:50) for 30 min at 4 °C. Mouse IgG1 isotype controls (diluted 1:50) were performed under the same experimental conditions. Data were recorded for at least 10,000 events and analyzed with the Expo32 software (Beckman Coulter, France). The activities of free and membrane-bound proteases were measured in PBS/EGTA. Free Pr3 and HNE were titrated with α1-Pi, the titer of which had been determined using bovine trypsin titrated with p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (22Serveau C. Moreau T. Zhou G.X. ElMoujahed A. Chao J. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). mPr3 and mHNE activities were quantified by comparing the rates of hydrolysis of their specific FRET substrates (Abz)-VADnorVADRQ-(EDDnp) and (Abz)-APEEIMRRQ-(EDDnp) (15Korkmaz B.

Attucci S. Moreau T. Godat E. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with that of titrated commercial proteases under the same experimental conditions. The concentration of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates was determined by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm, using ϵ365 nm = 17,300 m−1 cm−1 for EDDnp. Unactivated and activated (2 × 105 to 5 × 105 cells) neutrophils, or purified proteases used as controls, were incubated with 15 μm specific substrate in polypropylene microplate wells selected for their low binding properties (Hard-Shell Thin-Wall Microplates; MJ Research) at room temperature in activity buffer (10 mm PBS, 4 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). The fluorescence was recorded at λex = 320 nm and λem = 420 nm using a microplate fluorescence reader (Spectra Max Gemini; Molecular Devices) under continuous stirring. Once the enzyme reaction was complete, the reaction medium was incubated with 4 volumes of absolute ethanol for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the hydrolysis products was recovered, air-dried under vacuum, and dissolved in 200 μl of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Hydrolysis fragments were purified by rp-HPLC on a C18 column (2.1 × 30 mm or 2 × 33 mm, Uptisphere), using a P200 pump coupled to a Spectrasystem UV3000 detector (Thermo Separation Products), at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, with a linear (0–60%, v/v) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min. Eluted peaks were monitored at three wavelengths (220, 320, and 360 nm) simultaneously, which allowed the direct identification of EDDnp-containing peptides prior to sequencing. Cleavage sites were identified by N-terminal sequencing in an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer attached to a model 140C micro-gradient system and a 610A data analysis system with the chemicals and program recommended by the manufacturer. The release of mPr3 and mHNE into PBS was checked by incubating cells (3 × 106 cells/ml) in buffer for up to 1 h and measuring the peptidase activities in supernatants cleared of cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. Cell pellets were suspended in the same buffer, and membrane-bound activity was measured using the same procedure. The procedure was repeated using the same buffer supplemented with 1.5 m NaCl. Neutrophils were kept for 1 h at room temperature or 24 h at 37 °C under gentle stirring, collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min, and suspended in PBS containing 1.5 m NaCl (final concentration). The Pr3 and HNE activities in the supernatants of cells were measured and compared with the activities on unfractionated treated cells. Inhibition of mPr3 by α1-Pi or elafin was analyzed under pseudo-first order conditions using a 1000-fold molar excess of inhibitor. Activated neutrophils (2 × 105 to 5 × 105 cells) corresponding to 5 × 10−10m to 10−9m active purified Pr3 were preincubated with EPI-hNE4 (10−8m to 5 × 10−7m) for 5 min at room temperature. The Pr3 substrate (15 μm) and α1-Pi or elafin (5 × 10−7m to 10−6m) were added at the same time to the reaction medium, and fluorescence was recorded continuously every 24 s for up to 4000 s. A control was made to check that mHNE remained fully inhibited by EPI-hNE4. The inhibition of mPr3 by α1-Pi or elafin was also checked under the same experimental conditions by preincubating the EPI-hNE4-treated cells with α1-Pi or elafin for 4000 s before adding the Pr3 substrate. mPr3 was also inhibited by incubating the cells with 10−4m MeO-Suc-AAPA-CMK for 2 h. Controls using free Pr3 were performed under the same experimental conditions. We first determined the Pr3 on the surfaces of resting and activated neutrophils from healthy donors by flow cytometry with anti-Pr3 antibodies. The resting neutrophils had a genetically determined distribution of the protease that resulted in a bimodal mPr3 expression (Fig. 1). The mPr3 activity remains low, generally below the detection limit (10−10m) whatever the percentage of mPr3high quiescent cells, despite the high cell concentration (300,000 cells/150 μl). Any proteolytic activity detected was because of the partial activation of quiescent neutrophils that occurs during cell purification. This was confirmed by the parallel recording of a basal neutrophil elastase activity that should not be present at the surface of quiescent neutrophils (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that constitutive mPr3 is inactive. All the purified neutrophils had more Pr3 at their surface after they had been activated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (Fig. 1) or after incubation for 2 h in PBS at room temperature (data not shown). The Pr3 activity in the cell suspensions was increased by a factor of 5–20 (Fig. 1). We quantified the mPr3 concentration in the cell suspension by comparing the rate of hydrolysis of Abz-VADnorVADRQ-EDDnp by activated cell suspensions (300,000 cells/150 μl) with that of free, titrated Pr3. For this purpose, we assumed that mPr3 and soluble Pr3 hydrolyze their synthetic low molecular weight substrate similarly. The apparent concentration of mPr3 varied from <0.1 to 4 nm, and this concentration was independent of the percentage of mPr3high resting cells before activation (Fig. 1). We ensured that no other neutrophil protease had cleaved the Pr3 substrate by checking that there was a single cleavage site at the expected norV-A bond of the FRET substrate. This was done by fractionation of the supernatant by rp-HPLC and N-terminal sequencing of the EDDnp-containing fragment (Fig. 2). We next measured the Pr3 activity in the supernatant after centrifuging the cell suspension at 500 × g for 5 min to ensure that the enzyme activity was mainly because of membrane-bound Pr3. About 25% of total activity was recovered in this supernatant (Fig. 3), and this percentage remained unchanged throughout a 2-h incubation before centrifugation. We checked by flow cytometry that the substrate did not release mPr3 from the membrane (data not shown). We also found that mPr3 was not released from the surface of activated cells placed in buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl, whereas almost all the mHNE was released (Fig. 3). Thus, mPr3 binds differently and more tightly to the cell surface than does mHNE. This raises the question of the inhibition of mPr3 at the cell surface. We investigated the interaction between constitutive and induced mPr3 with natural inhibitors, like α1-Pi and elafin, and synthetic inhibitors to better understand the function of these two mPr3 populations.FIGURE 3Pr3 activity at the surface and in the supernatant of activated neutrophils. About 25% of the total Pr3 activity is released spontaneously when cells are suspended in PBS for at least 120 min, and no further release occurs following incubation with 1.5 m NaCl, whereas almost all the membrane-bound HNE is released into the supernatant after incubation with NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first checked whether active Pr3 at the membrane surface of activated neutrophils was inhibited by α1-Pi, its main natural inhibitor. Because α1-Pi is not specific for Pr3 and preferentially inhibits HNE (18Korkmaz B. Poutrain P. Hazouard E. de Monte M. Attucci S. Gauthier F.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we cleared mHNE from the cell surface using a molar excess of the low molecular weight HNE-specific inhibitor EPI-hNE4 (17Attucci S. Gauthier A. Korkmaz B. Delépine P. Martino M.F. Saudubray F. Diot P. Gauthier F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We ensured by kinetic analysis that no HNE activity remained in the reaction mixture, using an HNE-specific substrate, and that the Pr3 activity remained unchanged after EPI-hNE4 treatment (data not shown). We then added a large molar excess of α1-Pi (0.5–1 μm final concentration, close to its pathophysiological plasma concentration) to a suspension of triggered neutrophils (200–500 × 103 cells) whose mPr3 activity was 0.2 and 1 nm. We used soluble Pr3 as a control and adjusted it to obtain the same rate of hydrolysis. The rates of inhibition of soluble and mPr3 were then recorded under pseudo-first order conditions (I ≫ E) in the cell suspension and in the control. mPr3 was inhibited almost as rapidly as the soluble Pr3, but inhibition was not complete after 1 h of continuous recording (Fig. 4A). Because Pr3 is inhibited by α1-Pi more slowly than HNE, this was probably due to competition between the inhibitor and substrate for binding to newly exposed Pr3 molecules at the membrane surface of activated, unfixed cells. We confirmed this by incubating cells with the inhibitor for 1 h before adding the substrate. No activity was recorded under these conditions. The same result was obtained using a large molar excess of elafin (Fig. 4B) that fully inhibited mPr3 only when it was preincubated with the cell suspension, but not during an assay in the presence of the substrate. A molar excess of the low molecular weight chloromethyl ketone irreversible inhibitor MeO-Suc-AAPA-CMK also inhibited about 90% mPr3 activity after 2 h (Fig. 4C, inset). The next question was whether the newly formed mPr3-inhibitor complexes remain at the membrane surface. We studied the fate of mPr3-α1-Pi complexes by flow cytometry. Activated cells were first treated with EPI-hNE4 as before to remove mHNE, and the inactivity of HNE and activity of Pr3 were checked. A molar excess of α1-Pi was added to activated cells, which were then incubated with the MCPR3-2 anti-Pr3 mAb. This mAb was used because Western blotting showed that it still recognized Pr3 after binding to α1-Pi, despite the drastic structural rearrangements that occur during the formation of the complex between serpins and their target proteases. The fluorescent peak was not displaced by excess α1-Pi using mPr3high quiescent cells bearing constitutive mPr3 on their surface (Fig. 4D). This confirmed that constitutive mPr3 does not form an irreversible complex with the inhibitor. But whether this is because of an enzymatically inactive protease, or to impaired access to the active site as a result of a different exposure of constitutive mPr3, remains to be determined. The fluorescent peak was displaced when activated cells were incubated with α1-Pi, which strongly suggests that induced Pr3 is removed from the membrane when the complex is formed (Fig. 4E). But the fluorescent peak was not displaced when Pr3high quiescent cells and triggered cells were incubated with elafin (Fig. 4, F and G) or with the low molecular weight chloromethyl ketone inhibitor MeO-Suc-AAPA-CMK that also inhibits Pr3 at the surface of activated cells (Fig. 4C). We conclude that complexes formed between induced mPr3 and low molecular weight inhibitors remain at the cell surface. This differs from mHNE, which is cleared from the surface of triggered neutrophils by incubation with a low molecular weight recombinant inhibitor (17Attucci S. Gauthier A. Korkmaz B. Delépine P. Martino M.F. Saudubray F. Diot P. Gauthier F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pr3 is exposed at the surface of quiescent circulating neutrophils in a genetically determined fashion, unlike HNE or CG (7Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Lopez S. Witko-Sarsat V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have previously developed Pr3 FRET substrates that can measure subnanomolar Pr3 concentrations (15Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Moreau T. Godat E. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), one of them was used here to measure the Pr3 activity at the surface of quiescent and triggered neutrophils. When used at a concentration of 300,000 cells/150 μl, only activated neutrophils showed any significant activity against the Pr3-specific FRET substrate Abz-VADnorVADRQ-EDDnp. Some samples of quiescent cells retained detectable activity at their surface, but this was because of the propensity of neutrophils to become activated, especially during the erythrocyte removing step of their purification (24Fuchs T.A. Abed U. Goosmann C. Hurwitz R. Schulze I. Wahn V. Weinrauch Y. Brinkmann V. Zychlinsky A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar), and to the great sensitivity of the Pr3 FRET substrate (19Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Juliano M.A. Kalupov T. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). But this activity was independent of the mPr3 status of the cell population because some mPr3high cell suspensions had no detectable mPr3 activity. We conclude that constitutive mPr3 is inactive. This is why Pr3 may be present at the surface of circulating quiescent neutrophils without interacting with α1-Pi, despite its huge plasma concentration. Assuming that membrane binding at the surface of triggered cells does not alter mPr3 kinetic properties, induced mPr3 would be about 10 times less concentrated than mHNE based on the rate of hydrolysis of its specific FRET substrate. But there is no specific pseudo irreversible Pr3 inhibitor presently available that would allow us to titrate mPr3 and to answer this question unambiguously, as we did for mHNE (16Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus the enzymatic properties of mPr3 might be altered because of the way it is bound to the cell membrane. There is considerable evidence that mPr3 and mHNE bind differently to the membrane. For example, high salt concentrations led to the rapid release of mHNE from triggered neutrophil membranes but not to the release of mPr3. There is also a large cluster of positive charges at the HNE surface that is interrupted in Pr3, making it more electronegative than HNE (15Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). But mPr3 binding to neutrophil membranes is not only charge-dependent (25Owen C.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1246-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), because anchoring to the hydrophobic membrane leaflet (26Goldmann W.H. Niles J.L. Arnaout M.A. Eur. J.

Cell Res. 2005; 308: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Fridlich R. David A. Aviram I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have been reported. Furthermore, mPr3 colocalizes with the adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18 (β2 integrin) (31David A. Kacher Y. Specks U. Aviram I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein CD177 (NB1 antigen), which is bimodally expressed and is present on the same subset of neutrophils as Pr3 (9Bauer S. Abdgawad M. Gunnarsson L. Segelmark M. Tapper H. Hellmark T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 81: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), has also been shown to mediate the exposure of mPr3 at the cell surface (32von Vietinghoff S. Tunnemann G. Eulenberg C. Wellner M. Cristina Cardoso M. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Blood. 2007; 109: 4487-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This binding probably occurs via the single hydrophobic cluster on the surface of Pr3 but not on NE or CG (33Korkmaz B. Kuhl A. Bayat B. Santoso S. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35976-35982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that the NB1 antigen is stored in secretory vesicles and secondary granules, but not in primary granules (9Bauer S. Abdgawad M. Gunnarsson L. Segelmark M. Tapper H. Hellmark T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 81: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), supports the idea that constitutive mPr3 originates from secretory granules, whereas induced Pr3, which is coexpressed with HNE and CG, is mainly stored in primary granules. This different storage within the cell could well result in different binding modes and/or changes in the protease structure at the cell surface that alter its enzymatic properties, but this needs further investigation. It is clear that the NB1 antigen is not the only binding site for mPr3 (34Hu N. Westra J. Kallenberg C.G. Autoimmun. Rev. 2009; 8: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). von Vietinghoff et al. (10von Vietinghoff S. Eulenberg C. Wellner M. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2008; 152: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found that there is an NB1-independent presentation early during differentiation in addition to membrane Pr3 presentation via the NB1 receptor. A proform that escapes granular targeting has been demonstrated during synthesis (35Sköld S. Rosberg B. Gullberg U. Olofsson T. Blood. 1999; 93: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive Pr3 could be an enzymatically inactive proform that still contains an N-terminal propeptide and is secreted during neutrophil maturation. Constitutive Pr3 could also be a proteolytically degraded and inactivated protease that still binds mAbs and ANCAs. We confirmed that constitutive and induced mPr3 have different enzymatic properties by studying their interactions with α1-Pi. The simultaneous presence of active mPr3 and its inhibitors in the same physiological compartment has been explained by the resistance of mPr3 to naturally occurring inhibitors (20Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Owen C.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). But those experiments were done using fixed cells incubated with purified Pr3. Our present study shows that induced mPr3 is inhibited by α1-Pi and by low molecular weight inhibitors. Nevertheless, α1-Pi inhibits HNE faster than Pr3 (6Korkmaz B. Moreau T. Gauthier F. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which means that transient extracellular Pr3 activity may remain when competition occurs between natural substrates and its main physiological inhibitor. Flow cytometry studies showed that mPr3 is cleared from the surface of triggered neutrophils by α1-PI, as is membrane-bound elastase (16Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). But mPr3 is not released from the cell surface by a canonical inhibitor like elafin or a low molecular weight chloromethyl ketone inhibitor, although these inhibitors fully inhibited its enzymatic activity. This again indicates that the active protease is more tightly bound to the neutrophil membrane than is mHNE, which is released from cell surfaces by its low molecular weight inhibitor EPI-hNE4 (17Attucci S. Gauthier A. Korkmaz B. Delépine P. Martino M.F. Saudubray F. Diot P. Gauthier F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our flow cytometry studies also show that α1-Pi does not release constitutive mPr3 from quiescent neutrophils isolated from individuals having a significant population of mPr3high cells. This confirms that constitutive mPr3 is enzymatically inactive. Constitutive mPr3 is reported to be a putative pathogenic factor in ANCA-associated vasculitis and chronic inflammatory diseases (36Witko-Sarsat V. Lesavre P. Lopez S. Bessou G. Hieblot C. Prum B. Noël L.H. Guillevin L. Ravaud P. Sermet-Gaudelus I. Timsit J. Grünfeld J.P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1224-1233PubMed Google Scholar, 37van Rossum A.P. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2003; 21: S64-68PubMed Google Scholar), although this is still a matter of debate (38von Vietinghoff S. Schreiber A. Otto B. Choi M. Göbel U. Kettritz R. Clin. Nephrol. 2005; 64: 453-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But the binding of Pr3-ANCAs to cell surface Pr3, which results in neutrophil activation, remains the most attractive explanation for the contribution of these antibodies to the pathogenesis of Wegener granulomas (39Van Rossum A.P. van der Geld Y.M. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 537-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For mPr3 to interact with ANCAs, it should be present at the cell surface in an environment replete with α1-Pi that can bind to its active site and remove it from the cell surface. But we show here that constitutive mPr3 does not interact with α1-Pi, so it can remain at the surface of quiescent circulating neutrophils even in the presence of huge amounts of inhibitor. Constitutive mPr3 could still interact with circulating ANCAs under these conditions, which explains why mPr3high patients are more susceptible to a relapse during WG than are patients with low concentrations of constitutive mPr3 (11van Rossum A.P. Rarok A.A. Huitema M.G. Fassina G. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A previous study reports that ANCAs do not bind to circulating neutrophils in WG patients (40Abdel-Salam B. Iking-Konert C. Schneider M. Andrassy K. Hänsch G.M. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but this lack of binding could be due to the ANCA-induced activation of neutrophils and their subsequent adhesion to endothelium (38von Vietinghoff S. Schreiber A. Otto B. Choi M. Göbel U. Kettritz R. Clin. Nephrol. 2005; 64: 453-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α-primed neutrophils incubated with excess α1-Pi are significantly less sensitive to activation by an anti-Pr3 mAb, suggesting that the inhibitor impairs mAb binding (13Rooney C.P. Taggart C. Coakley R. McElvaney N.G. O'Neill S.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because induced mPr3 is present at the surface of primed neutrophils in addition to constitutive mPr3, this could be explained by the removal of induced mPr3 from the cell surface by α1-Pi, as was shown using cells that stably expressed the NB1 receptor (33Korkmaz B. Kuhl A. Bayat B. Santoso S. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35976-35982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This also agrees with the recent observation that Pr3 is no longer present on neutrophil membranes when tumor necrosis factor-α activation is suppressed by α1-Pi (41Matsumoto T. Kaneko T. Seto M. Wada H. Kobayashi T. Nakatani K. Tonomura H. Tono Y. Ohyabu M. Nobori T. Shiku H. Sudo A. Uchida A. Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Clin. Appl. Thromb. Hemost. 2008; 14: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other results show that Pr3-ANCAs interfere with the enzymatic activity of Pr3, but they were obtained using soluble Pr3 rather than membrane-bound Pr3 (42van der Geld Y.M. Tool A.T. Videler J. de Haas M. Tervaert J.W. Stegeman C.A. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. Roos D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no formal proof that the enzymatic activity of mPr3 modulates activation of neutrophils by anti-Pr3. α1-Pi preferentially inhibits HNE, so that mPr3 is not its main target (18Korkmaz B. Poutrain P. Hazouard E. de Monte M. Attucci S. Gauthier F.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hence, designing a serpin-like inhibitor that specifically removes induced mPr3 would help clarify the roles of constitutive and induced mPr3 in the pathogenicity of vasculitides, and serve as a putative therapeutic agent for controlling the neutrophil-induced inflammation that occurs in WG and related diseases.

All three transport proteins, NHE3, DRA, and CFTR, have PDZ interaction motifs that facilitate binding to several members of the NHERF class of PDZ adapter proteins (8.Lamprecht G. Seidler U. Am. J.

Electroneutral NaCl absorption is regulated largely in parallel but reciprocally with electrogenic chloride secretion (10.Field M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In different systems NHE3 is acutely regulated by cAMP, cGMP, intracellular calcium, lysophosphatidic acid, and epidermal growth factor (11.Donowitz M. Li X. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 825-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as well as by tumor necrosis factor-α (12.Clayburgh D.R. Musch M.W. Leitges M. Fu Y.X. Turner J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2682-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Notably, some of these regulatory processes are mediated through the interaction of NHE3 with several members of the NHERF class of PDZ adapter proteins (8.Lamprecht G. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G766-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11.Donowitz M. Li X. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 825-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the acute regulation of DRA. In the context of chloride and bicarbonate secretion, DRA is activated by cAMP, if it is expressed in a complex with CFTR and PDZ adapter proteins (PDZK1, also known as CAP70, and/or NHERF) (6.Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 7.Ko S.B. Zeng W.

Shmukler B.E. Schweinfest C.W. Blanco P. Freedman S.D. Stewart A.K. Alper S.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is expected that DRA is inhibited in vivo in parallel with NHE3 during NaCl absorption, and in Caco-2/BBE cells transfected with NHE3 and DRA, this coupled inhibition has recently been shown (14.Musch M.W. Arvans D.L. Wu G.D. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 296: G202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes DRA is refractory to regulation by the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium (10 μm), the PP2A inhibitor calyculin A (100 nm), or actin-modifying agents (13.Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Shmukler B.E. Schweinfest C.W. Blanco P. Freedman S.D. Stewart A.K. Alper S.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Other data suggest that direct phosphorylation may regulate DRA, as mutation of tyrosine 756 (Y756F) increases DRA activity, although no signaling pathway has been suggested (13.Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Shmukler B.E. Schweinfest C.W. Blanco P. Freedman S.D. Stewart A.K. Alper S.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus the regulation of DRA remains poorly understood. Moreover, no data address whether DRA regulation can occur independently or is always dependent on regulation of partner transporters, i.e. CFTR or NHE3, to which it is functionally and structurally coupled. Here we show that DRA activity is inhibited by elevations of Ca2+i, that this regulation is independent of CFTR and NHE3, and that regulation requires interactions between DRA and the PDZ adapter protein PDZK1. Trypsin, doxycycline, hygromycin, G418, and Zeocin were from Invitrogen. 4Br-A23187 and PMA were from Biomol. Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and NeutrAvidin were from Pierce. Alexa594-conjugated phalloidin, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester, and FURA-2-AM were from Molecular Probes. Nigericin and all other chemicals were from Sigma. In our previous study we have used a mixed population of HEK cells stably transfected with EGFP-tagged wild type DRA (15.Lamprecht G. Baisch S. Schoenleber E. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A full-length EGFP-tagged DRA construct lacking the PDZ interaction domain (i.e. lacking the C-terminal four amino acids ETKF) was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). HEK cells were transfected with pEGFP/DRA (wild type) and pEGFP/DRA-ETKFminus, as described previously (15.Lamprecht G. Baisch S. Schoenleber E. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and clonal cell lines were established by serial dilution. Two randomly chosen clones with comparable Cl/HCO3 exchange activity were used for further studies. EGFP-DRA and EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus fusion constructs were subcloned into pTRE2[hygro]. Caco-2/BBE cells stably transfected with the Tet-Off system (16.Shen L. Black E.D. Witkowski E.D. Lencer W.I. Guerriero V. Schneeberger E.E. Turner J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were transfected in suspension while passaging the cells and grown for 24 h in the absence of antibiotics. Cells were then passaged again and diluted onto 100-mm dishes. The parental cell line is already G418- and Zeocin-resistant, and transfected cells were thus selected using 250 μg/ml G418, 50 μl/ml Zeocin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. Clones appeared after 14–21 days, and those that showed green fluorescence were recovered using cloning rings (Sigma). Two randomly chosen clones with comparable Cl/HCO3 exchange activity were used for further studies. Cells were used between passages 5 and 12 after transfection. They were grown and split in the presence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline, and only cells used for functional studies were kept in the absence of doxycycline immediately after passaging the cells. PDZK1 was cloned by RT-PCR from a human ileal biopsy (sense primer, CTC TTG GAT CCC CAG AAA TGA CCT CCA CC, and antisense primer, AAG CTT TTA CTT GTT TTC ATC ACA TCT CTG). The sequence was verified in pCR-II-blunt, and the insert was subcloned into pEGFP resulting in pEGFP/PDZK1. HEK/EGFP-DRA cells were transfected with EGFP-PDZK1 as described previously (15.Lamprecht G. Baisch S. Schoenleber E. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and clonal cell lines were established by serial dilution. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, and washed again in PBS. They were then permeabilized for 5 min using 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed, and blocked for 20 min using 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The actin cytoskeleton was stained using Alexa594/phalloidin (1:200 in PBS). The samples were washed again three times in PBS and mounted using SlowFade (Molecular Probes). The slides were visualized using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss). DRA activity was assessed as changes in the intracellular pH (pHi) after removing chloride from the extracellular buffer. In transfected HEK cells, pHi was measured exactly as described previously (15.Lamprecht G. Baisch S. Schoenleber E. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In transfected Caco-2/BBE cells, pHi was measured as described previously (15.Lamprecht G. Baisch S. Schoenleber E. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Because of the slow calibration of confluent Caco-2/BBE cells, a one-point calibration at pH 7.0 was performed in some experiments as described by Boyarsky et al. (17.Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after validating this approach using the conventional calibration at pH 7.0, 7.5, and 7.8. The base-line pHi of the transfected Caco-2/BBE cells varied from day to day. To analyze experiments from several days, data for these cells are expressed as ΔpHi compared with base line. The pHi traces from the transfected HEK cells were analyzed as described previously (18.Lamprecht G. Schaefer J. Dietz K. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This nonlinear curve-fitting algorithm allows the estimation of the initial slope after the change of the buffer solutions as well as the estimation of the maximal pHi change from base line after removal of extracellular chloride. For the transfected Caco-2/BBE cells, ΔpHi values were used in this algorithm instead of absolute pHi values. For calcium measurements, cells were loaded with 1 μm FURA-2-AM for 60 min. The sample was excited alternating at 340 and 380 nm (slit width 2.5 nm), and emission was collected at 510 nm (slit width 2.5–3.5 nm). Data were recorded every 2.9 s. Intracellular calcium concentration was expressed as the F380/F340 ratio. RNA was prepared using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer from 10-day confluent Caco-2/BBE cells, in which expression of EGFP-DRA or EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus was either repressed by the presence of doxycycline or induced by its absence. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out with 50 ng of cDNA template in an ABI Prism 7000 system using the SYBR green method. DRA (endogenous DRA and induced EGFP-DRA), EGFP (induced EGFP-DRA), PAT1, CFTR, NHE3, PDZK1, and E3KARP as well as histone 3.3A were amplified using the following primers that were optimized for amplification efficiency: histone 3.3A, TTCCAGAGCGCAGCTATCG (300 nm) and TCTTCAAAAAGGCCAACCAGAT (300 nm); DRA, GTGTCCTTTCTTGATGTTTCTTCAGT (200 nm) and CGGTTAAGCTTCTCAATGAAGTCA (200 nm); EGFP, CAAGCAGAAGAACGGCATCAC (300 nm) and GGACTGGGTGCTCAGGTAGGC (300 nm); PAT1, GGGTGCCCTCTCCTTTGTG (300 nm) and CCAGATGGGTCCACACTGAAG (300 nm); CFTR, GGAAAAGGCCAGCGTTGTC (250 nm) and CCAGGCGCTGTCTGTATCCT (250 nm); NHE3, CTGTCCCTCTACGGCGTCTT (100 nm) and GCTGCCAAACAGGAGGAAGTC (300 nm), PDZK1, TGGAGGTGTGCAAACTTGGA (200 nm) and ACACCCCCTTTTTACCTTGGA (200 nm); and E3KARP, GTCACCCGTCACCAATGGA (300 nm) and CAGTGTCCTTGTCGGAACCA (200 nm). The data were analyzed by the ΔΔCt method (ΔΔCt = (Ctsample − Ctreference)doxycycline − (Ctsample − Ctreference)no−doxycycline). Cell surface expression was assayed by biotinylation similar to that described in Ref. 19.Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ryu S.H. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23714-23724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar. 10-Day confluent Caco-2/BBE cells expressing EGFP-DRA were washed three times with PBS (plus calcium and magnesium). The cells were then incubated twice for 30 min with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS (plus calcium and magnesium). After removal of the buffer, unbound biotin was quenched with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS (plus calcium and magnesium) plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min. The cells were then scraped and lysed in 1 ml of 60 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm NaEDTA, 3 mm NaEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 125 μl/ml complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by passing them 15 times through a 22-gauge needle. The lysates were cleared by spinning for 10 min at 10,000 × g and were then incubated with 100 μl of NeutrAvidin-agarose beads overnight. Beads were separated by centrifugation for 1 min at 2500 × g, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min. 30 μl of the lysate and 60 μl of the eluate from the beads were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll), and probed with monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody (1:500; Clontech) and anti-mouse (1:5000) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) using standard conditions. Bands were quantified using ImageMaster 1D, version 3.0 software (Amersham Biosciences), with manual background subtraction. Relative changes of DRA surface expression were analyzed by normalization of the band intensity of biotinylated EGFP-DRA to the band intensity of total EGFP-DRA in the lysate. NHERF and E3KARP were detected using antibodies described previously (20.Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21.Liedtke C.M. Yun C.H. Kyle N. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22925-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:3000 each. PDZK1 and IKEPP were detected using commercially available antibodies (catalogue numbers PA3-16818 and PA3-16819ABR, Golden, CO) at a dilution of 1:1000 each. Anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used 1:5000. All statistical calculations were done using Jump 5.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data are presented as means ± S.D. analysis of variance and t tests were applied when appropriate. Calcium-dependent short term regulation of NHE3 has been studied in transfected PS120 cells (19.Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ryu S.H. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23714-23724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22.Lee-Kwon W. Kim J.H. Choi J.W. Kawano K. Cha B. Dartt D.A. Zoukhri D. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus we followed this approach and used our previously established HEK cells stably expressing EGFP-DRA (15.Lamprecht G. Baisch S. Schoenleber E. Gregor M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In these cells Cl/HCO3 exchange is about eight times higher than in nontransfected cells. DRA activity was measured as intracellular alkalinization upon removal of chloride and intracellular re-acidification upon re-addition of chloride. Intracellular calcium was increased by 10 μm 4Br-A23187, which was applied 100 s before measuring DRA activity. Fig. 1A shows that 4Br-A23187 inhibited DRA activity both by a reduced pHi change after removal of chloride (ΔpHi, 0.58 ± 0.09 versus 0.36 ± 0.09, −39%, p < 0.05) as well as by a reduced initial slope (0.73 ± 0.22 pH/min versus 0.40 ± 0.17, −45%, p < 0.05). The limited background Cl/HCO3 exchange in untransfected cells was not inhibited by 4Br-A23187, indicating that the effect is specific for DRA (data not shown). Taken together these data demonstrate that DRA is inhibited by intracellular calcium. To address a role of PDZ adapter proteins in mediating the calcium effect, the experiment was repeated in two clonal cell lines, one expressing wild type EGFP-DRA and one lacking the PDZ interaction motif (EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus) (Fig. 1, B and C). In EGFP-DRA (wild type) expressing HEK cells, the maximal pHi change after removal of chloride was reduced by 28% (ΔpHi, 0.58 ± 0.08 versus 0.42 ± 0.07, p < 0.05), and the initial slope was reduced by 33% (0.60 ± 0.14 pH/min versus 0.40 ± 0.13, p < 0.05). In EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus-expressing HEK cells, the respective values were −49% (ΔpHi, 0.60 ± 0.07 versus 0.30 ± 0.15, p < 0.05) and −80% (0.94 ± 0.16 pH/min versus 0.19 ± 0.11, p < 0.05). Thus calcium-mediated DRA inhibition induced by 4Br-A23187 was independent of the PDZ interaction motif arguing against a role of PDZ adapter proteins in transfected HEK cells. Cholinergic stimulation elicits a calcium signal that activates protein kinase C (PKC) by translocation to the apical plasma membrane and thus inhibits brush border NHE3 in the ileum (23.Cohen M.E. Wesolek J. McCullen J. Rys-Sikora K. Pandol S. Rood R.P. Sharp G.W. Donowitz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of PKC by phorbol ester has been shown to inhibit NHE3 in PS120 cells (24.Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and in Caco-2 cells (25.Janecki A.J. Montrose M.H. Zimniak P. Zweibaum A. Tse C.M. Khurana S. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8790-8798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Given the parallel action of NHE3 and DRA, it appeared possible that the inhibition of DRA by calcium involved the activation of PKC. To test such an involvement, PKC was activated by 100 nm PMA for 5 min. Fig. 2 shows that DRA activity was unchanged after activation of PKC. Because DRA regulatory pathways may not be present in poorly differentiated HEK cells, we expressed DRA and the ETKFminus mutant in the differentiated intestinal epithelial Caco-2/BBE cell line, which is a standard model of absorptive enterocytes. Our previous attempts to transgenically express DRA in Caco-2 cells have failed, perhaps because DRA expression retards growth in several transfected cell lines, with the notable exception of HEK cells (26.Chapman J.M. Knoepp S.M. Byeon M.K. Henderson K.W. Schweinfest C.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5083-5088PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, Caco-2/BBE cells expressing the Tet-Off system (16.Shen L. Black E.D. Witkowski E.D. Lencer W.I. Guerriero V. Schneeberger E.E. Turner J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were transfected with EGFP-DRA and EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus in the Tet-responsive pTRE2[hygro] vector, and stable clones were selected by hygromycin in the presence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline, which suppresses the expression of the gene of interest. Clones were then tested for the expression of EGFP-DRA in the absence of doxycycline. Established clones were kept in culture in the continued presence of doxycycline except for those cells that were used for functional studies. The effect of removal of doxycycline on the mRNA expression of EGF-DRA or EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus, PAT1 (SLC26A6), CFTR, and NHE3 as well as PDZK1 and E3KARP was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3). Removal of doxycycline induced mRNA expression of DRA and DRA-ETKFminus as well as EGFP by a factor of 8–16-fold (23 to 24). Induction of EGFP was minimally (and statistically not significant) greater than induction of DRA indicating relatively little endogenous DRA expression compared with the induced expression of EGFP-DRA. mRNA expressions of PAT1, CFTR, NHE3, PDZK1, and E3KARP were all not significantly influenced by the induction of EGFP-DRA or EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus, and there were no differences between EGFP-DRA- and EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus-expressing cells. Of note, mRNA of NHE3 was difficult to amplify even with several other primer pairs (Ct values >33) suggesting little endogenous NHE3 expression in these cells. Expression of EGFP-DRA and EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy for EGFP (Fig. 4A). EGFP-DRA and EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus are distributed at the apical surface in a punctate manner, suggestive of localization on microvilli. To further substantiate this, the actin cytoskeleton was counterstained. Fig. 4B shows that EGFP-DRA colocalizes with actin cores of apical microvilli. Similar images were obtained with EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus. mRNA of both PAT1 (SLC26A6) and CFTR was detected by RT-PCR in our cells (Fig. 3). PAT1 catalyzes Cl/HCO3 exchange, and CFTR enhances PAT1 and DRA activity in several models (6.Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 7.Ko S.B. Zeng W. Dorwart M.R. Luo X. Kim K.H. Millen L. Goto H. Naruse S. Soyombo A. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was necessary to examine the influence of PAT1 and CFTR on the Cl/HCO3 exchange activity in the EGFP-DRA-expressing Caco-2/BBE cells, i.e. after induction by doxycycline removal. Fig. 5 shows that Cl/HCO3 exchange was not affected by 100 μm DIDS, a concentration that predominantly inhibits PAT1 but not DRA (27.Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) (maximal ΔpHi, 0.44 ± 0.12 versus 0.45 ± 0.18, 2% stimulation, p > 0.05; and initial slope 0.37 ± 0.08 pH/min versus 0.37 ± 0.10, 0% change, p > 0.05). Furthermore, inhibition of CFTR by 10 μm CFTRinh-172 (28.Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) also had no effect on Cl/HCO3 exchange activity (maximal ΔpHi 0.50 ± 0.13 versus 0.50 ± 0.11, 0% change, p > 0.05; and initial slope 0.42 ± 0.07 pH/min versus 0.42 ± 0.13, 0% change, p > 0.05) arguing against a functional interplay between CFTR and DRA in these cells. Taken together the data presented in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 suggest that EGFP-DRA- and EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus-transfected Caco-2/BBE cells are a useful model to study DRA and the potential role of its interaction with PDZ adapter proteins. The effect of 4Br-A23187 on Cl/HCO3 exchange mediated by DRA was then tested in the transfected Caco-2/BBE cells. In wild type EGFP-DRA-transfected cells, 4Br-A23187 inhibited the maximal increase of pHi after chloride removal significantly by 26% (ΔpHi, 0.59 ± 0.19 versus 0.44 ± 0.11, p < 0.05), and the initial slope nonsignificantly by 30% (0.61 ± 0.34 pH/min versus 0.42 ± 0.16, p > 0.05). In the mutant lacking the PDZ interaction motif (EGFP-DRA-ETKFminus) neither the maximal pHi increase (ΔpHi, 0.54 ± 0.07, −12%, p > 0.05) nor the initial slope (0.66 ± 0.40 pH/min versus 0.63 ± 0.24, −8%, p > 0.05) was significantly reduced (Fig. 6). This suggests that calcium-mediated inhibition of DRA involves the interaction of DRA with PDZ adapter proteins in Caco-2/BBE cells and, by extension, in enterocytes. Because 4Br-A23187 as an ionophore leads to a nonphysiologic elevation of intracellular calcium, the calcium effect needed to be verified by a physiological agonist. Therefore, we tested UTP because it acts via stimulation of P2Y receptors and is independent of protein kinase C (29.Bucheimer R.E. Linden J. J. Physiol. 2004; 555: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, postconfluent Caco-2 cells express P2Y receptors that can be stimulated by UTP resulting in an increase of intracellular calcium (30.Inoue C.N. Woo J.S. Schwiebert E.M. Morita T. Hanaoka K. Guggino S.E. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1862-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was confirmed in our EGFP-DRA-expressing cells by comparing the magnitude of the calcium tra"
https://openalex.org/W2154950961,"The eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) gene undergoes translocation and fuses in-frame to the multiple lineage leukemia gene in a substantial proportion of patients suffering from acute forms of leukemia. Studies show that ELL indirectly modulates transcription by serving as a regulator for transcriptional elongation as well as for p53, U19/Eaf2, and steroid receptor activities. Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that ELL could also serve as a transcriptional factor to directly induce transcription of the thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) gene. Experiments using ELL deletion mutants established that full-length ELL is required for the TSP-1 up-regulation and that the transactivation domain likely resides in the carboxyl terminus. Moreover, the DNA binding domain may localize to the first 45 amino acids of ELL. Not surprisingly, multiple lineage leukemia-ELL, which lacks these amino acids, did not induce expression from the TSP-1 promoter. In addition, the ELL core-response element appears to localize in the -1426 to -1418 region of the TSP-1 promoter. Finally, studies using zebrafish confirmed that ELL regulates TSP-1 mRNA expression in vivo, and ELL could inhibit zebrafish vasculogenesis, at least in part, through up-regulating TSP-1. Given the importance of TSP-1 as an anti-angiogenic protein, our findings may have important ramifications for better understanding cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2101097337,"Stem cells, that is, cells that can both reproduce themselves and differentiate into functional cell types, attract much interest as potential aids to healing and disease therapy. Embryonic neural crest is pluripotent and generates the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and some connective tissues. Neural-crest-related stem cells have been reported previously in postnatal skin: committed melanocytic stem cells in the hair follicle, and pluripotent cell types from the hair follicle and papilla that can produce various sets of lineages. Here we describe novel pluripotent neural crest-like stem cells from neonatal mouse epidermis, with different potencies, isolated as 3 independent immortal lines. Using alternative regulatory factors, they could be converted to large numbers of either Schwann precursor cells, pigmented melanocytes, chondrocytes, or functional sensory neurons showing voltage-gated sodium channels. Some of the neurons displayed abundant active TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors. Such functional neurons have previously been obtained in culture only with difficulty, by explantation. The system was also used to generate comparative gene expression data for the stem cells, melanocytes, and melanoblasts that sufficiently explain the lack of pigment in melanoblasts and provide a rationale for some genes expressed apparently ectopically in melanomas, such as ephrin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2000030207,"N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are lipids involved in several physiological processes in animal and plant cells. In brain, NAEs are ligands of endocannabinoid receptors, which modulate various signaling pathways. In plant, NAEs regulate seed germination and root development, and they are involved in plant defense against pathogen attack. This signaling activity is started by an enzyme called N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) synthase. This catalyzes the N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form NAPE, which is most likely hydrolyzed by phospholipase D β/γ isoforms to generate NAE. This compound is further catabolized by fatty amide hydrolase. The genes encoding the enzymes involved in NAE metabolism are well characterized except for the NAPE synthase gene(s). By heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and overexpression in plants, we characterized an acyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (At1g78690p) catalyzing the synthesis of lipids identified as NAPEs (two-dimensional TLC, phospholipase D hydrolysis assay, and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses). The ability of free fatty acid and acyl-CoA to be used as acyl donor was compared in vitro with E. coli membranes and purified enzyme (obtained by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography). In both cases, NAPE was synthesized only in the presence of acyl-CoA. β-Glucuronidase promoter experiments revealed a strong expression in roots and young tissues of plants.

Most studies carried out with animal cells/tissues have focused on N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, NAE20:4), which is synthesized in brain neurons but also, under certain conditions, in macrophage cells (6.Liu J.

Chambers W.A. Pertwee R.G. Anaesthesia. 2001; 56: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that NAE20:4 also promotes food intake, whereas NAE18:0 and NAE18:1 exert anorexic effects by increasing satiety (9.Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A.

NAE16:0 is accumulated during inflammation and has several anti-inflammatory effects (for a review, see Ref. 12.Lambert D.M. Vandevoorde S. Jonsson K.O. Fowler C.J. Curr. Med.

In plants, NAEs are thought to be involved in various physiological functions. For example, because NAE levels observed in various dry seeds decline rapidly after imbibition, a possible role of these compounds in the regulation of seed germination has been proposed (13.Chapman K.D. Venables B. Markovic R. Blair Jr., R.W. Bettinger C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It was further observed that the addition of 25 μm NAE12:0 to growth medium of Arabidopsis thaliana leads to a decrease in the size of the main and lateral roots and in root hair formation. This reduction in growth was associated with a modification of cytoskeletal organization (14.Blancaflor E.B. Hou G. Chapman K.D. Planta. 2003; 217: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NAE12:0 is also able to delay cut Dianthus caryophyllus (carnation) senescence by decreasing oxidative damage and enhancing antioxidant defense (15.Zhang Y. Guo W.M. Chen S.M. Han L. Li Z.M. J. Plant Physiol. 2007; 164: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas NAE14:0 inhibits the elicitor-induced medium alkalinization and activates phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene expression involved in plant defense against pathogen attack (16.Tripathy S. Venables B.J. Chapman K.D. Plant physiol. 1999; 121: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both in plant and animal cells (for a review, see Ref. 17.Kilaru A. Blancaflor E.B. Venables B.J. Tripathy S. Mysore K.S. Chapman K.D. Chem. Biodivers. 2007; 4: 1933-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), NAEs are formed by the hydrolysis (by PLDs) of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). NAPE is an unusual derivative of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with a third fatty acid linked to the amine position of the ethanolamine headgroup. In animals, the formation of NAEs is catalyzed by a PLD with a high specificity toward NAPE (NAPE-PLD). In plants, PLDβ and PLDγ isoforms, but not PLDα, hydrolyzed NAPE into NAE in vitro, and this is thought to operate in response to several biotic and abiotic stresses. Both in animals and in plants, NAEs signaling is terminated by the action of fatty acid amide hydrolases, which hydrolyze NAEs to free fatty acid and ethanolamine. FAAH has been identified and characterized in mammals and plants (for a review, see Ref. 17.Kilaru A. Blancaflor E.B. Venables B.J. Tripathy S. Mysore K.S. Chapman K.D. Chem. Biodivers. 2007; 4: 1933-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, FAAH has been shown to modulate NAE content. Moreover, lines overexpressing FAAH displayed enhanced seedling growth as well as increased cell size (18.Wang Y.S. Shrestha R. Kilaru A. Wiant W. Venables B.J. Chapman K.D. Blancaflor E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12197-12202Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and were also more susceptible to bacterial pathogens (19.Kang L. Wang Y.S. Uppalapati S.R. Wang K. Tang Y. Vadapalli V. Venables B.J. Chapman K.D. Blancaflor E.B. Mysore K.S. Plant J. 2008; 56: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the role of NAEs and their catabolism have been extensively investigated, little is known about their precursors, the NAPEs. NAPEs represent a minor phospholipid class but are present in all tissues of plants and animals. The principal function of NAPEs is to serve as a precursor for the production of lipid mediator NAEs, but it has also been suggested that NAPEs could serve as a membrane stabilizer to maintain cellular compartmentalization during tissue damage (20.Sandoval J.A. Huang Z.H. Garrett D.C. Gage D.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More recently, N-palmitoyl-PE was proposed to act as an inhibitor of macrophage phagocytosis through inhibition of the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (21.Shiratsuchi A. Ichiki M. Okamoto Y. Ueda N. Sugimoto N. Takuwa Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the animal and plant kingdoms, therefore, the signaling events mediated by NAEs appear to be involved in many physiological processes that have been extensively studied. The genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthesis (from NAPEs) and the degradation of NAEs have been cloned and characterized. By contrast, little is known about the physiological roles of NAPEs or about the first step of this lipid signaling pathway, namely the N-acylation of PE to form NAPEs. In animals, the synthesis of NAPEs is catalyzed by an N-acyltransferase, where the O-linked acyl unit from a phospholipid donor is transferred to the ethanolamine headgroup of PE (22.Schmid H.H. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Recently, a rat LRAT-like protein 1 or RLP1 was shown to display such an activity, but according to the authors, RLP-1 can function as a PE N-acyltransferase, catalytically distinguishable from the known Ca2+-dependent N-acyltransferase (23.Jin X.H. Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3614-3623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, a different situation is observed in plants. NAPE synthase activity was shown to directly acylate PE with free fatty acids (24.Chapman K.D. Moore Jr., T.S. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25.Chapman K.D. Sriparameswaran A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1359-1367Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but a gene encoding a NAPE synthase activity remained unidentified until now. The present work shows that the A. thaliana acyltransferase At1g78690p catalyzes the synthesis of NAPEs from PE and acyl-CoAs in vitro as well as in vivo when this enzyme is expressed in E. coli and overexpressed in plants. A tDNA insertion mutant of At1g78690 was identified in the SALK collection (SALK_029716). The location and orientation of the tDNA insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing of PCR products amplified with tDNA and insert-specific primers (LBa1, 5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′; LP1, 5′-TCTCCTGTGTATCCTCTCGTGTG-3′) and gene-specific primers (LP1 and RP1 (5′-TCAGATCTTGCTGCCCATTCC-3′)). Transgenic Arabidopsis was generated by the floral dip method with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain C58C1) harboring the specific construct (26.Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arabidopsis seeds were planted and grown on MS medium supplemented with 0.7% agar, 2.5 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.7. The At1g78690 sequence was amplified using the PhusionTM High-Fidelity DNA polymerase by a set of sense and antisense primers containing the appropriate restriction sites for cloning the sequence of interest in the pET-15b vector (Novagen). The PCR product was purified with the UltraCleanTM GelSpinTM DNA extraction kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. This product of purification and pET-15b vector were submitted to endonuclease enzymes (NcoI and XhoI; Biolabs), and the 5′ extremities were dephosphorylated (alkaline phosphatase; Biolabs). Then the vector was purified using the UltraCleanTM Standard Mini plasmid prep kit (MO BIO Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantity and purity of this preparation were determined at 260 and 280 nm. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Finally, this insert was introduced into pET-15b vector by ligation (T4 DNA ligase of Biolabs). C41 (DE3) E. coli bacteria (Avidis, Saint-Beauzire, France) was further transformed with the pET-15b containing the At1g78690 sequence by the heat shock method. Independent clones were obtained by ampicillin selection. To obtain At1g78690p tagged with His6 and the construction needed for tissue and cellular location, the cDNA of At1g78690 or the promoter of this gene (964 bp before the start codon) was amplified using the PhusionTM High-Fidelity DNA polymerase and a set of sense and antisense primers containing the attB region (respecting the reading frame for the different constructions). The PCR products were cloned in the PDONR221 vector using Gateway technology. After verification by sequencing, the pDONR221 containing the sequence of interest (cDNA or gene promoter) were purified as previously and used for the LR reaction with different destination vectors: pDESTTM17 (for His6-At1g78690p), pK7WG2D (for p35S:At1g78690), pK7YWG2 and pK7WGY2 (for p35S:YFP-At1g78690 in the C terminus and N terminus, respectively), or pKGWFS7 (for pAt1g78690:GUS). C41 (DE3) E. coli bacteria were grown overnight in LB medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C at 200 rpm. The overnight culture was diluted (1:20), and the culture was continued in 250-ml flasks at 37 °C. When the culture reached an absorbance A600 of 0.6, expression of the At1g78690 was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The culture was then allowed to grow for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of water. The lipids were extracted according to Ref. 27.Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. A culture of E. coli C41-transformed At1g78690-His6 cDNA was obtained. After 3 h of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C. The proteins were solubilized by incubation of the pellet with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside at 4 °C for 1 h. The solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for protein purification. The At1g78690-His6 was purified using the Ni SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The equilibration buffer was 20 mm phosphate buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, pH 8, and the NAPE synthase was eluted with 20 mm phosphate buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 50 ml of E. coli culture were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of 0.2 m Tris/HCl (pH 8) buffer. 2.5 ml of 0.2 m Tris/HCl, 1 m sucrose,1 mm EDTA (pH 8) buffer was added and gently mixed before the addition of 25 μl lysozyme (1 g/liter) and 10 ml of water. Digestion of cell walls was performed at 20 °C under gentle shaking for 30 min. Membranes were spun down by centrifugation (15 min at 150,000 × g, using a Hitachi centrifuge). The pellet was washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8) buffer before centrifugation (15 min at 150,000 × g, using a Hitachi centrifuge) and resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8) buffer. The protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method with BSA as a standard. The NAPE synthase assays were conducted for 10 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of assay mixture (15 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8) containing 1 nmol of labeled acyl donor ([14C]palmitoyl-CoA (60 mCi/mmol), [14C]stearoyl-CoA (58 mCi/mmol), [14C]palmitic acid (56 mCi/mmol) or [14C]stearic acid (51 mCi/mmol)) and in the presence of 1 nmol of PE. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μg of membrane proteins or 40 μg of purified enzyme. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 500 μl of water. The lipids were extracted as described below. The radioactivity incorporated into NAPE was quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE HealthCare). Complete seedlings or tissue cuttings were stained in multiwell plates. Histochemical assays for GUS activity were performed according to the protocol described in Ref. 28.Beeckman T. Engler G. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 12: 37-42Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar. The plants were observed with a Leica binocular loupe (Leica MZ16F) coupled with a camera (DFC 420), and data processing was done with Leica application suite version 2.5.0 R1. Four-week-old tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana) greenhouse plants grown at 22–24 °C were used for Agrobacterium tumefasciens (strain GV3101)-mediated transient expression as described in Ref. 29.Chatre L. Brandizzi F. Hocquellet A. Hawes C. Moreau P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 13: 1244-1254Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Polar lipids were separated by two-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/1-propanol/methyl acetate/0.25% KCl (solvent A; 10:4:10:10:3.6, by volume) for migration in the first dimension and using pyridine/chloroform/formic acid (25/15/3.5, by volume) for migration in the second dimension. The lipids were then visualized and quantified by GC, as described by Testet et al. (27.Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from rosette leaf by the addition of 2 ml of hexane/2-propanol/water (20/55/25, by volume) and heated at 70 °C until total leaf discoloration. The solvent was evaporated to dryness under N2. The lipids were extracted according to Ref. 27.Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. Plant lipids were separated on a Kieselgel G type 60 column. Chloroform, chloroform/methanol (6:1, v/v), and chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were used to elute yellow pigments, chlorophyll + MGDG, and phospholipids, respectively. Each fraction was evaporated under N2 and further analyzed by TLC using solvent A. The unidentified lipid synthesized by E. coli transformed with pET15b::At1g78690 was isolated as described previously. The lipid was evaporated to dryness and suspended in 1 ml of diethyl ether. The reaction mix was composed by 235 μl of MES-NaOH 40 mm, CaCl2 15 mm, with 62.5 units of Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD. The reaction was carried out at 32 °C with shaking (120 rpm) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Then lipids were extracted and separated by TLC. Aliquots of lipids extracted from bacteria transformed by the cDNA of At1g78690 or E. coli (wild type) were dried gently under a stream of N2. The lipids were suspended in methanol solution. All experiments were performed using an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Advantage; Thermo Fisher) fitted with an orthogonal electrospray ionization source, by analyzing negative ions. Methanolic lipid solutions were diluted at 1:10 and infused by means of a syringe pump at a flow rate of 300 μl/h (KD Scientific). The spray voltage was 4.5 kV, the capillary voltage was 10 V, and its temperature was 200 °C. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed in the ion trap by collision-induced dissociation with helium gas buffer at 0.1 pascals. Data were collected and analyzed with XcaliburTM software. Total RNA from 3-week-old leaves of wild type (Col0), tDNA, and overexpressing At1g78690 lines was extracted using the RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out with the SuperScript RT II kit (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA as template and oligo(dT) as primers. To determine the relative transcript levels of At1g78690, reverse transcription-PCR assays were performed using the following oligonucleotides: GGCCAAGTGCTAGACGAAAC as a 5′-primer and CAACCGCTTGGCTAAGAGTC as a 3′-primer. A standard curve was established using serially diluted cDNA. PCR efficiency ranged from 95 to 105%. All samples were assayed in triplicate wells. Real time PCR was performed on an iCyclerTM (Bio-Rad). Samples were amplified in a 25-μl reaction containing 1× SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and a 260 nm concentration of each primer. The thermal profile consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 42 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and at 58 °C for 30 s. For each run, data acquisition and analysis were done using the iCyclerTMQ software (version 3.0a; Bio-Rad). The transcript abundance in tDNA and overexpressing samples relative to Col0 samples was determined using a comparative Ct method. The relative abundance of ACT2 (At1g49240) and EIF4 (At3g13920) mRNA in each sample was determined and used to normalize for differences in total RNA amounts. To identify and characterize lysolipid acyltransferases from A. thaliana other than the well characterized lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (30.Kim H.U. Li Y. Huang A.H.C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1073-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we sought homologies between the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase from S. cerevisiae, (YPR140wp) that we previously described (31.Testet E. Akermoun M. Shimoji M. Cassagne C. Bessoule J.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1150-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and open reading frames of A. thaliana. Two sequences were identified: At1g78690 and At3g05510. In the present paper, we describe results obtained for At1g78690p (the function of At3g05510p is completely different and will be described in a further article). The At1g78690p sequence presents three of the four conserved domains generally associated with glycerolipid acyltransferases (Fig. 1) and particularly the blocks I (NHX4D) and III (FPEGT) that might be the catalytic sites of these enzymes (32.Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of At1g78690p is 31.74 kDa for 284 amino acids. The pHi is estimated at 8.84. The sequence analysis (TMpred program; available on the World Wide Web) of At1g78690p predicts the presence of two transmembrane helixes from amino acid 14 to 37 (score 671) and from amino acid 163 to 182 (score 526). However, other prediction sites do not mention these structures (HMMTOP, TMMOD, and PHOBIUS). The presence of myristoylation sites, prenylation sites, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition sites was also sought using the NMT, PrePS, and Big-PI Plant Predictor programs (all available on the World Wide Web). The analysis of this sequence with these programs did not evidence post-translational modifications. In addition, no targeting signal was evidenced using WolfPSORT Prediction, Target P, and MITOPROT (all available on the World Wide Web). The complete cDNA of At1g78690p was transformed into the E. coli C41 strain. After induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, the lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig. 2A, the lipid extract of bacteria transformed with pET15b-At1g78690 contained an additional lipid class (RF = 0.68) compared with those of bacteria transformed with the empty plasmid. Following two-dimensional TLC, it appeared that this lipid co-migrated with NAPE standard (Fig. S1). This spot was further scraped from the TLC plate and submitted to hydrolysis catalyzed by S. chromofuscus PLD. After the reaction, lipids were extracted from the incubation mixture and separated on a TLC plate. As shown in Fig. 2B, the hydrolysis of the lipid of interest by PLD led to two products identified as NAE (RF = 0.93) (Fig. 2B) and phosphatidic acid (RF = 0.31). These results are in perfect agreement with the claim that At1g78690p catalyzes the synthesis of NAPE when expressed in E. coli. To check this assumption, the lipid extracts of bacteria transformed with the cDNA of At1g78690p or with the empty vector were further analyzed by mass spectrometry. In contrast with results obtained with the lipid extract from bacteria transformed with the empty vector, several pseudomolecular ions corresponding to NAPE species were detected in the lipid extract purified from bacteria expressing At1g78690p (Fig. S2; m/z 928–1010 mass range). These ions were further characterized by MS/MS, yielding characteristic fragment ions of NAPE species (33.Chapman K.D. Moore Jr., T.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34.Hansen H.H. Hansen S.H. Bjørnsdottir I. Hansen H.S. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In agreement with the fatty acid composition of E. coli, only NAPEs containing C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and C18:1 chains were detected. As an example, the MS/MS spectrum of the m/z 980.6 species (pseudomolecular ion [M − H]−) and its fragmentation scheme are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. Diagnostic fragment ions correspond to fatty acid carboxylate anions (palmitoleic acid at m/z 253.1 and oleic acid at m/z 281.1) and to the losses of these carboxylic acids. As already described for this type of compound (34.Hansen H.H. Hansen S.H. Bjørnsdottir I. Hansen H.S. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the loss of the sn-2-carboxylate was more abundant than the loss from the sn-1-position (m/z 727.3 > m/z 699.3, and m/z 253.1 > m/z 281.1; Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the characteristic neutral loss of the N-acylethanolamine moiety following the first loss of carboxylate was also observed (m/z 417.1 and 389.1), making it possible to assign the m/z 980.6 ion to N-stearic-1-oleic-2-palmitoleic-3-phosphatidylethanolamine. More generally, results obtained by MS and MS/MS analysis are consistent with the production of NAPEs in E. coli cells expressing At1g78690p. Therefore, we assumed that the At1g78690 gene codes for a NAPE synthase from A. thaliana, but this hypothesis remained to be confirmed both in vitro and in planta. The ability of At1g78690p to synthesize NAPE was analyzed by performing enzymatic assays with 14C-labeled free fatty acids (C16:0 or C18:0) or labeled acyl-CoAs (C16:0 or C18:0) and unlabeled PE as substrates. Initial experiments were carried out by using membranes purified from E. coli transformed with the empty vector pET15b (control) or with pET15b-At1g78690 plasmid (50 μg of proteins/assay; 10-min incubation). Results are shown in Table 1. Whatever the experimental conditions used, no significant amount (<1 pmol) of NAPE was synthesized by membranes purified from E. coli transformed with the empty vector. A similar result was obtained when membranes purified from bacteria expressing At1g78690p were incubated with PE and FFA. By contrast, the same membranes synthesized about 33 pmol of NAPE when palmitoyl-CoA or stearoyl-CoA was used as acyl donor.TABLE 1Determination of the acyl donorNAPE synthesizedC16:0 FFAC16:0-CoAC18:0 FFAC18:0-CoApmolE. coli pET15b membranes0 min0.09 ± 0.000.11 ± 0.090.16 ± 0.120.10 ± 0.0910 min0.06 ± 0.040.26 ± 0.070.17 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.02E. coli pET15b ::At1g78690 membranes0 min0.19 ± 0.040.08 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.110.01 ± 0.0110 min1.23 ± 0.3132.51 ± 1.190.07 ± 0.0533.65 ± 0.97Purified protein0 min0.11 ± 0.020.20 ± 0.060.02 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.0210 min0.07 ± 0.021.82 ± 0.310.24 ± 0.043.72 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab In a second set of experiments, we used the protein At1g78690p fused with a poly-His tag purified on an IMAC column.

The aim of this work was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of small-molecule agonist ligands acting at this receptor, comparing it with the action mechanism of the receptor's natural peptide ligand. cAMP responses to four non-peptidyl ligands and calcitonin were studied in COS-1 cells expressing wild-type and chimeric calcitonin-secretin receptors. All compounds were full agonists at the calcitonin receptor with no activity at the secretin receptor. Only chimeric constructs including the calcitonin receptor amino terminus exhibited responses to any of these ligands. We progressively truncated this domain and tested constructs for cAMP responses. Although calcitonin was able to activate the calcitonin receptor fully with the first 58 residues absent, its potency was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that at the wild-type receptor. After truncation of 114 residues, there was no response to calcitonin. In contrast, small-molecule ligands were fully active at receptors having up to 149 amino-terminal residues absent. Those compounds finally became inactive after truncation of 153 residues. Deletion and/or alanine replacement of the region of the calcitonin receptor between residues 150 and 153 resulted in marked reduction in cAMP responses to these compounds, with some compound-specific differences observed, supporting a critical role for this region. Binding studies further supported distinct sites of action of small molecules relative to that of calcitonin. These findings focus attention on the potential importance of the juxtamembranous region of the amino terminus of the Family B calcitonin receptor for agonist drug action."

The effects of morphine through MOR, such as analgesia and development of tolerance and dependence, are influenced by individual specificity. Recently, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms on the human MOR gene to investigate the factors that contribute to individual specificity. In process of single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis, we found that specific nuclear proteins bound to G−172 → T region in exon 1 in MOR gene, and its affinity to DNA was increased by base substitution from G−172 to T−172. The isolated protein was identified by mass spectrometry and was confirmed by Western blotting to be poly(ADP-ribose) po ly mer ase-1 (PARP-1). The overexpressed PARP-1 bound to G−172 → T and enhanced the transcription of reporter vectors containing G−172 and T−172. Furthermore, PARP-1 inhibitor (benzamide) decreased PARP-1 binding to G−172 → T without affecting mRNA or protein expression level of PARP-1 and down-regulated the subsequent MOR gene expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we found that tumor necrosis factor-α enhanced MOR gene expression as well as increased PARP-1 binding to the G−172 → T region and G−172 → T-dependent transcription in SH-SY5Y cells. These effects were also inhibited by benzamide. In this study, our data suggest that PARP-1 positively regulates MOR gene transcription via G−172 → T, which might influence individual specificity in therapeutic opioid effects. μ opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as morphine are applied widely in clinical practice as pain therapy.

Opioids have potent analgesic effects, which are mediated by binding of agonists such as opioid alkaloids or opioid peptides to their endogenous receptors.

Studies with MOR knock-out mice clearly demonstrated that the MOR is the major target of analgesia (1Kieffer B.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, treatments via the MOR have become the center of strategy for palliative care, and the selective MOR agonist, morphine, became widely applied to clinical therapy. However, it is difficult to determine a proper dose of morphine because morphine efficacy is affected by individual specificity. Recently, individual specificity was considered to be related to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present on the human MOR gene. MOR couples to G proteins and regulates adenylyl cyclase, intracellular calcium, inwardly rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and other messengers, which further trigger a cascade of intracellular events (2Law P.Y.

The human MOR gene is found on chromosome 6q24-25 and is composed of a transcriptional regulatory region, four exons, and three introns (3Wang J.B. Johnson P.S. Persico A.M. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Uhl G.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), in which 47 kinds of SNPs are discovered (4Hoehe M.R. Köpke K. Wendel B. Rohde K. Flachmeier C. Kidd K.K. Berrettini W.H. Church G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2895-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the SNPs affect MOR receptor function by causing amino acid substitution or by altering gene transcription levels. The most typical polymorphism, A118 → G, was located on exon 1 of the MOR gene and induced an amino acid substitution, Asn40 → Asp, in the extracellular domain of the MOR (5Bergen A.W. Kokoszka J. Peterson R. Long J.C. Virkkunen M. Linnoila M. Goldman D. Mol. Psychiatry. 1997; 2: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar); this substitution increased the receptor binding affinity of β-endorphin and decreased the binding affinity of morphine-6-glucuronid (6Bond C.

The G779 → A, G794 → A, or T802 → C polymorphisms in MOR exon 3 caused amino acid substitutions Arg260 → H, Arg265 → His, or Ser268 → Pro, respectively, in the third intracellular loop of the MOR, which decreased the receptor signaling activity (8Wang D. Quillan J.M. Winans K. Lucas J.L. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34624-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the T802 → C polymorphism (Ser268 → Pro) resulted in a loss of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-induced receptor desensitization (9Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schröder H. Raulf E. Höllt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Expression level of the MOR gene is controlled by various transcriptional factors, and the SNPs in the promoter region influence MOR expression and following responsiveness to its agonists. In immuno-effector cells, interleukin-4 up-regulated the MOR gene via STAT6 binding to −997 bp. The C−995 → A polymorphism is present in the DNA-binding site of STAT6, and the affinity of STAT6 to A−995 was lower than that to C−995. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α up-regulated the MOR gene via NF-κB binding to −2174, −557, and −207 bp. The G−554 → A polymorphism is present on the DNA-binding site of NF-κB. The affinity of NF-κB to A−554 was lower than that to G−554. Therefore, either the C−995 → A or the G−554 → A polymorphism has the possibility of influencing the MOR gene expression that interleukin-4 or TNF-α causes through respective transcriptional factors (10Kraus J.

Transplantation. 1971; 11: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are known as MOR knockdown mice. It was reported that the base substitution at C−202 → A detected in CXBK mice decreased the SP1 binding affinity to the MOR gene (13Lee P.W. Wu S. Lee Y.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1580-1584PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a 116-kDa nuclear protein known to have DNA binding activity and enzymatic activity of ADP-ribosylation (14Soldatenkov V.A. Chasovskikh S. Potaman V.N.

PARP-1 catalyzes the reaction that adds the ADP-ribose unit of NAD+ to several nuclear proteins, including PARP-1 itself (15D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Initial study of PARP-1 implicated many biological functions, including DNA repair, recombination, apoptosis, and tumor genesis (15D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

However, recent studies demonstrated that PARP-1 also contributed to gene transcription in several ways. It was reported that PARP-1 could act as a transcription activator (17Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, PARP-1 modified histones to alter chromatin structure or bound to other DNA-binding factors as coactivators (22Kraus W.L. Lis J.T.

Recently, we analyzed SNPs on the MOR gene in the Japanese population and found the novel linkage of SNPs (G−1748 → A and G−172 → T) (24Ono T. Muto A. Kaneda T. Yoshida T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2009; 32: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In these analyses, we found that specific nuclear proteins bound to the G−172 → T region, and its affinity was increased by base substitution of G−172 → T. In this study, we demonstrated that the identified PARP-1 bound to the G−172 → T region in the MOR gene, preferentially to T−172, and positively regulated MOR gene expression. The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen). Benzamide (BZD; WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and sodium benzoate (BZA; WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). TNF-α was purchased from WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. In all experiments, the same amount of DMSO was added to the control samples. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK293T or SH-SY5Y cells. All of the steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei, which were washed with lysis buffer. The nuclei were incubated in elution buffer (50 mm HEPES, 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% grycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was used for nuclear extracts. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). All of the oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). To obtain double-stranded DNA, equimolar amounts of consensus oligonucleotides were heated to 85 °C for 15 min with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. After heating, each sample was allowed to cool down to room temperature slowly. Oligonucleotides used for EMSA were 5′ end-labeled with T4 kinase (Toyobo, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After the reaction, labeled oligonucleotides were separated with MicroSpinTM G-25 Columns (GE Healthcare) and diluted to 100 μl. Oligonucleotide sequences are shown as follows: G−172 probe, 5′-AGAGGAGAATGTCAGATGCTCAGCTCGGTCCCCTCCGCCTGA-3′; and T−172 probe, 5′-AGAGGAGAATGTCAGATGCTCATCTCGGTCCCCTCCGCCTGA-3′. Nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in 10 μl of binding reaction mixture contained 1 μg of nuclear extracts and 2 μl of 5× gel shift binding buffer (Promega Co., San Luis, CA). Subsequently, 35 fmol of labeled probe was added, and incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature. For competition assay, unlabeled probe was added to the binding reaction mixture before the addition of the labeled probe. For supershift assay, anti-PARP-1 antibody (sc-8007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was dialyzed with 0.1× phosphate-buffered saline for 2 days. Subsequently, dialyzed antibody and buffer were concentrated on 8-fold by lypholization. Two microliters of anti-PARP-1 antibody, concentrated dialyzed buffer, or anti-SP1 antibody (sc-59X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of the labeled probe. Samples were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. After running, the gel was dewatered, exposed to the imaging plate and analyzed with Typhoon9410 (GE Healthcare). For blocking nonspecific protein binding, 10 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Merck) were preincubated in 2% bovine serum albumin and washed twice in the buffered solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl). Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (90 pmol) were added to nuclear extracts of 100 μg and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Next, streptavidin-agarose beads pretreated with bovine serum were added to the oligo-DNA-protein complex and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Bead-oligo-DNA-protein complexes were washed twice in the buffered solution and then collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 5 min. The sample for SDS-PAGE was prepared by heating precipitated complex with 100 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.00125% bromphenol blue) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The PARP-1 coding sequence was cloned from SH-SY5Y cells using PCR amplification; PCR was performed using KOD plus (Toyobo, Ltd.) and the following set of primers: forward, 5′-TATCTCGAGGATGGCGGAGTCTTCGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-TGCCTCGAGTACCTCTCCCAATTACCACAG-3′. Following sequencing, the fragments were digested with XhoI (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and inserted to expression vector digested with same enzyme. DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega Co.), and plasmid DNA was purified using the Genopure plasmid maxi kit (Roche Applied Science). Nuclear extracts containing 2 μg of protein were diluted to 100 μl with Laemmli buffer contained of 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were loaded on 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The PARP-1 protein was detected by using mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the C terminus of PARP-1 (sc-8007), anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies, and ECL reagent. SP1 protein for loading control was detected by using rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-59), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies, and ECL reagent. PARP-1 RNA interference was carried out by using shRNA expression vector. All of the shRNA expression vectors were based on the piGENETMtRNA Neo/KpnI/SacI (iGENE Therapeutics, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Construction of shPARP-1 vectors were accomplished by inserting oligonucleotides directed against human PARP-1. Target area was decided according to the research of Kameoka et al. (25Kameoka M. Nukuzuma S. Itaya A. Tanaka Y. Ota K. Ikuta K. Yoshihara K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8931-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: SH-1 (human PARP-1 2401–2421 bp), 5′-AAGCCTCGGCTCCTGAACAATCTTCCTGTCAATTGTTCAGGAGCGGAGGCTT-3′; and SH-2 (human PARP-1 2671–2691 bp), 5′-AAGATAGAGCGTGAAGGCGAACTTCCTGTCATTCGCCTTCACGCTCTATCTT-3′. Each shRNA expression vector was transiently transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences). Seventy-two hours after transfection, total RNA was prepared and used for RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR analyses. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed in a final volume of 20 μl using 1 μg of RNA, 1 μl of oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega), and 50 units of Rever Tra Ace (Toyobo, Ltd.). The reaction conditions were as follows: 70 °C for 10 min, 4 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and 99 °C for 5 min. PCR was carried out using an ABI PRISM 7000 system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl using 5 μl of diluted cDNA, 12.5 pmol of each primer, and 0.625 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min. Primer sequences used are as follows: MOR forward, 5′-CTGCCACCAACATCTACATTTTCAACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCACCACCACCAGCACCATC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-GAACATCATCCCTGCCTCTACT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTG-3′; and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) forward, 5′-ATCCCACCCAGCCACCACCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CACGCCAAGCCCCACAAAGAG-3′. Real time RT-PCR was carried out using a My iQTM single-color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). A total reaction volume of 50 μl was prepared containing 4 μl of template cDNA, 25 μl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and 250 nm each of the forward and reverse PCR primers. Amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. To amplify the MOR mRNA, a forward primer (5′-CTGGGTCAACTTGTCCCACT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TGGAGTAGAGGGCCATGATC-3′) were used for amplification of a 146-bp fragment. As an internal control, a 169-bp fragment of the L19 ribosomal protein gene was amplified with a forward primer (5′-CTAGTGTCCTCCGCTGTGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AAGGTGTTTTTCCGGCATC-3′). These primers sequences and the calculation method of relative MOR mRNA level were referred to Bedini's report (26Bedini A. Baiula M. Spampinato S. J Neurochem. 2008; 105: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A nontemplate control was included in each experiment. Melting curve analysis and agarose electrophoresis were carried out to validate the specificity of the amplification products. All of the reporter plasmids were based on the pGL3 basic vector (Promega Co.). Construction of pGL3 TK G−172 or T−172 was accomplished by inserting oligonucleotides used for EMSA into the pGL3 basic vector digested with SmaI (Takara Bio Inc.). Next, thymidine kinase promoter sequence was obtained from the pRL TK vector (Promega) by digesting with BglII (Takara Bio, Inc.) and HindIII (Takara Bio, Inc.) and then inserting in all pGL3 vectors. Construction of pGL3G−172 or -T−172 was accomplished by inserting the MOR promoter ranged from translation initiation site to 3 kilobase pairs upstream into the pGL3 basic vector at XhoI and HindIII sites. The inserted G−172 fragment was amplified from genomic DNA of the G−172 → G genotype with PCR; PCR was performed using KOD plus (Toyobo, Ltd.) and the following set of primers: forward, 5′-TATCTCGAGGATGGCGGAGTCTTCGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCCTCGAGTACCTCTCCCAATTACCACAG-3′. The T−172 fragment was amplified from the G−172 fragment by mutagenesis that employed PCR. DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega), and plasmid DNA was purified using the Genopure plasmid maxi kit. Plasmid DNA transfection to HEK293T cells was performed in a 24-well plate by using NP-OH transfection reagent (27Hattori Y. Ding W.X. Maitani Y. J. Control. Release. 2007; 120: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and 2.4 μl of NP-OH transfection reagent were added to 12.5 μl of NaCl (40 mm). This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and used for each well. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected by using FuGENE 6. HEK293T cells and SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104/well for 24 h before transfection. Transient transfection was performed using 0.25 μg of the pGL3 vector, 0.125 μg of the pEF-bos β-galactosidase vector, and 0.125 μg of the pcDNA3-myc vector. The pEF-bos β-galactosidase vector was used for β-galactosidase assay as an internal control of transfection efficacy. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis solution (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm EGTA). Each lysate (40 μl) was used for luciferase assay and for β-galactosidase assay. Luciferase activity was quantified in MiceoLumat Plus LB96Y (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) by measurements based on the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). These assays were performed three times in triplicate. For statistical evaluation of the experiments, one-way analysis of variance was performed. The asterisks indicate significantly difference (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). To determine whether specific nuclear proteins bind to the G−172 → T region, we performed EMSA using nuclear proteins extracted from SH-SY5Y or HEK293T cells and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing the G−172 → T region. SH-SY5Y or HEK293T cells were respectively employed as MOR-expressing cells or as advantageous cells for gene transfer analysis. In each cell, specific nuclear protein binding to both the G−172 and T−172 probes were observed as doublet bands. More proteins displayed binding to the T−172 probe than to the G−172 probe (Fig. 1A). To compare the binding affinity of specific nuclear proteins to the G−172 or to the T−172 probe, a cross-competition assay was carried out using respective nonlabeled probes as a competitor (Fig. 1B). Nonlabeled T−172 probe dose-dependently interfered with specific nuclear protein binding to the G−172 probe (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–7). However, inhibitory effects by the nonlabeled G−172 probe to the T−172 probe were comparatively weak (Fig. 1B, lanes 9–11). These results were similar for both SH-SY5Y and HEK293T cells. The reporter vector of G−172 → T TK or of G−172 → T was used for the luciferase assay to monitor transcriptional activity of the MOR gene in SH-SY5Y or HEK293T cells. Oligonucleotide containing the G−172 or T−172 probe was cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter sequence in the pGL3 TK vector. Luciferase activity of pGL3G−172 TK or of pGL3T−172 TK normalized by that of pGL3 TK was shown as the relative transcriptional activity of these sequences. As a result, both pGL3G−172 TK and pGL3T−172 TK showed the transcriptional activities, which in pGL3T−172 TK was 1.7-fold as high as that of pGL3G−172 TK in SH-SY5Y or HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A). Similar to the results in pGL3G−172 → T TK, the pGL3G−172 → T containing the MOR promoter that ranged from the start site of transcription to −3 kb upstream indicated transcriptional activity; that of pGL3T−172 was 2.0–2.5-fold higher than that of pGL3G−172 in SH-SY5Y or HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). The results depicted in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 indicate that the promoter containing T−172 could possibly bind much more nuclear protein and have higher transcriptional activity. For identification of binding proteins in the G−172 → T region, the biotin-labeled T−172 probe and streptavidin-agarose beads were applied to nuclear protein purification. Protein separated by SDS-PAGE was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and observed as a single band at 120 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 5). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that the 120-kDa protein separated from acrylamide gel was PARP-1, which was confirmed by WB with anti-PARP-1 antibody in both SH-SY5Y and HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). PARP-1 overexpression enhanced protein binding to the T−172 probe and was detected as doublet bands in EMSA (Fig. 4B); it also increased transcriptional activity of pGL3T−172 TK or of pGL3T−172 (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the increase in transcriptional activities was also observed in pGL3G−172 TK or in pGL3G−172 (data not shown). Furthermore, in supershift analysis, anti-PARP-1 antibody specifically diminished PARP-1-delieved doublet bands (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 7). SP1 was initially predicted by computer program to bind G−172 → T; however, anti-SP1 antibody did not influence protein-binding signals in T−172 (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 8). These results clearly indicate that PARP-1 binds to the G−172 → T region and activates transcription of MOR, which is influenced by base substitution.FIGURE 5Super shift analysis with anti-PARP-1 antibody for reconfirmation of PARP-1 binding to the T−172 probe. Each sample, consisting of 1.0 μg of nuclear protein extracted from SH-SY5Y (lanes 1–4) or HEK293T (lanes 5–8), was loaded in EMSA. Anti-PARP-1 antibody was prepared after the dialysis and the concentration because commercially available antibody was too thin. Salt concentration of anti-PARP-1 antibody, concentrated dialyzed buffer, and anti-SP1 antibody was equal in respective sample. Lanes 1 and 5, nuclear extract without any antibody or dialyzed buffer; lane 2 and 6, nuclear extract with 2.0 μl of dialyzed buffer used for dialysis of antibody solution; lanes 3 and 7, nuclear extract with 2.0 μl of anti-PARP-1 antibody; lanes 4 and 8, nuclear extract with 2.0 μl of anti-SP1 antibody as a negative control (CON). These results were performed of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For detection of a PARP-1-binding sequence in the G−172 → T region, a competition assay was performed using shortened or mutated T−172 probes. In the analysis using shortened probes, mt 1 competed to T−172 probe and diminished PARP-1 signals, but mt 2 did not have this effect. Among mutated probes of mt 1, mt 3 completely diminished PARP-1 signals, but inhibition by mt 4, mt 5, or mt 6 was partial (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that TGTCAGATG was the center of PARP-1 binding in the MOR gene, and the sequence CTCAT beside the T−172 also related to its binding. BZD, an inhibitor of PARP-1, was used for further confirmation of PARP-1 binding to the G−172 → T region. Although neither the mRNA nor the protein expression of PARP-1 was affected by BZD (Fig. 7, A and C), the quantity of PARP-1 binding in the T−172 probe dose-dependently decreased 24 h after the addition of BZD in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 7D). SH-SY5Y cells are known to express MOR constitutively. MOR mRNA expression detected by RT-PCR was suppressed by BZD in a dose-dependent manner. However, BZA, as a negative control for BZD, did not influence the tested mRNA expressions, including MOR (Fig. 7A). Real time RT-PCR analysis showed that BZD resulted in a 0.7-fold depletion of MOR mRNA expression (Fig. 7B). Moreover, PARP-1 expression was knocked down by two kinds of PARP-1 shRNA vector in SH-SY5Y cells, which was investigated for the PARP-1-dependent regulation of MOR expression. For correction of the nonspecific effects by transfection, SH-SY5Y cells were also transfected with a control shRNA. The MOR mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR or real time RT-PCR 72 h after transfection. The MOR mRNA levels were decreased by depletion of PARP-1 (Fig. 7A). Real time RT-PCR analysis showed that PARP-1 knockdown resulted in a 0.6-fold depletion of MOR mRNA expression (Fig. 7B). The increase in DRD2 mRNA by BZD or by PAR"
https://openalex.org/W2088460225,"Myc, a key regulator of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, exerts its biological functions by activating or suppressing the transcription of specific sets of target genes. C/EBP transcription factors play important roles during differentiation of various cell types and have been identified as critical targets for v-Myc- and c-Myc-dependent suppression of myeloid and fat cell differentiation. Here, we have addressed the mechanism by which v-Myc suppresses the activity of C/EBPbeta. We show that v-Myc is recruited to the aminoterminal domain of C/EBPbeta and interferes with the cooperation of C/EBPbeta and the co-activator p300 by preventing C/EBPbeta-induced phosphorylation of p300. We have identified the protein kinase responsible for C/EBPbeta-induced phosphorylation of p300 as homeo-domain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) and show that v-Myc displaces the kinase from the C/EBPbeta-p300 complex. Overall, our findings that the modulation of the C/EBPbeta-induced phosphorylation of p300 as a new mechanism of transcriptional suppression by v-Myc."
