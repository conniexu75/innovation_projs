https://openalex.org/W1596308403,"Abstract An isolated, vascularly perfused preparation of rat intestine extracted large amounts of glutamine (75 µmoles per hour), but no other amino acid, from a recirculated blood perfusate. With l-[U-14C]glutamine, the carbon was partly incorporated into tissue acid-insoluble material (14%) and the rest reappeared with little delay in intestinal venous blood in CO2 (57%), citrulline (6%), proline (5%), and organic acids (18%), predominantly citric acid and lactic acid. Perfusate glutamine was the source of 32% of the CO2 produced by the preparation, although the perfusate contained 10 to 15 mm glucose. Most glutamine uptake and metabolism occurred in the small intestinal mucosal cells and, from analyses of labeled tissue metabolites, appeared to proceed via glutamic acid. The rapid flow of glutamine carbon through mucosa may be explained in part by the small glutamine pool, only 0.2 µmole per g of tissue. Glutamine nitrogen taken up by intestine could be approximately accounted for by the quantities of citrulline (34%), alanine (33%), ammonia (23%), and proline (10%) released back into the perfusate. Glutamine uptake comparable to that found in the isolated organ was observed in vivo, from arteriovenous concentration measurements across intestine in fasted dogs, cats, hamsters, monkeys, and conventional and germ-free rats. Twenty-five to 33% of plasma glutamine was extracted in each pass through the tissue. Glutamine uptake persisted in rats during transport of large amounts of glutamic acid from the intestinal lumen into the blood and in rats injected with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine. The results of these studies suggest that glutamine derived from blood is an important respiratory substrate for cells in the small intestinal mucosa and that intestine is a major site for metabolism of glutamine released into the circulation by other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1518030473,"The complete amino acid sequence of plasma prealbumin has been determined. Prealbumin forms a stable complex with plasma retinol-binding protein and plays an important role in vitamin A transport. Prealbumin also binds thyroxine, and is involved in transport of thyroid hormone. The prealbumin molecule is a stable tetramer, composed of 4 identical subunits, with over-all molecular weight of 54,980. Each prealbumin subunit contains 127 amino acids, including 1 cysteine (position 10), 1 methionine (position 13), 4 arginine, and 8 lysine residues. Thirteen tryptic peptides were aligned after studies which included the tryptic digestion of maleylated, reduced, and carboxymethylated prealbumin (to yield 5 peptides), and subsequent tryptic digestion of these peptides after removal of the maleyl groups. The sequence of each subunit is: NH2-Gly-Pro-Thr-Gly-Thr-Gly-Glu-Ser-Lys-Cys-Pro-Leu-Met-Val-Lys-Val-Leu-Asp-Ala-Val-Arg-Gly-Ser-Pro-Ala-Ile-Asn-Val-Ala-Val-His-Val-Phe-Arg-Lys-Ala-Ala-Asp-Asp-Thr-Trp-Glu-Pro-Phe-Ala-Ser-Gly-Lys-Thr-Ser-Glu-Ser-Gly-Glu-Leu-His-Gly-Leu-Thr-Thr-Glx-Glx-Gln-Phe-Val-Glu-Gly-Ile-Tyr-Lys-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-Thr-Lys-Ser-Tyr-Trp-Lys-Ala-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ser-Pro-Phe-His-Glu-His-Ala-Glu-Val-Val-Phe-Thr-Ala-Asn-Asp-Ser-Gly-Pro-Arg-Arg-Tyr-Thr-Ile-Ala-Ala-Leu-Leu-Ser-Pro-Tyr-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Thr-Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Thr-Asn-Pro-Lys-Glu-COOH."

https://openalex.org/W1982234756,"The ACTA-Scanner has virtually unlimited potential in the evalution of any part of the body. The usefulness of the technique has already been shown in the appraisal of pathologies of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid cavities. The orbits and the eyeballs, the facial sinuses, and skull base lesions have also been elucidated. Tumors of the larynx, pharynx, thyroid, and parathyroid; lymphomas; and pathology of the spine and spinal cord are well within the reach of this new diagnostic methodology. Lung pathologies, such as emphysema, pneumonias, neoplasms, infarctions, pleural effusions and granulomatous diseases, and mediastinal pathology represent a challenging complex of lesions to be appraised by ACTA-scanning. For the heart, there is great potential for observing cardiac chamber size, hypertrophy of ventricular or atrial walls, and ventricular or aortic aneurysms, and possibly for recognizing the damaged myocardial tissue immediately after or some time after an infarction. The abdominal pathologies that can be studied are almost uncountable: gastric neoplasms, pancreatic cysts and stones, gallstones, neoplasms of the liver and pancreas, bowel tumors, abdominal aortic aneurysms, renal neoplasms and cysts, atrophy of the kidneys, bladder tumors, uterine tumors, ovarian cysts, and many more. Although bones and joints are adequately demonstrated by conventional x-ray techniques, there is no doubt that as the new technique is developed ACTA-grams will contribute significant information in the transverse plane, as well as in densitometric analyses. The impact of ACTA-scanning will not be limited to the diagnostic area, but will extend, at least indirectly, to general patient management and to some aspects of medical economics as well. Risk-laden, technically complex, and costly diagnostic procedures, sometimes requiring lengthy hospitalization, will in some cases be eliminated. The simple, innocuous, and noninvasive ACTA-scanning can be performed on an outpatient basis. Repeated follow-up examinations should be easily accepted by the patients, considering that this diagnostic test is carried out without discomfort. The entire field of diagnostic radiology is on the verge of revolutionary changes."

https://openalex.org/W1565440433,"Abstract The role of GTP in the translocation reaction catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G) has been investigated. The addition of EF-G and GTP to a poly(U)-ribosome complex having deacylated tRNA in the P site and N-acetyldiphenyl-alanyl-tRNA in the A site (Complex II) results in the shift of N-acetyldiphenylalanyl-tRNA from the A to the P site of ribosomes with a concomitant release of tRNA from the P site. It was found that 5'-guanylylmethylenediphosphonate (Gpp(CH2)p), a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, could substitute for GTP in this reaction provided that a stoichiometric amount of EF-G is employed. When Complex II was incubated with a stoichiometric amount of EF-G and Gpp(CH2)p, the deacylated tRNA was released from the P site and the N-acetyldiphenylalanyl-tRNA in the A site was shifted to the P site to become puromycin-reactive. It is concluded that the role of GTP in this reaction is to facilitate the binding of EF-G to Complex II. The translocation reaction is promoted probably by conformational change of Complex II induced through interaction with EF-G and GTP. The hydrolysis of GTP appears to be required for the removal of EF-G after completion of the translocation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1575153043,"Abstract A new form of DNA polymerase III (pol III), termed holoenzyme, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from gently lysed Escherichia coli. Three forms of pol III have now been recognized on the bases of their distinctive physical characteristics and their capacity to utilize a predominantly single-stranded template: (a) pol III, a dimer of 90,000-dalton subunits, which is inactive on single-stranded circular DNA (SS DNA); (b) pol III*, a higher polymer of pol III, which is active on SS DNA only in the presence of copolymerase III* (copol III*), a 77,000-dalton polypeptide; and (c) holoenzyme, a 330,000-dalton tetramer composed of the two pol III subunits and two copol III* units, which is distinguished from pol III or pol III* by its activity on SS DNA in the absence of added copol III*. The holoenzyme is dissociated into pol III* and copol III* by chromatography on phosphocellulose; pol III* is converted to pol III by heating, dilution, or aging. Like pol III*, the holoenzyme requires ATP to form an initiation complex with the primer template."
https://openalex.org/W1530369569,"Abstract T4 DNA polymerase cannot use a nicked duplex DNA molecule as a template-primer for DNA synthesis, apparently because it is unable to displace the 5' end of the strand paired to the strand serving as the template. Addition of the T4 phage gene 32 DNA unwinding protein (32-protein) facilities strand displacement and allows the T4 DNA polymerase to synthesize DNA using nicked duplex T7 DNA as the template-primer. The first product of this reaction is a rapidly renaturable DNA which is found to contain a few large branches when examined by electron microscopy. Later in the reaction there is also synthesis of a product containing predominantly alternating residues of dAMP and dTMP."
https://openalex.org/W1600964106,"Abstract Reaction intermediates formed during the degradation of duplex DNA by the recBC DNase have been characterized by sedimentation velocity, isopyknic centrifugation, electron microscopy, and susceptibility to various deoxyribonucleases which are specific for single-stranded DNA. It has been concluded that the intermediates are of two classes: (a) duplex molecules with single-stranded tails of several thousand nucleotides at the 3' and the 5' termini and (b) singlestranded fragments several hundred nucleotides in length. To explain the presence of these intermediates, even in synchronized reactions with DNA molecules in molar excess over enzyme, a reaction scheme for the degradation of duplex DNA is proposed. According to this scheme, the DNase unwinds the strands of the duplex from an end and clips off fragments several hundred nucleotides long from one strand, while remaining bound to the terminus of the undegraded strand. When a single-stranded tail of up to several thousand nucleotides is formed in this way, the enzyme switches strands and degrades the tail from its terminus, yielding a shortened, wholly duplex molecule. The cycle is then repeated until the molecule is entirely digested. The scheme recognizes the processive nature of the degradation of duplex DNA by this enzyme and hypothesizes that the ATP hydrolysis which accompanies DNA degradation is required for the unwinding reaction."

The solubilized enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of chitin microfibrils similar, if not identical, to those formed in vivo by the fungus. Cell wall microfibrils were thus abundantly formed in the absence of a living cell or its membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1508239888,"Phage Qβ RNA-dependent RNA replicase consists of four subunits: one is RNA phage specific (subunit II), the other three, present in the uninfected cell, are the protein biosynthesis elongation factors EF-Tu (subunit III) and EF-Ts (subunit IV) and the translation interference factor i (subunit I). When the protein biosynthesis elongation factors are removed by centrifugation of the initiated enzyme-RNA complex, the remaining two subunits (I and II) are capable of continued polymerization at a normal rate but do not initiate subsequent rounds of synthesis. Thus the protein biosynthesis factors are required for initiation but not elongation of RNA synthesis by Qβ replicase. Similar results are observed when this experiment is performed with enzyme lacking subunit I, indicating that the RNA polymerizing activity of the enzyme resides in the phage-coded polypeptide, subunit II. Guanosine tetraphosphate, a strong competitor of GTP binding by EF-Tu, inhibits initiation but not elongation by Qβ replicase on synthetic templates. However, the role of EF-T in the initiation of RNA synthesis on synthetic templates is not simply related to the functions it performs in protein biosynthesis. The aminoacyl-tRNA binding activity of EF Tu in the Qβ replicase complex can be inactivated by alkylating reagents without affecting replicase poly(U, G) polymerase activity. 5′-Guanylyl-β, γ-imidodiphosphate, an inhibitor of EF-Tu-catalyzed protein biosynthesis due to its resistance to cleavage to GDP, does not inhibit replicase activity although the compound is a competitor of GDP binding. The protein biosynthesis factors appear to play an essential role in maintaining the active conformation of the replicase enzyme complex. Catalytic activities of both EF-Tu and EFTs can be assayed when the factors are part of Qβ replicase, but the activities differ from those of the isolated factors in their sensitivity to ionic strength and dissociation by GDP."
https://openalex.org/W1563542949,"Abstract This paper describes a method for the isolation of RNA polymerase A (or I) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is rapid and achieves a 2,000-fold purification. The method involves mainly a batchwise adsorption of enzyme on phosphocellulose and on DEAE-cellulose and a sedimentation on glycerol gradient. The enzyme obtained can be differentiated from RNA polymerase B (or II) by a number of criteria including electrophoretic migration on polyacrylamide gel, sensitivity to α-amanitin, subunit structure, and optimal conditions for RNA synthesis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate reveals that yeast RNA polymerase A (or I) is made up of two large subunits in equimolar amount of 190,000 and 135,000 daltons and several smaller polypeptide chains, 1 (48,000), 1 (41,000), 2 (29,000), and 2 (16,000). The RNA synthesized on native calf thymus or yeast DNA is constituted of many short chains and of a small percentage (about 10%) of very long chains which represent the bulk of the RNA. Termination factor rho from Escherichia coli inhibits 50% the transcription of native DNA."

About half these deaths are sudden and unexpected and are consequently referred to a coroner for certification; subsequent post mortem investigation reveals evidence of disease likely to cause death in 30% of sudden deaths: in the remainder the cause of death is obscure and such a case may be described as sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS, or more conveniently as cot death. In 1972 a panel, convened by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Washington, to discuss the status of epidemiological research in SIDS considered a prospective study of high risk babies of primary importance, but doubt was expressed as to whether a sufficiently high risk group could be identified to make such a study feasible (P.

https://openalex.org/W2005147035,"The effect of ppGpp on the rate of protein synthesis has been determined in vivo. When the stringent response is triggered and then reversed in isogenic strains carrying either spoT− or spoT+, the mutants lower their elevated ppGpp only slowly, whereas wild type cells do so rapidly. Protein synthesis resumes only after a lag in spoT− cells but almost immediately in spoT+ cells. In spoT− rel− double mutants, ppGpp does not accumulate under these conditions and protein synthesis resumes immediately. Inhibition of protein synthesis in spoT− rel+ cells therefore appears to be due to elevation of ppGpp levels and not to any other effect of the spoT− mutation."

Phosphoheptose isomerase, the first enzyme in the proposed pathway of heptose biosynthesis, was shown to catalyze the reaction: sedoheptulose 7-phosphate → d-glycero-d-mannoheptose 7-phosphate. This enzyme was partially purified and utilized for the enzymatic synthesis of d-glycero-d-manno[14C]heptose 7-phosphate from [14C]sedoheptulose 7-phosphate. These findings support the proposed pathway for the conversion of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to l-glycero-d-mannoheptose (Eidels, L., and Osborn, M. J. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1513802600,"Abstract The template specificity of yeast RNA polymerase B (or II) has been investigated using single-stranded homopolymers, helical homopolymers, and alternated copolymers. The enzyme exhibited a remarkable base sequence specificity for single-stranded polynucleotides; only those containing pyrimdine nucleotides were transcribed with (dC)n g (dT)n. Homopolymer pairs were transcribed asymmetrically, the pyrimidine-containing strand acting as template. The best synthetic template was the alternated d(I-C)n copolymer. The results signal a preference by the enzyme for initiating in pyrimidine-rich and (dC)-rich regions of the DNA. The structure of the RNA product was studied with ribonucleases of different specificity, RNases A and Ti, RNase H, and RNase III. It appeared that the dissociation of the RNA product from the template strand was determined by the relative stabilities of the helical structures involved. Net synthesis of RNA was favored by the release of the RNA chain from the template. Among polyribonucleotides, (rC)n was a very efficient template, turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA had some activity, but no other ribopolymer tested was found to have a significant activity. Competition experiments with polyribonucleotides indicated a different specificity with respect to the binding reaction, since (rG)n and (rU)n, which had no template activity, are much better inhibitors of transcription than (rC)n."

https://openalex.org/W1517820984,"Abstract At least two electrophoretically distinct components of hemoglobin, B and C, occur in hemolysates of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana (Aggarwal, S.J., and Riggs, A. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 2372–2383). Component C polymerizes by disulfide bond formation between tetramers, but component B does not. Component C also has a higher oxygen affinity and a smaller Bohr effect than does component B. The amino acid sequence of the first 105 of 141 residues has been determined for the β chain of component C. The sequences of segments of the remaining 35 residues have also been determined. The first 105 residues together with these segments differ in 29 of the 125 identified positions (excluding one deletion and one insertion) from the corresponding segment of the β chain of the European frog, Rana esculenta (CHAUVET, J.-P., AND ACHER, R. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 916–927). This large difference suggests that these frogs, although in the same genus, may have been separated from one another for as long as 150 to 250 x 106 years if the procedure of Dickerson ((1971) J. Mol. Evol. 1, 26–45) is assumed. Alignment of the sequence with that of the human β chain shows that the first 6 residues of the NH2-terminal segment of the human chain are absent in the bullfrog β chain. Among the remainder (125 residues in the bullfrog), 67 of 125 (54%) are identical. In mammalian hemoglobins a hydrogen bond between the imidazole group of the histidyl residue at β146 and the aspartyl residue at β94 appears responsible for about half the Bohr effect. The position corresponding to this aspartyl residue is a glycyl residue at β88 in the bullfrog. Therefore, if the COOH-terminal histidine of the β chain is involved in the Bohr effect it must be hydrogen-bonded to a different residue in unliganded bullfrog hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1967896776,"In this article I have presented data that indicate the feasibility of attaining the five objectives outlined in the introduction. It should be possible to assign genes to specific chromosome regions by (i) selective DNA deletion of a 0.25- to 0.5-micro.m segment of one or both homologous chromosomes, (ii) deletion of one or both entire homologous chromosomes, or (iii) combining cell fusion with selective deletion of whole chromosomes and then deletion of chromosome segments. By laser microirradiation it should be possible to determine which chromosomes and chromosome regions are essential for immediate cell survival by removing from individual cells whole chromosomes, and chromosome segments from each of the chromosomes in the karyotype, and then assessing the cloning efficiency of each cell. For example, we have already determined that removal of one large chromosome No. 1 from PTK(2) cells does not prevent the cell from undergoing a subsequent mitosis. It should also be possible to generate new classes of mutants by damaging small selected areas of DNA with the laser beam and then cloning the irradiated cells-but this has yet to be demonstrated. This procedure might reveal recessive alleles on the nonirradiated homolog, or might result in the direct production of a genetic mutation. Irradiation of identical places on both homologous chromosomes could result in deletion of a genetic locus which ultimately might be detected as a deficiency in a metabolic pathway or some other cellular abnormality. Studies on chromosome stability and DNA constancy can be conducted with laser irradiated cells. For example, the karyotypic analysis of chromosome No. 1 suggests that a cellular mechanism exists to maintain the constancy of this chromosome in both the diploid and tetraploid cell lines. The same approach could be used with each of the chromosomes in the karyotype. Various cytochemical procedures could be used for making quantitative DNA studies of the cells, and chromosome and DNA analyses could be performed at varying times following laser microirradiation. It might also be possible to study the repair of chromosomal damage caused by laser irradiation. The cells could be examined by autoradiographic, cytochemical, and electron microscopy procedures at varying times after irradiation, and because the precise location, time, and nature of the mutational event would be known, subsequent analysis of repair and alteration would be facilitated."

https://openalex.org/W1529969687,"Abstract Sulfhydryl residues in RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli have been reversibly modified by treatment with a thiol reagent, sodium tetrathionate. After extensive reaction periods, 21 sulfhydryl residues of the holoenzyme are modified. Such enzyme preparations do not catalyze templatedependent or -independent synthesis of poly(A-U) or DNA-dependent pyrophosphate exchange reaction. Interactions of the enzyme with nucleoside triphosphates, d(A-T) copolymer, and an inhibitor, rifampicin, are greatly altered, while the binding of another inhibitor, Rose Bengal, is unaffected. Analytical ultracentrifugation of this extensively reacted enzyme shows no disintegration into subunits. However, fluorescence studies with a noncovalent, environmentally-sensitive probe, p-toluidinyl-napthalene-6-sulfonate, reveal that the modified enzyme undergoes conformational alterations as a result of reaction of the sulfhydryl residues. Treatment of holoenzyme with tetrathionate for short time periods produces an enzyme preparation containing an average of 12 modified sulfhydryl residues. This enzyme preparation is almost inactive (l5% initial activity) when assayed with native double-stranded DNA templates; however, it retains 50 to 70% of the initial activity with d(A-T) copolymer, and 70 to 100% of the initial activity with single-stranded DNA templates. The sigma subunit isolated from this modified holoenzyme preparation is fully active, whereas the core enzyme isolated from such preparations shows only slight stimulation by addition of the unmodified sigma subunit. Thus, the main structural defect responsible for the inability of the modified holoenzyme to transcribe DNA resides on the core enzyme. Although sigma subunit may be needed, our results indicate that intact core enzyme is essential for template recognition and specific initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1602041987,"Abstract The fidelity of in vitro transcription of bacteriophage T3 DNA by T3 RNA polymerase and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase have been studied by DNA-RNA hybridization-competition studies with regard to (a) asymmetry of transcription and (b) the region of the T3 DNA transcribed by either polymerase. RNA transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase hybridized exclusively with the H strand of T3 DNA—the only strand that is copied in vivo at all times following T3 phage infection. In contrast, RNA transcribed by E. coli RNA polymerase hybridized with both the H and the L strands of T3 DNA, although a high proportion of RNA chains (g70%) hybridized with the H strand. Approximately 15 to 20% of RNA chains hybridized with the L strand, the strand that does not appear to be copied in vivo. The ratio of H to L strand copying by E. coli polymerase was unaltered by the presence of either excess σ or ρ factor or by changes in the ratio of polymerase to DNA in the reaction mixture. Competition-hybridization studies between RNA synthesized in vitro and RNA isolated after T3 phage infection indicate that RNA transcribed in vitro by T3 RNA polymerase contained all of the sequences present in late in vivo RNA. In addition, all sequences present in early in vivo RNA were also present in in vitro T3 RNA polymerase products. Thus, in vitro, T3 RNA polymerase transcribed the entire early and late regions of the T3 genome. RNA transcribed by E. coli RNA polymerase contained all sequences present in early in vivo RNA. In addition, such in vitro RNA also contained nearly 50% of the sequences present in late in vivo RNA. In contrast, RNA transcribed by E. coli RNA polymerase in the presence of termination factor ρ contained all of the sequences present in early in vivo RNA, but contained very few late RNA sequences. These results demonstrate that E. coli RNA polymerase, in the absence of ρ factor, can read through early termination signals to transcribe part of the late regions. The presence of ρ factor restricts E. coli RNA polymerase to copying primarily early regions. In agreement with the above results, it was observed that RNA synthesized either by T3 RNA polymerase or by E. coli RNA polymerase could direct in vitro synthesis of both early and late T3 phage-specific enzymes—S-adenosylmethionine-cleaving enzyme and lysozyme, respectively—in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system. When RNA transcribed by E. coli RNA polymerase in the presence of ρ factor was used as messenger, lysozyme synthesis was markedly depressed."

The initiation step of protein synthesis appears to be sufficient to cause the conversion of ribosomes to a state more sensitive to colicin E3. Message and protein synthesis are not, however, absolute requirements for the in vitro inactivation of ribosomes by colicin E3. The in vitro inactivation of ribosomes by E3 has a sharp magnesium optimum which correlates well with the magnesium optimum for in vitro protein synthesis. We conclude from these experiments that ribosomes in a state most competent for protein synthesis are most susceptible to inactivation by colicin E3."

Hence, when IF-2 functions catalytically, thiostrepton inhibits fMet-tRNA binding to the ribosome; but when IF-2 functions stoichiometrically, thiostrepton is without effect. Furthermore, thiostrepton inhibits the ribosome-dependent hydrolysis of GTP by IF-2 when hydrolysis is tightly coupled to formation of the initiation complex. In contrast, the antiobiotic has no effect on ribosomedependent uncoupled hydrolysis of GTP catalyzed by IF-2. We conclude that thiostrepton inhibits the initiation reaction by blocking the ribosomal site involved in the dissociation of IF-2 from the 70 S initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1575299778,"Abstract The metabolism of lactose operon mRNA was studied in Escherichia coli after a brief exposure to inducer in glucose medium, removal of inducer, and a shift to fresh glucose medium or to succinate medium (shift-down). Hybridization of labeled mRNA with the DNA of phage λh80dlac was used as an assay for lactose operon mRNA. Decay of lactose operon mRNA proceeded to the same extent and at the same rate (half-life 1 min at 37°) in both cultures. Sedimentation studies on RNA purified from whole cells showed no difference in the size distribution of lactose operon mRNA at 1 or 2 min after inducer removal and a shift to either medium, suggesting that normal propagation of preinitiated lac mRNA chains occurs in the down-shifted culture. Hybridization of mRNA extracted from polyribosomes 1.5 min after inducer removal showed that lac mRNA is associated with smaller polyribosomes and monosomes in the down-shifted culture. This observation supports the hypothesis that the reduced translational yield after shift-down is due to a reduction in the rate of polypeptide chain initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2467105231,"Abstract The production by Escherichia coli of total protein and of β-galactosidase from preformed messenger RNA was measured after inhibition of mRNA initiation and a shift to fresh glucose medium or to succinate medium (shift-down). For total protein, the translational yield in down-shifted cells was about 64% of that in the glucose culture. The polypeptide completion time was the same (18 s) in both cultures, but the functional half-life of mRNA was increased from 2.5 min in the glucose culture to 6.4 min in the succinate culture. For β-galactosidase, the relative translational yield in the down-shifted culture depended on the length of the induction period, ranging from 20% for a 1-min induction up to 61 % for induction of 4.5 min or longer. The polypeptide completion time for β-galactosidase monomers (100 s) and the rate of functional inactivation of β-galactosidase mRNA (half life, 0.95 min) were unaffected by the shift-down. Calculations are presented to show that an 85 to 95 % reduction in the rate of polypeptide chain initiation after shift-down is sufficient to account for the observed relative translational yields of total protein and of β-galactosidase."
