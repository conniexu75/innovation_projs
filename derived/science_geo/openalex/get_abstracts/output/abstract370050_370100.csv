https://openalex.org/W2152119060,"Julie Williams and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for Alzheimer's disease. They identify variants at the CLU and PICALM loci associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease. We undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful AD GWAS to date. In stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (most significant SNP, rs2075650, P = 1.8 × 10−157) and observed genome-wide significant association with SNPs at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the CLU (also known as APOJ) gene (rs11136000, P = 1.4 × 10−9) and 5′ to the PICALM gene (rs3851179, P = 1.9 × 10−8). These associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with Alzheimer's disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, P = 8.5 × 10−10, odds ratio = 0.86; rs3851179, P = 1.3 × 10−9, odds ratio = 0.86)."
https://openalex.org/W1964846007,"The brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway results in the activation of BZR transcription factors to control plant development. The complete pathway is established here, by showing that BR induces the BSU1 phosphatase-dependent inactivation of the GSK3-like kinase BIN2, thereby leading to accumulation of unphosphorylated BZR factors in the nucleus. Brassinosteroid (BR) regulates gene expression and plant development through a receptor kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway1. Despite the identification of many components of this pathway, it remains unclear how the BR signal is transduced from the cell surface to the nucleus2. Here we describe a complete BR signalling pathway by elucidating key missing steps. We show that phosphorylation of BSK1 (BR-signalling kinase 1) by the BR receptor kinase BRI1 (BR-insensitive 1) promotes BSK1 binding to the BSU1 (BRI1 suppressor 1) phosphatase, and BSU1 inactivates the GSK3-like kinase BIN2 (BR-insensitive 2) by dephosphorylating a conserved phospho-tyrosine residue (pTyr 200). Mutations that affect phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of BIN2 pTyr200 (bin2-1, bin2-Y200F and quadruple loss-of-function of BSU1-related phosphatases) support an essential role for BSU1-mediated BIN2 dephosphorylation in BR-dependent plant growth. These results demonstrate direct sequential BR activation of BRI1, BSK1 and BSU1, and inactivation of BIN2, leading to accumulation of unphosphorylated BZR (brassinazole resistant) transcription factors in the nucleus. This study establishes a fully connected BR signalling pathway and provides new insights into the mechanism of GSK3 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1986166279,"During mouse embryonic development, neural progenitors lengthen the G1 phase of the cell cycle and this has been suggested to be a cause, rather than a consequence, of neurogenesis. To investigate whether G1 lengthening alone may cause the switch of cortical progenitors from proliferation to neurogenesis, we manipulated the expression of cdk/cyclin complexes and found that cdk4/cyclinD1 overexpression prevents G1 lengthening without affecting cell growth, cleavage plane, or cell cycle synchrony with interkinetic nuclear migration. Specifically, overexpression of cdk4/cyclinD1 inhibited neurogenesis while increasing the generation and expansion of basal (intermediate) progenitors, resulting in a thicker subventricular zone and larger surface area of the postnatal cortex originating from cdk4/cyclinD1-transfected progenitors. Conversely, lengthening of G1 by cdk4/cyclinD1-RNAi displayed the opposite effects. Thus, G1 lengthening is necessary and sufficient to switch neural progenitors to neurogenesis, and overexpression of cdk4/cyclinD1 can be used to increase progenitor expansion and, perhaps, cortical surface area."

https://openalex.org/W2088230889,"In this study, high-throughput microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis revealed that the expression of miR-140 was associated with chemosensitivity in osteosarcoma tumor xenografts. Tumor cells ectopically transfected with miR-140 were more resistant to methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Overexpression of miR-140 inhibited cell proliferation in both osteosarcoma U-2 OS (wt-p53) and colon cancer HCT 116 (wt-p53) cell lines, but less so in osteosarcoma MG63 (mut-p53) and colon cancer HCT 116 (null-p53) cell lines. miR-140 induced p53 and p21 expression accompanied with G1 and G2 phase arrest only in cell lines containing wild type of p53. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was confirmed to be one of the important targets of miR-140. The expression of endogenous miR-140 was significantly elevated in CD133+hiCD44+hi colon cancer stem-like cells that exhibit slow proliferating rate and chemoresistance. Blocking endogenous miR-140 by locked nucleic acid-modified anti-miR partially sensitized resistant colon cancer stem-like cells to 5-FU treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-140 is involved in the chemoresistance by reduced cell proliferation through G1 and G2 phase arrest mediated in part through the suppression of HDAC4. miR-140 may be a candidate target to develop novel therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2166338743,"The authors show long-term potentiation at the hippocampal CA3–CA1 synapse is modulated by EphA4 in the postsynaptic CA1 neuron and by ephrin-A3, an EphA4 ligand, in astrocytes, through their regulation of glial glutamate transporters. These results suggest EphA4/ephrin-A3 signaling as a mechanism for astrocytic regulation of synaptic plasticity. Astrocytes are critical participants in synapse development and function, but their role in synaptic plasticity is unclear. Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands have been suggested to regulate neuron-glia interactions, and EphA4-mediated ephrin reverse signaling is required for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Here we show that long-term potentiation (LTP) at the CA3–CA1 synapse is modulated by EphA4 in the postsynaptic CA1 cell and by ephrin-A3, a ligand of EphA4 that is found in astrocytes. Lack of EphA4 increased the abundance of glial glutamate transporters, and ephrin-A3 modulated transporter currents in astrocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of glial glutamate transporters rescued the LTP defects in EphA4 (Epha4) and ephrin-A3 (Efna3) mutant mice. Transgenic overexpression of ephrin-A3 in astrocytes reduces glutamate transporter levels and produces focal dendritic swellings possibly caused by glutamate excitotoxicity. These results suggest that EphA4/ephrin-A3 signaling is a critical mechanism for astrocytes to regulate synaptic function and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2201926879,"Integrins regulate adhesion-dependent growth, survival and invasion of tumor cells. In particular, expression of integrin αvβ3 is associated with progression of a variety of human tumors. Here we reveal a previously undescribed adhesion-independent role for integrin αvβ3 in pancreatic cancer and other carcinomas. Specifically, αvβ3 expressed in carcinoma cells enhanced anchorage-independent tumor growth in vitro and increased lymph node metastases in vivo. These effects required recruitment of c-Src to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail, leading to c-Src activation, Crk-associated substrate (CAS) phosphorylation and tumor cell survival that, unexpectedly, was independent of cell adhesion or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Pharmacological blockade of c-Src kinase activity or decreased expression of endogenous αvβ3 integrin or c-Src not only inhibited anchorage-independent growth but also suppressed metastasis in vivo, yet these manipulations did not affect tumor cell migration or invasion. These data define an unexpected role for an integrin as a mediator of anchorage independence, suggesting that an αvβ3–c-Src signaling module may account for the aggressive behavior of integrin αvβ3–expressing tumors in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2029005510,Physiological and premature ageing are characterized by multiple defects in chromatin structure and accumulation of persistent DNA damage. Here we identify the NURD chromatin remodelling complex as a key modulator of these ageing-associated chromatin defects. We demonstrate loss of several NURD components during premature and normal ageing and we find an ageing-associated reduction in HDAC1 activity. Silencing of individual NURD subunits recapitulated chromatin defects associated with ageing and we provide evidence that structural chromatin defects precede DNA damage accumulation. These results outline a molecular mechanism for chromatin defects during ageing.
https://openalex.org/W1973562117,"An elevated proteasome activity contributes to tumorigenesis, particularly by providing cancer cells with antiapoptotic protection and efficient clearance from irregular proteins. Still, the underlying mechanisms are poorly known. In this study, we report that in colon cancer patients, higher proteasome activity was detected in tumoral tissue compared with surrounding normal tissue, and also that increased levels of proteasomal subunit proteins, such as S5a/PSMD4 and α-5/PSMA5, could be detected. Colon tumors showed higher nuclear levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor supposed to be involved in the control of proteasomal subunit protein expression. The induction or overexpression of Nrf2 led to stronger S5a and α-5 expression in the human colon cancer cell lines, Colo320 and Lovo, as well as in NCM460 colonocytes along with higher proteasome activity. The small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Nrf2 knockdown decreased S5a and α-5 expression and reduced proteasome activity. Additionally, Nrf2-dependent S5a and α-5 expression conferred protection from tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis, an effect preceded by an increased nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and higher expression of antiapoptotic NF-κB target genes. These findings point to an important role of Nrf2 in the gain of proteasome activity, thereby contributing to colorectal carcinogenesis. Nrf2 may therefore serve as a potential target in anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2055589857,"Physiological oxidants that are generated by activated phagocytes comprise the main source of oxidative stress during inflammation. Oxidants such as taurine chloramine (TnCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) can damage proteins and induce apoptosis, but the role of specific protein oxidation in this process has not been defined. We found that the actin-binding protein cofilin is a key target of oxidation. When oxidation of this single regulatory protein is prevented, oxidant-induced apoptosis is inhibited. Oxidation of cofilin causes it to lose its affinity for actin and to translocate to the mitochondria, where it induces swelling and cytochrome c release by mediating opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). This occurs independently of Bax activation and requires both oxidation of cofilin Cys residues and dephosphorylation at Ser 3. Knockdown of endogenous cofilin using targeted siRNA inhibits oxidant-induced apoptosis, which is restored by re-expression of wild-type cofilin but not by cofilin containing Cys to Ala mutations. Exposure of cofilin to TnCl results in intramolecular disulphide bonding and oxidation of Met residues to Met sulphoxide, but only Cys oxidation causes cofilin to induce mitochondrial damage."
https://openalex.org/W2066123991,"Mechanisms governing muscle satellite cell withdrawal from cell cycle to enter into quiescence remain poorly understood. We studied the role of angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and its receptor Tie-2 in the regulation of myogenic precursor cell (mpc) fate. In human and mouse, Tie-2 was preferentially expressed by quiescent satellite cells in vivo and reserve cells (RCs) in vitro. Ang1/Tie-2 signaling, through ERK1/2 pathway, decreased mpc proliferation and differentiation, increased the number of cells in G0, increased expression of RC-associated markers (p130, Pax7, Myf-5, M-cadherin), and downregulated expression of differentiation-associated markers. Silencing Tie-2 had opposite effects. Cells located in the satellite cell neighborhood (smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts) upregulated RC-associated markers by secreting Ang1 in vitro. In vivo, Tie-2 blockade and Ang1 overexpression increased the number of cycling and quiescent satellite cells, respectively. We propose that Ang1/Tie-2 signaling regulates mpc self-renewal by controlling the return to quiescence of a subset of satellite cells.

We propose that Ang1/Tie-2 signaling regulates mpc self-renewal by controlling the return to quiescence of a subset of satellite cells. Adult skeletal muscle has a remarkable regenerative potential, which is mainly attributable to a population of precursors called satellite cells. In normal adult muscle, satellite cells are quiescent (Hawke and Garry, 2001Hawke T.J. Garry D.J. Myogenic satellite cells: physiology to molecular biology.J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 534-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The ability of satellite cells to respond to both the routine turnover of myonuclei and muscle regeneration indicates that mechanisms must be in place to maintain a viable satellite cell pool throughout adult life span (Zammit et al., 2006Zammit P.S. Partridge T.A. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. The skeletal muscle satellite cell: the stem cell that came in from the cold.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In vivo evidence of satellite cell self-renewal was obtained using grafts of intact single isolated myofibers into muscle (Collins et al., 2005Collins C.A. Olsen I. Zammit P.S. Heslop L. Petrie A. Partridge T.A. Morgan J.E. Stem cell function, self-renewal, and behavioral heterogeneity of cells from the adult muscle satellite cell niche.Cell. 2005; 122: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) or fresh isolated quiescent satellite cells (Montarras et al., 2005Montarras D.

Direct isolation of satellite cells for skeletal muscle regeneration.Science. 2005; 309: 2064-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Ex vivo studies on isolated myofibers showed that after activation and proliferation, a small number of myogenic precursor cells (mpcs) do not undergo terminal differentiation, but retain the ability to restore the reserve pool of quiescent progenitor cells by a direct self-renewal (Zammit et al., 2004Zammit P.S. Golding J.P. Nagata Y. Hudon V. Partridge T.A. Beauchamp J.R. Muscle satellite cells adopt divergent fates: a mechanism for self-renewal?.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), probably involving asymmetric division (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S. Kuroda K. Le Grand F.

In cultures of myogenic cells, a subpopulation also constitutes the “reserve cells” (RCs); these noncycling undifferentiated cells may further give rise to both differentiated and new RCs, sharing many characteristics with muscle satellite cells (Beauchamp et al., 2000Beauchamp J.R.

Activated proliferating satellite cells/mpcs coexpress Pax7 and MyoD transcription factors. At time of differentiation, while the majority of mpcs exits the cell cycle to enter terminal myogenic differentiation and fuses into myotubes, the RC pool downregulates MyoD expression, maintains high levels of Pax7 expression, and is in the G0 phase (Kitzmann et al., 1998Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. The muscle regulatory factors MyoD and myf-5 undergo distinct cell cycle-specific expression in muscle cells.J.

Consequently, satellite cells, or at least a subset of them, are now considered as myogenic stem cells (Collins et al., 2005Collins C.A. Olsen I. Zammit P.S. Heslop L. Petrie A. Partridge T.A.

The mechanisms controlling the withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle to enter into terminal differentiation have been studied, while exit from the cell cycle to enter in the quiescence state remains poorly understood. In mice, several markers have been associated with quiescent satellite cells, including M-cadherin (Beauchamp et al., 2000Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A.

Rudnicki M.A. Asymmetric self-renewal and commitment of satellite stem cells in muscle.Cell. 2007; 129: 999-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). A large number of effectors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of myogenic cells, but few have been identified as direct regulators of quiescence and self-renewal of satellite/myogenic cells: in human cultures, p130 from the Rb family is involved in the RC pool constitution by blocking cell-cycle progression and differentiation (Carnac et al., 2000Carnac G. Fajas L. L'Honore A. Sardet C. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. The retinoblastoma-like protein p130 is involved in the determination of reserve cells in differentiating myoblasts.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mice, Pax7 transcription factor is required for satellite cell maintenance and acquisition of a quiescent undifferentiated state (Olguin and Olwin, 2004Olguin H.C. Olwin B.B.

Pax7 directs postnatal renewal and propagation of myogenic satellite cells but not their specification.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Calcium signaling, via calcineurin and NFAT, upregulates Myf5 expression in quiescent RCs at time of fate choice between self-renewal and myogenic differentiation (Friday and Pavlath, 2001Friday B.B. Pavlath G.K. A calcineurin- and NFAT-dependent pathway regulates Myf5 gene expression in skeletal muscle reserve cells.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 303-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt and Notch signalings are crucial regulators of mpc proliferation and differentiation that are finely regulated with time (Brack et al., 2008Brack A.S. Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Shen J. Rando T.A. A temporal switch from notch to wnt signaling in muscle stem cells is necessary for normal adult myogenesis.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 50-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Their role in myogenic cell self-renewal is not yet deciphered, although Notch activation alters RC recruitment into myotubes (Kitzmann et al., 2006Kitzmann M. Bonnieu A. Duret C. Vernus B. Barro M. Laoudj-Chenivesse D. Verdi J.M. Carnac G. Inhibition of Notch signaling induces myotube hypertrophy by recruiting a subpopulation of reserve cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and β-catenin promotes self-renewal of satellite cells, likely through wnt pathway (Perez-Ruiz et al., 2008Perez-Ruiz A. Ono Y. Gnocchi V.F. Zammit P.S. {beta}-catenin promotes self-renewal of skeletal-muscle satellite cells.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In adult normal skeletal muscle, satellite cells are located close to capillaries (Christov et al., 2007Christov C. Chretien F. Abou-Khalil R. Bassez G. Vallet G. Authier F.J. Bassaglia Y. Shinin V. Tajbakhsh S. Chazaud B. et al.Muscle satellite cells and endothelial cells: close neighbors and privileged partners.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In vitro, we have shown that endothelial cells (ECs) and mpcs have privileged interactions and may act in a paracrine way (Christov et al., 2007Christov C. Chretien F. Abou-Khalil R. Bassez G. Vallet G. Authier F.J. Bassaglia Y. Shinin V. Tajbakhsh S. Chazaud B. et al.Muscle satellite cells and endothelial cells: close neighbors and privileged partners.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). One of the main molecular systems regulating vascular homeostasis is the angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie system (Shim et al., 2007Shim W.S. Ho I.A. Wong P.E. Angiopoietin: a TIE(d) balance in tumor angiogenesis.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ang1 binding to its tyrosine kinase Tie-2 endothelial receptor is required to maintain vascular integrity while Ang2 behaves as a context-dependent agonistic or antagonistic Tie-2 ligand (Shim et al., 2007Shim W.S. Ho I.A. Wong P.E. Angiopoietin: a TIE(d) balance in tumor angiogenesis.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ang1/Tie-2 system is a pleiotropic system because it has been involved in various biological activities, including cell survival, proliferation, migration, chemotaxis, and quiescence (Fiedler and Augustin, 2006Fiedler U. Augustin H.G. Angiopoietins: a link between angiogenesis and inflammation.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 552-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, Shim et al., 2007Shim W.S. Ho I.A. Wong P.E. Angiopoietin: a TIE(d) balance in tumor angiogenesis.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is involved in the quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs): osteoblast-secreted Ang1 binds to Tie-2 borne by HSCs to promote their survival and maintenance in G0 (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In migrating ECs, matrix-Ang1 bound to Tie-2 induces cell-matrix contacts involving ERK signaling, while in contacting ECs, Ang1/Tie-2 forms homotypic cell:cell interactions involving Akt signaling (Fukuhara et al., 2008Fukuhara S. Sako K. Minami T. Noda K. Kim H.Z. Kodama T. Shibuya M. Takakura N. Koh G.Y. Mochizuki N.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This indicates that signaling triggered by Ang1/Tie-2 may differ in the same cell according to the status of the cell and its environment. Here, we explored the role of Ang1/Tie-2 signaling in the regulation of myogenic cell fate by using human cell culture system, in vivo labeling analyses, and murine strains allowing the tracing of specific cell lineages. We showed that Ang1 and Tie-2 are strongly expressed in quiescent undifferentiated RCs. We used several strategies to alter Ang1/Tie-2 signaling, and further analyzed myogenic cell fate (differentiation versus quiescence) to identify a new role for Ang1/Tie-2 interaction in the self-renewal of myogenic cells that proceeds in vitro and ex vivo on isolated myofibers. Ang1 binding to Tie-2 induces myogenic cells toward the RC status and is expressed by the most quiescent satellite cells in skeletal muscle in vivo. Finally, in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies confirmed the role of Ang1/Tie-2 in the regulation of satellite cell quiescence in skeletal muscle. Expression of Angs and Tie-2 was analyzed in cultured human mpcs at various stages of differentiation (Chazaud et al., 2003Chazaud B. Sonnet C. Lafuste P. Bassez G. Rimaniol A.C. Poron F. Authier F.J. Dreyfus P.A. Gherardi R.K. Satellite cells attract monocytes and use macrophages as a support to escape apoptosis and enhance muscle growth.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and, in differentiated cultures, in multinucleated myotubes (MTs) and RCs (that accounted for about 15%–20% of the cells and did not express MyoD) (Figure S1C). As expected, Pax7 expression decreased as cells differentiated and was higher in RCs compared to MTs (38-fold more, p < 0.05) (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Ang1 expression decreased with differentiation (p < 0.05) and was upregulated in RCs (4.2-fold more than in MTs, p < 0.05) (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Tie2 expression increased with differentiation (p < 0.05) and was more expressed in RCs compared to MTs (2.5-fold more, p < 0.05) (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Ang2 was expressed at a very low level at all stages (Figure S1A), while Tie-1 was not expressed by human mpcs (data not shown). Flow cytometry experiments confirmed the expression of Tie-2 at the surface of human mpcs: at day 4, 42.3 ± 10.3% of cells expressed Tie-2 while in RCs, 80.9 ± 9.3% of cells expressed Tie-2 (p < 0.01) (example is shown in Figure 1B). Cultured human mpcs were sorted based on their cell-cycle status (Figure 1C). Compared to G2/M fraction, G0 cells expressed higher levels of Tie-2 (4-fold more, p < 0.0005) and Pax7 (p < 0.05) and lower levels of MyoD (p < 0.001) (Figure 1C). Quiescent human satellite cells were isolated from normal adult muscle by magnetic cell sorting based on the surface marker CD56 and analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. CD56/NCAM is a reliable marker for quiescent satellite cells in normal human muscle (Illa et al., 1992Illa I. Leon-Monzon M. Dalakas M.C. Regenerating and denervated human muscle fibers and satellite cells express neural cell adhesion molecule recognized by monoclonal antibodies to natural killer cells.Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Human-muscle-derived CD56+ cells expressed Pax7 and also expressed Tie-2 and Ang1, as do the CD56− fractions that contain ECs and periECs (CD45−) and macrophages (CD45+) that are both Pax7− (Figure S1B). The CD56− fraction was further sorted into CD31+ and CD31− fractions. RT-qPCR results showed that CD56−CD31+, which corresponded to ECs, expressed 2-fold more Tie-2 than CD56+/satellite cells (Figure 1D). Finally, sorted CD56+ were analyzed by flow cytometry, and about 80% of sorted cells expressed Tie-2 at their surface (Figure 1E), confirming Tie-2 expression by satellite cells in vivo. Ang1 inhibited mpc growth (p < 0.0001): at day 8, mpc density was decreased by 32% compared to control (Figure 2A). Tie-2 competitor Tie-2Fc totally inhibited the effect of Ang1, suggesting that Ang1's effect was mediated by its receptor Tie-2 (Figure 2A). Ang2 had no effect on mpc growth (Figure 2A). Ang1 exerts an antiapoptotic effect on various cell types (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, Shim et al., 2007Shim W.S. Ho I.A. Wong P.E. Angiopoietin: a TIE(d) balance in tumor angiogenesis.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ang1 protected mpcs from staurosporine-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent way (p < 0.0001), 51% of protection being observed at 500 ng/ml (Figure 2B). Here, again, Tie-2Fc totally abolished Ang1's effect (Figure 2C). Addition of Ang1 decreased the number of Ki67+ cells by 66% (p < 0.05), indicating an inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure 3A). Accordingly, cyclin D1 expression was decreased by 44% (p < 0.005) in the presence of Ang1 (Figure S2A). The number of both myogenin+ cells and of myotubes was strongly reduced in the presence of Ang1 (by 75% [p < 0.05] and 85% [p < 0.001], respectively) (Figure 3B and Figure S2B). Addition of Tie-2Fc totally abolished the effects of Ang1 on proliferation and differentiation (Figures 3A and 3B and Figures S2A and S2B). In the absence of reliable anti-human Pax7 antibody, we performed RT-qPCR analyses of various markers associated with either mpc differentiation or self-renewal. In whole mpc cultures, Ang1 treatment increased both Pax7 and p130 expression (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively) and decreased both MyoD and p57 expression (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively) (Figure 3C). We analyzed the mpc cell-cycle status in the presence of Ang1 and showed that the number of cells in G0 increased significantly from day 4, from 5% to 25%, and did not further increase afterward (p < 0.05) (Figure 3D). These results indicate that Ang1 favored the entry into quiescence and the appearance of RCs in mpc cultures. We further studied the effect of Ang1 by the analysis of myogenic cell fate on isolated mouse single myofibers according to their expression of Pax7 and MyoD (Zammit et al., 2004Zammit P.S. Golding J.P. Nagata Y. Hudon V. Partridge T.A. Beauchamp J.R. Muscle satellite cells adopt divergent fates: a mechanism for self-renewal?.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Although at early time of activation, Pax7+/MyoD− cells may represent early differentiating cells, 3 days after activation, Pax7+/MyoD− cells are considered as self-renewing cells (Zammit et al., 2004Zammit P.S. Golding J.P. Nagata Y. Hudon V. Partridge T.A. Beauchamp J.R. Muscle satellite cells adopt divergent fates: a mechanism for self-renewal?.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Ang1 increased the number of Pax7+/MyoD− cells by 10% and decreased the number of Pax7−/MyoD+ cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 3E) in the clusters. Addition of Tie-2Fc reversed the effect of Ang1 (Figure 3E). Ang1 effect on mpc growth and entry into G0 was noticeable from day 4 of culture, suggesting that mpcs are responsive to Ang1 signaling only at a given time. We added Ang1 at day 4 and found that Ang1 provoked the same response when added at day 0 or day 4 (Figures 3A and 3B). In the experiments below, Ang1 treatment was performed at day 4, and analyses were performed at day 5. Tie-2 expression was inhibited by two different small interference RNAs (siRNA) in a dose-dependent way (p < 0.05) (Figure 4Aa and Figure S2C). In whole mpc cultures, Pax7 and p130 expression was inhibited in a dose dependent way (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) (Figure 4Aa and Figure S2C). Inversely, MyoD and p57 expression was increased (p < 0.05) (Figure 4Aa and Figure S2C). Accordingly, the number of Ki67+ cells, of myogenin+ cells, and of myotubes was increased in the presence of Tie-2 siRNA (p < 0.005, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively) (Figure 4Ab). These data show that expression of Tie-2 was required for proper signaling of Ang1 to induce the appearance of RCs and that Ang1 binding to its Tie-2 receptor was required to commit responsive mpcs toward quiescence. In whole mpc cultures, Tie-2 overexpression induced an increase in Pax7 and p130 expression (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), and inversely, a decrease in MyoD and p57 expression (p < 0.05) (Figure 4Ba). The number of Ki67+ cells, of myogenin+ cells, and of myotubes was decreased by Tie-2 overexpression (p < 0.05) (Figure 4Bb). These data show that overexpression of Tie-2 was associated with the increase of RCs within mpc culture, suggesting that endogenous Ang1 was sufficient to trigger a cell response when the receptor is overexpressed. Indeed, addition of Ang1 to overexpressing Tie-2 mpcs did not amplify the response of the cells (data not shown). We investigated the signaling pathway triggered by Tie-2 binding using a Proteome Profiler Array (Figure S3A). Figure 5A shows that mpc treatment with Ang1 elicited a time-dependent increase in P-ERK1/2 protein level that reached a maximum at 10 min. We confirmed by western blot that Ang1/Tie-2 triggered only ERK1/2 signaling and not Akt signaling (Figures S3B and S3C). Addition of Tie-2Fc inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 5A). U0126, a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, an upstream effector of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, also abolished Ang1-induced ERK1/2 activation (Figure 5A). Inhibiting ERK1/2 signaling with U0126 almost totally inhibited the Ang1-induced expression of Ang1 and Tie-2 (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B), and also that of Pax7 (p < 0.005) whereas it restored that of MyoD (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B). Myf5 has also been shown to be upregulated in RCs (Friday and Pavlath, 2001Friday B.B. Pavlath G.K. A calcineurin- and NFAT-dependent pathway regulates Myf5 gene expression in skeletal muscle reserve cells.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 303-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Ang1 treatment markedly increased Myf5 expression (p < 0.05) that was inhibited by U0126 (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B). M-cadherin is expressed by quiescent satellite cells in vivo (Irintchev et al., 1994Irintchev A. Zeschnigk M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wernig A. Expression pattern of M-cadherin in normal, denervated, and regenerating mouse muscles.Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that M-cadherin was expressed at a higher level by RCs compared to day 4 mpcs (1.75-fold) or MTs (4.5-fold) (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B, insert). Ang1 treatment strongly increased M-cadherin expression (p < 0.05); this upregulation was totally impaired by inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B). These results show that Ang1/Tie-2 activated ERK1/2 signaling pathway that triggered expression of genes associated with the RC status. Transcription factors of the ETS family are involved in Ang/Tie gene regulation (Brown et al., 2004Brown C. Gaspar J. Pettit A. Lee R. Gu X. Wang H. Manning C. Voland C. Goldring S.R. Goldring M.B. et al.ESE-1 is a novel transcriptional mediator of angiopoietin-1 expression in the setting of inflammation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12794-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among these factors, ESE-1 has been shown to interact with Ang1 promoter and NERF-2 and ELF-1 have been shown to bind Tie-2 promoter and to stimulate Ang/Tie expression (Christensen et al., 2002Christensen R.A. Fujikawa K. Madore R. Oettgen P. Varticovski L. NERF2, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, is increased in response to hypoxia and angiopoietin-1: a potential mechanism for Tie2 regulation during hypoxia.J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ang1 stimulates Tie-2 expression via increased expression of NERF-2 (Christensen et al., 2002Christensen R.A. Fujikawa K. Madore R. Oettgen P. Varticovski L. NERF2, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, is increased in response to hypoxia and angiopoietin-1: a potential mechanism for Tie2 regulation during hypoxia.J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In human mpcs, both Ang1 and Tie-2 expressions were upregulated upon Ang1 treatment (p < 0.005) (Figure 6A). Upregulation of Tie-2 expression was confirmed at protein level by flow cytometry analysis: 2.3-fold more myogenic cells expressed Tie-2 at their surface after Ang1 addition (p < 0.05) (Figure 6Ab). Ang1 treatment also increased ESE-1, NERF-2, and ELF-1 expression in mpc cultures (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively) (Figure 6Aa), in accordance with a positive regulation loop. This effect was specific because other members of the ETS family were not upregulated in myogenic cells by Ang1 treatment (Figure S4A). It is important to note that addition of U0126 inhibited Ang1-induced expression of ESE-1, NERF-2, and ELF-1 (data not shown), indicating that ERK1/2 signaling pathway also regulated expression of these ETS transcription factors. We have previously shown that the majority of satellite cells are close to capillaries (Christov et al., 2007Christov C. Chretien F. Abou-Khalil R. Bassez G. Vallet G. Authier F.J. Bassaglia Y.

We have engineered the PiggyBac transposable element to create an efficient system for gene delivery in hESCs. This redesigned system, named ""ePiggyBac,"" can deliver up to 18 Kb inserts, and transgene expression is observed in almost 90% of hES cells. ePiggyBac transposons can also carry insulators, inducible expression cassettes, and short hairpin RNAs for gain- and loss-of-function approaches. In hES cells, ePiggyBac's efficiency is superior to that of viral vectors and previously described transposons, including other PiggyBac-based systems. In addition, ePiggyBac transgenes can be removed from the hESC genome without leaving any mutation. We used this system to direct hESC differentiation toward a neuronal phenotype. We then removed the transposons to obtain transgene-free neuronal precursors and neurons. The ability to create fully reversible genetic modifications represents an important step toward clinical applications of hESCs."

We found that activation of Epac2, a PKA-independent cAMP target and Rap guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), in cultured rat cortical neurons induced spine shrinkage, increased spine motility, removed synaptic GluR2/3-containing AMPA receptors and depressed excitatory transmission, whereas its inhibition promoted spine enlargement and stabilization. Epac2 was required for dopamine D1-like receptor-dependent spine shrinkage and GluR2 removal from spines. Epac2 interaction with neuroligin promoted its membrane recruitment and enhanced its GEF activity. Rare missense mutations in the EPAC2 (also known as RAPGEF4) gene, previously found in individuals with autism, affected basal and neuroligin-stimulated GEF activity, dendritic Rap signaling, synaptic protein distribution and spine morphology. Thus, we identify a previously unknown mechanism that promotes dynamic remodeling and depression of spiny synapses, disruption of which may contribute to some aspects of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051672813,"Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1). Ppt1 knockout mice display hallmarks of INCL and mimic the human pathology: accumulation of lipofuscin, degeneration of CNS neurons, and a shortened life span. Purified non-genetically modified human CNS stem cells, grown as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns), were transplanted into the brains of immunodeficient Ppt1(-/)(-) mice where they engrafted robustly, migrated extensively, and produced sufficient levels of PPT1 to alter host neuropathology. Grafted mice displayed reduced autofluorescent lipofuscin, significant neuroprotection of host hippocampal and cortical neurons, and delayed loss of motor coordination. Early intervention with cellular transplants of hCNS-SCns into the brains of INCL patients may supply a continuous and long-lasting source of the missing PPT1 and provide some therapeutic benefit through protection of endogenous neurons. These data provide the experimental basis for human clinical trials with these banked hCNS-SCns."

https://openalex.org/W2023101194,"Hallmarks of malignant melanoma are its propensity to metastasize and its resistance to treatment, giving patients with advanced disease a poor prognosis. The transition of melanoma from non-invasive radial growth phase (RGP) to invasive and metastatically competent vertical growth phase (VGP) is a major step in tumor progression, yet the mechanisms governing this transformation are unknown. Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is highly expressed by VGP melanomas, and is thought to contribute to melanoma progression by degrading type I collagen within the skin to facilitate melanoma invasion. Protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) is activated by MMP-1, and is also expressed by VGP melanomas. However, the effects of MMP-1 signaling through PAR-1 have not been examined in melanoma. Here, we demonstrate that an MMP-1/PAR-1 signaling axis exists in VGP melanoma, and is necessary for melanoma invasion. Introduction of MMP-1 into RGP melanoma cells induced gene expression associated with tumor progression and promoted invasion in vitro, and enhanced tumor growth and conferred metastatic capability in vivo. This study demonstrates that both the type I collagenase and PAR-1 activating functions of MMP-1 are required for melanoma progression, and suggests that MMP-1 may be a major contributor to the transformation of melanoma from non-invasive to malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069149753,"Aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthases (aaPGSs) are multiple peptide resistance factors that transfer amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNAs to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in the cytoplasmic membrane. Aminoacylation of PG is used by bacteria to decrease the net negative charge of the cell envelope, diminishing affinity for charged molecules and allowing for adaptation to environmental changes. Lys-PGS, which transfers lysine to PG, is essential for the virulence of certain pathogens, providing resistance to both host cationic antimicrobial peptides and therapeutic antibiotics. Ala-PGS was also recently described, but little is known about the possible activities of other members of the highly diverse aaPGS family of proteins. Systematic deletion of the predicted membrane-inserted domains of several aaPGSs revealed that the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain alone is sufficient for aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol transferase catalytic activity. In contrast to previously characterized aaPGSs, the Enterococcus faecium enzyme used an expanded repertoire of amino acids to modify PG with Ala, Arg, or Lys. Reexamination of previously characterized aaPGSs also revealed broader than anticipated substrate specificity, for example Bacillus subtilis Lys-PGS was shown to also catalyze Ala-PG synthesis. The relaxed substrate specificities of these aaPGSs allows for more elaborate remodeling of membrane lipids than previously thought, potentially providing bacteria that harbor these enzymes resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and environmental stresses.

The relaxed substrate specificities of these aaPGSs allows for more elaborate remodeling of membrane lipids than previously thought, potentially providing bacteria that harbor these enzymes resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and environmental stresses. To adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as those encountered during host infection, bacteria must alter the properties of their cellular envelope by adjusting the composition and abundance of their membrane lipids. Bacteria choose from a variety of lipid components that vary in fatty acid chain length and saturation levels and that bear a repertoire of different polar head groups. Aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthases (aaPGSs) 2The abbreviations used are: aaPGSaminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthaseaa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAAla-RSalanyl-tRNA synthetaseArg-RSarginyl-tRNA synthetaseLys-RSlysyl-tRNA synthetasePGphosphatidylglycerol. 2The abbreviations used are: aaPGSaminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthaseaa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAAla-RSalanyl-tRNA synthetaseArg-RSarginyl-tRNA synthetaseLys-RSlysyl-tRNA synthetasePGphosphatidylglycerol. are enzymes embedded within the bacterial membrane that are responsible for the transfer of amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the polar head groups of phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Addition of amino acids to membrane PG is a critical mechanism evolved by bacteria to decrease the net negative charge of the cell membrane (1Roy H. Dare K. Ibba M. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This alteration of charge diminishes the membrane affinity for cationic antimicrobial peptides used by the host immune system (i.e. defensins), and for other bactericidal agents (2Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. Van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). During infection, aaPGSs have been shown to be essential for the virulence of several pathogenic microorganisms by facilitating the evasion of antibiotic activity. Their role in virulence and their broad distribution in bacterial species make aaPGSs attractive targets for new therapeutic strategies to combat pathogenic microbes.Lys-PG in the membrane allows for the evasion of neutrophils and enhances the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus both in mice (3Staubitz P. Neumann H. Schneider T. Wiedemann I. Peschel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 231: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and in endovascular infection of rabbits (4Weidenmaier C. Peschel A.

Similar observations were made for Listeria monocytogenes, in which Lys-PG enhances infectivity of epithelial cells and macrophages in mice (5Thedieck K. Hain T. Mohamed W. Tindall B.J. Nimtz M.

Moreover, Lys-PG provides S. aureus with resistance to other classes of cationic bactericidal agents such as vancomycin (glycopeptide) and daptomycin (lipopeptide) (7Nishi H. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara T. McCallum N. Sugai M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Cui L. Tominaga E. Neoh H.M. Hiramatsu K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), which are often used as a last resort to treat infections. A new aaPGS with altered specificity was recently discovered in Clostridium perfringens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9Roy H. Ibba M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4667-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Klein S. Lorenzo C. Hoffmann S. Walther J.M. Storbeck S. Piekarski T. Tindall B.J. Wray V. Nimtz M. Moser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This enzyme, Ala-PGS, is responsible for the formation of Ala-PG in the membrane. Despite the net neutral charge of Ala-PG, this modification has been shown to enhance bacterial resistance to certain cationic antimicrobial peptides (10Klein S. Lorenzo C. Hoffmann S. Walther J.M. Storbeck S. Piekarski T. Tindall B.J. Wray V. Nimtz M. Moser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both Lys-PG and Ala-PG have also been shown to enhance the resistance of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to several negatively charged β-lactams (e.g. oxacillin, methicillin, cefsulodin) (7Nishi H. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara T. McCallum N. Sugai M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Klein S. Lorenzo C. Hoffmann S. Walther J.M.

Labischinski H. Sugai M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 49-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These latter findings suggest that aaPGs confer antibiotic resistance both by diminishing the net negative charge of the membrane and by modulating more general biophysical properties such as membrane fluidity and permeability (12Mishra N.N.

In addition, aaPGs not only decrease membrane permeability to cationic antimicrobial peptides, but also to protons and osmolytes (e.g. lactate), providing bacteria with resistance to challenging osmotic or acidic growth conditions such as those encountered during fermentative growth (10Klein S.

To date, 348 putative aaPGS genes in 213 distinct species have been identified in 96 different genera of microorganisms, covering almost all known groups of bacteria. Also, 49 of the available genome sequences encode two or more aaPGS paralogs. This dual occurrence is most often encountered in Gram-positive bacteria, particularly in members of the Actinobacteria class (e.g. Mycobacterium, Streptomyces, etc.). Here, we describe structure/function-based assignment of aaPGS catalytic domains that subsequently allowed us to identify new amino acid specificities of PG aminoacylation. The coexistence of several such activities in the same organism expands the set of unique aaPGSs that are available for tuning of membrane properties and may provide these bacteria with resistance to a far broader spectrum of antimicrobial agents and environmental conditions than previously appreciated. In addition, our work shows that although some aaPGSs display strict substrate specificity (e.g. Lys-PGS from C. perfringens), some aaPGSs display relaxed substrate specificity in vitro. For example, Enterococcus faecium aaPGS exhibits a triple specificity for Ala-, Arg-, and Lys-tRNA, and Bacillus subtilis displays a dual specificity for Lys- and, Ala-tRNA. To adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as those encountered during host infection, bacteria must alter the properties of their cellular envelope by adjusting the composition and abundance of their membrane lipids. Bacteria choose from a variety of lipid components that vary in fatty acid chain length and saturation levels and that bear a repertoire of different polar head groups. Aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthases (aaPGSs) 2The abbreviations used are: aaPGSaminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthaseaa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAAla-RSalanyl-tRNA synthetaseArg-RSarginyl-tRNA synthetaseLys-RSlysyl-tRNA synthetasePGphosphatidylglycerol. 2The abbreviations used are: aaPGSaminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthaseaa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAAla-RSalanyl-tRNA synthetaseArg-RSarginyl-tRNA synthetaseLys-RSlysyl-tRNA synthetasePGphosphatidylglycerol. are enzymes embedded within the bacterial membrane that are responsible for the transfer of amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the polar head groups of phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Addition of amino acids to membrane PG is a critical mechanism evolved by bacteria to decrease the net negative charge of the cell membrane (1Roy H. Dare K. Ibba M. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This alteration of charge diminishes the membrane affinity for cationic antimicrobial peptides used by the host immune system (i.e. defensins), and for other bactericidal agents (2Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. Van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). During infection, aaPGSs have been shown to be essential for the virulence of several pathogenic microorganisms by facilitating the evasion of antibiotic activity. Their role in virulence and their broad distribution in bacterial species make aaPGSs attractive targets for new therapeutic strategies to combat pathogenic microbes. aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthase aminoacyl-tRNA alanyl-tRNA synthetase arginyl-tRNA synthetase lysyl-tRNA synthetase phosphatidylglycerol. aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol synthase aminoacyl-tRNA alanyl-tRNA synthetase arginyl-tRNA synthetase lysyl-tRNA synthetase phosphatidylglycerol. Lys-PG in the membrane allows for the evasion of neutrophils and enhances the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus both in mice (3Staubitz P. Neumann H. Schneider T. Wiedemann I. Peschel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 231: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and in endovascular infection of rabbits (4Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Kempf V.A. Lucindo N. Yeaman M.R. Bayer A.S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 8033-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made for Listeria monocytogenes, in which Lys-PG enhances infectivity of epithelial cells and macrophages in mice (5Thedieck K. Hain T. Mohamed W. Tindall B.J. Nimtz M.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3950-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, Lys-PG provides S. aureus with resistance to other classes of cationic bactericidal agents such as vancomycin (glycopeptide) and daptomycin (lipopeptide) (7Nishi H. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara T. McCallum N. Sugai M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Cui L. Tominaga E. Neoh H.M. Hiramatsu K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), which are often used as a last resort to treat infections. A new aaPGS with altered specificity was recently discovered in Clostridium perfringens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9Roy H. Ibba M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4667-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Klein S. Lorenzo C. Hoffmann S. Walther J.M. Storbeck S. Piekarski T. Tindall B.J. Wray V. Nimtz M. Moser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This enzyme, Ala-PGS, is responsible for the formation of Ala-PG in the membrane. Despite the net neutral charge of Ala-PG, this modification has been shown to enhance bacterial resistance to certain cationic antimicrobial peptides (10Klein S. Lorenzo C. Hoffmann S. Walther J.M. Storbeck S. Piekarski T. Tindall B.J. Wray V. Nimtz M. Moser J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both Lys-PG and Ala-PG have also been shown to enhance the resistance of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to several negatively charged β-lactams (e.g. oxacillin, methicillin, cefsulodin) (7Nishi H. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara T. McCallum N. Sugai M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Klein S. Lorenzo C. Hoffmann S. Walther J.M.

Labischinski H. Sugai M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 49-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These latter findings suggest that aaPGs confer antibiotic resistance both by diminishing the net negative charge of the membrane and by modulating more general biophysical properties such as membrane fluidity and permeability (12Mishra N.N.

In addition, aaPGs not only decrease membrane permeability to cationic antimicrobial peptides, but also to protons and osmolytes (e.g. lactate), providing bacteria with resistance to challenging osmotic or acidic growth conditions such as those encountered during fermentative growth (10Klein S.

We screened seven parasite lines for differences in responses to 1,279 bioactive chemicals. Hundreds of compounds were active in inhibiting parasite growth; 607 differential chemical phenotypes, defined as pairwise IC50 differences of fivefold or more between parasite lines, were cataloged. We mapped major determinants for three differential chemical phenotypes between the parents of a genetic cross, and we identified target genes by fine mapping and testing the responses of parasites in which candidate genes were genetically replaced with mutant alleles. Differential sensitivity to dihydroergotamine methanesulfonate (1), a serotonin receptor antagonist, was mapped to a gene encoding the homolog of human P-glycoprotein (PfPgh-1). This study identifies new leads for antimalarial drugs and demonstrates the utility of a high-throughput chemical genomic strategy for studying malaria traits."

Inhibiting calpain prevents LIS1 degradation in heterozygous mice and rescues the defective neuronal migration in utero. Lissencephaly is a devastating neurological disorder caused by defective neuronal migration. LIS1 (official symbol PAFAH1B1, for platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, isoform 1b, subunit 1) was identified as the gene mutated in individuals with lissencephaly, and it was found to regulate cytoplasmic dynein function and localization. Here we show that inhibition or knockdown of calpains protects LIS1 from proteolysis, resulting in the augmentation of LIS1 amounts in Lis1+/− mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and rescue of the aberrant distribution of cytoplasmic dynein, mitochondria and β-COP–positive vesicles. We also show that calpain inhibitors improve neuronal migration of Lis1+/− cerebellar granular neurons. Intraperitoneal injection of the calpain inhibitor ALLN to pregnant Lis1+/− dams rescued apoptotic neuronal cell death and neuronal migration defects in Lis1+/− offspring. Furthermore, in utero knockdown of calpain by short hairpin RNA rescued defective cortical layering in Lis1+/− mice. Thus, calpain inhibition is a potential therapeutic intervention for lissencephaly."
https://openalex.org/W2150783328,"The γ isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kγ) has been viewed as restricted to leukocytes mediating the regulation of chemokine-induced migration and recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. In line with the observation that PI3Kγ-deficient mice display defects in adaptive immunity, inhibition of PI3Kγ reduces synovial inflammation in the collagen-induced arthritis mouse model of inflammatory arthritis [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)], which has been attributed to reduced influx of inflammatory cells. Challenging the concept of leukocyte-restricted PI3Ky function, we report here a novel, nonredundant function of PI3Kγ as an important regulator of fibroblast- induced cartilage destruction during chronic destructive arthritis. We show that in human tumor necrosis factor transgenic mice, the loss of PI3Kγ leads to a milder inflammatory arthritis. Interestingly, PI3Kγ deficiency does not alter the recruitment of inflammatory cells, but significantly reduces cartilage damage through reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinases in fibroblasts and chondrocytes. In vitro analyses demonstrate that the decreased invasiveness of fibroblasts is mediated by reduced phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signalregulated kinase. Using a PI3Kγ specific inhibitor, these data are confirmed in human synovial fibroblasts from patients with RA who exhibit a disease-specific up-regulation of PI3Kγ. Our data indicate that in addition to mediating the recruitment of inflammatory cells, PI3Kγ is an important regulator of fibroblast-mediated joint destruction in RA and suggest that specific inhibitors of PI3Kγ will interfere with the activation of RA synovial fibroblasts and reduce cartilage destruction in RA.— Hayer, S., Pundt, N., Peters, M.

The chloroplast-encoded large subunits form the active site, but the nuclear-encoded small subunits can also influence catalytic efficiency and CO2/O2 specificity.

Bot. 2008; 59: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The ∼55-kDa large subunit contains a carboxyl-terminal α/β-barrel domain that, along with residues from the amino-terminal domain of a neighboring large subunit, forms the active site of the enzyme. Carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) initiates the rate-limiting step of photosynthetic CO2 fixation. However, O2 is mutually competitive with CO2, and oxygenation of RuBP is a nonessential side reaction that ultimately leads to the loss of CO2 in the photorespiratory pathway. Thus, net CO2 fixation is determined by the difference between the rates of carboxylation and oxygenation (4Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are ultimately determined by the Vmax values for carboxylation (Vc) and oxygenation (Vo), the Km values for CO2 (Kc) and O2 (Ko), and the concentrations of CO2 and O2 at the Rubisco active site. Another kinetic constant referred to as the CO2/O2 specificity factor (Ω) is equal to the catalytic efficiency of carboxylation (Vc/Kc) relative to the catalytic efficiency of oxygenation (Vo/Ko) (4Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ω is determined by the difference between the carboxylation and oxygenation free energies of activation at the rate-determining step of catalysis (5Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 31: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), changes in Ω may identify regions of Rubisco worthy of genetic engineering. There continues to be much interest in either engineering or selecting improvements in Rubisco as a means for increasing net CO2 fixation and the production of food, fiber, and renewable energy.The catalytic mechanism of the large subunit active site has been studied extensively by employing directed mutagenesis of either the dimeric large subunit Rubisco enzyme of Rhodospirillum rubrum (referred to as L2 Rubisco) or the plant-like L8S8 Rubisco of Synechococcus expressed in Escherichia coli (reviewed in Refs. 6Hartman F.C.

Because there is greater divergence between eukaryotic and prokaryotic small subunits than between large subunits, one wonders whether the small subunits may, in part, be responsible for the higher Ω values of eukaryotic Rubisco enzymes (8Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar).The loop between β-strands A and B of the small subunit is the most variable structure among all Rubisco enzymes (12Spreitzer R.J.

It is comprised of 10 residues in prokaryotes and eukaryotic non-green algae, ∼22 residues in green plants, and 28 residues in green algae (see Fig. 1). The βA-βB loops of four small subunits, which reside at opposite ends of the octameric large subunit core, surround the opening of a solvent channel that passes through the holoenzyme (1Spreitzer R.J.

Biol. 1993; 23: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and because the small subunit is coded by a family of rbcS genes in plants that cannot be eliminated and replaced with engineered copies (35Dhingra A. Portis Jr., A.R. Daniell H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6315-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When the longer βA-βB loop of plants was engineered into the Synechococcus small subunit, this cyanobacterial small subunit was then able to assemble with plant large subunits in the isolated chloroplasts (33Wasmann C.C. Ramage R.T. Bohnert H.J. Ostrem J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the βA-βB loop appeared to be an assembly domain (33Wasmann C.C. Ramage R.T. Bohnert H.J. Ostrem J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but detailed analysis of Rubisco catalysis was difficult to perform because of the low yield of holoenzyme in the isolated chloroplast system (28Flachmann R.

Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 451: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Du Y.C. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whereas the L290F substitution caused a decrease in Ω and holoenzyme stability (36Chen Z.X. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the substitutions in the βA-βB loop returned Ω to nearly normal values and improved thermal stability of the holoenzyme (15Genkov T. Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 451: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Du Y.C. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When the rbcS gene family (comprised of linked rbcS1 and rbcS2 genes) of Chlamydomonas was deleted via an insertional mutagenesis procedure (37Khrebtukova I. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13689-13693Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it became possible to investigate the role of the βA-βB loop in greater detail, as well as the importance of the eukaryotic small subunit in general. Like all photosynthesis-deficient mutants of this model genetic organism, the Chlamydomonas rbcS deletion strain can be maintained with acetate as an alternative carbon source, and it can be restored to photosynthetic competency by transformation with either of the two rbcS genes (14Spreitzer R.J. Esquivel M.G. Du Y.C. McLaughlin P.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5615-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Khrebtukova I. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13689-13693Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ala-scanning mutagenesis of conserved residues of the eukaryotic βA-βB loop showed that none was essential for holoenzyme assembly, but several affected catalysis, and an R71A substitution caused a decrease in Ω (14Spreitzer R.J. Esquivel M.G. Du Y.C. McLaughlin P.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5615-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas Rubisco enzymes engineered to contain the smaller cyanobacterial or plant βA-βB loops could also assemble in vivo despite the loss of substantial structural interactions with the large subunit observed in x-ray crystal structures (38Karkehabadi S. Peddi S.R. Anwaruzzaman M. Taylor T.C. Cederlund A. Genkov T. Andersson I. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9851-9861Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both chimeric enzymes had altered catalytic properties, and the enzyme with the cyanobacterial loop had a decreased Ω value. Most recently, the shorter plant loop, along with five substitutions of neighboring large subunit residues, has produced an enzyme with an increased Ω value and kinetic constants quite similar to those of the plant enzyme (11Spreitzer R.J. Peddi S.R. Satagopan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17225-17230Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Altogether, it appears that the small subunit βA-βB loop makes a greater contribution to Rubisco catalytic efficiency than to simply holding together large subunits in the holoenzyme.Perhaps there are other structural features of the small subunit that contribute to Rubisco function. One approach for identifying such structural regions is to substitute highly conserved residues. Previous directed mutagenesis studies of prokaryotic Rubisco enzymes expressed in E. coli (see Fig. 1) identified a number of small subunit substitutions that affected carboxylase activity or holoenzyme stability (reviewed in Ref. 12Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because those studies were performed when relatively few rbcS sequences were available, focused on conserved regions rather than residues, and substituted a variety of similar or quite dissimilar residues, no specific structural region was studied in any greater detail. In the present study, the 10 most conserved small subunit residues were substituted with alanine in Chlamydomonas Rubisco. This eukaryotic system allows the effect of the substitutions to be assessed in vivo and in vitro. Analysis has indicated that the conserved small subunit residues may influence a single structural element that contributes to the Rubisco large subunit active site.DISCUSSIONAnalysis of hybrid (16Read B.A. Tabita F.R.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has shown that Rubisco small subunits can influence both carboxylation catalytic efficiency and Ω. However, because small subunits do not interact directly with the large subunit active site (2Andersson I. Backlund A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2008; 46: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), it remains difficult to determine the structural basis for this influence. A chimeric Chlamydomonas Rubisco enzyme containing the shorter small subunit βA-βB loop of Synechococcus has a decreased Ω value, but the x-ray crystal structure of the mutant enzyme failed to identify a direct structural path from the βA-βB loop to the large subunit active site (38Karkehabadi S. Peddi S.R. Anwaruzzaman M. Taylor T.C. Cederlund A. Genkov T. Andersson I. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9851-9861Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).It was interesting to find that the small subunit residues chosen for analysis in the present study, based solely on their high level of conservation (Fig. 1), associate in groups near α-helix 8 of the large subunit α/β-barrel (Fig. 5). Previous comparison of the x-ray crystal structure of L8S8 spinach Rubisco with the L2 structure of R. rubrum Rubisco identified shifts in α-helix 8 and its preceding loop (53Schneider G. Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because small subunit residues interact with these large subunit regions, it was concluded that the small subunit was responsible for the observed differences in conformation (53Schneider G. Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the loop before α-helix 8 contains two active site residues (Gly-403 and Gly-404) that bind to one of the phosphate groups of the CABP transition state analog (20Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Taylor T.C. Backlund A. Bjorhall K. Spreitzer R.J. Andersson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48159-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it was also proposed (53Schneider G. Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that small subunits might influence Rubisco catalysis via these interactions and account for the differences in Ω values between L2 (Ω ≈ 15) and L8S8 (Ω ≈ 80) Rubisco enzymes (8Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar).At the bottom of large subunit α-helix 8, the conserved small subunit residue Tyr-32 appears to shield large subunit residues Arg-431 and Asn-432 from solvent (Fig. 5). These residues are the last two at the carboxyl-terminal end of α-helix 8 at the bottom of the α/β-barrel. Nonetheless, the Y32A mutant enzyme has a 10% decrease in Ω (Table 2) in addition to an associated structural instability (Figs. 3 and 4). Because α-helixes are dipoles because of resonance at the peptide bond, perhaps the nature of small subunit residue 32 at the carboxyl-terminal end of large subunit α-helix 8 can influence the partial positive charge at the amino-terminal end of α-helix 8.Of the three conserved small subunit residues that reside near the middle of large subunit α-helix 8 (Ser-16, Leu-18, and Pro-19) (Fig. 5), only Leu-18 has a significant effect on cell growth when substituted with alanine (Fig. 2). Because the side chain of Leu-18 is in van der Waals contact with three large subunit α-helix-8 residues (Glu-425, Ala-426, and Gln-429), the loss of these interactions may account for both the holoenzyme instability observed in L18A cells grown at 35 °C (Fig. 3) and the difficulty with purifying L18A mutant Rubisco. However, despite the fact that Ser-16 and Pro-19 are in contact with Leu-18, the S16A and P19A substitutions have only minor effects on carboxylation specific activity (Table 1) and in vitro holoenzyme thermal stability (Figs. 3 and 4). Perhaps less conservative substitutions at these residues would produce an effect. In previous studies with Synechococcus Rubisco expressed in E. coli, P19A and P19H substitutions also had no significant effect on carboxylation or holoenzyme assembly (13Kostov R.V. Small C.L. McFadden B.A. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 127-134Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Lee B. Berka R.M. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7417-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, an S16D substitution disrupted holoenzyme stability (26Lee B. Berka R.M. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7417-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas an S16A substitution was reported to cause a decrease in Ω (13Kostov R.V. Small C.L. McFadden B.A. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 127-134Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this latter study (13Kostov R.V. Small C.L. McFadden B.A. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 127-134Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), an increased Ω value was also reported for a P20A substitution, but other Rubisco kinetic constants were not measured. Other substitutions were created in cyanobacterial small subunits at residues near to Ser-16, Leu-18, and Pro-19 (Fig. 1), but, except for one study (27Paul K. Morell M.K. Andrews T.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10019-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), analysis of these mutant enzymes was incomplete. R10G and E13V substitutions blocked holoenzyme assembly (13Kostov R.V. Small C.L. McFadden B.A. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 127-134Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Fitchen J.H. Knight S. Andersson I. Branden C.I. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and some substitutions at Thr-14, Tyr-17, and Leu-21 caused decreases in both carboxylation and holoenzyme stability (13Kostov R.V. Small C.L. McFadden B.A. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 127-134Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Lee B. Berka R.M. Tabita F.R. J. Biol.

Perhaps Ser-16 and Pro-19 have provided some selective advantage during evolution that is not readily apparent from the completed biochemical analysis of Chlamydomonas Rubisco. Further study of the region defined by the conservative Ser-16, Leu-18, and Pro-19 residues may be necessary to determine whether this region is primarily responsible for holoenzyme stability, catalytic efficiency, or both.The remainder of the conserved small subunit residues cluster near the top of α-helix 8 (Glu-43, Trp-73, Leu-78, Pro-79, Phe-81, and Glu-92) (Fig. 5). With respect to the evolution of Rubisco structure, it is interesting to note that these residues reside in a small subunit different from the one that comes in contact with the carboxyl-terminal end of large subunit α-helix 8. Although conserved Tyr-32 caps the carboxyl-terminal end of large subunit α-helix 8, small subunit Leu-78 is in contact with large subunit residues Pro-410 and Gly-412 just before the start of α-helix 8 at Asn-413 (Fig. 5). The L78A substitution does not alter Ω, but it does cause a decrease in Vc and increases in Kc and Ko (Table 2). The loss of interactions between small subunit Leu-78 and large subunit residues Pro-410 and Gly-412 may alter the structure of the loop preceding α-helix 8. Catalysis may be affected because this loop contains the active site residues Gly-403 and Gly-404, which interact with the CABP transition state analog (Fig. 5). Leu-78 and Phe-81 are not in direct contact with each other, but the L78A and F81A substitutions cause similar changes in catalytic properties (Table 2). The aromatic ring of Phe-81 is surrounded by large subunit residues Trp-70, Gly-73, and Leu-74 in the amino-terminal domain of a neighboring large subunit (Fig. 5). The loss of the Phe-81 side group might influence the position of Leu-78. However, the Leu-78 side group is also in van der Waals contact with large subunit Trp-70, and residues Trp-70, Gly-73, and Leu-74 are in the loop between large subunit α-helix B and β-strand C (αB-βC loop) that contains active site residues Thr-65 and Trp-66 (Fig. 5). It might be possible that L78A and F81A affect catalysis by altering the loop before α-helix 8, the amino-terminal-domain αB-βC loop, or both. Conserved small subunit residue Pro-79 is in contact with large subunit Trp-70 and small subunit residues Leu-78 and Phe-81, but the P79A substitution causes a relatively small decrease in only Vc. Perhaps a less conservative substitution would produce a different effect. In a previous study, when the homologous Pro-59 residue in the small subunit of Anabaena Rubisco was replaced with a larger and polar histidine (Fig. 1), holoenzyme assembly in E. coli was blocked (25Fitchen J.H. Knight S. Andersson I. Branden C.I. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the Chlamydomonas L78A, P79A, and F81A mutant strains have normal amounts of Rubisco when grown at 25 °C, and the purified mutant enzymes have only a modest decrease in thermal stability in vitro (Fig. 4). The side chain of conserved residue Glu-92 resides at the surface of small subunit α-helix B (Figs. 1 and 5). Glu-92 is in contact with some of the same residues contacted by small subunit Leu-78, Pro-79, and Phe-81, but the E92A substitution causes only a small decrease in carboxylation (Table 2) with no effect on holoenzyme stability (Figs. 3 and 4). Altogether, it seems likely that the conserved Leu-78, Pro-79, Phe-81, and Glu-92 residues may have a greater role in function than in holoenzyme assembly or stability.Whereas conserved small subunit residues Glu-43 and Trp-73 are also in the region near the top of large subunit α-helix 8, they are in direct contact with large subunit α-helix 1 of the α/β-barrel (Fig. 5). Glu-43 forms an ionic bond with large subunit Arg-187, and Trp-73 is in van der Waals contact with large subunit Tyr-190. The E43A and W73A enzymes both have decreases in Vc and increases in Kc and Ko, but the E43A enzyme also has a decreased Ω value (Table 2) and an associated structural instability in vivo (Fig. 3), which may result from the loss of the salt bridge to the large subunit. Analysis of small subunit Trp-55 and Trp-58 in Synechococcus Rubisco (which are homologous to Trp-73 and Trp-76 in Chlamydomonas; Fig. 1) indicated that W55F and W58F mutant enzymes also had a decrease in Vc, but Kc was not changed, and Ko was not measured (24Voordouw G. De Vries P.A. Van den Berg W.A. De Clerck E.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Lee B. Berka R.M. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7417-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the residue homologous to Chlamydomonas Trp-73 was substituted with arginine in Anabaena Rubisco, the holoenzyme failed to assemble in E. coli (25Fitchen J.H. Knight S. Andersson I. Branden C.I. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was suggested, in part, that the structural instability might result from the additional arginine disrupting the ionic interaction between small subunit Glu-43 and large subunit Arg-187 (25Fitchen J.H. Knight S. Andersson I. Branden C.I. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, as demonstrated by the Chlamydomonas E43A mutant enzyme, this ionic bond is not essential for holoenzyme assembly. Substitutions were also created at Tyr-72 of the Chlamydomonas small subunit (32Esquível M.G. Pinto T.S. Marín-Navarro J. Moreno J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and at the homologous plant and cyanobacterial tyrosine residues (26Lee B. Berka R.M. Tabita F.R. J. Biol.

The C terminus of the high-risk HPV 16 E6 oncoprotein physically associates with and degrades a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN13), and PTPN13 loss synergizes with H-RasV12 or ErbB2 for invasive growth in vivo. Oral keratinocytes that have lost PTPN13 and express H-RasV12 or ErbB2 show enhanced Ras/RAF/MEK/Erk signaling. In co-transfection studies, wild-type PTPN13 inhibited Ras/RAF/MEK/Erk signaling in HEK 293 cells that overexpress ErbB2, EGFR or H-RasV12, whereas an enzymatically inactive PTPN13 did not. Twenty percent of HPV-negative HNSCCs had PTPN13 phosphatase mutations that did not inhibit Ras/RAF/MEK/Erk signaling. Inhibition of Ras/RAF/MEK/Erk signaling using MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked anchorage-independent growth in cells lacking PTPN13. These findings show that PTPN13 phosphatase activity has a physiologically significant role in regulating MAP kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2162321261,"Nucleophosmin (NPM) is a multifunctional protein involved in both proliferation and apoptosis. Importantly, NPM negatively regulates p53 and is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers. To identify inhibitory molecules of NPM, we used an in vitro selection method termed systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to select RNA aptamers that bind to NPM with high affinity and specificity. The selected RNA aptamers bind to the central acidic region of NPM and affect its oligomerization both in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, expression of NPM-specific aptamers causes mislocalization of NPM in the nucleoplasm rather than in the nucleolus, suggesting that NPM oligomerization is important for its proper localization. Moreover, p14ARF is mislocalized in the nucleoplasm and p53 is upregulated in cells expressing NPM aptamers. In addition, cancer cells expressing NPM aptamers not only undergo apoptosis on their own, but are more susceptible to apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents as well. These results suggest that interfering with NPM oligomerization can inhibit NPM function and aptamers targeting NPM can serve as potential lead for developing anticancer drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1967919303,"The Escherichia coli O9a O-polysaccharide (O-PS) is a prototype for O-PS synthesis and export by the ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathway. Comparable systems are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria. The polymannose O9a O-PS is assembled on a polyisoprenoid lipid intermediate by mannosyltransferases located at the cytoplasmic membrane, and the final polysaccharide chain length is determined by the chain terminating dual kinase/methyltransferase, WbdD. The WbdD protein is tethered to the membrane via a C-terminal region containing amphipathic helices located between residues 601 and 669. Here, we establish that the C-terminal domain of WbdD plays an additional pivotal role in assembly of the O-PS by forming a complex with the chain-extending mannosyltransferase, WbdA. Membrane preparations from a DeltawbdD mutant had severely diminished mannosyltransferase activity in vitro, and no significant amounts of the WbdA protein are targeted to the membrane fraction. Expression of a polypeptide comprising the WbdD C-terminal region was sufficient to restore both proper localization of WbdA and mannosyltransferase activity. In contrast to WbdA, the other required mannosyltransferases (WbdBC) are targeted to the membrane independent of WbdD. A bacterial two-hybrid system confirmed the interaction of WbdD and WbdA and identified two regions in the C terminus of WbdD that contributed to the interaction. Therefore, in the O9a assembly export system, the WbdD protein orchestrates the critical localization and coordination of activities involved in O-PS chain extension and termination at the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2063817436,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57Kip2 gene has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene, being inactivated in various cancer types, linked to tumor progression and poor patient outcome. Here, we report that p57Kip2 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton modifying enzyme, LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK-1) but not LIMK-2. This interaction enhances activity of LIMK-1, independently of its activator Rho-associated kinase. This resulted in an increased phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of the actin depolymerization factor, cofilin. In accordance, selective p57Kip2 expression promotes actin stress fiber formation in cancer cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of fluorescent-labeled actin further demonstrated that p57Kip2 expression results in reduction of actin protein mobile fraction, which affects its turnover rate in cell. Finally, we present evidence that the p57Kip2 control of LIMK-1 ultimately affects cell mobility negatively. Thus, in addition to its established function in control of proliferation and cell death, these results indicate that p57Kip2 is critical in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamic and by this means migration ability of cancer cells."

Palmitate-induced Mcl-1 degradation was attenuated by the novel protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor rottlerin. Of the two human novel PKC isozymes, PKCδ and PKCθ, only activation of PKCθ was observed by phospho-immunoblot analysis. As compared with Jurkat cells, a smaller PKCθ polypeptide and mRNA were expressed in hepatocytes consistent with an alternative splice variant. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of PKCθ reduced Mcl-1 degradation and lipoapoptosis. Likewise, genetic deletion of Pkcθ also attenuated Mcl-1 degradation and cytotoxicity by palmitate in primary hepatocytes. During treatment with palmitate, rottlerin inhibited phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at Ser159, a phosphorylation site previously implicated in Mcl-1 turnover. Consistent with these results, an Mcl-1 S159A mutant was resistant to degradation and improved cell survival during palmitate treatment. Collectively, these results implicate PKCθ-dependent destabilization of Mcl-1 as a mechanism contributing to hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. The mechanisms of free fatty acid-induced lipoapoptosis are incompletely understood.

Apoptosis is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 protein family (24Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). These proteins can be categorized into three subsets as follows: the guardians or anti-apoptotic members of this family, which include Bcl-2, A1, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w; the multidomain executioners or proapoptotic members of this family, which include Bax and Bak; and the messengers or biosensors of cell death, which share only the third Bcl-2 homology domain and are referred to as BH3-only proteins. This last group of proteins includes Bid, Bim, Bmf, Puma, Noxa, Hrk, Bad, and Bik. We have previously reported that cytotoxic FFA induce Bim expression by a FoxO3a-dependent mechanism that contributes, in part, to lipoapoptosis by activating Bax (20Malhi H. Barreyro F.J. Isomoto H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Gut. 2007; 56: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Barreyro F.J. Kobayashi S. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Malhi H. Gores G.J. J. Biol.

However, Bax activation can be held in check by anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family suggesting their function may also be dysregulated during FFA-mediated cytotoxicity. Bcl-2 is not expressed in hepatocytes at the protein level (25Tzung S.P. Fausto N. Hockenbery D.M. Am. J.

It has also been posited that cellular elimination of Mcl-1 is a critical step in certain proapoptotic cascades (34Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 35Cuconati A. Mukherjee C. Perez D. White E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2922-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 is unique among Bcl-2 proteins in that it has a short half-life, 30–120 min in most cell types, due to the presence of two sequences rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, which target the protein for rapid degradation by the proteasome (36Warr M.R. Shore G.C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2008; 8: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 is promoted by ubiquitination, which in turn is regulated by various kinase cascades (36Warr M.R. Shore G.C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2008; 8: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Despite its potential importance, a role for Mcl-1 in regulating hepatocyte FFA-mediated lipoapoptosis remains unexplored. Given that FFA induce insulin resistance (37Solinas G. Naugler W. Galimi F. Lee M.S. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16454-16459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the kinases potentially regulating lipoapoptosis are likely those also identified in insulin resistance syndromes, especially the novel PKC isoforms PKCδ and PKCθ (38Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The novel PKC isoforms are activated by diacylglycerol, which rises in the presence of FFA (39Itani S.I. Ruderman N.B. Schmieder F. Boden G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 40Timmers S. Schrauwen P. de Vogel J. Physiol. Behav. 2008; 94: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Yu C.

A role for PKCδ in apoptosis has not been described. PKCθ has recently been shown to be activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress in liver cells (43Sakaki K. Wu J. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15370-15380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and lipids in vivo (44Kim J.K. Fillmore J.J. Sunshine M.J. Albrecht B. Higashimori T. Kim D.W.

Rev. 2007; 87: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKCθ has also been implicated in apoptosis of Jurkat cells, neuroblastoma cells, and myeloid leukemia cells (46Schultz A. Jönsson J.I. Larsson C. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 662-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol.

However, neither its role in mediating lipoapoptosis nor modulating levels/activity of Bcl-2 proteins has been examined. This study addresses the role of Mcl-1 and PKCθ in FFA-induced lipoapoptosis. We identify a pathway that involves PKCθ-dependent proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. Using inhibitors of various steps along this pathway, along with Mcl-1 mutants that are resistant to proteasomal degradation or Ser159 phosphorylation, our studies implicate Mcl-1 degradation via a PKCθ-dependent process as a critical step in lipoapoptosis. Isopropyl alcohol and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Rottlerin (a novel PKC inhibitor) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor IX were from Calbiochem. Z-VAD-fmk was from Enzyme Systems (Livermore, CA). Huh-7 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, and primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (25 mm), 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 wild type (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), human MCL-1 transgenic (Ruth W.

Palmitate, stearate, and oleate (Sigma) were individually dissolved in isopropyl alcohol at a concentration of 80 mm. The concentration of the vehicle, isopropyl alcohol, was 1% in the final incubations. For all studies employing FFA, the media contained 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to ensure a ratio between bound and unbound FFA analogous to the ratio present in human plasma (49Richieri G.V.

Although these concentrations are similar to total fasting FFA plasma concentrations found in the pathophysiologic condition of NASH, the concentrations are elevated compared with each species of FFA present in human plasma. Cells were incubated for 20 min on ice with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40; 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 1 mm Na3VO4; 1 mm NaF) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Sigma), and aliquots containing 80 μg of protein were electrophoretically resolved by SDS-PAGE on a pre-cast 12% acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight and then, after washing, with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The following primary antibodies were employed: rabbit polyclonal antibody, which is strongly reactive to human but not murine Mcl-1 at 1:1000 (sc-819, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-mouse Mcl-1 (600-401-394, Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA); monoclonal mouse anti-human PKCθ (clone 27, Pharmingen); polyclonal rabbit anti-human PKCθ (2059, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA; data not shown); polyclonal rabbit anti-human phospho-Thr538 PKCθ (9377, Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal rabbit anti-human PKCδ (2058, Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse phospho-Thr505 PKCδ (9374, Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal goat anti-β-actin antibody at 1:2000 (C11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin (T6557, Sigma). Immune complexes were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) or a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation of immune complexes was performed using Odyssey 3.0 software per the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from Huh-7 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript® III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers per the manufacturer's protocol. A 1.5-μl aliquot of a 20-μl reverse transcription reaction was subjected to real time PCR analysis. PCR primers used for human MCL-1 were as follows: forward 5′-AAGCCAATGGGCAGGTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-TGTCCAGTTTCCGAAGCAT-3′, which generated an amplicon of 121 bp from the cDNA. The forward primer is located in exon 1 and the reverse primer in exon 2, and no detectable genomic product was generated under the PCR conditions employed. Universal ProbeLibrary probe 4 (Roche Applied Science) bound in the amplicon, and cleavage of the 5′-fluorescein during amplification generated the fluorescent signal. Commercially available primers for ribosomal 18 S RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) were used for copy controls. The Lightcycler TaqMan master kit (Roche Applied Science) was employed for all reactions. Quantitative real time PCR using a capillary thermocycler (LightCycler, Roche Applied Science) was performed as we described previously in detail (21Barreyro F.J. Kobayashi S. Bronk S.F.

Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Huh-7 cells were either transfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing construct alone (pEGFP-N, Clontech) or with GFP plus a pcDNA3 vector expressing the mutated human Mcl-1 at a 1:2 ratio. Transfected cells were identified by expression of GFP. Characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis were assessed by staining nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) followed by fluorescence microscopy using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 430 nm, respectively (48Faubion W.A.

The constructs were transfected using a standard lipofection method. Stably transfected Huh-7 clones were selected in medium containing 1200 μg/ml G418. Individual colonies were subcloned and screened for Mcl-1 or PKCθ expression by immunoblot analysis. RNA was extracted from Jurkat and Huh-7 cells using the FastTrack MAG mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and used for Northern blot analysis. Digoxigenin-labeled probe and Northern blot examination were performed using the digoxigenin Northern starter kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Digoxigenin-labeled probe was created from a PCR product corresponding to exons 12–14 of the human PKCθ gene. Huh-7 cells were stably transfected with S peptide-tagged human Mcl-1 as we have described previously for other cell types (51Kobayashi S. Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Mott J.L. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W.

HA-tagged ubiquitin in a pcDNA plasmid was obtained from Dr. Mark A. McNiven (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and transiently transfected into the S peptide Mcl-1-expressing Huh-7 cells. Cells were treated with palmitate (800 μm) plus MG-132 (10 mm) for the desired time intervals. S peptide Mcl-1 was affinity-purified from whole cell lysates using S protein coupled to agarose beads as described previously (51Kobayashi S. Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Mott J.L. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W.

The affinity-purified protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immobilized on nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was performed for S peptide and HA. Huh-7 cells stably transfected with S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 were cultured in 10-cm dishes. After the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer, S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 was recovered on S protein-agarose as described previously (51Kobayashi S. Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Mott J.L. Bronk S.F.

The tagged polypeptide was released into SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) in 20% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid. The Mcl-1 band was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry analysis at the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School. All data represent at least three independent experiments expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were compared using the two-tailed Student's t test. Analysis of variance with a Bonferroni test to correct for multiple comparisons was employed when appropriate. We initially assessed that if saturated, cytotoxic FFA altered the cellular fate of Mcl-1 in Huh-7 cells. Palmitate (16:0 saturated FFA) induced a rapid decrease of Mcl-1 protein that was apparent within 1 h and maximal at 4 h (Fig. 1A). Levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, however, were unaltered. Treatment with the proapoptotic FFA stearate (18:0 saturated FFA) also resulted in a rapid loss of cellular Mcl-1 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the nontoxic FFA oleate (18:1 mono-unsaturated FFA) did not significantly reduce Mcl-1 cellular protein levels (Fig. 1C). Additional experiments were performed to assess the cause of the Mcl-1 down-regulation. Treatment with palmitate did not alter steady state levels of MCL-1 mRNA, indicating that FFA are unlikely to affect either MCL-1 mRNA generation or stability (Fig. 2A). Loss of Mcl-1 was also not simply a consequence of lipoapoptosis, as the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, which blocks FFA-mediated apoptosis (52Malhi H. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12093-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), did not prevent loss of cellular Mcl-1 (Fig. 2B, upper and lower panels). Analysis of replicate immunoblots for palmitate-induced Mcl-1 degradation in the presence or absence of Z-VAD-fmk revealed no significant difference (p > 0.25) in Mcl-1 levels at any of the analyzed time points (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Mcl-1 protein is known to be rapidly turned over in many cell types by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated pathway. Consistent with this concept, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked loss of cellular Mcl-1 during palmitate treatment (Fig. 2C). To further confirm this mechanism for Mcl-1 cellular elimination, Huh-7 cells were transiently transfected with a ubiquitin-resistant Mcl-1 mutant in which lysines 5, 40, 136, 194, and 197 were mutated to arginine (termed KR Mcl-1), thereby reducing Mcl-1 turnover by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (54Zhong Q.

https://openalex.org/W2031098368,"Thymidine nucleotides are required for faithful DNA synthesis and repair, and their de novo biosynthesis is regulated by serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1). The SHMT1 transcript contains a heavy chain ferritin, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H2, and CUG-binding protein 1-responsive internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that regulates SHMT1 translation. In this study a non-lethal dose of UVC is shown to increase SHMT1 IRES activity and protein levels in four different cell lines. The mechanism for the UV-induced activation of the SHMT1 IRES involves an increase in heavy chain ferritin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H2 expression and the translocation of CUG-binding protein 1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The UV-induced increase in SHMT1 translation is accompanied by an increase in the small ubiquitin-like modifier-dependent nuclear localization of the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway and a decrease in DNA strand breaks, indicating a role for SHMT1 and nuclear folate metabolism in DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2159945618,"Human serum albumin (HSA) participates in heme scavenging; in turn, heme endows HSA with myoglobin-like reactivity and spectroscopic properties. Here, the allosteric effect of ibuprofen on peroxynitrite isomerization to NO(3)(-) catalyzed by ferric human serum heme-albumin (HSA-heme-Fe(III)) is reported. Data were obtained at 22.0 degrees C. HSA-heme-Fe(III) catalyzes peroxynitrite isomerization in the absence and presence of CO(2); the values of the second order catalytic rate constant (k(on)) are 4.1 x 10(5) and 4.5 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1), respectively. Moreover, HSA-heme-Fe(III) prevents peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of free added l-tyrosine. The pH dependence of k(on) (pK(a) = 6.9) suggests that peroxynitrous acid reacts preferentially with the heme-Fe(III) atom, in the absence and presence of CO(2). The HSA-heme-Fe(III)-catalyzed isomerization of peroxynitrite has been ascribed to the reactive pentacoordinated heme-Fe(III) atom. In the absence and presence of CO(2), ibuprofen impairs dose-dependently peroxynitrite isomerization by HSA-heme-Fe(III) and facilitates the nitration of free added l-tyrosine; the value of the dissociation equilibrium constant for ibuprofen binding to HSA-heme-Fe(III) (L) ranges between 7.7 x 10(-4) and 9.7 x 10(-4) m. Under conditions where [ibuprofen] is >>L, the kinetics of HSA-heme-Fe(III)-catalyzed isomerization of peroxynitrite is superimposable to that obtained in the absence of HSA-heme-Fe(III) or in the presence of non-catalytic HSA-heme-Fe(III)-cyanide complex and HSA. Ibuprofen binding impairs allosterically peroxynitrite isomerization by HSA-heme-Fe(III), inducing the hexacoordination of the heme-Fe(III) atom. These results represent the first evidence for peroxynitrite isomerization by HSA-heme-Fe(III), highlighting the allosteric modulation of HSA-heme-Fe(III) reactivity by heterotropic interaction(s), and outlining the role of drugs in modulating HSA functions. The present results could be relevant for the drug-dependent protective role of HSA-heme-Fe(III) in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2030324144,"Understanding the mechanisms that link changes in DNA methylation with histone modifications is particularly relevant in the case of tumor suppressor genes that undergo transcriptional silencing in cancer cells in association with promoter CpG island hypermethylation. In this study, we show that two histone lysine methylation marks associated with active transcription, dimethylation of H3K79 (H3K79me2) and trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3), are present in all the unmethylated promoters analysed, and both of them are lost when these promoters become hypermethylated. Most importantly, pharmacological and genetic interventions that cause DNA demethylation and partial recovery of gene transcription, result in the restoration of H3K4me3, but not of H3K79me2. We also show that DOT1L, the major H3K79 histone methyltransferase, is no longer recruited to the promoters that are demethylated after 5-aza-deoxycytidine treatment or genetic deletion of DNA methyltransferases. Knock-down and transfection experiments for DOT1L show that this enzyme has a direct role in maintaining the euchromatic and active status of these genes when unmethylated. These findings suggest that DNA demethylating interventions alone are not able to restore a complete euchromatic status and a full transcriptional reactivation of the epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes, and reinforce the necessity of targeting multiple elements of the epigenetics machinery for a successful treatment of malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2026305546,"Human interleukin-24 (IL-24) is unique among the IL-10 superfamily as there is considerable evidence that it possesses multiple anti-cancer properties, including direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, helper T cell (TH1) immune stimulation, and anti-angiogenic activities. The primary sequence of human IL-24 differs from homologous cytokines, because it possesses three consensus N-linked glycosylation sites and the potential for a single disulfide bond. To address the significance of these modifications in human IL-24, we analyzed the relationship between post-translational modifications and the cytokine activity of the human IL-24 protein. In contrast to related interleukins, we identified a relationship between net glycosylation, protein solubility, and cytokine activity. In addition, abrogation of the two cysteine residues by mutagenesis dramatically altered the ability of IL-24 to secrete from host cells and resulted in the concomitant loss of IL-24 activity. We conclude that, unlike other IL-10 family members, human IL-24 must be glycosylated to maintain solubility and bioavailability. Further, a single, unique disulfide bond is required for secretion and activity. These structure-function relationships show that, although IL-24 is a member of the IL-19 subfamily of IL-10-like cytokines by sequence similarity, its surface properties and its distinctive disulfide arrangement make it unique. These observations could explain the novel biological activities measured of this cytokine. Understanding the structural basis of IL-24 activity will be important in the interpretation of the function of this cytokine and in the development of scale-up strategies for biophysical and clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1984545490,"The 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that regulates SHMT1 expression, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo thymidylate biosynthesis. In this study, we show that the SHMT1 IRES is the first example of a cellular IRES that is poly(A) tail-independent. Interactions between the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR functionally replaced interactions between the poly(A) tail and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to achieve maximal IRES-mediated translational efficiency. Depletion of the SHMT1 IRES-specific trans-acting factor (ITAF) CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) from in vitro translation extracts or deletion of the CUGBP1 binding site on the 3'-UTR of the SHMT1 transcript decreased the IRES activity of non-polyadenylylated biscistronic mRNAs relative to polyadenylylated biscistronic mRNAs and resulted in a requirement for PABP. We also identified a novel ITAF, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H2 (hnRNP H2), that stimulates SHMT1 IRES activity by binding to the 5'-UTR of the transcript and interacting with CUGBP1. Collectively, these data support a model for the IRES-mediated translation of SHMT1 whereby the circularization of the mRNA typically provided by the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G/PABP/poly(A) tail interaction is achieved instead through the hnRNP H2/CUGBP1-mediated interaction of the 5'- and 3'-UTRs of the SHMT1 transcript. This circularization enhances the IRES activity of SHMT1 by facilitating the recruitment and/or recycling of ribosomal subunits, which bind to the transcript in the middle of the 5'-UTR and migrate to the initiation codon via eIF4A-mediated scanning."
https://openalex.org/W2035897513,"Hsp90 chaperones stabilize many tyrosine kinases including several oncogenes, which are inhibited or induced to degrade by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA). As a consequence, GA has been developed for future chemotherapeutic use in several tumour types including neuroblastoma (NB). Alternative splicing of the neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA may have a pivotal function in regulating NB behaviour, with reports suggesting that tumour-suppressing signals from TrkA may be converted to oncogenic signals by stress-regulated alternative TrkAIII splicing. Within this context, it is important to know whether Hsp90 interacts with TrkA variants in NB cells and how GA influences this. Here, we report that both TrkAI and TrkAIII are Hsp90 clients in human NB cells. TrkAI exhibits GA-sensitive interaction with Hsp90 required for receptor endoplasmic reticulum export, maturation, cell surface stabilization and ligand-mediated activation, whereas TrkAIII exhibits GA-sensitive interactions with Hsp90 required for spontaneous activity and to a lesser extent stability. We show that GA inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of TrkAI expressing NB cells, whereas TrkAIII reduces the sensitivity of NB cells to GA-induced elimination. Our data suggest that GA-sensitive interactions with Hsp90 are critical for both TrkAI tumour suppressor and TrkAIII oncogenic function in NB and that TrkAIII expression exerts a negative impact on GA-induced NB cell eradication, which can be counteracted by a novel TrkAIII-specific peptide nucleic acid inhibitor."

PyMT-induced mammary tumorigenesis is closely correlated with robust telomerase expression and activity. To assess the role of telomerase activation and telomere maintenance in mammary carcinoma tumorigenesis, we generated mice expressing MUC1 and PyMT (MMT mice) but deficient in the telomerase RNA component, mTerc, on the C57BL/6 background. Successive generational intercrosses of mTerc−/−MMT mice produced cohorts with progressively shorter telomeres that were audited for mammary tumor formation. Relative to MMT (N=14) and G0 mTerc+/− female controls (G0=14), mTerc−/−MMT females (G1=11, G2=15, G3=15 and G4=5) showed decreased tumor volumes and increased tumor latency—MMT=95.6 days; G0 mTerc+/−MMT=98.6 days versus G1, G2, G3 and G4 mTerc−/−MMT mice with latencies of 122.6, 138.9, 140.7 and 220.9 days, respectively (controls versus G1–G4, P<0.005). The progressive impairment of lung metastasis was also observed with each successive mTerc−/−MMT generation. The impairment of tumorigenesis was associated with decreased proliferation of mammary epithelial and tumor cells and increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Together, these results indicate that, in the setting of viral oncoprotein mammary tumorigenesis, telomerase-dependent telomere maintenance facilitates the formation and metastatic progression of mammary tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1980500310,"We identified a novel GTPase, SLIP-GC, with expression limited to a few tissues, in particular germinal center B cells. It lacks homology to any known proteins, indicating that it may belong to a novel family of GTPases. SLIP-GC is expressed in germinal center B cells and in lymphomas derived from germinal center B cells such as large diffuse B cell lymphomas. In cell lines, SLIP-GC is expressed in lymphomas that express activation-induced deaminase (AID) and that likely undergo somatic hypermutation. SLIP-GC is a nuclear protein, and it localizes to replication factories. Reduction of SLIP-GC levels in the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji and in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines resulted in an increase in DNA breaks and apoptosis that was AID-dependent, as simultaneous reduction of AID abrogated the deleterious effects of SLIP-GC reduction. These results strongly suggest that SLIP-GC is a replication-related protein in germinal center B cells whose reduction is toxic to cells through an AID-dependent mechanism."

The aaRSs are a highly conserved family of enzymes comprised of two distinct structural groups referred to as classes I and II (1Ibba M. Soll D. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2006; 361: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), each enzyme has developed a high specificity in recognizing its cognate amino acid and tRNA, which is pivotal for accurate translation of the genetic code (1Ibba M. Soll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar).

The specificity of tRNA selection depends on a set of identity determinants that are mostly located at two distal extremities: the anticodon loop and the amino acid accepting stem. In a few instances, identity elements are also found in the D-arm, T-arm, and variable loop. They can either act as positive determinants that enhance aminoacylation or negative ones that prevent aminoacylation. The recognition of tRNAs by synthetases can also be affected by the modification of particular nucleotides (7Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Despite pronounced structural differences between the tRNA-binding domains in two SerRS types, in each case the N-terminal domain of one subunit interacts with the extra arm of tRNASer, to position the 3′-end of tRNA into the C-terminal active site of another subunit (23Biou V.

The recent crystal structure of the first archaeal/eukaryal SerRS from the archaeon P. horikoshii, and the structure-based model of the enzyme bound with the T. thermophilus and P. horikoshii tRNAsSer, suggested that the helical N-terminal domain of P. horikoshii SerRS is also involved in the binding of the extra arm of tRNA (17Itoh Y. Sekine S. Kuroishi C. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. RNA Biol. 2008; 5: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The recognition of tRNA by SerRS relies, besides on the long extra arm, on the identity elements in tRNASer acceptor arms, achieved by the motif 2 residues. Unlike the majority of aaRSs systems, the anticodon triplet is not recognized by SerRS. The first four base pairs in the tRNA acceptor arm (G1:C72, G2:C71, A/U3:U/A70, and R4:Y69) are identity elements for bacterial SerRS, and among them, the second G2:C71 base pair is the most significant (reviewed in Ref. 18Weygand-Durasevic I. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases.in: Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 177-192Google Scholar). Consistently, the crystal structure of the T. thermophilus SerRS·tRNASer complex revealed that SerRS interacts with the tRNASer acceptor stem, and Ser261 is responsible for the base-specific interaction with G2 (23Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 26Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the acceptor stem sequences are not well conserved among the eukaryal tRNASer isoacceptors, the discriminator base G73 is an essential identity requirement for human tRNASer and serves as an anti-determinant in lower eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 18Weygand-Durasevic I. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases.in: Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 177-192Google Scholar). Unlike eukaryal tRNAsSer, archaeal tRNAsSer conserve the G1:C72, C2:G71, C3:G70, and G4:C69 base pairs in the acceptor stem. However, the tRNA specificity of the archaeal/eukaryal SerRS from P. horikoshii seems to depend mainly on the extra arm, but not on the acceptor stem. Indeed, this enzyme exhibits quite relaxed specificity for tRNASer recognition (17Itoh Y. Sekine S. Kuroishi C. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. RNA Biol. 2008; 5: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri, which possesses two dissimilar SerRSs, one of a bacterial- and the other of methanogenic-type, provides an excellent system for studying the evolution of tRNASer determinants. Two enzymes recognize the same set of tRNA isoacceptors in vitro (27Korencic D. Polycarpo C. Weygand-Durasevic I. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48780-48786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have undertaken several approaches to elucidate the basis for their different serylation mechanisms. Kinetic analysis of variant tRNASer transcripts by the two archaeal SerRS enzymes (27Korencic D. Polycarpo C. Weygand-Durasevic I. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48780-48786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that the length of the variable arm is a critical recognition element for both enzymes, as is the identity of the discriminator base (G73) and base pair G30:C40 in the anticodon stem. However, additional determinants were identified as being required for specific serylation by the unusual methanogenic-type enzyme, which relies on G1:C72 identity and on the number of unpaired nucleotides at the base of the variable loop. The tRNA recognition pattern by two M. barkeri SerRS may differ in vivo, because only bacterial-type SerRS complements the function of thermolabile E. coli SerRS (28Lesjak S. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 294: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 2The abbreviations used are: aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (standard amino acid abbreviations precede RS throughout)SerRSseryl-tRNA synthetasemMbSerRSmethanogenic-type Methanosarcina barkeri SerRSMbtRNAGGASerM. barkeri tRNASer with anticodon GGASPRsurface plasmon resonanceWTwild typeDTTdithiothreitolMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (standard amino acid abbreviations precede RS throughout)SerRSseryl-tRNA synthetasemMbSerRSmethanogenic-type Methanosarcina barkeri SerRSMbtRNAGGASerM. barkeri tRNASer with anticodon GGASPRsurface plasmon resonanceWTwild typeDTTdithiothreitolMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. catalyze the activation of cognate amino acids and their transfer to the 3′-end of corresponding tRNA molecules. The aaRSs are a highly conserved family of enzymes comprised of two distinct structural groups referred to as classes I and II (1Ibba M. Soll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), with a notable exception of LysRS representatives, which belong to both classes (4Ibba M. Morgan S. Curnow A.W. Pridmore D.R. Vothknecht U.C. Gardner W. Lin W. Woese C.R. Söll D. Science. 1997; 278: 1119-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic mechanisms of various aaRSs are broadly similar (5Zhang C.M. Perona J.J. Ryu K. Francklyn C. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), each enzyme has developed a high specificity in recognizing its cognate amino acid and tRNA, which is pivotal for accurate translation of the genetic code (1Ibba M. Soll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The discrimination of the amino acids is based on recognizing the differences in the size and charge of the molecules (6Ataide S.F. Ibba M. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The specificity of tRNA selection depends on a set of identity determinants that are mostly located at two distal extremities: the anticodon loop and the amino acid accepting stem. In a few instances, identity elements are also found in the D-arm, T-arm, and variable loop. They can either act as positive determinants that enhance aminoacylation or negative ones that prevent aminoacylation. The recognition of tRNAs by synthetases can also be affected by the modification of particular nucleotides (7Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). AaRSs show divergent strategies for tRNA recognition. Most notably, class I and class II aaRSs (including pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase, see Ref. 9Nozawa K. O'Donoghue P. Gundllapalli S. Araiso Y. Ishitani R. Umehara T. Söll D. Nureki O. Nature. 2009; 457: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) approach tRNAs from the minor and major groove sides of the acceptor stem, respectively (10Ribas de Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Cell. 2001; 104: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the majority of determinants are in direct contact with cognate synthetases (8Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), the aminoacylation fidelity is controlled by kinetic differences more than by binding affinities (11Ebel J.P. Giegé R. Bonnet J. Kern D. Befort N. Bollack C. Fasiolo F. Gangloff J. Dirheimer G. Biochimie. 1973; 55: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (standard amino acid abbreviations precede RS throughout) seryl-tRNA synthetase methanogenic-type Methanosarcina barkeri SerRS M. barkeri tRNASer with anticodon GGA surface plasmon resonance wild type dithiothreitol 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (standard amino acid abbreviations precede RS throughout) seryl-tRNA synthetase methanogenic-type Methanosarcina barkeri SerRS M. barkeri tRNASer with anticodon GGA surface plasmon resonance wild type dithiothreitol 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. Seryl-tRNA synthetases (SerRSs), which catalyze the aminoacylation of several tRNASer isoacceptors and tRNASec with serine, can be divided into two structurally different groups: bacterial-type SerRSs function in a variety of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms, whereas the methanogenic-type was found only in methanogenic archaea (12Kim H.S. Vothknecht U.C. Hedderich R. Celic I. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6446-6449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tumbula D. Vothknecht U.C. Kim H.S. Ibba M. Min B. Li T. Pelaschier J. Stathopoulos C. Becker H. Söll D. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1269-1276PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on sequence comparison (14Lenhard B. Orellana O. Ibba M. Weygand-Duraseviæ I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 202-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and x-ray analyses, two subgroups of bacterial-type SerRSs were identified: one consists of the enzymes from bacterial sources, best represented by those from Thermus thermophilus (16Fujinaga M. Berthet-Colominas C. Yaremchuk A.D. Tukalo M.A. Cusack S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), and an archaeal/eukaryal-type, structurally related to SerRS from archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii (17Itoh Y. Sekine S. Kuroishi C. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. RNA Biol. 2008; 5: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All SerRSs are functional homodimers with a C-terminal active site domain typical for class II aaRSs and an N-terminal domain that is responsible for binding of the long variable arm of tRNASer isoacceptors (reviewed in Ref. 18Weygand-Durasevic I. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases.in: Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 177-192Google Scholar), with exception of the mammalian mitochondrial enzyme (19Chimnaronk S. Gravers Jeppesen M. Suzuki T. Nyborg J. Watanabe K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3369-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The long variable arm of tRNASer categorizes it as one of the type 2 tRNAs, including the tRNASer and tRNALeu species (from all organisms or domains of life) and bacterial tRNATyr species (20Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In bacterial-type SerRS, the N-terminal domain forms an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil structure (3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 16Fujinaga M. Berthet-Colominas C. Yaremchuk A.D. Tukalo M.A. Cusack S. J. Mol.
