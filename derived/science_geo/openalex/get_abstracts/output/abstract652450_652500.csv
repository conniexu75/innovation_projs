https://openalex.org/W3024643080,Respiratory immune characteristics associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity are currently unclear. We characterized bronchoalveolar lavage fluid immune cells from patients with varying severity of COVID-19 and from healthy people by using single-cell RNA sequencing. Proinflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages were abundant in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-9. Moderate cases were characterized by the presence of highly clonally expanded CD8+ T cells. This atlas of the bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment suggests potential mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and recovery in COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptome and T cell receptor analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid suggests enrichment of proinflammatory macrophages in patients with severe COVID-19 and the presence of clonally expanded CD8+ T cells in patients with moderate COVID-19.

Following an unprecedented global spread3, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Although data on COVID-19 in humans are emerging at a steady pace, some aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can be studied in detail only in animal models, in which repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory disease in rhesus macaques that lasts between 8 and 16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, which are a hallmark of COVID-19 in humans, were visible in lung radiographs. We detected high viral loads in swabs from the nose and throat of all of the macaques, as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one macaque, we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates the moderate disease that has been observed in the majority of human cases of COVID-19. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, and aid in the development and testing of medical countermeasures. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques causes a respiratory disease that recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in humans, establishing this species as an animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3024272360,"Global plastic litter pollution has been increasing alongside demand since plastic products gained commercial popularity in the 1930’s. Current plastic pollutant research has generally assumed that once plastics enter the ocean they are there to stay, retained permanently within the ocean currents, biota or sediment until eventual deposition on the sea floor or become washed up onto the beach. In contrast to this, we suggest it appears that some plastic particles could be leaving the sea and entering the atmosphere along with sea salt, bacteria, virus’ and algae. This occurs via the process of bubble burst ejection and wave action, for example from strong wind or sea state turbulence. In this manuscript we review evidence from the existing literature which is relevant to this theory and follow this with a pilot study which analyses microplastics (MP) in sea spray. Here we show first evidence of MP particles, analysed by μRaman, in marine boundary layer air samples on the French Atlantic coast during both onshore (average of 2.9MP/m3) and offshore (average of 9.6MP/m3) winds. Notably, during sampling, the convergence of sea breeze meant our samples were dominated by sea spray, increasing our capacity to sample MPs if they were released from the sea. Our results indicate a potential for MPs to be released from the marine environment into the atmosphere by sea-spray giving a globally extrapolated figure of 136000 ton/yr blowing on shore."
https://openalex.org/W3023918693,"Single-cell transcriptomics of neocortical neurons have revealed more than 100 clusters corresponding to putative cell types. For inhibitory and subcortical projection neurons (SCPNs), there is a strong concordance between clusters and anatomical descriptions of cell types. In contrast, cortico-cortical projection neurons (CCPNs) separate into surprisingly few transcriptomic clusters, despite their diverse anatomical projection types. We used projection-dependent single-cell transcriptomic analyses and monosynaptic rabies tracing to compare mouse primary visual cortex CCPNs projecting to different higher visual areas. We find that layer 2/3 CCPNs with different anatomical projections differ systematically in their gene expressions, despite forming only a single genetic cluster. Furthermore, these neurons receive feedback selectively from the same areas to which they project. These findings demonstrate that gene-expression analysis in isolation is insufficient to identify neuron types and have important implications for understanding the functional role of cortical feedback circuits."

https://openalex.org/W3023907854,"Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are composed of an amalgam of cells with distinct genotypes and phenotypes. Here, we reveal a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the biosynthetic capacities of CRC cells. We discover that the majority of ribosomal DNA transcription and protein synthesis in CRCs occurs in a limited subset of tumor cells that localize in defined niches. The rest of the tumor cells undergo an irreversible loss of their biosynthetic capacities as a consequence of differentiation. Cancer cells within the biosynthetic domains are characterized by elevated levels of the RNA polymerase I subunit A (POLR1A). Genetic ablation of POLR1A-high cell population imposes an irreversible growth arrest on CRCs. We show that elevated biosynthesis defines stemness in both LGR5+ and LGR5− tumor cells. Therefore, a common architecture in CRCs is a simple cell hierarchy based on the differential capacity to transcribe ribosomal DNA and synthesize proteins."

https://openalex.org/W3024555779,"Background 
Healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs may contribute to the transmission of influenza-like illness (ILI) to colleagues and susceptible patients by working while sick (presenteeism). The present study aimed to explore the views and behavior of HCWs and non-HCWs towards the phenomenon of working while experiencing ILI.


Methods 
The study was a cross-sectional online survey conducted between October 2018 and January 2019 to explore sickness presenteeism and the behaviour of HCWs and non-HCWs when experiencing ILI. The survey questionnaire was distributed to the members and international networks of the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC) Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Working Group, as well as via social media platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter and IPC Blog.


Results 
In total, 533 respondents from 49 countries participated (Europe 69.2%, Asia-Pacific 19.1%, the Americas 10.9%, and Africa 0.8%) representing 249 HCWs (46.7%) and 284 non-HCWs (53.2%). Overall, 312 (58.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 56.2–64.6) would continue to work when sick with ILI, with no variation between the two categories. Sixty-seven (26.9%) HCWs and forty-six (16.2%) non-HCWs would work with fever alone (p<0 .01) Most HCWs (89.2–99.2%) and non-HCWs (80%-96.5%) would work with “minor” ILI symptoms, such as sore throat, sinus cold, fatigue, sneezing, runny nose, mild cough and reduced appetite.


Conclusion 
A future strategy to successfully prevent the transmission of ILI in healthcare settings should address sick-leave policy management, in addition to encouraging the uptake of influenza vaccine."

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) deamination in RNA is among the most abundant RNA modifications in mammalian cells, and it can greatly affect the transcriptome by altering mRNA coding potential, modifying RNA structure, and regulating its localization (Walkley and Li, 2017Walkley C.R.

Immune responses interact with other cellular stress responses including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which results from the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (Bettigole and Glimcher, 2015Bettigole S.E.

Roles of endoplasmic reticulum stress in immune responses.Mol. Cells. 2018; 41: 705-716PubMed Google Scholar). ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved eukaryotic stress response mechanism mediated by IRE1/PERK/ATF6 signaling pathways, to restore ER homeostasis (Wang and Kaufman, 2016Wang M. Kaufman R.J. Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum as a conduit to human disease.Nature. 2016; 529: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). While ER stress and the UPR have been involved in cell fate decisions in a cell-context-dependent manner (Hetz, 2012Hetz C.

Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar, Wang and Kaufman, 2016Wang M. Kaufman R.J. Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum as a conduit to human disease.Nature. 2016; 529: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), how the IIR modulator ADAR1 and its RNA editing activity may functionally intersect with these pathways to regulate ER function and cell fate determination is currently unknown. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through somatic cell reprogramming with four transcription factors (i.e., Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc; also known as OSKM) (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K.

Under standard conditions, the OSKM reprogramming of fibroblasts involves an initial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) (Li et al., 2010Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W.

In this study, we found that absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing in reprogramming enabled MDA5 sensing and cytoplasmic retention of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) encoding membrane-associated proteins, which led to the upregulation of IIR, ER stress, and defective activation of the PERK signaling pathway of the UPR. Consequently, the transient ER stress that we found associated with MET during reprogramming becomes hyperactivated upon the loss of ADAR1, leading to the inhibition of epithelial cell fate specification and compromised iPSC generation. To investigate whether RNA editing participates in the somatic cell reprogramming process, we first employed an unbiased in silico approach using published RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets to compare A-to-I editing sites in somatic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and pluripotent iPSCs. Interestingly, the editing profiles of each cell line were sufficient to segregate the samples according to their cellular identity (Figures 1A and S1A–S1C) with a higher editing frequency in MEFs than iPSCs (Figure 1B), which was further confirmed using an A-to-I reporter system (Figures 1C and 1D). We next examined the effect of transient suppression of ADAR1 or ADAR2 in the acquisition of the pluripotent cell identity using MEFs harboring a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter under the control of the Pou5f1 (aka Oct4) gene (Pou5f1-GFP) transduced with the OSKM cassette. Intriguingly, we found that knockdown of Adar1, but not Adar2, was sufficient to significantly abrogate the generation of GFP+ iPSC colonies compared with a control small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting luciferase (Figures 1E, S1D, and S1E), concomitant with downregulation of the pluripotency genes (Figure S1F). Notably, the few iPSC colonies that arose from shAdar1-transduced MEFs did not have reduced Adar1 expression (Figure S1G). The impairment of somatic cell reprogramming by Adar1 depletion was due neither to the delay in iPSC formation (Figure S1H), nor to the reprogramming barrier function of cell contact inhibition despite a slight increase of MEF proliferation upon Adar1 depletion (Figures S1I and S1J). Notably, the ADAR1 requirement for reprogramming was also conserved in the human system (Figure 1F). In addition, knockdown of Adar1 not only abrogated OSKM reprogramming of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Figure S1K) but also significantly reduced reprogramming of MEFs transduced with Pei’s seven-factor (7F) cocktail (i.e., Jdp2, Jhdm1b, Mkk6, Glis1, Nanog, Esrrb, and Sall4) (Wang et al., 2019Wang B. Wu L. Li D. Liu Y. Guo J. Li C. Yao Y. Wang Y. Zhao G. Wang X. et al.Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Jdp2-Jhdm1b-Mkk6-Glis1-Nanog-Essrb-Sall4.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 3473-3485.e3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Figure 1G). Furthermore, depletion of Adar1 compromised the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced neurons (Chanda et al., 2014Chanda S. Ang C.E. Davila J. Pak C. Mall M. Lee Q.Y. Ahlenius H. Jung S.W. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Generation of induced neuronal cells by the single reprogramming factor ASCL1.Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3: 282-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Figure 1H). Altogether, these data support a critical role for ADAR1 in reprogramming cell fates that is not restricted to OSKM reprogramming cocktail or fibroblasts. To address the specific contribution of A-to-I editing activity to cell fate transitions during reprogramming, we derived MEFs from Adar1Fl/Fl and Adar1Fl/E861A mice with CreERT2 knocked into Rosa26 locus (Hartner et al., 2009Hartner J.C. Walkley C.R. Lu J. Orkin S.H. ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of hematopoiesis and suppression of interferon signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, Liddicoat et al., 2015Liddicoat B.J. Piskol R. Chalk A.M. Ramaswami G. Higuchi M. Hartner J.C. Li J.B. Seeburg P.H. Walkley C.R. RNA editing by ADAR1 prevents MDA5 sensing of endogenous dsRNA as nonself.Science. 2015; 349: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) renders these mice or cells either Adar1 null (for Adar1Fl/Fl) or only expressing editing-deficient Adar1E861A (for Adar1Fl/E861A) (Figure S1L). In line with our shRNA experiments, genetic depletion of Adar1 impaired the formation of alkaline-phosphatase-positive (AP+) colonies (Figure 1I), and more importantly, the editing mutant (MUT) mirrored the effects of ADAR1 null with compromised somatic cell reprogramming (Figure 1J). Furthermore, the reprogramming defects elicited by ADAR1 deficiency (i.e., Adar1Fl/Fl + 4OHT) can only be rescued by the ectopic expression of a wild-type (WT), but not editing mutant (E861A), ADAR1 (Figure 1I). Altogether, these data establish the essential role of A-to-I editing activity for pluripotency acquisition in reprogramming. To investigate the time window when ADAR1 activity is required during the multistep reprogramming process, we first evaluated iPSC formation at day 14 and observed that Adar1 depletion failed not only to induce the expression of the pluripotency regulator NANOG and the epithelial marker CDH1 (aka E-CADHERIN) but also to suppress the fibroblast mesenchymal factor CDH2 (Figure 2A), suggesting a possible defect on MET. Supporting this, gene expression dynamics showed that loss of Adar1 resulted in reduced transcriptional activation of epithelial genes and inefficient shutdown of mesenchymal genes (Figures 2B and S2A). Immunofluorescence analysis at day 7 for early reprogramming markers (i.e., CDH1 and SSEA1) further confirmed the requirement of ADAR1 for MET during iPSC formation (Figure S2B). Likewise, genetic depletion of ADAR1 demonstrated that ADAR1 plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional activation of the epithelial program in this initiation phase of reprogramming (Figure 2C). Importantly, presence of editing-deficient ADAR1 protein (Adar1E861A) was not sufficient to restore proper MET (Figure 2D). Taken together, these results establish an essential role for RNA A-to-I editing activity of ADAR1 in the earliest phase of reprogramming that involves a requisite MET. We then addressed potential roles of ADAR1 beyond MET during iPSC generation. While confirming the requisite role of ADAR1 at the earliest stage of reprogramming coinciding with MET (i.e., days 1–5) (Figure 2E), we observed, however, no significant differences in iPSC formation between vehicle (Veh)- or 4OHT-treated Adar1Fl/Fl MEFs at later time points (Figure 2E) when the epithelial fate has already been established. Such an ADAR1 dispensability after MET was further supported by nonsignificant effects of ADAR1 depletion on reprogramming to iPSCs of epithelial intermediate state cells (aka pre-iPSC) (Costa et al., 2013Costa Y. Ding J. Theunissen T.W. Faiola F. Hore T.A. Shliaha P.V. Fidalgo M. Saunders A. Lawrence M. Dietmann S. et al.NANOG-dependent function of TET1 and TET2 in establishment of pluripotency.Nature. 2013; 495: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) (Figure 2F) or somatic epithelial normal murine mammary gland cells (Figures S2C and S2D). Next, we investigated whether depletion of Adar1 influences the late stabilization phase, when reprogrammed cells have activated the pluripotency gene program and successfully transited to iPSCs (Plath and Lowry, 2011Plath K. Lowry W.E. Progress in understanding reprogramming to the induced pluripotent state.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For this, we established stable Adar1Fl/Fl iPSCs followed by 4OHT treatment over a period of >10 passages to deplete ADAR1. We found that Adar1 knockout (KO) cells maintained a normal undifferentiated iPSC morphology with stem-cell-specific alkaline phosphatase (AP) positivity (Figure 2G). Colony-formation assays (Figure 2H) and gene expression analyses (Figures S2E–S2G) revealed no significant differences in self-renewal between Adar1 KO and WT iPSCs. Of note, Adar1 KO iPSCs are compromised in differentiation toward mesoderm and endoderm lineages (Figures S2H and S2I). Together, these results support a nonessential role for ADAR1 in later stages of reprogramming beyond MET and in the maintenance of iPSCs with an epithelial cell identity. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of ADAR1 and its editing activity on MET, we performed transcriptional profiling at day 7 of OSKM reprogramming of Adar1Fl/Fl and Adar1Fl/E861A MEFs treated with vehicle or 4OHT. We identified 668 upregulated and 1,162 downregulated genes (fold change [FC] > 2) in the absence of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing (Figures 3A and S3A–S3C; Table S1) with the enrichment of “response to stress” and “endoplasmic reticulum (ER)” Gene Ontology (GO) categories (Figure 3B). Considering that ER-translated membrane proteins represent a significant fraction of the total proteome (Diehn et al., 2000Diehn M. Eisen M.B. Botstein D. Brown P.O.

Indeed, we observed the upregulation of UPR-related genes during a short time window coincident with MET, indicative of a “transient ER stress” that is compatible with epithelial gene activation during normal reprogramming (Figure 3C). More importantly, we found a significant upregulation of genes related to ER stress and the UPR at the MET stage during reprogramming of MEFs deficient for ADAR1 or its editing activity, while housekeeping genes remained unchanged (Figures 3D and 3E). These results suggest that the observed “hyperactivated ER stress” upon the loss of ADAR1 or its editing activity may be detrimental to MET, which was confirmed by our following experiments. First, we ectopically induced ER stress with tunicamycin and thapsigargin and found that acquisition of epithelial cell identity and reprogramming were significantly compromised (Figures 3F and 3G). Second, we performed OSKM-mediated MEF reprogramming with forced expression of a dominant-negative isoform of the chaperone GRP78 (aka BiP or HSPA5), which acts upstream of the UPR to modulate ER (Hendershot et al., 1995Hendershot L.M. Wei J.Y. Gaut J.R. Lawson B. Freiden P.J. Murti K.G. In vivo expression of mammalian BiP ATPase mutants causes disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and found that this UPR disruption also compromised reprogramming (Figure S3D). Third, we employed genetical interventions to promote UPR function by ectopic expression of WT GRP78 or ATF4, which led to significantly increased reprogramming efficiency (Figure S3E). In contrast, knockdown of UPR-related genes (i.e., Atf6, Ire1, and Atf3) severely compromised iPSC generation (Figure S3F). Fourth, we observed that induction of ER stress with tunicamycin or GRP78DN mainly abrogated reprogramming of Adar1 WT cells at early, but not later, phases of iPSC generation, when MET takes place (Figure S3G). Fifth, we treated Adar1 WT MEFs with the ER stress inhibitors salubrinal (Boyce et al., 2005Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. A selective inhibitor of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation protects cells from ER stress.Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) and azoramide (Fu et al., 2015Fu S. Yalcin A. Lee G.Y. Li P. Fan J. Arruda A.P. Pers B.M. Yilmaz M. Eguchi K. Hotamisligil G.S. Phenotypic assays identify azoramide as a small-molecule modulator of the unfolded protein response with antidiabetic activity.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 292ra98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and observed enhanced MET and reprogramming (Figures S3H and S3I). Lastly, we used same ER stress inhibitors to curtail or suppress the hyperactivated ER stress during reprogramming of Adar1 editing activity-deficient MEFs and observed the rescue of both epithelial gene activation (Figure 3H) and iPSC formation (Figure 3I). These results together establish that hyperactivated ER stress, resulting from the loss of ADAR1 RNA editing activity, acts as an intrinsic barrier that preserves the mesenchymal phenotype of fibroblasts and hampers MET during reprogramming to epithelial fated iPSCs. To delineate the molecular events leading to the hyperactivated ER stress during reprogramming in the absence of ADAR1, we first asked whether aberrant IIRs observed in mutant mouse (Hartner et al., 2009Hartner J.C. Walkley C.R. Lu J. Orkin S.H. ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of hematopoiesis and suppression of interferon signaling.Nat.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and GO analysis revealed the upregulation of gene signatures related to innate immune/interferon responses (Figures 4A and S4A). Notably, among the most differentially expressed genes, 70 IIR-related markers were significantly upregulated in both Adar1 KO and editing mutant cells at day 7 of reprogramming (Figures 4B and S4B). Of note, a transient activation of IIR concomitantly with UPR activation during MET was also observed in reprogramming even with a lentivirus-free transducing system (Figures 4C and S4C). Importantly, ADAR1 depletion resulted in a sustained derepression of IIR during reprogramming (Figure S4D). Furthermore, by analyzing gene interaction networks using the STRING database, we found that 94.8% of the IIR genes activated during MET were related to response to stress, membrane-bounded organelle, or both (Figure S4E). The sustained derepression of the IIR produced by the absence of ADAR1 can be rescued by genetic deletion of MDA5 (Ifih1 gene) or MAVS (Mavs gene), but not RIG-I (Ddx58 gene) (Liddicoat et al., 2015Liddicoat B.J.

To test whether an analogous mechanism may operate during reprogramming of Adar1-deficient cells, we performed loss-of-function studies of both IIR transducers (Ifih1 and Ddx58) and their effector (Mavs). In WT cells where ADAR1 is intact, we found that Ifih1 knockdown did not affect reprogramming and that depletion of Ddx58 and Mavs greatly reduced iPSC generation (Figures S4F and S4G). However, in Adar1-depleted cells, we observed that only knockdown of Ifih1, but not Ddx58 or Mavs, was able to rescue efficient reprogramming (Figure 4D). In line with this finding, genetic ablation of Ifih1 abrogated the observed IIR derepression (Figure S4D) in ADAR1 editing-deficient cells during MET (Figure 4E). Remarkably, we also observed that the hyperactivated ER stress genes caused by absence of ADAR1 catalytic activity was substantially reduced in MDA5 (Ifih1)-depleted cells (Figure 4F). Consequently, the removal of Ifih1 was sufficient to rescue both the activation of the epithelial Cdh1 gene during early reprogramming (Figures 4G, S4H, and S4I) and final iPSC formation (Figures 4H and S4J). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ADAR1-dependent A-to-I RNA editing safeguards MET by restraining MDA5-mediated IIR and ER stress associated with the reprogramming process. The accumulation of misfolded proteins leading to ER stress is buffered by the activation of the UPR under both physiological and pathological conditions (Schröder and Kaufman, 2005Schröder M.

Camera trap (CT) data can be used to estimate animal distribution, density, and behaviour. Attractants, such as scent lures, are often used in an effort to increase CT detections; however, the degree which the effects of attractants vary across species is not well understood. We investigated the effects of scent lure on mammal detections by comparing detection rates between 404 lured and 440 unlured CT stations sampled in Alberta, Canada over 120 day survey periods between February and August in 2015 and 2016. We used zero-inflated negative binomial generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of lure on detection rates for a) all mammals, b) six functional groups (all predator species, all prey, large carnivores, small carnivores, small mammals, ungulates), and c) four varied species of management interest (fisher, Pekania pennanti; gray wolf, Canis lupus; moose, Alces alces; and Richardson’s ground squirrel; Urocitellus richardsonii). Mammals were detected at 800 of the 844 CTs, with nearly equal numbers of total detections at CTs with (7110) and without (7530) lure, and variable effects of lure on groups and individual species. Scent lure significantly increased detections of predators as a group, including large and small carnivore sub-groups and fisher specifically, but not of gray wolf. There was no effect of scent lure on detections of prey species, including the small mammal and ungulate sub-groups and moose and Richardson’s ground squirrel specifically. We recommend that researchers explicitly consider the variable effects of scent lure on CT detections across species when designing, interpreting, or comparing multi-species surveys. Additional research is needed to further quantify variation in species responses to scent lures and other attractants, and to elucidate the effect of attractants on community-level inferences from camera trap surveys."

The genetic and epigenetic changes that underlie this malignancy are incompletely understood. We found that ASH1-like histone lysine methyltransferase (ASH1L) is overexpressed in ATC relative to the much less aggressive and more common differentiated thyroid cancer. This increased expression was due at least in part to reduced levels of microRNA-200b-3p (miR-200b-3p), which represses ASH1L expression, in ATC. Genetic knockout of ASH1L protein expression in ATC cell lines decreased cell growth both in culture and in mouse xenografts. RNA-Seq analysis of ASH1L knockout versus WT ATC cell lines revealed that ASH1L is involved in the regulation of numerous cancer-related genes and gene sets. The pro-oncogenic long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 1 (CCAT1) was one of the most highly (approximately 68-fold) down-regulated transcripts in ASH1L knockout cells. Therefore, we investigated CCAT1 as a potential mediator of the growth-inducing activity of ASH1L. Supporting this hypothesis, CCAT1 knockdown in ATC cells decreased their growth rate, and ChIP-Seq data indicated that CCAT1 is likely a direct target of ASH1L's histone methyltransferase activity. These results indicate that ASH1L contributes to the aggressiveness of ATC and suggest that ASH1L, along with its upstream regulator miR-200b-3p and its downstream mediator CCAT1, represents a potential therapeutic target in ATC.

Thyroid carcinoma, the most common endocrine malignancy (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2020.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2020; 70 (31912902): 7-3010.3322/caac.21590Crossref PubMed Scopus (6739) Google Scholar), is divided into the major histological types papillary (∼90% of thyroid cancers), follicular (∼6%), anaplastic (∼1%), and medullary (∼2%). Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers (PTCs and FTCs) are generally well-differentiated tumors that can be treated successfully with surgery and radioiodine. Consequently, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data indicate that the overall 5-year survival of patients with thyroid cancer is very high, ∼98% (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/thyro.html, Accessed December 20, 2019). In contrast, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive and least treatable human malignancies, with a median life expectancy of ∼6 months from the time of diagnosis (2Kebebew E. Greenspan F.S. Clark O.H. Woeber K.A. McMillan A. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

Thus, although ATC accounts for only ∼1% of thyroid cancer diagnoses, it accounts for as much as 39% of thyroid cancer deaths (2Kebebew E. Greenspan F.S. Clark O.H. Woeber K.A. McMillan A. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Treatment outcome and prognostic factors.Cancer. 2005; 103 (15739211): 1330-133510.1002/cncr.20936Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Kitamura Y. Shimizu K.

Although ATCs arise from thyroid follicular cells, they do not retain any of the biological characteristics of the normal thyroid, such as iodide uptake, thyroglobulin synthesis, or dependence on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Multiple molecular and genetic factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ATC. Some ATCs are associated with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) components, and if the DTC contains a classic thyroid cancer driver mutation such as BRAF V600E, that mutation also is found in the ATC (4Nikiforova M.N. Kimura E.T. Gandhi M. Biddinger P.W. Knauf J.A. Basolo F. Zhu Z. Giannini R. Salvatore G. Fusco A. Santoro M. Fagin J.A. Nikiforov Y.E.

However, some ATCs lack a DTC component, and in such cases the developmental pathway is obscure. Relative to DTCs, ATCs are more likely to harbor mutations in the TERT promoter (5Bonhomme B.

For example, miR-146b, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-17-92 are up-regulated, and miR-200, miR-30, let-7d, and let-7g are repressed (reviewed in Ref. 11Pallante P. Battista S. Pierantoni G.M. Fusco A.

Many of these changes may contribute to the aggressive biology of ATC. For example, evidence suggests that decreased miR-200 contributes to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and decreased miR-30 contributes to invasion and migration. In addition to genetic changes, epigenetic perturbations contribute to oncogenesis. Trithorax and Polycomb group proteins act antagonistically in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Trithorax group proteins usually activate gene expression and counteract Polycomb group protein-mediated gene silencing (12Schuettengruber B. Martinez A.M. Iovino N. Cavalli G.

This study provided evidence that FTCs have increased expression of ASH1L protein (but not RNA) relative to PTCs and that increased ASH1L protein is a consequence of reduced expression of miR-142-3p, which decreases the translation of ASH1L mRNA. In the present study, we demonstrate that ASH1L protein abundance is much greater in ATCs than PTCs. Genetic knockout (KO) of ASH1L protein expression in ATC cell lines inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft tumor formation in vivo. We identify ASH1L-responsive genes, including Colon cancer associated transcript 1 (CCAT1), that are potential mediators of ASH1L's oncogenic actions in ATC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-200b-3p, which is expressed at very low levels in ATC relative to PTC and FTC (26Braun J. Hoang-Vu C. Dralle H. Hüttelmaier S. Downregulation of microRNAs directs the EMT and invasive potential of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.Oncogene. 2010; 29 (20498632): 4237-424410.1038/onc.2010.169Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Hébrant A.

Therefore, decreased levels of miR-200b-3p likely underlie increased ASH1L protein abundance in ATC. The data together suggest that ASH1L, miR-200-3p, and CCAT1 are potential therapeutic targets in ATC. Published data support the hypothesis that ASH1L protein is overexpressed in FTC compared with PTC (25Colamaio M. Puca F. Ragozzino E. Gemei M. Decaussin-Petrucci M. Aiello C. Bastos A.U. Federico A. Chiappetta G. Del Vecchio L. Torregrossa L. Battista S. Fusco A. miR-142-3p down-regulation contributes to thyroid follicular tumorigenesis by targeting ASH1L and MLL1.J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Given that ATC presents a much more intractable clinical problem, we tested whether ASH1L might play a role in this disease. We performed Western blotting of nuclear extracts from six fresh frozen ATCs and five PTCs (Fig. 1A). Quantification of the ASH1L bands normalized to lamin B1 shows that the median ASH1L protein expression is at least 5-fold greater in ATCs than PTCs (p = 0.0022) (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that ASH1L is expressed at similar or greater levels in the ATC cell lines BHT-101, SW1736, and JEM493, compared with the FTC cell lines FTC-133, FTC-236, FTC-238, TT2609-C02, and 8505C (Fig. 1, C and D). These data suggest that ASH1L may play a role in the aggressive biology of ATC. In the published study on ASH1L in FTC (25Colamaio M. Puca F. Ragozzino E. Gemei M. Decaussin-Petrucci M. Aiello C.

Metab. 2015; 100 (25238203): E59-E6910.1210/jc.2014-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Western blots showed that the ASH1L immunoreactive bands were smaller than expected and were cytoplasmic. However, in our studies, ASH1L is nuclear, and we have found no evidence of smaller ASH1L species, defined as immunoreactive bands that disappear upon genetic ASH1L KO. We used two shRNAs to knock down ASH1L mRNA and protein in BHT-101 cells by ∼50% (Fig. S1A), which resulted in decreased growth rates assessed by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (Fig. S1B). We injected 5 × 106 ASH1L shRNA (referred to here as shASH1L) or control shRNA (referred to here as shControl) BHT-101 cells subcutaneously into each of 6 NOD-SCID mice. Tumors formed in all mice, but the tumor growth rate was ∼50% lower with the shASH1L cells, and those tumors were ∼50% smaller by weight at sacrifice than those of the shControl cells (Fig. S1, C to E). Given these encouraging results, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out ASH1L expression in BHT-101 cells. CRISPR-Cas9 and four guide RNAs (gRNAs) that target different regions of exon 3 or 11 were used to create four BHT-101 cell lines with premature stop codons in both alleles of ASH1L. The positions of the stop codons are shown schematically in Fig. 2A, along with several functional domains of the protein (14An S. Yeo K.J. Jeon Y.H. Song J.J. Crystal structure of the human histone methyltransferase ASH1L catalytic domain and its implications for the regulatory mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21239497): 8369-837410.1074/jbc.M110.203380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The minimum catalytic domain is the SET domain, and all stop codons terminate translation before this domain. Sanger sequencing confirmed the following. In clone 1, one allele encodes ASH1L amino acids 1–413 followed by the novel sequence QV*, and the other encodes amino acids 1–413 followed by the novel sequence GRSDQ* (the asterisk signifies a stop codon). In clone 2, both alleles encode ASH1L amino acids 1–610 followed immediately by a stop codon. In clone 3, one allele encodes ASH1L amino acids 1–2129 followed by the novel sequence PEDTEA*, and the other encodes amino acids 1–2129 followed by the novel sequence TEDTEA*. In clone 4, one allele encodes ASH1L amino acids 1–2174 followed by the novel sequence RGGRQ*, and the other encodes amino acids 1–2169 followed by a stop codon. Since these proteins terminate before translation of the catalytic domain, they would not be enzymatically active even if expressed. However, the only antibody that works well in Western blots (A301-749A; Bethyl) targets the very C terminus of the protein, so we cannot assess the expression of putative prematurely truncated species. As expected, all 4 clones show complete loss of ASH1L protein by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). All 4 clones have ∼50% decreased ASH1L mRNA levels, likely reflecting nonsense-mediated decay (assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR); data not shown). Importantly, all four ASH1L KO clones grow slowly in culture, assessed by MTT assay (Fig. 2C, left) and validated by direct cell counting (Fig. 2C, right). These data confirm that growth of the BHT-101 ATC cell line in culture depends on ASH1L. To assess whether ASH1L dependence is a property of ATC cell lines in addition to BHT-101, we also studied the ATC cell lines SW1736 and JEM493. Both BHT-101 and SW1736 contain a BRAF V600E mutation, and JEM493 contains HRAS Q61R. We used CRISPR-Cas9 and the same gRNAs that were used for BHT-101 cells to create frameshift mutations in both ASH1L alleles of SW1736 and JEM493 cells. Western blots confirmed loss of ASH1L protein (Fig. S2A). ASH1L KO decreased the growth rates of SW1736 and JEM493 cells (Fig. S2B), indicating that ASH1L dependence is not unique to BHT-101 cells and does not require BRAF V600E. We focused on BHT-101 cells to investigate the role of ASH1L in ATC cell growth in vivo. We injected 5 × 106 WT BHT-101 cells and KO clones 1 and 4 into the flanks of NOD-SCID mice (6 animals each). As shown in Fig. 2D, all 6 mice receiving WT cells were sacrificed at day 29 postinjection due to the formation of large tumors, 0.91 ± 0.17 g (mean ± S.D.). In contrast, the clone 4 mice were sacrificed at day 48, at which time they had small tumors, 0.15 ± 0.11 g (p < 0.0001 versus WT, 2-tailed t test). The clone 1 mice were sacrificed at day 42 and had no detectable tumors at that time. These results indicate that BHT-101 cell growth in vivo is highly ASH1L dependent. To identify ASH1L-regulated genes, an RNA-Seq analysis was performed on mRNA from the 4 BHT-101 ASH1L KO clones, compared with 3 separate passages of the WT BHT-101 cells. We used a stringent definition of differentially expressed genes as those with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 and an absolute fold change (FC) of >2 in the same direction in all 4 KO lines versus the WT cells. This resulted in 53 down-regulated genes and 103 induced genes in the KO cells, implying that ASH1L induces 53 genes and represses 103. A heat map of these differentially expressed genes is shown in Fig. 3. The 15 genes most significantly down-regulated by ASH1L KO, and the 15 genes most significantly induced, are shown in Table 1, and the complete list is provided in Table S1. We used RT-qPCR to confirm the RNA-Seq data for 10 of the differentially expressed genes, and the results were uniformly consistent (Table S1, last column).Table 1Most significantly down-regulated and up-regulated genes in ASH1L KO BHT-101 cells compared to WT BHT-101 cellsaThe 15 most significantly up-regulated and 15 most significantly down-regulated genes are shown.

Methods Here, we evaluated lncRNAs differentially expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a cDNA microarray data set obtained in a previous study from our group. Using in silico analyses in combination with a review of the current literature, we identify three lncRNAs as potential prognostic factors for TNBC patients. Results We found that the expression of WDFY3-AS2, BDNF-AS, and AFAP1-AS1 was associated with poor survival in patients with TNBCs. WDFY3-AS2 and BDNF-AS are lncRNAs known to play an important role in tumor suppression of different types of cancer, while AFAP1-AS1 exerts oncogenic activity. Conclusion Our findings provided evidence that WDFY3-AS2, BDNF-AS, and AFAP1-AS1 may be potential prognostic factors in TNBC development."
https://openalex.org/W3025932998,"Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis caused by traumatic implantation of many species of black fungi. Due to the refractoriness of some cases and common recurrence of CBM, a more effective and less time-consuming treatment is mandatory. The aim of this study was to identify compounds with in vitro antifungal activity in the Pathogen Box® compound collection against different CBM agents. Synergism of these compounds with drugs currently used to treat CBM was also assessed. An initial screening of the drugs present in this collection at 1 μM was performed with a Fonsecaea pedrosoi clinical strain according to the EUCAST protocol. The compounds with activity against this fungus were also tested against other seven etiologic agents of CBM (Cladophialophora carrionii, Phialophora verrucosa, Exophiala jeanselmei, Exophiala dermatitidis, Fonsecaea monophora, Fonsecaea nubica, and Rhinocladiella similis) at concentrations ranging from 0.039 to 10 μM. The analysis of potential synergism of these compounds with itraconazole and terbinafine was performed by the checkerboard method. Eight compounds inhibited more than 60% of the F. pedrosoi growth: difenoconazole, bitertanol, iodoquinol, azoxystrobin, MMV688179, MMV021013, trifloxystrobin, and auranofin. Iodoquinol produced the lowest MIC values (1.25–2.5 μM) and MMV688179 showed MICs that were higher than all compounds tested (5 - >10 μM). When auranofin and itraconazole were tested in combination, a synergistic interaction (FICI = 0.37) was observed against the C. carrionii isolate. Toxicity analysis revealed that MMV021013 showed high selectivity indices (SI ≥ 10) against the fungi tested. In summary, auranofin, iodoquinol, and MMV021013 were identified as promising compounds to be tested in CBM models of infection."

Inhibition of sEH is used as a strategy to increase EET levels leading to lower inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to destruction of joint tissues. This pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between the immune system, and environmental factors. Here, we investigate the effects of inhibiting sEH with 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) on a collagen-induced arthritis model. The treatment with TPPU ameliorates hyperalgesia, edema, and decreases the expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines of Th1 and Th17 profiles, while increasing Treg cells. Considering the challenges to control RA, this study provides robust data supporting that inhibition of the sEH is a promising target to treat arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3024155612,"Cell signaling pathways play key roles in coordinating cellular events in development. The Notch signaling pathway is highly conserved across all multicellular animals and is known to coordinate a multitude of diverse cellular events, including proliferation, differentiation, fate specification, and cell death. Specific functions of the pathway are, however, highly context-dependent and are not well characterized in post-traumatic regeneration. Here, we use a small-molecule inhibitor of the pathway (DAPT) to demonstrate that Notch signaling is required for proper arm regeneration in the brittle star Ophioderma brevispina, a highly regenerative member of the phylum Echinodermata. We also employ a transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) to characterize the downstream genes controlled by the Notch pathway in the brittle star regeneration. We demonstrate that arm regeneration involves an extensive cross-talk between the Notch pathway and other cell signaling pathways. In the regrowing arm, Notch regulates the composition of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as components of the innate immune response. We also show for the first time that Notch signaling regulates the activity of several transposable elements. Our data also suggests that one of the possible mechanisms through which Notch sustains its activity in the regenerating tissues is via suppression of Neuralized1."

To better understand users, needs and inform peri-urban sanitation policy, our study used multivariate stepwise logistic regression to assess the factors associated with use of improved (toilet) and unimproved (chamber) sanitation facilities among peri-urban residents. We analysed data from 205 household heads in 1 peri-urban settlement of Lusaka, Zambia on socio-demographics (economic status, education level, marital status, etc.), household sanitation characteristics (toilet facility, ownership and management) and household diarrhoea prevalence. Household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities were assessed based on WHO-UNICEF criteria. Of particular interest was the simultaneous use of toilet facilities and chambers, an alternative form of unimproved sanitation with focus towards all-in-one suitable alternatives. Findings revealed that having a regular income, private toilet facility, improved drinking water and handwashing facility were all positively correlated to having an improved toilet facility. Interestingly, both improved toilets and chambers indicated increased odds for diarrhoea prevalence. Odds of chamber usage were also higher for females and users of unimproved toilet facilities. Moreover, when toilets were owned by residents, and hygiene was managed externally, use of chambers was more likely. Findings finally revealed higher diarrhoea prevalence for toilets with more users. Results highlight the need for a holistic, simultaneous approach to WASH for overall success in sanitation. To better access and increase peri-urban sanitation, this study recommends a separate sanitation ladder for high density areas which considers improved private and shared facilities, toilet management and all-inclusive usage (cancelling unimproved alternatives). It further calls for financial plans supporting urban poor access to basic sanitation and increased education on toilet facility models, hygiene, management and risk to help with choice and proper facility use to maximize toilet use benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3024368629,"Individual electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical reports are often part of a larger sequence—for example, a single patient may generate multiple reports over the trajectory of a disease. In applications such as cancer pathology reports, it is necessary not only to extract information from individual reports, but also to capture aggregate information regarding the entire cancer case based off case-level context from all reports in the sequence. In this paper, we introduce a simple modular add-on for capturing case-level context that is designed to be compatible with most existing deep learning architectures for text classification on individual reports. We test our approach on a corpus of 431,433 cancer pathology reports, and we show that incorporating case-level context significantly boosts classification accuracy across six classification tasks—site, subsite, laterality, histology, behavior, and grade. We expect that with minimal modifications, our add-on can be applied towards a wide range of other clinical text-based tasks."

Thus, this study was conducted to assess and compare the performance of four machine-learning methods in modeling and forecasting brucellosis time series data based on climatic parameters. Methods In this cohort study, human brucellosis cases and climatic parameters were analyzed on a monthly basis for the Qazvin province–located in northwestern Iran- over a period of 9 years (2010–2018). The data were classified into two subsets of education (80%) and testing (20%). Artificial neural network methods (radial basis function and multilayer perceptron), support vector machine and random forest were fitted to each set. Performance analysis of the models were done using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Root Error (MARE), and R2 criteria. Results The incidence rate of the brucellosis in Qazvin province was 27.43 per 100,000 during 2010–2019. Based on our results, the values of the RMSE (0.22), MAE (0.175), MARE (0.007) criteria were smaller for the multilayer perceptron neural network than their values in the other three models. Moreover, the R2 (0.99) value was bigger in this model. Therefore, the multilayer perceptron neural network exhibited better performance in forecasting the studied data. The average wind speed and mean temperature were the most effective climatic parameters in the incidence of this disease. Conclusions The multilayer perceptron neural network can be used as an effective method in detecting the behavioral trend of brucellosis over time. Nevertheless, further studies focusing on the application and comparison of these methods are needed to detect the most appropriate forecast method for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3025037436,"We previously identified a 210 kb region on chromosome 11 (50.37-50.58 Mb, mm10) containing two protein-coding genes (Hnrnph1, Rufy1) that was necessary for reduced methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in C57BL/6J congenic mice harboring DBA/2J polymorphisms. Gene editing of a small deletion in the first coding exon supported Hnrnph1 as a quantitative trait gene. We have since shown that Hnrnph1 mutants also exhibit reduced methamphetamine-induced reward, reinforcement, and dopamine release. However, the quantitative trait variants (QTVs) that modulate Hnrnph1 function at the molecular level are not known. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms and seven indels distinguish C57BL/6J from DBA/2J within Hnrnph1, including four variants within the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Here, we show that a 114 kb introgressed region containing Hnrnph1 and Rufy1 was sufficient to cause a decrease in MA-induced locomotor activity. Gene-level transcriptome analysis of striatal tissue from 114 kb congenics vs Hnrnph1 mutants identified a nearly perfect correlation of fold-change in expression for those differentially expressed genes that were common to both mouse lines, indicating functionally similar effects on the transcriptome and behavior. Exon-level analysis (including noncoding exons) revealed decreased 5′ UTR usage of Hnrnph1 and immunoblot analysis identified a corresponding decrease in hnRNP H protein in 114 kb congenic mice. Molecular cloning of the Hnrnph1 5′ UTR containing all four variants (but none of them individually) upstream of a reporter induced a decrease in reporter signal in both HEK293 and N2a cells, thus, identifying a set of QTVs underlying molecular regulation of Hnrnph1."
https://openalex.org/W3025368587,"Peronospora effusa (previously known as P. farinosa f. sp. spinaciae, and here referred to as Pfs) is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes downy mildew on spinach (Spinacia oleracea). To combat this destructive many disease resistant cultivars have been bred and used. However, new Pfs races rapidly break the employed resistance genes. To get insight into the gene repertoire of Pfs and identify infection-related genes, the genome of the first reference race, Pfs1, was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. Due to the obligate biotrophic nature of this pathogen, material for DNA isolation can only be collected from infected spinach leaves that, however, also contain many other microorganisms. The obtained sequences can, therefore, be considered a metagenome. To filter and obtain Pfs sequences we utilized the CAT tool to taxonomically annotate ORFs residing on long sequences of a genome pre-assembly. This study is the first to show that CAT filtering performs well on eukaryotic contigs. Based on the taxonomy, determined on multiple ORFs, contaminating long sequences and corresponding reads were removed from the metagenome. Filtered reads were re-assembled to provide a clean and improved Pfs genome sequence of 32.4 Mbp consisting of 8,635 scaffolds. Transcript sequencing of a range of infection time points aided the prediction of a total of 13,277 gene models, including 99 RxLR(-like) effector, and 14 putative Crinkler genes. Comparative analysis identified common features in the predicted secretomes of different obligate biotrophic oomycetes, regardless of their phylogenetic distance. Their secretomes are generally smaller, compared to hemi-biotrophic and necrotrophic oomycete species. We observe a reduction in proteins involved in cell wall degradation, in Nep1-like proteins (NLPs), proteins with PAN/apple domains, and host translocated effectors. The genome of Pfs1 will be instrumental in studying downy mildew virulence and for understanding the molecular adaptations by which new isolates break spinach resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3025814963,"A national study, 'Costing of healthcare services in India' (CHSI) aimed at generating reliable healthcare cost estimates for health technology assessment and price-setting is being undertaken in India. CHSI sampled 52 public and 40 private hospitals in 13 states and used a mixed micro-costing approach. This paper aims to outline the process, challenges and critical lessons of cost data collection to feed methodological and quality improvement of data collection.An exploratory survey with 3 components-an online semi-structured questionnaire, group discussion and review of monitoring data, was conducted amongst CHSI data collection teams. There were qualitative and quantitative components. Difficulty in obtaining individual data was rated on a Likert scale.Mean time taken to complete cost data collection in one department/speciality was 7.86(±0.51) months, majority of which was spent on data entry and data issues resolution. Data collection was most difficult for determination of equipment usage (mean difficulty score 6.59±0.52), consumables prices (6.09±0.58), equipment price(6.05±0.72), and furniture price(5.64±0.68). Human resources, drugs & consumables contributed to 78% of total cost and 31% of data collection time. However, furniture, overheads and equipment consumed 51% of time contributing only 9% of total cost. Seeking multiple permissions, absence of electronic records, multiple sources of data were key challenges causing delays.Micro-costing is time and resource intensive. Addressing key issues prior to data collection would ease the process of data collection, improve quality of estimates and aid priority setting. Electronic health records and availability of national cost data base would facilitate conducting costing studies."
https://openalex.org/W3025431159,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, and has the second highest mortality rate. Over 90% of all cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis, which is the spread of malignant cells from the primary tumor to a secondary site in the body. It is hypothesized that one cause of metastasis involves epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). When epithelial cells undergo EMT and transition into mesenchymal cells, they display increased levels of cell proliferation and invasion, resulting in a more aggressive phenotype. While many factors regulate EMT, microRNAs have been implicated in driving this process. MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that suppress protein production, therefore loss of microRNAs may promote the overexpression of specific target proteins important for EMT. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of miR-96 and miR-183 in EMT in breast cancer. Both miR-96 and miR-183 were found to be downregulated in post-EMT breast cancer cells. When microRNA mimics were transfected into these cells, there was a significant decrease in cell viability and migration, and a shift from a mesenchymal to an epithelial morphology (mesenchymal-epithelial transition or MET). These MET-related changes may be facilitated in part by the regulation of ZEB1 and vimentin, as both of these proteins were downregulated when miR-96 and miR-183 were overexpressed in post-EMT cells. These findings indicate that the loss of miR-96 and miR-183 may help facilitate EMT and contribute to the maintenance of a mesenchymal phenotype. Understanding the role of microRNAs in regulating EMT is significant in order to not only further elucidate the pathways that facilitate metastasis, but also identify potential therapeutic options for preventing or reversing this process."
https://openalex.org/W3024038249,"The time-dependent properties of rubber-like synthesized and biological materials are crucial for their applications. Currently, this behavior is mainly measured using axial tensile test, compression test, or indentation. Limited studies performed on using multi-axial loading measurements of time-dependent material behavior exist in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the viscoelastic response of rubber-like materials under multi-axial loading using cavity expansion and relaxation tests. The tests were performed on PVA hydrogel specimens. Three hyperelasitc models and one term Prony series were used to characterize the viscoelastic response of the hydrogels. Finite element (FE) simulations were performed to verify the validity of the calibrated material coefficients by reproducing the experimental results. The excellent agreement between the experimental, analytical and numerical data proves the capability of the cavity expansion technique to measure the time-dependent behavior of viscoelastic materials."
https://openalex.org/W3024476378,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is regarded as a multifactorial disease and shares many risk factors with alcoholism. However, the association between alcoholism and CRC remains controversial.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between alcoholism and risk of CRC.We performed a large-scale, population-based nested case-control study using the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2013, derived from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, and collected data from 2000 to 2013. There were 49,095 diagnosed cases of CRC defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Each case was matched with three controls by sex, age, index date of CRC, and annual medical visits; a total of 147,285 controls were identified. Multiple risk factors of CRC in alcoholism cases were investigated using unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis.Among 49,095 cases of CRC, alcoholism was associated with a significantly higher risk of CRC (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.631; 95% CI, 1.565-1.699) in multivariate logistic regression, after adjusting other CRC risk factors, and in stratified analysis with multivariate logistic regression. In addition, there was a time-dependent relationship between alcoholism duration and CRC risk in >1 year, > 2 years, >5 years, and > 11 years groups (adjusted ORs, 1.875, 2.050, 2.662 and 2.670; 95% CI, 1.788-1.967, 1.948-2.158, 2.498-2.835, and 2.511-2.989 respectively).An association between alcoholism and risk of CRC was found in this study. Furthermore, patients with longer alcoholism history showed higher likelihood of developing CRC, which indicates a time-dependent relationship between alcoholism exposure and CRC. Further research on colorectal tumorigenesis is needed."

Yet, the genetic networks governing microglia development remain incompletely defined. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a microglia-defective zebrafish mutant wulonghkz12 (wulhkz12) isolated from an ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-based genetic screen. We show that wulhkz12 mutants harbors a missense point mutation in the gene region encoding the PRY/SPRY domain of the tripartite-motif family protein 35-28 (trim35-28) gene. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the loss of Trim35-28 function causes lytic necrosis of microglial precursors/peripheral macrophages, as indicated by cytoplasmic swelling and membrane rupture of these precursors and accompanied by neutrophil infiltration and systemic inflammation. Intriguingly, the lytic necrosis of microglial precursors in trim35-28–deficient mutants appeared to depend neither on the canonical pyroptotic nor necroptotic pathways, as inhibition of the key component in each pathway could not rescue the microglia phenotype in trim35-28–deficient mutants. Finally, results from tissue-specific rescue experiments suggested that Trim35-28 acts cell-autonomously in the survival of microglial precursors.

Yet, the molecular networks controlling the formation of microglia remain incompletely defined. Although recent advance of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has made reverse genetic study much feasible in zebrafish model (21Sun Y. Zhang B. Luo L. Shi D.-L. Wang H. Cui Z. Huang H. Cao Y. Shu X. Zhang W. Zhou J. Li Y. Du J. Zhao Q. Chen J. et al.Systematic genome editing of the genes on zebrafish chromosome 1 by CRISPR/Cas9.Genome Res. 2019; 30: 118-12610.1101/gr.248559.119Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), an unbiased forward genetic study with this tiny organism will still provide a useful tool to identify new players involving in various biological processes. For a long time, apoptosis has been thought to be the only form of programmed cell death governed by well-defined intrinsic molecular pathways programs (22Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Programmed cell death and apotosis: origins of the theory.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2 (11433369): 545-55010.1038/35080097Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidences have suggested that necrosis, although initially described as accidental cell death, can be programed by defined signaling pathways, including the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinases (RIPKs)- dependent necroptosis and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis (23Wallach D. Kang T.-B. Dillon C.P. Green D.R. Programmed necrosis in inflammation: Toward identification of the effector molecules.Science. 2016; 352 (aaf2154 27034377): aaf215410.1126/science.aaf2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Vandenabeele P.

Apoptosis and necrosis can be easily distinguished based on their morphological changes of the dying cells. Although the morphological changes of apoptosis involve chromosome fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and shrinkage of cell volume, necrosis, either accidental or programed, display a common morphological feature: cytoplasmic swelling due to early loss of membrane integrity (23Wallach D. Kang T.-B. Dillon C.P. Green D.R. Programmed necrosis in inflammation: Toward identification of the effector molecules.Science. 2016; 352 (aaf2154 27034377): aaf215410.1126/science.aaf2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Vandenabeele P.

Another conspicuous difference between apoptosis and necrosis is their distinct immunological consequences. Through packaging the cellular contents within membrane-bound cell apoptotic bodies, apoptosis does not trigger inflammation. On the other hand, necrosis is a lytic cell death that causes the release of cellular contents and the exposure of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and danger-associated molecular patterns, resulting in the induction of inflammation (23Wallach D. Kang T.-B. Dillon C.P. Green D.R. Programmed necrosis in inflammation: Toward identification of the effector molecules.Science. 2016; 352 (aaf2154 27034377): aaf215410.1126/science.aaf2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 25Lamkanfi M.

Despite numerus elegant studies showing that apoptosis and anti-apoptosis mechanisms play an essential role in cell lineage development and organ formation (27Pérez-Garijo A. Steller H.

The TRIM proteins comprise a large family of proteins defined by the presence of the RBCC motif, which has a tandem organization of a RING domain, one or two B-box domains and a coiled-coil domain (29Khan R. Khan A. Ali A. Idrees M. The interplay between viruses and TRIM family proteins.Rev. Med. Virol. 2019; 29 (30609250): e202810.1002/rmv.2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Hatakeyama S.

The RING domain of the TRIM family proteins possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which has been shown to be crucial for mediating their effects on innate immunity. The B-box domains are zinc-binding motifs facilitating the recognition of the viral and intracellular proteins during innate response to viral infection. And the coiled-coil domain mediates homomeric and heteromeric interactions among TRIM family members and with other proteins to form high molecular complexes essential for the generation of innate immunity.

Origin and evolution of TRIM proteins: new insights from the complete TRIM repertoire of zebrafish and pufferfish.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21789205): e2202210.1371/journal.pone.0022022Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and little is known about their functions in vivo. In this study, we described the isolation and characterization a microglia-defective zebrafish mutant wulhkz12 and uncovered the role of Trim35-28, a member of Trim35 orthologues, as an anti-necrosis factor during microglia development. To uncover novel factors involving in microglia development, we carried out an ENU-based forward genetic screen searching for microglia-defective zebrafish mutants (19Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Zebrafish early macrophages colonize cephalic mesenchyme and developing brain, retina, and epidermis through a M-CSF receptor-dependent invasive process.Dev. Biol. 2001; 238 (11784010): 274-28810.1006/dbio.2001.0393Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A mutant designated as wulhkz12 (wulong is the name of a Chinese tea) was identified because of the lack of neutral red (NR) staining in the developing brain at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and 6 dpf (Fig. 1A). Because of the nature of NR staining, the absence of NR signals in the brain of wulhkz12 mutants could be caused by the impairment of the lysosomal function of microglia or the loss of microglia population. To distinguish these two possibilities, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) with the microglial marker apolipoprotein Eb (apoeb) and the pan-leukocyte marker lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (Lcp1). Results showed that, whereas apoeb+ and Lcp1+ cells were abundantly present in the brains of control siblings, these cells were nearly absent in wulhkz12 mutants (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that the lack of NR staining in wulhkz12 mutants is likely attributed to the loss of microglia. Interestingly, we noticed that, although microglia were largely absent in the brains of wulhkz12 mutants, a significant number of Lcp1+ leukocytes accumulated in the periphery (data not shown). To define the nature of the peripheral Lcp1+ cells, we monitored the formation of peripheral macrophages and neutrophils at 4 dpf, both of which are known to be Lcp1+ (37Meijer A.H. van der Sar A.M. Cunha C. Lamers G.E.M. Laplante M.A. Kikuta H. Bitter W. Becker T.S. Spaink H.P. Identification and real-time imaging of a myc-expressing neutrophil population involved in inflammation and mycobacterial granuloma formation in zebrafish.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2008; 32: 36-4910.1016/j.dci.2007.04.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), with lineage-specific markers. Results showed that the number of peripheral macrophages was significantly reduced in wulhkz12 mutants (data not shown). In contrast, Sudan Black B (SB) staining, a dye that preferentially stains neutrophils (38Le Guyader D. Redd M.J. Colucci-Guyon E. Murayama E. Kissa K. Briolat V. Mordelet E. Zapata A. Shinomiya H. Herbomel P. Origins and unconventional behavior of neutrophils in developing zebrafish.Blood. 2008; 111 (17875807): 132-14110.1182/blood-2007-06-095398Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), revealed a robust increase of neutrophils in the mutants (Fig. 1C). Notably, the increased neutrophils in wulhkz12 mutants were found to be scattered in the tissues, such as yolk sac and trunk regions, where normally devoid of neutrophils in WT siblings (Fig. 1C). Moreover, neutrophils often formed clusters in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) in wulhkz12 mutants (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the wulhkz12 mutants are lack of microglia and peripheral macrophages but have an expanded neutrophil phenotype in the periphery. To identify the gene mutated in wulhkz12 mutants, we carried out positional cloning analysis. The wul mutation was mapped to a 200-kb region on chromosome 16 flanked by two simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers, SSLP65 and SSLP82 (Fig. 2A). DNA sequencing of the coding regions of the 10 candidate genes within this 200-kb region revealed a T to A missense mutation in the sixth exon of the trim35-28 gene, leading to a single amino acid substitution from isoleucine to asparagine at position 454 in the PRYSPRY (B30.2) domain (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the I454N mutation in the trim35-28 locus is responsible for the mutant phenotype, we designed a trim35-28 morpholino (MO) to test whether knocking down Trim35-28 expression in WT zebrafish would produce a phenotype similar to that of wulhkz12 mutants. As expected, results showed that trim35-28 MO knockdown caused a severe reduction of microglia in zebrafish (<5 microglia, n = 63/88; 5∼15 microglia, n = 20/88 in morphants; >20 microglia in control embryos, n = 69/69) (Fig. 2C). We then performed the rescue experiment with in vitro synthesized WT or I454N trim35-28 mRNA. Consistent with the MO knockdown assay, we showed that the injection of WT but not I454N mutant trim35-28 mRNA could partially rescue the microglia number in wulhkz12 mutants (Fig. 2, D and E). Collectively, these data demonstrate that trim35-28 is indeed the causative gene responsible for the loss of microglia in wulhkz12 mutants. We were next keen to investigate how this I454N mutation disrupts the function of Trim35-28 protein. We first aligned the protein sequences of the zebrafish Trim35-28 PRY/SPRY domain with four known PRYSPRY domains sharing the highest degree of similarity with Trim25-28 from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Results indicated that the PRY/SPRY domains had a highly conserved secondary structure (Fig. S1A), indicating that the PRY/SPRY domain of Trim35-28 is likely to adopt a similar folding pattern with the canonical PRY/SPRY domains. We then took the human PYRIN PRY/SPRY domain (PDB ID 2wl1) (39Weinert C. Grütter C. Roschitzki-Voser H. Mittl P.R.E. Grütter M.G. The crystal structure of human pyrin B30.2 domain: implications for mutations associated with familial mediterranean fever.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394 (19729025): 226-23610.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.059Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as a core structure to model the structure of the Trim35-28 PRY/SPRY domain (Fig. S1C). We found that Ile-454 in Trim35-28 appeared to correspond to Ile-755 in human PYRIN (Fig. S1B, indicated by red arrow), which locates in a scaffolding β-strand (β-strand 12) (39Weinert C. Grütter C. Roschitzki-Voser H. Mittl P.R.E. Grütter M.G. The crystal structure of human pyrin B30.2 domain: implications for mutations associated with familial mediterranean fever.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394 (19729025): 226-23610.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.059Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and is buried in a hydrophobic core (Fig. S1C, blue dashed circle). The two loops (loop 2 and loop 5 in PYRIN) covering this hydrophobic core are the key components of the pocket essential for target recognition (40Woo J.-S. Suh H.-Y. Park S.-Y. Oh B.-H. Structural basis for protein recognition by B30.2/SPRY domains.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24 (17189197): 967-97610.1016/j.molcel.2006.11.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The importance of this binding pocket is further documented by the observation that several mutations in the Familial Mediterranean fever patients are found to locate on the wall or near the rim of the target-binding pocket (39Weinert C. Grütter C. Roschitzki-Voser H. Mittl P.R.E. Grütter M.G. The crystal structure of human pyrin B30.2 domain: implications for mutations associated with familial mediterranean fever.J. Mol.

Given the fact that the I454N mutation had no obvious effect on the stability and subcellular location of the proteins (Fig. S1, D and E), we believe that the substitution of hydrophobic isoleucine to hydrophilic asparagine at residue 454 might cause a conformational change of these two loops, resulting in the disruption of this protein function. Having shown that trim35-28 is the causative gene mutated in wulhkz12 mutants, we next asked whether the loss of microglia phenotype and the neutrophil expansion phenotype in the mutants was caused by a cell-autonomous or noncell-autonomous mechanism. To test that, we first examined the temporal-spatial expression expressions of trim35-28 during early zebrafish development. WISH analysis showed that trim35-28 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed, with a relative enrichment in the developing brain and pharyngeal arches (Fig. S2). The ubiquitous expression of trim35-28 raises the possibility that the microglia and neutrophil phenotype in wulhkz12 mutants may not be necessarily caused by a cell-autonomous mechanism. To clarify this issue, we generated two transgenic lines, Tg(mpeg1:trim35-28) and Tg(lyz:trim35-28), in which the expression of WT trim35-28 was under the control of the macrophage-specific gene 1 (mpeg1) promoter (41He S. Chen J. Jiang Y. Wu Y. Zhu L. Jin W. Zhao C. Yu T. Wang T. Wu S. Lin X. Qu J.Y. Wen Z. Zhang W. Xu J. Adult zebrafish Langerhans cells arise from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.eLife. 2018; 7 (29905527): e3613110.7554/eLife.36131Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the neutrophil-specific lysozyme C (lyz) promoter (42Kitaguchi T. Kawakami K. Kawahara A. Transcriptional regulation of a myeloid-lineage specific gene lysozyme C during zebrafish myelopoiesis.Mech. Dev. 2009; 126 (19275935): 314-32310.1016/j.mod.2009.02.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 3A). These transgenic lines were outcrossed with wulhkz12 mutant fish to test whether the restoration of WT trim35-28 expression in a lineage-specific manner could rescue the microglia and neutrophil defect in wulhkz12 mutants. Results showed that forced expression of trim35-28 in the mutants with the mpeg1 promoter could fully rescue the microglia phenotype (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, the neutrophil phenotype was also rescued in this macrophage-specific trim35-28 expression Tg(mpeg1:trim35-28);wulhkz12 line (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, both phenotypes could not be restored in the neutrophil-specific trim35-28 expression Tg(lyz:trim35-28);wulhkz12 line (Fig. 3, B–E). Taken together, these results indicate that trim35-28 is cell-autonomously required for the development of microglia and their precursors and the expansion of neutrophils in wulhkz12 mutants is a secondary effect caused by the defect of microglia. To dissect the cellular mechanism underlying the loss of microglia in wulhkz12 mutants, we examined the formation of microglial precursors: peripheral macrophages at early developmental stages. WISH of microfibril-associated protein 4 (mfap4) expression revealed that peripheral macrophages were specified and distributed properly in wulhkz12 mutants at 36 hpf (Fig. 4A, upper panel).

Over the last decade the genomes and transcriptomes of many agriculturally important plant pathogens have been sequenced and vast candidate effector repertoires were identified using bioinformatic analyses. Elucidating the contribution of individual effectors to pathogenicity is the next major hurdle. To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lettuce susceptibility to the downy mildew Bremia lactucae, we mapped physical interactions between B. lactucae effectors and lettuce candidate target proteins. Using a lettuce cDNA library-based yeast-two-hybrid system, 61 protein-protein interactions were identified, involving 21 B. lactucae effectors and 46 unique lettuce proteins. The top ten interactors based on the number of independent colonies identified in the Y2H and two interactors that belong to gene families involved in plant immunity, were further characterized. We determined the subcellular localization of the fluorescently tagged lettuce proteins and their interacting effectors.

These changes are reflected in the range of motion of trunk, pelvis, lower limbs and other body segments, affect the locomotion and some of these changes may persist to the postpartum period. The aim of this study was to describe the changes affecting the gait during pregnancy and to determine the effect of tested footwear on kinematic gait characteristics during pregnancy as previous studies indicate that special orthopaedic insoles and footwear might be useful in prevention of the common musculoskeletal pain and discomfort related to pregnancy. Participants from the control group (n = 18), without any intervention, and the experimental group (n = 23), which was wearing the tested shoes, were measured at their 14, 28 and 37 gestational weeks and 28 weeks postpartum to capture the complete pregnancy-related changes in gait. The gait 3D kinematic data were obtained using Simi Motion System. The differences between the control and experimental group at the first data collection session in most of the analysed variables, as well as relatively high standard deviations of analysed variables indicate large individual differences in the gait pattern. The effect of tested footwear on kinematic gait pattern changes may be explained by its preventive effect against the foot arches falling. In the control group, changes associated previously with the foot arches falling and hindfoot hyperpronation were observed during advanced phases of pregnancy and postpartum, e.g. increase in knee flexion or increase in spinal curvature. For the comprehensive evaluation of the tested footwear on pregnancy gait pattern, future studies combining the kinematic and dynamic plantographic methods are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3025902752,"Methamphetamine use has increased over the past decade and the first use of methamphetamine is most often when women are of reproductive age. Methamphetamine accumulates in the liver; however, little is known about the effect of methamphetamine use on hepatic drug metabolism. Methamphetamine was administered on 3 occassions to female Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs of reproductive age, mimicking recreational drug use. Low doses of test drugs caffeine and midazolam were administered after the third dose of methamphetamine to assess the functional activity of cytochrome P450 1A2 and 3A, respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the mRNA expression of factors involved in glucocorticoid signalling, inflammation, oxidative stress and drug transporters. This study showed that methamphetamine administration decreased hepatic CYP1A2 mRNA expression, but increased CYP1A2 enzyme activity. Methamphetamine had no effect on CYP3A enzyme activity. In addition, we found that methamphetamine may also result in changes in glucocorticoid bioavailability, as we found a decrease in 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 mRNA expression, which converts inactive cortisone into active cortisol. This study has shown that methamphetamine administration has the potential to alter drug metabolism via the CYP1A2 metabolic pathway in female guinea pigs. This may have clinical implications for drug dosing in female methamphetamine users of reproductive age."

Methods We analysed the 2013 Philippine National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The NDHS is a nationally representative survey which utilized a two-stage stratified design to sample Filipino women aged 15–49. We considered the following exposures in our study: socio-demographic characteristics of respondent and her partner (i.e., age of respondent, age of partner, wealth index, etc.), sexual practices and contraception (i.e., age at first intercourse, condom use, etc.), media access, tobacco use, HIV knowledge, tolerance to domestic violence, and women’s empowerment. The outcome variable is HIV testing. We used logistic regression for survey data to study the said associations. Results Out of 16,155 respondents, only 372 (2.4%) have ever tested for HIV. After adjusting for confounders, having tertiary education (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.15; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.15–4.04), living with partner (aOR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.19–2.48), tobacco use (aOR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.13–3.11); belonging to the middle class (aOR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.30–5.67), richer (aOR = 3.00; 95% CI: 1.37–5.68), and richest (aOR = 4.14; 95% CI: 1.80–5.91) populations, having weekly television access (aOR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.04–2.94) or internet access (aOR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.35–3.00), living in a rural area (aOR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.34–2.61); and being a Muslim (aOR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.15–4.57) were associated with ever testing for HIV. Conclusions The low percentage of respondents who test for HIV is a call to further strengthen efforts to promote HIV testing among Filipino women. Information on its determinants can be used to guide the crafting and implementation of interventions to promote HIV testing to meet DOH and UNAIDS targets."
https://openalex.org/W3024671900,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common tool used to predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, it is limited by its low accuracy (<60%) and sensitivity (30%). We set forth the hypothesis that the Machine Learning (ML) C5.0 algorithm could optimize the ECG in the prediction of LVH by echocardiography (Echo) while also establishing ECG-LVH phenotypes. We used Echo as the standard diagnostic tool to detect LVH and measured the ECG abnormalities found in Echo-LVH. We included 432 patients (power = 99%). Of these, 202 patients (46.7%) had Echo-LVH and 240 (55.6%) were males. We included a wide range of ventricular masses and Echo-LVH severities which were classified as mild (n = 77, 38.1%), moderate (n = 50, 24.7%) and severe (n = 75, 37.1%). Data was divided into a training/testing set (80%/20%) and we applied logistic regression analysis on the ECG measurements. The logistic regression model with the best ability to identify Echo-LVH was introduced into the C5.0 ML algorithm. We created multiple decision trees and selected the tree with the highest performance. The resultant five-level binary decision tree used only six predictive variables and had an accuracy of 71.4% (95%CI, 65.5-80.2), a sensitivity of 79.6%, specificity of 53%, positive predictive value of 66.6% and a negative predictive value of 69.3%. Internal validation reached a mean accuracy of 71.4% (64.4-78.5). Our results were reproduced in a second validation group and a similar diagnostic accuracy was obtained, 73.3% (95%CI, 65.5-80.2), sensitivity (81.6%), specificity (69.3%), positive predictive value (56.3%) and negative predictive value (88.6%). We calculated the Romhilt-Estes multilevel score and compared it to our model. The accuracy of the Romhilt-Estes system had an accuracy of 61.3% (CI95%, 56.5-65.9), a sensitivity of 23.2% and a specificity of 94.8% with similar results in the external validation group. In conclusion, the C5.0 ML algorithm surpassed the accuracy of current ECG criteria in the detection of Echo-LVH. Our new criteria hinge on ECG abnormalities that identify high-risk patients and provide some insight on electrogenesis in Echo-LVH."

Therefore, selective inhibition of TNFR1 signaling and preservation of TNFR2 signaling activities may be beneficial for managing autoimmune diseases. To this end, we developed a TNFR1-selective, antagonistic TNFα mutant (R1antTNF). Here, we developed an R1antTNF derivative, scR1antTNF-Fc, which represents a single-chain form of trimeric R1antTNF with a human IgG-Fc domain. scR1antTNF-Fc had properties similar to those of R1antTNF, including TNFR1-selective binding avidity, TNFR1 antagonistic activity, and thermal stability, and had a significantly extended plasma t1/2 in vivo. In a murine rheumatoid arthritis model, scR1antTNF-Fc and 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF (a previously reported PEGylated form) delayed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, suppressed arthritis progression in mice, and required a reduced frequency of administration.

At present, antibody drugs that neutralize TNFα have shown excellent therapeutic effects in the treatment of immunogenic disorders. However, because they inhibit intracellular signaling through TNFR1 and TNFR2, the use of TNFR1-selective inhibition strategies might be more effective (12Fischer R. Kontermann R. Maier O.

Indeed, therapeutics and biologics focused on the function of specific TNF receptor signaling pathways are expected for multiple disorders (14Kodama S. Davis M. Faustman D.L.

Therefore, to develop anti-TNF drugs with new modalities, we created a TNFα variant protein R1antTNF that functions as a TNFR1 antagonist and that selectively inhibits TNFR1 signaling involved in the pathogenesis of immunogenic disorders (17Shibata H.

R1antTNF specifically binds to TNFR1, but not TNFR2, and does not transmit signals via TNFR1. Thus, R1antTNF competes with TNF at TNFR1. We reported the pharmacological effects of R1antTNF in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (18Shibata H. Yoshioka Y. Abe Y. Ohkawa A. Nomura T. Minowa K. Mukai Y. Nakagawa S. Taniai M. Ohta T.

R1antTNF modified with 5-kDa PEG (5-kDa PEG-R1antTNF) suppressed arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice (18Shibata H. Yoshioka Y. Abe Y. Ohkawa A. Nomura T. Minowa K. Mukai Y. Nakagawa S. Taniai M. Ohta T. Kamada H. Tsunoda S. Tsutsumi Y.

In addition, 5-kDa PEG-R1antTNF decreased the paralysis of limbs and tails in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice (19Nomura T. Abe Y. Kamada H. Shibata H. Kayamuro H. Inoue M. Kawara T. Arita S. Furuya T. Yamashita T. Nagano K. Yoshikawa T. Yoshioka Y. Mukai Y.

Controlled Release. 2011; 149 (20036293): 8-1410.1016/j.jconrel.2009.12.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, R1antTNF has poor stability in vivo compared with antibody drugs because it is a cytokine-derived structure and therefore its t1/2 in the blood is short even with 5-kDa PEGylation (18Shibata H. Yoshioka Y. Abe Y. Ohkawa A. Nomura T. Minowa K. Mukai Y. Nakagawa S. Taniai M. Ohta T. Kamada H. Tsunoda S. Tsutsumi Y. The treatment of established murine collagen-induced arthritis with a TNFR1-selective antagonistic mutant TNF.Biomaterials. 2009; 30 (19765818): 6638-664710.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.08.041Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated a single-chain R1antTNF (scR1antTNF), where the trimeric structure of R1antTNF is fused with a peptide linker as a single-chain structure to improve its molecular stability and molecular-modification efficiency (20Inoue M. Ando D. Kamada H. Taki S. Niiyama M. Mukai Y. Tadokoro T. Maenaka K. Nakayama T. Kado Y. Inoue T. Tsutsumi Y. Tsunoda S.I. A trimeric structural fusion of an antagonistic tumor necrosis factor-α mutant enhances molecular stability and enables facile modification.J. Biol.

As the result, mono-PEGylated scR1antTNF with 40-kDa PEG (40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF) was easily generated and its t1/2 in blood was significantly extended. In this study, we investigated the further structural optimization of a TNFR1-selective antagonist protein. The R1antTNF derivative with a human IgG-Fc domain, termed scR1antTNF-Fc, was created to enhance its in vivo stability and extend the dosage interval. Furthermore, the pharmacological effects of this derivative were demonstrated experimentally using CIA mice to verify its potential as a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the effects of scR1antTNF-Fc were compared with that of 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF in arthritis mice. We previously reported an engineered single-chain structure form of R1antTNF, termed scR1antTNF, which crosslinked three R1antTNF monomers via a GGGSGGG peptide linker (20Inoue M. Ando D. Kamada H. Taki S. Niiyama M. Mukai Y. Tadokoro T. Maenaka K. Nakayama T. Kado Y. Inoue T. Tsutsumi Y. Tsunoda S.I. A trimeric structural fusion of an antagonistic tumor necrosis factor-α mutant enhances molecular stability and enables facile modification.J. Biol.

The N terminus and C terminus of the R1antTNF monomer are located on the same side as demonstrated by crystal structure data (PDB ID 2E7A), and the single-chain structure of R1antTNF was easily generated and properly functioned as a TNFR1 antagonist. In this study, we newly created scR1antTNF-Fc, consisting of scR1antTNF fused to a human IgG1-Fc domain on the C terminus, to extend its t1/2 in vivo. The model structure of scR1antTNF-Fc demonstrated that TNFR1 antagonist proteins become bivalent by fusion with the human IgG1-Fc domain via a hinge region (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). The Fc domain did not affect the binding ability of the scR1antTNF domain to TNFR1, because the Fc proteins were located on the top of scR1antTNF, which is different from the receptor interaction region (Fig. 1B). pCAG-based expression vectors for scR1antTNF-Fc (Fig. 1C) were engineered and transfected into Expi293F cells. Two types of secretion sequences derived from human IgG heavy chain (Vhss) or human IL-2 (IL-2ss) were used to confirm superior protein secretion and expression (21Dalton A.C. Barton W.A. Over-expression of secreted proteins from mammalian cell lines.Protein Sci. 2014; 23 (24510886): 517-52510.1002/pro.2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After cell cultivation for 7 days, scR1antTNF-Fc expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D, left). The band of each protein expressed with Vhss or IL-2ss was detected at 75 kDa as a monomer of similar density. The recombinant proteins were then purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. scR1antTNF-Fc fused to Vhss and IL-2ss were detected as a single peak with a similar retention time and good purity (Fig. 1E). Purification was also confirmed by a single band at the expected molecular weight by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D, right). Moreover, Western blotting showed that both scR1antTNF-Fcs co-migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 75 kDa (Fig. 1F). Thus, it was confirmed that scR1antTNF-Fc forms an Fc fusion protein with scR1antTNF consisting of two 75-kDa monomers similar to IgG. TNFα binds to TNFR1 and TNFR2, but scR1antTNF binds only to TNFR1 (20). The binding avidities of scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss) and scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss) against TNF receptors were assessed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to confirm its binding specificity for TNFR1 (Fig. 2A). The affinities of TNFα and scR1antTNF and the avidities of scR1antTNF-Fcs were evaluated at concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 100 nm by single-cycle kinetics. scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss) and scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss) showed dose-dependent responses for TNFR1 as well as scR1antTNF. At a maximum concentration of each protein, maximum binding response (Rmax) values were obtained from the sensorgram for TNFR1 (TNFα, scR1antTNF, scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss), scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss); 135, 32.3, 78.8, 82.2 RU, respectively). TNFα bound to TNFR2 (Rmax: 27.6 RU). However, scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss) and scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss) had poorer binding ability to TNFR2 as well as scR1antTNF (Fig. 2A). Thus, these scR1antTNF-Fcs appeared to selectively interact with TNFR1 in preference to TNFR2. From these sensorgrams, the dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated. The TNFR1 Kd of TNFα, scR1antTNF, scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss), and scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss) were similar (1.5, 2.6, 4.2, and 4.3 nm, respectively) (Fig. 2B). The TNFR2 Kd of TNFα was indicated (4.8 nm), but the Kd of each antagonist was not defined because the binding avidities were too small. These results showed that scR1antTNF-Fcs retained TNFR1-selective binding property after Fc fusion. The thermal stability of scR1antTNF-Fc was investigated in vitro by a thermal shift assay (TSA) using differential scanning fluorometry. TSA can quickly assess the thermal denaturation temperature (Tm) and denaturation process of a protein by increasing fluorescence intensity dependent on structure aggregation. An increase in the peak temperature in the TSA indicates an increase in the thermal stability of the protein. A marked peak shift was not observed between scR1antTNF and scR1antTNF-Fcs (Fig. 3A). From these results, the Tm value of scR1antTNF was determined to be 75.7 ± 0.2°C (Fig. 3B). By contrast, scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss) and scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss) showed biphasic peaks (Fig. 3A), and tandem Tm values were 69.4 ± 0.1°C/75.8 ± 0.1°C and 70.1 ± 0.1°C/75.6 ± 0.2°C, respectively. Because the Tm value of etanercept was 69.1 ± 0.1°C, the smaller biphasic peaks of scR1antTNF-Fc might indicate that denaturing begins in the Fc region. Therefore, no significant difference in the thermal stability of the TNFR1 antagonist domain was found between scR1antTNF and scR1antTNF-Fc, even after Fc fusion. These results indicate that scR1antTNF-Fc has high thermal stability as well as anti-TNF properties. Bioassays were performed to investigate the effect of scR1antTNF-Fc by Fc fusion. The agonist activity of scR1antTNF-Fc was observed using mouse fibroblast (LM) cells. scR1antTNF originally showed only slight cytotoxicity for LM cells, which preferentially express TNFR1. This indicated that scR1antTNF and scR1antTNF-Fcs function as TNFR1 antagonists. scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss) and scR1antTNF-Fc (IL-2ss) induced a similar level of cytotoxicity to scR1antTNF (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, antagonistic activity was observed. scR1antTNF suppressed TNFα-induced LM cell death. scR1antTNF-Fcs also induced TNFα inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner, and the activity tended to be higher than that of scR1antTNF (Fig. 4B). No difference in cytotoxic activity between IgG-Vhss and IL-2ss was observed. Therefore, these results indicated that the antagonistic activities of scR1antTNF-Fc were retained by the Fc fusion. The agonistic activity of scR1antTNF-Fc was also assessed by NF-κB reporter assay. After the stimulation of Ramos-Blue cells with human TNFα, scR1antTNF, or scR1antTNF-Fcs, NF-κB-inducible secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity was measured. This assay measures the signal transduction activity via TNFR1 because Ramos-Blue cells preferentially express TNFR1. TNFα increases SEAP activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas scR1antTNF and scR1antTNF-Fcs induced no activity (Fig. 4C). This confirmed that the TNFR1 antagonist Fc fusion protein did not have agonistic activity by activating NF-κB signaling through TNFR1. In addition, a cytotoxic assay using huTNFR2/mFas-preadipocytes was used to confirm these bioactivities via TNFR2 (Fig. 4D). We found that cells overexpressing a fusion chimera receptor of human TNFR2 and mouse Fas induced cell death by TNFR2 stimulation (22Abe Y. Yoshikawa T. Kamada H. Shibata H. Nomura T. Minowa K. Kayamuro H. Katayama K. Miyoshi H. Mukai Y. Yoshioka Y. Nakagawa S. Tsunoda S. Tsutsumi Y. Simple and highly sensitive assay system for TNFR2-mediated soluble- and transmembrane-TNF activity.J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 335 (18417150): 71-7810.1016/j.jim.2008.02.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As a result, TNFα displayed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, but scR1antTNF induced slight cell death as reported previously (20Inoue M. Ando D. Kamada H. Taki S. Niiyama M. Mukai Y. Tadokoro T. Maenaka K. Nakayama T. Kado Y. Inoue T. Tsutsumi Y. Tsunoda S.I. A trimeric structural fusion of an antagonistic tumor necrosis factor-α mutant enhances molecular stability and enables facile modification.J. Biol.

Interestingly, scR1antTNF-Fcs induced concentration-dependent cytotoxicity with a lower activity than TNFα. Therefore, scR1antTNF-Fcs seem to exert agonistic activity via TNFR2 because they induce TNFR2 signal transduction similar to membrane-bound TNF. To evaluate the stability of scR1antTNF-Fc in vivo, plasma clearance was measured after a single intraperitoneal administration to mice (Fig. 5A). scR1antTNF-Fc had the same amino acid sequence regardless of which expression vector (Vhss or IL-2ss) was used, because the signal sequence was cleaved. Indeed, both scR1antTNF-Fcs had similar kinetics and bioactivities. Therefore, we used scR1antTNF-Fc (Vhss) to assess its pharmacokinetics. The t1/2 of scR1antTNF was 4.1 h, and it disappeared from the blood within 24 h after administration. By contrast, plasma concentrations of scR1antTNF-Fc peaked 90 min after i.p. injection and were maintained for a week. The concentration of scR1antTNF-Fc was higher than that of etanercept. The t1/2 of scR1antTNF-Fc was 193.4 h, which was extended compared with etanercept (131.3 h) (Fig. 5B). The area under the curve (AUC) of scR1antTNF was more than twice that of etanercept. These results indicated that the Fc fusion protein of scR1antTNF-Fc dramatically increased its in vivo stability. To evaluate the effects of scR1antTNF-Fc treatment on the development of arthritis, we investigated the severity of CIA mice treated with saline, etanercept (1250 μg/kg), and scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg) twice a week for 3 weeks (Fig. 6A). CIA is a chronic autoimmune model of human rheumatoid arthritis that is widely used for evaluating potential therapeutic agents. Etanercept was used as a positive control. Scoring the degree of arthritis demonstrated a significant decrease in arthritis in scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)–treated mice compared with saline-treated mice (Fig. 6B). The arthritis suppressive effect of scR1antTNF-Fc was similar to that of etanercept. Weight decrease was not observed in scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)–, saline-, or etanercept-treated mice (Fig. 6C). The incidence of disease in scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)– and etanercept-treated mice was consistently lower than that of saline-treated mice (Fig. 6D). At 42 days after immunization, swelling of hind limbs in saline-treated mice was severe compared with scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)– or etanercept-treated mice (Fig. 6E). These results indicate that scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg) treatment effectively suppressed arthritis in CIA mice. H&E staining to investigate the histopathologic features of swollen joints in saline-treated mice indicated that joint cavities were filled with inflammatory cells such as mononuclear cells and neutrophils and a substantial thickening of the synovium, which has also been observed in human rheumatoid arthritis patients (Fig. 7A). In contrast, these pathological features were suppressed in etanercept (1250 μg/kg)- or scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)–treated mice at 42 days after immunization. The results of grading right front or right hind paws also indicated that the arthritis states (cell infiltration, synovitis, destruction of cartilage, the juxta-articular bone involvement) were suppressed in etanercept (1250 μg/kg)- or scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)–treated mice (Fig. 7B). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining data in limb joint tissues showed TRAP-positive cells were frequently detected in saline-treated mice at day 42 (Fig. 7C). Osteoclasts express high amounts of TRAP. TRAP-positive cells in rheumatoid synovium may induce the destruction of articular cartilage. However, scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg) and etanercept (1250 μg/kg) suppressed the number of TRAP-positive cells in the joints of limbs. To examine whether scR1antTNF-Fc treatment affected inflammatory cytokines in vivo, we confirmed IL-1β levels in plasma recovered from the orbital sinus of anesthetized mice at 42 days after immunization. Increased IL-1β levels in saline-treated mice were suppressed in scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)– and etanercept-treated mice (Fig. 7D). scR1antTNF-Fc inhibits TNFR1 signaling selectively. Therefore, TNFR2 signaling is transmitted by endogenous TNF. To confirm the advantage of the TNFR1-selective inhibition mechanism, we measured the population of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in the lymph nodes of saline-, etanercept-, or scR1antTNF-Fc (50 μg/kg)–treated CIA mice. Lymph node cells were separated to CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, and then CD4+ T cells were further fractionated to CD4+ forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)+ Treg cells and CD4+ Foxp3− conventional T cells (Tconvs) (Fig. 8A). Statistical analyses indicated no significant differences in the percentages of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells among the three groups (Fig. 8B). However, numbers of CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs in scR1antTNF-Fc–treated mice were significantly higher than in saline- or etanercept-treated mice (Fig. 8C). Furthermore, there were fewer CD4+ Foxp3− Tconvs in scR1antTNF-Fc–treated mice. Therefore, the ratio of Tregs to Tconvs was significantly increased in scR1antTNF-Fc–treated mice. The balance between CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs and CD4+ Foxp3− Tconvs was biased to the Tregs side by the administration of scR1antTNF-Fc. It was reported that TNFR2 was preferentially expressed in Tregs. These results showed that TNFR1-selective inhibition might increase Treg induction by retaining TNFR2 signaling. We reported 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF in our previous study (20Inoue M. Ando D. Kamada H. Taki S. Niiyama M. Mukai Y. Tadokoro T. Maenaka K. Nakayama T. Kado Y. Inoue T. Tsutsumi Y. Tsunoda S.I.

This molecule consists of scR1antTNF linked with a 40-kDa branched PEG chain at the N-terminal (Fig. 9A and Fig. S1B). 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF exerted antagonistic activity for TNFR1 similar to scR1antTNF. However, the molecular weight of 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF (∼100 kDa) was lower than that of scR1antTNF-Fc (∼150 kDa). Therefore, there may be some differences in terms of distribution or excretion between scR1antTNF-Fc and 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF. We investigated the suppressive effects of arthritis with scR1antTNF-Fc and 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF in CIA mice. Saline, etanercept (1250 μg/kg), scR1antTNF-Fc (10 μg/kg), and 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF (10 μg/kg) were administrated to CIA mice twice a week from day 22 after immunization. The dose of scR1antTNF-Fc was one fifth of the amount in the above section. A significant decrease of arthritis score was observed in scR1antTNF-Fc (10 μg/kg)– and 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF (10 μg/kg)–treated mice as well as etanercept (1250 μg/kg)–treated mice (Fig. 9B). However, no significant weight loss was observed in these groups (Fig. 9C). At day 35 after immunization, swelling of front limbs was not observed in scR1antTNF-Fc–, 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF–, and etanercept-treated mice, but it was severe in saline-treated mice (Fig. 9D). Furthermore, the TNFR1-selective inhibition effects of 40-kDa PEG-scR1antTNF treatment were confirmed. The"
https://openalex.org/W3024813672,"Identical codon pairing and co-tRNA codon pairing increase translational efficiency within genes when two codons that encode the same amino acid are translated by the same tRNA before it diffuses from the ribosome. We examine the phylogenetic signal in both identical and co-tRNA codon pairing across 23 428 species using alignment-free and parsimony methods. We determined that conserved codon pairing typically has a smaller window size than the length of a ribosome, and codon pairing tracks phylogenies across various taxonomic groups. We report a comprehensive analysis of codon pairing, including the extent to which each codon pairs. Our parsimony method generally recovers phylogenies that are more congruent with the established phylogenies than our alignment-free method. However, four of the ten taxonomic groups did not have sufficient orthologous codon pairings and were therefore analyzed using only the alignment-free methods. Since the recovered phylogenies using only codon pairing largely match phylogenies from the Open Tree of Life and the NCBI taxonomy, and are comparable to trees recovered by other algorithms, we propose that codon pairing biases are phylogenetically conserved and should be considered in conjunction with other phylogenomic techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3025125872,"Tetraene macrolides remain one of the most reliable fungicidal agents as resistance of fungal pathogens to these antibiotics is relatively rare. The modes of action and biosynthesis of polyene macrolides had been the focus of research over the past few years. However, few studies have been carried out on the overproduction of polyene macrolides. In the present study, cumulative drug-resistance mutation was used to obtain a quintuple mutant G5-59 with huge tetraene macrolide overproduction from the starting strain Streptomyces diastatochromogenes 1628. Through DNA sequence analysis, the mutation points in the genes of rsmG, rpsL and rpoB were identified. Additionally, the growth characteristic and expression level of tetrRI gene (belonging to the large ATP binding regulator of LuxR family) involved in the biosynthesis of tetraene macrolides were analyzed. As examined with 5L fermentor, the quintuple mutant G5-59 grew very well and the maximum productivity of tetramycin A, tetramycin P and tetrin B was as high as 1735, 2811 and 1500 mg/L, which was 8.7-, 16- and 25-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain 1628, respectively. The quintuple mutant G5-59 could be useful for further improvement of tetraene macrolides production at industrial level."
https://openalex.org/W3025134110,"The southern king crab (SKC) Lithodes santolla is an important commercial species in southern South America. Fishing pressure has caused the deterioration of its stocks. Currently, culture techniques are being developed for producing SKC juveniles to enhance the natural population and to recover the fishing stock. Therefore, it is necessary to know about physiology, energetic and nutritional requirements for SKC maintenance in hatchery. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the biochemical and physiological changes in the midgut gland, muscle and hemolymph of juveniles, pre-adults and adults of wild SKC. The energetic reserves, digestive enzymes activity, amino acid profile and energy were quantified in twelve juveniles, ten pre-adult, and ten adult crabs. Juveniles showed high glycogen and low lipids in the midgut gland, and low proteins and low lactate in muscle. In the hemolymph, juveniles had high lipids. Pre-adults had high glycogen and lipids in the midgut gland, and both high protein and lactate in muscle. In the hemolymph, pre-adults had high lipids. Adults had low glycogen and high lipids in midgut gland, and both high proteins and high lactate in muscle. In hemolymph, adults had high glucose and lactate. Juveniles and pre-adults had high proteinase activity, whereas adults had high lipase activity. Major essential amino acids of SKC were arginine, methionine, and tryptophan, and the non-essential amino acids were glycine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. On another hand, SKC had similar energy in the midgut gland and muscle, regardless of the ontogenetic stage. Moreover, we demonstrated that the biochemical energy calculation underestimates the actual measured values by a calorimeter. Thus, our results help to understand the physiological changes, energetic and nutritional requirements of L. santolla, and this study is a baseline for research on diet formulation for maintaining this species under culture conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3024087096,"This cross-sectional study of the general population of Telemark County, Norway, aimed to identify risk factors associated with poor asthma control as defined by the Asthma Control Test (ACT), and to determine the proportions of patients with poorly controlled asthma who had undergone spirometry, used asthma medication, or been examined by a pulmonary physician. In 2014-2015, the study recruited 326 subjects aged 16-50 years who had self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma and presence of respiratory symptoms during the previous 12 months. The clinical outcome measures were body mass index (BMI), forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum and serum C-reactive protein (CRP). An ACT score ≤ 19 was defined as poorly controlled asthma. Overall, 113 subjects (35%) reported poor asthma control. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with poorly controlled asthma were: self-reported occupational exposure to vapor, gas, dust, or fumes during the previous 12 months (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.6), body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2-4.1), female sex (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.5-4.7), current smoking (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.5-5.3), and past smoking (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.3-4.0). Poor asthma control was also associated with reduced FEV1 after bronchodilation (β -3.6; 95% CI -7.0 to -0.2). Moreover, 13% of the participants with poor asthma control reported no use of asthma medication, 51% had not been assessed by a pulmonary physician, and 20% had never undergone spirometry. Because these data are cross-sectional, further studies assessing possible risk factors in general and objectively measured occupational exposure in particular are needed. However, our results suggest that there is room for improvement with regards to use of spirometry and pulmonary physician referrals when a patient's asthma is inadequately controlled."
https://openalex.org/W3024643344,"In 2005, a random sample of 200 people were assessed in Camerino, Italy, eight years after an earthquake. Psychological symptom levels were low and only one person had current Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In 2016 a new earthquake occurred in Camerino. The study aims to assess the impact of the second exposure in the same cohort. A longitudinal study was conducted, 130 participants were re-interviewed between July and December 2017. Psychological symptoms were self-rated on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Global Severity Index (GSI) was analysed. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were self-rated on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Subjective quality of life (SQOL) was assessed on the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). Mean scores of GSI and IES-R were significantly higher than in 2005 (p<0.01 and p<0.001), whilst SQOL remained almost unchanged (p = 0.163). In 2017, 16.9% of the sample had reached the PTSD threshold whilst in 2005 only the 0.5% had reached it. Despite low symptom levels several years after an earthquake, people can show psychological distress after a new exposure, whilst average quality of life levels are not affected."
https://openalex.org/W3025046302,"Background It is challenging to define likely food allergy (FA) in large populations which limited the number of large studies regarding risk factors for FA. Objective We studied the prevalence and characteristics of self-reported FA (s-rFA) in the large, population-based Dutch Lifelines cohort and identified associated risk factors. Methods Likely food allergic cases (LikelyFA) were classified based on questionnaire reported characteristics consistent with FA. Subjects with atypical characteristics were classified as Indeterminate. We investigated 13 potential risk factors for LikelyFA such as birth mode and living on a farm and addressed health-related quality of life (H-RQOL). Results Of the 78, 890 subjects, 12.1% had s-rFA of which 4.0% and 8.1% were classified as LikelyFA and Indeterminate, respectively. Younger age, female sex, asthma, eczema and nasal allergy increased the risk of LikelyFA (p-value range <1.00*10−250–1.29*10−7). Living in a small city/large village or suburb during childhood was associated with a higher risk of LikelyFA than living on a farm (p-value = 7.81*10−4 and p = 4.84*10−4, respectively). Subjects classified as Indeterminate more often reported depression and burn-out compared to those without FA (p-value = 1.46*10−4 and p = 8.39*10−13, respectively). No association was found with ethnicity, (duration of) breastfeeding, birth mode and reported eating disorder. Mental and physical component scores measuring H-RQOL were lower in both those classified as LikelyFA and Indeterminate compared to those without FA. Conclusion The prevalence of s-rFA among adults is considerable and one-third reports characteristics consistent with LikelyFA. Living on a farm decreased the risk of LikelyFA. The association of poorer H-RQOL as well as depression and burn-out with questionable self-perceived FA is striking and a priority for future study."
https://openalex.org/W3024496063,"The quality control of intracellular proteins is achieved by degrading misfolded proteins which cannot be refolded by molecular chaperones. In eukaryotes, such degradation is handled primarily by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, it remained unclear whether and how protein quality control deploys various deubiquitinases. To address this question, we screened deletions or mutation of the 20 deubiquitinase genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and discovered that almost half of the mutations slowed the removal of misfolded proteins whereas none of the remaining mutations accelerated this process significantly. Further characterization revealed that Ubp6 maintains the level of free ubiquitin to promote the elimination of misfolded cytosolic proteins, while Ubp3 supports the degradation of misfolded cytosolic and ER luminal proteins by different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3024103776,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that in many places language coexistence has become ubiquitous and essential for supporting language and cultural diversity and associated with its financial and economic benefits. The competitive evolution among multiple languages determines the evolution outcome, either coexistence, decline, or extinction. Here, we extend the Abrams-Strogatz model of language competition to multiple languages and then validate it by analyzing the behavioral transitions of language usage over the recent several decades in Singapore and Hong Kong. In each case, we estimate from data the model parameters that measure each language utility for its speakers and the strength of two biases, the majority preference for their language, and the minority aversion to it. The values of these two biases decide which language is the fastest growing in the competition and what would be the stable state of the system. We also study the system convergence time to stable states and discover the existence of tipping points with multiple attractors. Moreover, the critical slowdown of convergence to the stable fractions of language users appears near and peaks at the tipping points, signaling when the system approaches them. Our analysis furthers our understanding of multiple language evolution and the role of tipping points in behavioral transitions. These insights may help to protect languages from extinction and retain the language and cultural diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3024573430,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become an accessible tool in clinical microbiology, and it allowed us to identify a novel Cupriavidus species. We isolated Gram-negative bacillus from the blood of an immunocompromised patient, and phenotypical and molecular identifications were performed. Phenotypic identification discrepancies were noted between the Vitek 2 (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) and Vitek MS systems (bioMérieux). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, it was impossible to identify the pathogen to the species levels. WGS was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and genomic sequence database searching with a TrueBacTM ID-Genome system (ChunLab, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) showed no strains with average nucleotide identity values higher than 95.0%, which is the cut-off for species-level identification. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the bacteria was a new Cupriavidus species that formed a subcluster with Cupriavidus gilardii. WGS holds great promise for accurate molecular identification beyond 16S rRNA gene sequencing in clinical microbiology."
https://openalex.org/W3025464403,"This study examined the impact of septal flattening on left ventricular (LV) torsion in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). Fifty-two patients with proven precapillary PH and 13 healthy controls were included. Ventricular function was assessed including 4D-measurements, tissue velocity imaging, and speckle tracking analysis. Increased eccentricity index (1.39 vs. 1.08, p<0.001), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (64 vs. 29mmHg, p<0.001) and right ventricular Tei index (0.55 vs. 0.28, p = 0.007), and reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (19.0 vs. 26.5mm, p<0.001) were detected in PH patients as compared to controls. With increasing eccentricity of left ventricle, LV torsion was both decreased and delayed. Torsion rate paralleled this pattern of change during systole, but not during diastole. In conclusion, right ventricular pressure overload directly affects LV torsion mechanics. The echocardiographic methodology applied provides novel insights in the interrelation of right- and left ventricular function."
https://openalex.org/W3025521065,"Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) plays a key role in patient assessment prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, to date no consensus has been established on what is the optimal pre-procedural imaging protocol. Variability in pre-TAVI acquisition protocols may lead to discrepancies in aortic annulus measurements and may potentially influence prosthesis size selection.The current study evaluates the magnitude of differences in aortic annulus measurements using max-systolic, end-diastolic, and non-ECG-synchronized imaging, as well as the impact of method on prosthesis size selection.Fifty consecutive TAVI-candidates, who underwent retrospectively-ECG-gated CT angiography (CTA) of the aortic root, directly followed by non-ECG-synchronized high-pitch CT of the entire aorta, were retrospectively included. Aortic root dimensions were assessed at each 10% increment of the R-R interval (0-100%) and on the non-ECG-synchronized scan. Dimensional changes within the cardiac cycle were evaluated using a 1-way repeated ANOVA. Agreement in measurements between max-systole, end-diastole and non-ECG-synchronized scans was assessed with Bland-Altman analysis.Maximal dimensions of the aortic root structures and minimum annulus-coronary ostia distances were measured during systole. Max-systolic measurements were significantly and substantially larger than end-diastolic (p<0.001) and non-ECG-synchronized measurements (p<0.001). Due to these discrepancies, the three methods resulted in the same prosthesis size selection in only 48-62% of patients.The systematic differences between max-systolic, end-diastolic and non-ECG-synchronized measurements for relevant aortic annular dimensions are both statistically significant and clinically relevant. Imaging strategy impacts prosthesis size selection in nearly half the TAVI-candidates. End-diastolic and non-ECG-synchronized imaging does not provide optimal information for prosthesis size selection. Systolic image acquisition is necessary for assessment of maximal annular dimensions and minimum annulus-coronary ostia distances."
https://openalex.org/W3025848927,"This descriptive study aimed to explore the physiological factors that determine tolerance to exertion during high-intensity interval effort. Forty-seven young women (15-28 years old) were enrolled: 23 athletes from Taiwan national or national reserve teams and 24 moderately active females. Each participant underwent a maximal incremental INC (modified Bruce protocol) cardiopulmonary exercise test on the first day and high-intensity interval testing (HIIT) on the second day, both performed on a treadmill. The HIIT protocol involved alternation between 1-min effort at 120% of the maximal speed, at the same slope reached at the end of the INC, and 1-min rest until volitional exhaustion. Gas exchange, heart rate (HR), and muscle oxygenation at the right vastus lateralis, measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, were continuously recorded. The number of repetitions completed (Rlim) by each participant was considered the HIIT tolerance index. The results showed a large difference in the Rlim (range, 2.6-12.0 repetitions) among the participants. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the variance in the Rlim within the cohort was related to the recovery rates of oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]), HR at the second minute after INC, and muscle tissue saturation index at exhaustion (R = 0.644). In addition, age was linearly correlated with Rlim (adjusted R = -0.518, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the recovery rates for [Formula: see text] and HR after the incremental test, and muscle saturation index at exhaustion, were the major physiological factors related to HIIT performance. These findings provide insights into the role of the recovery phase after maximal INC exercise testing. Future research investigating a combination of INC and HIIT testing to determine training-induced performance improvement is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3024067264,"In surveys non-responders may introduce bias and lower the validity of the studies. Ways to increase response rates are therefore important. The purpose of the study was to investigate if an unconditional monetary incentive can increase the response rate for vulnerable children and youths in a postal questionnaire survey.The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The study population consisted of 262 children and youth who participated in an established intervention study aimed at creating networks for different groups of vulnerable children and youths. The mean age of the participants was 16.7 years (range 11-28) and 67.9% were female. The questionnaire was adapted to three different age groups and covered different aspects of the participants' life situation, including the dimensions from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). In the follow-up survey, participants were randomly allocated to two groups that either received a €15 voucher for a supermarket together with the questionnaire or only received the questionnaire. We used Poisson regression to estimate the differences in response rate (Rate Ratio RR) between the intervention group and the control group.The response rate was 75.5% in the intervention group and 42.9% in the control group. The response rate in the intervention group was significantly higher than in the control group when adjusting for age and gender (Rate Ratio, RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.38-2.17). We did not find any significant differences in scales scores between the two groups for the five scales of the SDQ. In stratified analyses, we found the effect of the incentive to be higher for males (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.61-4.91) than for females (1.43; 95% CI 1.12-1.84).Monetary incentives can increase the response rate for vulnerable children and youths in surveys.The trial was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01741675."
https://openalex.org/W3025549079,"In pregnancy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), there is increased risk of low birthweight in the offspring. The present study examined how offspring body composition was affected by RYGB.Mother-newborn dyads, where the mothers had undergone RYGB were included. Main outcome measure was neonatal body composition. Neonatal body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning (DXA) within 48 hours after birth. In a statistical model offspring born after RYGB were compared with a reference material of offspring and analyses were made to estimate the effect of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain, parity, gestational age at birth and newborn sex on newborn body composition. Analyses were made to estimate the impact of maternal weight loss before pregnancy and of other effects of bariatric surgery respectively. The study was performed at a university hospital between October 2012 and December 2013.We included 25 mother-newborn dyads where the mothers had undergone RYGB and compared them to a reference material of 311 mother-newborn dyads with comparable pre-pregnancy BMI. Offspring born by mothers after RYGB had lower birthweight (335g, p<0.001), fat-free mass (268g, p<0.001) and fat% (2.8%, p<0.001) compared with reference material. Only 2% of the average reduction in newborn fat free mass could be attributed to maternal pre-pregnancy weight loss whereas other effects of RYGB accounted for 98%. Regarding reduction in fat mass 52% was attributed to weight loss and 47% to other effects of surgery.Offspring born after maternal bariatric surgery, had lower birthweight, fat-free mass and fat percentage when compared with a reference material. RYGB itself and not the pre-pregnancy weight loss seems to have had the greatest impact on fetal growth."
