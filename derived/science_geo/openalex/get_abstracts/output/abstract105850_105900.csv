https://openalex.org/W2001399809,"Mammalian cells respond to endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by activation of protein kinase cascades that lead to new gene expression. A protein kinase, p38, that was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, was cloned. The p38 enzyme and the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 gene, which are both members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, have sequences at and adjacent to critical phosphorylation sites that distinguish these proteins from most other MAP kinase family members. Both HOG1 and p38 are tyrosine phosphorylated after extracellular changes in osmolarity. These findings link a signaling pathway in mammalian cells with a pathway in yeast that is responsive to physiological stress."
https://openalex.org/W1989480480,"The MAP kinase pathway is activated by a wide variety of external signals leading to cell proliferation or differentiation. However, it is not clear whether activation of this pathway is required for cellular responses or whether it is only one branch point in signal transduction. To investigate these questions, we generated constitutively activated and interfering mutants of MAP kinase kinase 1. The activated mutants stimulated PC12 cell neuronal differentiation and transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The interfering mutants inhibited growth factor-induced PC12 differentiation, growth factor stimulation of proliferation, and reverted v-src- and ras-transformed cells. These results therefore show that, depending on cellular context, activation of MAP kinase kinase is necessary and sufficient for cell differentiation or proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1967485093,"Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common genetic form of dwarfism. This disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, although the majority of cases are sporadic. A gene for ACH was recently localized to 4p16.3 by linkage analyses. The ACH candidate region includes the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which was originally considered as a candidate for the Huntington's disease gene. DNA studies revealed point mutations in the FGFR3 gene in ACH heterozygotes and homozygotes. The mutation on 15 of the 16 ACH-affected chromosomes was the same, a G-->A transition, at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA. The mutation on the only ACH-affected chromosome 4 without the G-->A transition at nucleotide 1138 had a G-->C transversion at this same position. Both mutations result in the substitution of an arginine residue for a glycine at position 380 of the mature protein, which is in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3."
https://openalex.org/W1964761197,"A Drosophila gene that contains both a paired box and a homeobox and has extensive sequence homology to the mouse Pax-6 (Small eye) gene was isolated and mapped to chromosome IV in a region close to the eyeless locus. Two spontaneous mutations, ey2 and eyR, contain transposable element insertions into the cloned gene and affect gene expression, particularly in the eye primordia. This indicates that the cloned gene encodes ey. The finding that ey of Drosophila, Small eye of the mouse, and human Aniridia are encoded by homologous genes suggests that eye morphogenesis is under similar genetic control in both vertebrates and insects, in spite of the large differences in eye morphology and mode of development."
https://openalex.org/W1992084965,"The infectious agent (or 'prion') of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) such as scrapie resembles a virus in that it replicates in vivo and has distinct strains, but it was postulated long ago to contain only protein. More recently, PrPSc, a pathogenic, scrapie-associated form of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP), was identified as a possible primary TSE agent protein. PrPSc is defined biochemically by its insolubility and resistance to proteases and is derived post-translationally from normal, protease-sensitive PrP (PrPc). The conversion seems to involve conformational change rather than covalent modification. However, the conversion mechanism and the relationship of PrPSc formation to TSE agent replication remain unclear. Here we report the conversion of PrPc to protease-resistant forms similar to PrPSc in a cell-free system composed of substantially purified constituents. This conversion was selective and required the presence of preexisting PrPSc, providing direct evidence that PrPSc derives from specific PrPc-PrPSc interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2082064626,"P-glycoproteins (P-gps) encoded by the mouse mdr2 and mdr3 genes were expressed in secretory vesicles (SVs) from the yeast mutant sec6-4, and their capacity to function as a lipid translocase/flippase was tested. An assay that uses a fluorescent phosphatidylcholine (PC) analog was developed to quantitate asymmetric lipid distribution in the outer and inner leaflets of the lipid bilayer of these vesicles. Mdr2 expression in SVs caused a time- and temperature-dependent enhancement of PC translocation to the inner leaflet of the membrane. The Mdr2-mediated effect was specific since expression of Mdr3 in these vesicles was without effect on the membrane distribution of PC. Increased Mdr2-mediated PC translocation was strictly ATP and Mg2+ dependent, was abrogated by the ATPase inhibitor vanadate and the P-gp modulator verapamil, but was insensitive to the presence of excess of the multidrug resistance drugs colchicine and vinblastine."

https://openalex.org/W2042693809,"Butterfly wings display pattern elements of many types and colors. To identify the molecular processes underlying the generation of these patterns, several butterfly cognates of Drosophila appendage patterning genes have been cloned and their expression patterns have been analyzed. Butterfly wing patterns are organized by two spatial coordinate systems. One system specifies positional information with respect to the entire wing field and is conserved between fruit flies and butterflies. A second system, superimposed on the general system and involving several of the same genes, operates within each wing subdivision to elaborate discrete pattern elements. Eyespots, which form from discrete developmental organizers, are marked by Distal-less gene expression. These circular pattern elements appear to be generated by a process similar to, and perhaps evolved from, proximodistal pattern formation in insect appendages."
https://openalex.org/W1526348057,"Fatty acids induce an increase in the transcription of the mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase gene, which encodes an enzyme that has been proposed as a control site of ketogenesis. We studied whether the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is involved in the mechanism of this transcriptional induction. We found that cotransfection of a rat mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid and a PPAR expression plasmid in the presence of the peroxisome proliferator clofibrate led to a more than 30-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, relative to the activity in the absence of both PPAR and inducer. Linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, increased this activity as potently as does clofibrate and more effectively than does monounsaturated oleic acid. We have identified, by deletional analysis, an element located 104 base pairs upstream of the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase gene, which confers PPAR responsiveness to homologous and heterologous promoters. This is the first example of a peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE) in a gene encoding a mitochondrial protein. This element contains an imperfect direct repeat that is similar to those described in the PPREs of other genes. Furthermore, gel retardation and cotransfection assays revealed that, as for other genes, PPAR heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor and that both receptors cooperate for binding to the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase PPRE and subsequent activation of the gene. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that regulation of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase gene expression by fatty acids is mediated by PPAR, supporting the hypothesis that PPAR has an important role at the transcriptional level in the regulation of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1975576726,"Fragile X syndrome results from the expansion of a CGG repeat that is normally interrupted by occasional AGG triplets. Linkage disequilibrium suggests that certain normal haplotypes may contribute unequally to the pool of fragile X chromosomes. Sequence analysis of normal alleles demonstrates haplotype-specific variation of the cryptic nature of the repeat. Variation occurs principally at the 3' end of the repeat, suggesting stability differences between the leading and lagging strands of DNA replication. Normal alleles with greater than 24 perfect 3' CGG repeats appear more frequently on haplotypes overrepresented among fragile X chromosomes. Such alleles are found in 2% of normal chromosomes and could comprise the ancestral allelic pool from which fragile X chromosomes are derived. These data also may imply that equilibrium between certain predisposed alleles and fragile X expansions has not yet been attained, indicating ongoing evolutionary change at this locus."
https://openalex.org/W2048965038,"A human photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase, RetGC, was recently cloned and expressed, but its localization and manner of regulation were not defined. We report here that RetGC is detected primarily in outer segments of human photoreceptor cells. Recombinant RetGC can be stimulated by a soluble retinal-specific factor. Ca2+ interferes with stimulation of RetGC by this factor with a cooperativity coefficient of 1.7 and EC50 near 200 nM. The Ca2+ sensitivities of recombinant RetGC and of guanylyl cyclase activity from rod outer segment membranes are very similar. Our findings indicate that RetGC is a photoreceptor-specific guanylyl cyclase which is stimulated by a retinal-specific activator and inhibited by physiologically relevant concentrations of free Ca2+. The Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC may be responsible for some of the previously reported effects of Ca2+ on light adaptation and recovery of the dark state."
https://openalex.org/W2128806251,"[3H]palmitate attached to mutationally activated alpha s (alpha s-R201C) turns over rapidly, compared with palmitate linked to normal alpha s (t1/2 approximately 2 min versus 90 min); although alpha s-R201C (unlike normal alpha s) is predominantly found in the cytosol, [3H]palmitate is linked only to the membrane-bound pool of alpha s, normal or mutant. Similarly, activation of wild-type alpha s by isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist that also induces membrane-to-cytosol translocation of alpha s, dramatically accelerates depalmitoylation of alpha s. Thus, activation-induced removal of palmitate provides an explanation for activation-induced shifts of alpha s to the cytosol. Regulated palmitoylation cycles provide a potential general mechanism for controlling reversible changes in the cellular location and activity of a protein."
https://openalex.org/W2001747644,"Antibodies were raised against two distinct extracellular sequences of the rat mGluR1 metabotropic glutamate receptor expressed as bacterial fusion proteins. Both antibodies specifically reacted with mGluR1 in the rat cerebellum and inhibited the mGluR1 activity as assessed by the analysis of glutamate-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in CHO cells expressing mGluR1. Using these antibodies, we examined the role of mGluR1 in the induction of long-term depression in cultured Purkinje cells. In voltage-clamped Purkinje cells, current induced by iontophoretically applied glutamate was persistently depressed by depolarization of the Purkinje cells in conjunction with the glutamate application. The mGluR1 antibodies completely blocked the depression of glutamate-induced current. The results indicate that activation of mGluR1 is necessary for the induction of cerebellar long-term depression and that these mGluR1 antibodies can be used as selective antagonists."

https://openalex.org/W1981024710,"A new fluorescence method using the dye FM1-43 was used to examine exocytotic release from hippocampal synaptosomes. Nitric oxide caused a marked transient stimulation of vesicle release. Several structurally unrelated nitric oxide donors, sodium nitroprusside, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, 3-morpholino-sydnonimine, and acidified sodium nitrite, were effective. Release stimulated by nitric oxide and KCl were comparable in time course, using both the fluorescence assay and [3H]L-glutamate to monitor neurotransmitter release. Activation of guanylyl cyclase was not responsible for nitric oxide-stimulated release. Unlike release stimulated by KCl or A23187, nitric oxide-stimulated release was found to be independent of a rise in intrasynaptosomal Ca2+. Indo-1/AM measurements indicated that nitric oxide actually decreased intracellular Ca2+, and the Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ did not affect nitric oxide-stimulated vesicle release. Nitric oxide does, however, appear to act on the Ca(2+)-sensitive pool of vesicles. Nitric oxide may be the first physiological mediator that induces vesicle exocytosis without raising Ca2+ and may provide an interesting new tool for the study of molecules involved in vesicle exocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2015686762,"Activation of 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease by 5'-phosphorylated, 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates, known as 2-5A, is one pathway of interferon action. Unaided uptake into HeLa cells of 2-5A linked to an antisense oligonucleotide resulted in the selective ablation of messenger RNA for the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase PKR. Similarly, purified, recombinant human 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease was induced to selectively cleave PKR messenger RNA. Cells depleted of PKR activity were unresponsive to activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) by the dsRNA poly(I):poly(C), which provides direct evidence that PKR is a transducer for the dsRNA signaling of NF-kappa B."
https://openalex.org/W2025399103,"The neuroendocrine polypeptide 7B2 is a highly conserved secretory protein selectively present in prohormone-producing cells equipped with a regulated secretory pathway. We find that the amino-terminal half of 7B2 is distantly related to chaperonins, a subclass of molecular chaperones. When incubated in vitro with newly synthesized pituitary proteins, recombinant 7B2 specifically associates with prohormone convertase PC2. Metabolic cell labeling combined with coimmuno-precipitation studies showed that, in vivo, the precursor form of 7B2 interacts with the proform of PC2. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that this association is transient in that it commences early in the secretory pathway, while dissociation in the later stages appears to coincide with the cleavages of 7B2, proPC2, and prohormone. Our results suggest that 7B2 is a novel type of molecular chaperone preventing premature activation of proPC2 in the regulated secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2070223645,"The particular structural arrangement of chaperonins probably contributes to their ability to assist in the folding of proteins. The interaction of the oligomeric bacterial chaperonin GroEL and its cochaperonin, GroES, in the presence of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) forms an asymmetric complex. However, in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or its nonhydrolyzable analogs, symmetric complexes were found by electron microscopy and image analysis. The existence of symmetric chaperonin complexes is not predicted by current models of the functional cycle for GroE-mediated protein folding. Because complete folding of a nonnative substrate protein in the presence of GroEL and GroES only occurs in the presence of ATP, but not with ADP, the symmetric chaperonin complexes formed during the GroE cycle are proposed to be functionally significant."

https://openalex.org/W1963988511,"A gene encoding a 35-kilodalton guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein, Gem, was cloned from mitogen-induced human peripheral blood T cells. Gem and Rad, the product of a gene overexpressed in skeletal muscle in individuals with Type II diabetes, constitute a new family of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins. The distinct structural features of this family include the G3 GTP-binding motif, extensive amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions beyond the Ras-related domain, and a motif that determines membrane association. Gem was transiently expressed in human peripheral blood T cells in response to mitogenic stimulation; the protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and localized to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. Deregulated Gem expression prevented proliferation of normal and transformed 3T3 cells. These results suggest that Gem is a regulatory protein, possibly participating in receptor-mediated signal transduction at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2054651254,"Chaperonins GroEL and GroES form two types of hetero-oligomers in vitro that can mediate the folding of proteins. Chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy showed that in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), two GroES7 rings can successively bind a single GroEL14 core oligomer. The symmetric GroEL14(GroES7)2 chaperonin, whose central cavity appears obstructed by two GroES7 rings, can nonetheless stably bind and assist the ATP-dependent refolding of RuBisCO enzyme. Thus, unfolded proteins first bind and possibly fold on the external envelope of the chaperonin hetero-oligomer."

https://openalex.org/W2046132746,"Assessing patterns of synaptic connections in the developing mammalian neocortex has relied primarily on anatomical studies. In a physiological approach described here, the patterns of synaptic connections in slices of developing ferret visual cortex were determined with scanning laser photostimulation. Functional synaptic inputs to pyramidal cells in cortical layers 2 and 3 originating from sites close to the neuronal cell body appeared at least 2 weeks before eye opening, prior to the formation of long-range horizontal connections. Extensive long-range horizontal connections appeared in the next 10 days of development. The number of local connections peaked at the time of eye opening; the number of these connections subsequently declined to the level found in the adult while the specificity of long-distance connections increased. Thus, the relative influence of local connections on the activity of layer 2 and layer 3 neurons declines as the cortex matures while the influence of longer range connections increases substantially."
https://openalex.org/W1605408170,"High affinity transport of glutamate across plasma membranes of brain neurons and epithelial is mediated by a Na(+)- and K(+)-coupled electrogenic transporter. Here we report the primary structure and functional characterization of the human high affinity glutamate transporter (HEAAC1). A unique characteristic of HEAAC1-mediated transport is that the affinity for glutamate and the maximal transport rate are strongly dependent on membrane potential. Our data provide new insights into individual steps of high affinity glutamate transport and show that the transport mechanism is distinct from that of the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT-1 and the Na+/glucose transporter SGLT1. Under voltage clamp condition, HEAAC1 mediated large substrate-evoked inward currents (up to 1 microA). The substrate specificity, stereospecificity, the Km value (30 +/- 3 microM at -60 mV) of the L-glutamate-evoked current, and Northern analysis all agree with previously reported characteristics of high affinity glutamate transport in brain. In contrast to SGLT1 and GAT-1, voltage jump studies of HEAAC1 yielded only minor relaxation currents. Classic inhibitors of brain glutamate uptake such as DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate, L-trans-pyrrolidine 2,4,-dicarboxylic acid (PDC), and dihydrokainate were found to be either transport substrates or to have no significant effect on glutamate transport. We also found that the maximal transport rate for PDC was markedly reduced compared to that for L-glutamate. We propose that PDC most likely reduces the turnover rate of the transporter. A search of the sequence data bases revealed weak homology of HEAAC1 to the H(+)-coupled vesicular monoamine transporter, suggesting an evolutionary link between plasma membrane and vesicular transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1999560094,"Failure of axons of the central nervous system in adult mammals to regenerate spontaneously after injury is attributed in part to inhibitory molecules associated with oligodendrocytes. Regeneration of central nervous system axons in fish is correlated with the presence of a transglutaminase. This enzyme dimerizes interleukin-2, and the product is cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro. Application of this nerve-derived transglutaminase to rat optic nerves, in which the injury had caused the loss of visual evoked potential response to light, promoted the recovery of that response within 6 weeks after injury. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the concomitant appearance of axons in the distal stump of the optic nerve."
https://openalex.org/W1575477925,"e23(dsFv)-PE38KDEL is a recombinant immunotoxin composed of the Fv region of anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibody e23 connected to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38KDEL), in which the inherently unstable Fv heterodimer (composed of VH and VL) is stabilized by a disulfide bond engineered between structurally conserved framework positions of VH and VL. We have now found that e23(dsFv)-PE38KDEL is considerably more cytotoxic to antigen-positive cell lines than the corresponding single-chain immunotoxin. The basis for the enhanced cytotoxic activity is that the e23 dsFv-immunotoxin binds to erbB2 with greater affinity than the single-chain counterpart. The dsFv-immunotoxin had 4-fold increased binding compared to the scFv and almost identical to the binding affinity of e23 Fab. e23(dsFv)-PE38KDEL was also considerably more stable at 37 degrees C than the single-chain immunotoxin. The therapeutic potential of the disulfide-stabilized immunotoxin was compared with its single-chain counterpart using two animal models of immunodeficient mice bearing subcutaneous tumor xenografts of human gastric tumor N87 cells or human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. The antitumor effect of e23(dsFv)-PE38KDEL was significantly better than that of the single-chain immunotoxin. e23(dsFv)-PE38KDEL caused complete regression of tumors at doses which caused no toxic effects in mice, whereas the single-chain immunotoxin did not cause complete regressions at the same doses."
https://openalex.org/W1600485881,"Endocytosis is regulated by several GTPases including Rab5 and one or more heterotrimeric G proteins. We show here that Rab5, in the GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate))-bound form, fully supports in vitro endosome fusion, indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required, whereas Rab5:S34N and Rab5:N133I, mutants unable to bind GTP, are potent inhibitors of endosome fusion. Double mutants (Rab5:S34N/delta C4 and Rab5:N133I/delta C4) lacking the C-terminal prenylation site were inactive, indicating that prenylation is required. Endosomes became resistant to the inhibitory effects of Rab5:S34N by preincubating the vesicles with cytosol prior to the addition of the inhibitor. The acquisition of resistance to Rab5:S34N was more rapid than to N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that Rab5 mutants are early acting. G beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins block endosome fusion. However the effect of G beta gamma was abrogated by Rab5-GTP gamma S, indicating that a heterotrimeric G protein may operate upstream of Rab5."
https://openalex.org/W1492490882,"In this report we demonstrate that various biologically active hydrophobic peptide derivatives, e.g., proteinase inhibitors, chemoattractants, ionophores, enkephalins, and immunosuppressants, stimulate a membrane ATPase activity associated with the human multidrug transporter (MDR1). The stimulation of the MDR1-ATPase by these agents does not correlate with their known biochemical or pharmacological activities but rather with their hydrophobicity. The peptides that show high-affinity interaction with the MDR1-ATPase also interfere strongly with fluorescent dye extrusion catalyzed by the multidrug transporter in intact cells and some have been shown to reverse drug resistance in cultured cells. These data suggest that several hydrophobic peptides behave as substrates of the multidrug transporter and may be used to modulate the chemotherapy resistance of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551340508,"The complexity of protein folding is often aggravated by the low solubility of the denatured state. The inefficiency of the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured lysozyme results from a kinetic partitioning of the unfolded protein between pathways leading to aggregation and pathways leading to the native structure. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a resident foldase of the endoplasmic reticulum, catalyzes the in vitro oxidative refolding of reduced, disulfide-containing proteins, including denatured lysozyme. Depending on the concentrations of foldase and denatured substrate and the order in which they are added to initiate folding, PDI can exhibit either a chaperone activity or an anti-chaperone activity (Puig, A., and Gilbert, H. F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem 269, 7764-7771). PDI's chaperone activity leads to quantitative recovery of native lysozyme. Its anti-chaperone activity diverts substrate away from productive folding and facilitates disulfide cross-linking of lysozyme into large, inactive aggregates that specifically incorporate PDI. A mutant PDI (NmCm-PDI), in which both the N- and C-terminal active site cysteines have been changed to serines, loses all chaperone activity and behaves as an anti-chaperone at all substrate and PDI concentrations tested. The dithiol/disulfide sites of PDI are essential for the chaperone activity observed at high PDI concentrations, but they are not required for the anti-chaperone activity found at low PDI concentrations. Inactivation of PDI's peptide/protein binding site by a specific photoaffinity label (Noiva, R., Freedman, R. B., and Lennarz, W. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19210-19217) inhibits the disulfide isomerase and chaperone activity, but the protein still retains its anti-chaperone activity. In a glutathione redox buffer, lysozyme-PDI aggregates are disulfide cross-linked; however, disulfide cross-linking is not required for aggregate formation or for the incorporation of PDI into the aggregates. Although both the peptide binding site and the catalytic active sites of PDI are required for chaperone and disulfide isomerase activity, neither of these sites are involved in PDI's anti-chaperone activity. PDI's anti-chaperone activity could serve as a quality control device by providing an efficient mechanism to retain misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (Marquardt, T., and Helenius, A. (1992) J. Cell. Biol. 117, 505-513)."
https://openalex.org/W1572616623,"A novel human homeobox gene, HB9, was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from in vitro stimulated human tonsil B lymphocytes and from a human genomic library. The HB9 gene is composed of 3 exons spread over 6 kilobases of DNA. An open reading frame of 1206 nucleotides is in frame with a diverged homeodomain. The predicted HB9 protein has a molecular mass of 41 kilodaltons and is enriched for alanine, glycine, and leucine. The HB9 homeodomain is most similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster homeobox gene proboscipedia. Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA purified from the human B cell line RPMI 8226 and from activated T cells revealed a major mRNA transcript of 2.2 kilobases. Similar analysis of poly(A) RNA from a variety of adult tissues demonstrated HB9 transcripts in pancreas, small intestine, and colon. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine HB9 RNA transcripts in hematopoietic cell lines. HB9 RNA transcripts were most prevalent in several human B cell lines and K562 cells. In addition, transcripts were detected in RNA prepared from tonsil B cells and in situ hybridization studies localized them in the germinal center region of adult tonsil. These findings suggest the involvement of HB9 in regulating gene transcription in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1504184774,"Promoter elements accounting for HER2 (c-erbB-2/neu) overexpression were searched for in several human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-453, BT-474, ZR-75-1, MCF-7) known to express constitutively a 30-fold range in HER2 transcripts per gene copy. HER2 overexpressing cells showed a single prominent DNase I hypersensitive site near a conserved and hitherto unrecognized ets response element (GAGGAA), located 38 bases down-stream from the CAAT box and directly 5' of the TATA box in the human HER2 promoter. Transient transfection of HER2 promoter constructs (0.125, 0.5, and 2.0 kilobase pairs (kb)) demonstrated that the most proximal promoter region (0.125 kb) was capable of conferring up to 30-fold enhanced activity in HER2-overexpressing cell lines relative to low HER2-expressing control lines. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ets response element (GAGGAA-->GAGAGA) caused a > or = 60% reduction in promoter activity affecting at least 0.5 kb of upstream HER2 regulatory sequence. Gel-shift assays with nuclear extracts and oligonucleotide sequences spanning the 0.125-kb promoter region detected an ETS-immunoreactive complex, present most abundantly in cells overexpressing HER2, whose high-affinity binding depended on the GAGGAA response element. Methylation interference confirmed the ETS-specific pattern of protein binding by this complex to guanine bases in the ets response element. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation implicate a approximately 60-kDa ETS protein, and candidate ETS genes expressed in these breast cancer cells include GABP alpha, elk-1, elf-1, and PEA3."

W-13 inhibited receptor-mediated IgA transcytosis, recycling of transferrin, and caused all material endocytosed from both surfaces of the cell to be delivered to exceptionally large, novel endosomal structures, which appear to be derived from early endosomes. Treatment with other calmodulin antagonists similarly inhibited transcytosis and caused large endosomes to form. These observations raise the possibility that calmodulin may be involved in regulating membrane trafficking through the endosomes of polarized epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515385911,"Members of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily such as the P-glycoproteins (MDR) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) share conserved sequence motifs in their nucleotide binding fold that are the major targets for CFTR mutations in patients with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis-type mutations were introduced at analogous positions into the human MDR1 gene. Heterologous expression of wild-type or mutated MDR1 revealed similar mRNA transcript levels in Chinese hamster ovary K1 recipients, but the subsequent processing was defective for all mutations that give rise to severe cystic fibrosis in the case of CFTR. Functional multidrug transporter MDR1, however, was obtained when amino acid substitutions were introduced into a less conserved position of the ATP-binding cassette transporter signature (codon 536 in MDR1). The profile of cross-resistance and chemosensitization was modulated in these codon 536 variants, which suggests that this region is involved in the drug transport function of P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2076521618,"Short-term augmentation of synaptic transmission at sensory neuron synapses of Aplysia contributes to behavioral sensitization and is one of the current models for a cellular mechanism of learning. This neuromodulatory process, mediated at least in part by the facilitatory neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) actingthrough cAMP, has been thought to result largely from prolongation of the sensory neuron action potential (AP). The quantitative contribution of AP prolongation to synaptic augmentation was examined using a new culture preparation that is favorable for controlling the voltage at the presynaptic terminals. Preventing AP prolongation by using unvarying voltage-clamp commands in place of triggered APs did not reduce augmentation significantly, and pharmacological prolongation of APs caused by a high concentration of 5-HT led to a negligible increase in the synaptic response. Together with earlier evidence against the involvement of changes in Ca2+ current, these results suggest that synaptic augmentation may result from modulation of steps in the secretory process that lie distal to the flow of ion currents across the nerve terminal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1555584098,"Abstract Expression of eukaryotic polytopic membrane proteins in Escherichia coli could provide an invaluable system for structure-function studies. Recently, the functional expression of a mouse multidrug resistance protein (Mdr1) in E. coli was described (Bibi, E., Gros, P., and Kaback, H. R. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 9209-9213). In the present study, the phoA gene fusion approach has been utilized to determine the membrane topology of the N-terminal domain of Mdr. The results support the idea that the N-terminal half of Mdr contains six transmembrane helices (TMs). However, our observations suggest that the previously proposed TM4 (amino acid residues Thr214-Ala232) is located at the periplasmic face of the membrane. Alternatively, we propose that another stretch of amino acid residues (Leu243 (out) to Ile260 (in)) traverses the membrane. This assignment is indicated also by the following observations: 1) deletion of a segment containing the originally predicted TM4 (delta T214-K241) does not reverse the orientation of the Mdr-alkaline phosphatase hybrid that is located in the following cytoplasmic loop; 2) a sandwich chimera, in which alkaline phosphatase is inserted in-frame between amino acid residues Leu226 and Ser227, exhibits high alkaline phosphatase activity. The existence of an externally exposed hydrophobic domain in Mdr may have special structural and functional implications, and these may also be relevant to other members of the ABC superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1548395410,"Two protein kinase genes (atpk1 and atpk2) were isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA with a probe generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers encoding conserved eukaryotic protein kinase sequences. atpk1 and atpk2 are organized in a head-to-tail tandem array on chromosome 3 and have about 80% nucleotide sequence identity. atpk1 encodes a hydrophilic polypeptide of 465 amino acids, M(r) = 52,554. The centrally located catalytic domain contains all the conserved residues characteristic of eukaryotic protein kinases, with greatest similarity to the catalytic domains of 70-kDa ribosomal S6 protein kinase, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A. The C-terminal 75 residues also show homology to protein kinase C and S6 protein kinase. In contrast, the N-terminal 130 residues have no homology to any known protein, and thus may represent a new class of protein kinase regulatory domain. Other motifs found in the Atpk1 protein include two putative autophosphorylation sites, a pseudosubstrate site, two acidic domains, a lysine-rich domain, and two putative PEST sequences, which may contribute to the regulation of protein kinase activity. RNA-blot hybridization showed that atpk1 encoded a 1.8-kb mRNA. Analysis of atpk1 promoter/beta-glucuronidase reporter gene fusions in transgenic plants showed that atpk1 was expressed in all tissues and at all developmental stages, with the strongest expression observed in metabolically active tissues, suggesting that atpk1 is involved in the control of plant growth and development. The first intron of atpk1 functions as an enhancer in atpk1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1506703897,"Cytochrome P450c17 encoded by CYP17, whose expression is regulated by peptide hormones via cAMP, is required for cortisol and sex hormone biosynthesis thereby playing a key role in biological processes including sexual differentiation. Utilizing the cAMP-regulatory sequence CRS1 of the bovine CYP17 gene as an affinity ligand, four CRS1-binding proteins have been purified from nuclear extracts of mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells and shown to enhance the in vitro transcription of a reporter gene promoted by CRS1. Microsequencing of these four proteins established two of them to be the homeodomain proteins Pbx1a and Pbx1b, originally discovered by their involvement in the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Overexpression of Pbx1 in Y1 cells enhances cAMP-dependent transcription of the CRS1-dependent reporter gene. These results identify the CRS1 of bovine CYP17 as a cellular target for Pbx1 and suggest that one role of this homeodomain protein is in the regulation of steroidogenesis and subsequently sexual development."
https://openalex.org/W1522785199,"The Kst-6 cell line is a human KB carcinoma cell line that has a stably integrated chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of the human mdr-1 promoter. Using Kst-6 cells as the parental cell line, five vincristine-resistant sublines, designated Kst-V5, -V25, -V50, -V75, and -V100, were isolated by exposure to increasing concentrations of drug. These sublines showed increased resistance to vincristine when compared with parental Kst-6 cells. Two sublines, V25-1 and V25-2, were further isolated from Kst-V25 after culture in the presence of vincristine, and V100-1 and V100-2 were also isolated from Kst-V100. Southern analysis demonstrated mdr-1 gene amplification in Kst-50, Kst-V75, Kst-V100, V100-1, and V100-2 cells, respectively, but not in Kst-V5, Kst-V25, V25-1, and V25-2 cells. In contrast, increased mdr-1 expression was documented by Northern analysis in Kst-V25, V25-1, and V25-2 cells and five cell lines with mdr-1 amplification. Southern blot analysis utilizing a CAT probe demonstrated a stable copy number in all vincristine-resistant sublines. However, Northern analysis documented increased CAT expression in Kst-V5, Kst-V25, V25-1, and V25-2 cells but reduced mRNA levels in the cell line with amplification of the endogenous mdr-1 gene. Expression of the CAT gene was increased along with the endogenous mdr-1 gene in the early steps of the selection but decreased with the onset of gene amplification. There appeared almost similar mRNA levels of two trans-acting factor genes, SP-1 and MDR-NF1/YB-1, which are supposed to be involved in mdr-1 gene promoter activation, among all cell lines used in this study. These findings suggest that transcription of both the CAT gene fused to the mdr-1 promoter and the endogenous mdr-1 gene is enhanced through activation by trans-acting factors in the early steps of drug selection. However, the quantity of trans-activating factor is limiting, and with the onset of gene amplification, less is available for activation of the CAT gene, resulting in decreased expression."
https://openalex.org/W1631593954,Rat phenylalanine hydroxylase was expressed in Escherichia coli. High level expression was achieved when the transformed E. coli were incubated at 27 degrees C for 24 h. A series of truncated fragments were expressed. The smallest fragment that gave an active soluble protein was from Leu142 to Phe410. This fragment corresponds closely to the region where there is highest homology between the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. The circular dichroism spectra of the phenylalanine hydroxylase catalytic core suggested that it contains around 50% alpha-helix. The core fragment is monomeric in dilute solutions but self-associates at higher concentrations. The E. coli expression system was used to generate a number of mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase from position 264 to 290. This region had been previously shown to be important for pterin binding. Characterization of the mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase molecules identified Glu286 as an amino acid critical for pterin function in phenylalanine hydroxylase.
https://openalex.org/W1537557435,"Microtubules are present at postsynaptic densities in brain and are proposed to be involved in anchoring neurotransmitter receptor clusters at postsynaptic membranes. However, the influence of microtubules on gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors has not been studied. Microtubule-affecting agents were tested for their actions on GABAA receptor function, by measuring muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake into cerebral cortical microsacs and proteoliposomes and GABA-mediated currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing GABAA receptors. Colchicine, nocodazole, vinblastine, and taxol inhibited muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake. beta- and gamma-lumicolchicine did not inhibit GABAA ergic function. Colchicine decreased the potency of muscimol, a GABA agonist, to stimulate chloride uptake without affecting the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam or t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the GABAA receptor, or the allosteric modulation of binding of these ligands by muscimol. The function of purified GABAA receptors reconstituted in proteoliposomes, a preparation not containing microtubule components, was not affected by colchicine. In contrast to the results seen in human monocytes by other investigators, we found that colchicine decreased, rather than increased, protein kinase A activity in cortical microsacs. Thus, protein kinase A modulation of the GABAA receptor is not a likely mechanism for the actions of colchicine. We propose that microtubule-depolymerizing agents inhibit GABAA ergic function by disrupting the interaction of GABAA receptors with microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1511004399,"hsp60 is a chaperonin located in the mitochondrial matrix. It has been suggested that hsp60 participates in two processes: protein folding in the matrix, and the sorting of imported proteins to the intermembrane space. We analyzed hsp60 function by allowing isolated mitochondria to import two model precursor proteins and then measuring the binding of these proteins to the chaperonin. Of the methods that we tested for monitoring the association of imported proteins with hsp60, only co-immunoprecipitation with specific anti-hsp60 antibodies proved to be reliable. A chimeric matrix-targeted precursor, consisting of a mitochondrial presequence fused to a chloroplast-encoded protein, bound stably to hsp60 after import. In contrast, there was no detectable binding to hsp60 with a fusion protein that was targeted to the intermembrane space by the bipartite cytochrome b2 presequence. Analysis of a translocation intermediate demonstrated that the cytochrome b2 presequence arrests import through the inner membrane, with the result that the attached passenger protein is never exposed to hsp60."
https://openalex.org/W1586998421,"D-Amino-acid oxidase from Rhodotorula gracilis was irreversibly inactivated by phenylglyoxal in a biphasic process. The fast phase was completed in less than 1 min. Its extent was linearly dependent on phenylglyoxal concentration and was not influenced by the presence of FAD or benzoate, a pseudo-substrate. The second phase of inactivation was due to a simple second-order reaction. The presence of FAD exerted only partial protection; the second-order rate constants of inactivation were 8.3 M-1 min-1 for holoprotein and 18.0 M-1 min-1 for apoprotein. The addition of benzoate completely protected against this second phase of inactivation. Efforts to isolate the enzyme modified at a single arginine residue at the end of the fast phase were unsuccessful, but analysis of the enzyme isolated at the end of the slow phase identified an arginine residue, protected by benzoate, that is highly conserved in all D-amino-acid oxidases and corresponds to Arg283 in the pig kidney enzyme. Modification of this residue is directly involved in the inactivation process during the slow phase. This arginine may represent the basic residue ion pairing with the carboxylate group of the substrate or the residue interacting with the flavin N1-C2 = O locus."

https://openalex.org/W1543646430,"Although chaperonin-assisted protein folding has been studied in vitro by a number of investigators, the feature(s) of the unfolded polypeptide that are recognized and bound by chaperonins is not known. We have addressed this question using the precursor of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (pS) as a substrate for GroEL. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal fusion to protein A. Protein A-pS and any associated cellular proteins were then purified by affinity chromatography. GroEL could be eluted from the fusion protein by incubation with ATP and either GroES or casein, consistent with results of in vitro folding assays. At least half of the transit sequence of pS is required to maintain this high stoichiometry of chaperonin binding. Using deletion mutagenesis from the C terminus of pS, we defined the smallest truncation of pS, PAxpS90T, that binds GroEL with high avidity (dissociation constant = 53 nM). A series of site-specific mutations targeting the C-terminal 15-20 amino acids of PAxpS90T was constructed and analyzed for the ability to bind GroEL. Our results show that complex formation between GroEL and pS is not dependent upon any single feature such as overall hydrophobicity, a net positive charge, or secondary structure but may be dependent upon a combination of these features."

https://openalex.org/W1555242511,"The crystal structure of RNase T1 complexed with 3'-GMP has been determined. The glycosyl conformation of 3'-GMP is in the syn conformation, and the ribose adopts the O4'-endo pucker. This observed pucker is different from that in any complex structures of RNase T1. In the present complex, this energetically unfavorable conformation is stabilized by the water molecule with the bridged hydrogen bonds between the O2' and the O3' atoms of the ribose. The guanine base is recognized in the same manner as observed in the complex of 2'-GMP. The 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose shows a tight hydrogen bond to both His-40 and Glu-58 with the suitable geometry for the proton transfer. These hydrogen bonds suggest that the two residues can participate directly in the proton transfer. His-92 is hydrogen bonded to two the proton transfer. His-92 is hydrogen bonded to two oxygen atoms of the phosphate group. Based on the geometry in the active site, the O1P atom may correspond to the O5' atom of the leaving nucleotide in the phosphoryl transfer or a water molecule as a nucleophile in the hydrolysis reaction. In the present complex, the conformations of the 3'-GMP molecule and the side chains of the catalytic residues would be represented as the conformation before the phosphoryl transfer reaction and/or after the hydrolysis reaction."
