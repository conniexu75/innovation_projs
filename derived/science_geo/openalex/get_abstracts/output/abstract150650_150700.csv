We report that human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells express the a17 and a22 splice forms of the np-2 receptor. Both np-2 forms bind VEGF165 with high affinity in the presence of heparin (KD 1.3 × 10−10m) but not VEGF121. np-2 also binds the heparin-binding form of placenta growth factor. These binding characteristics resemble those of np-1. VEGF145 is a secreted heparin binding VEGF form that contains the peptide encoded by exon 6 of VEGF but not the peptide encoded by exon 7, which is present in VEGF165. VEGF145 binds to np-2 with high affinity (KD 7 × 10−10m). Surprisingly, VEGF145 did not bind to np-1. Indeed, VEGF145does not bind to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which predominantly express np-1. By contrast, VEGF145 binds to human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells, which express both np-1 and np-2. The binding of VEGF165 to porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing recombinant np-2 did not affect the proliferation or migration of the cells. Nevertheless, it is possible that VEGF-induced np-2-mediated signaling will take place only in the presence of other VEGF receptors such as VEGF receptor-1 or VEGF receptor-2.

Targeted disruption of the VEGF gene has shown that even in animals containing a single allele of the VEGF gene angiogenesis is severely disrupted, indicating that the maintenance of exact VEGF levels in vivo is critical for the correct development of the cardiovascular system (7.Ferrara N.

Five splice forms of human VEGF ranging in length from 121 to 206 amino acids (VEGF121–VEGF206) have been characterized (4.Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). These forms differ primarily in the presence or absence of the heparin binding domains encoded by exons 6 and 7, giving rise to forms that differ in their heparin and heparan-sulfate binding ability (11.Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Poltorak Z. Tessler S. Gengrinovitch S. Levi B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189 forms appear to be abundant and are usually produced simultaneously by VEGF-producing cells (1.Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). VEGF145 is a rarer and much less studied VEGF form, which was reported to be expressed by cells derived from the female reproductive system (9.Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) as well in other organs such as the skin, penis, and kidney (12.Burchardt M. Burchardt T. Chen M.W.

It contains the heparin binding domain encoded by exon 6 and binds tightly to the extracellular matrix (9.Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). VEGF165 contains the heparin binding domain included in exon 7 and binds to heparin with an affinity that is similar to that of VEGF145. However, VEGF165 binds much less tightly than VEGF145 to extracellular matrix. VEGF121 lacks both exons and has no affinity for either heparin or for extracellular matrixes. Other VEGF family members such as PlGF and VEGF-B are also expressed in several forms that differ in their heparin binding ability. For example, the peptide encoded by exon 6 of PlGF is found only in PlGF-2 and confers a heparin binding ability to this form while PlGF-1 and PlGF-3 do not bind to heparin (15.Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Delvecchio S. Lei K.J. Chou J.Y. Persico M.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar,16.Cao Y.H. Ji W.D.R. Qi P. Rosin A. Cao Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All the VEGF isoforms bind to the tyrosine-kinase receptors VEGFR-1 (flt-1) (17.Shibuya M. Yamaguchi S. Yamane A. Ikeda T. Tojo A. Matsushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/flk-1) (18.Terman B.I. Carrion M.E. Kovacs E. Rasmussen B.A. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1677-1683PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 initiates intracellular signal transduction (1.Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z.

Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar, 23.Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast the activation of VEGFR-1 does not seem to result in the induction of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, or permeabilization of blood vessels but enhances cell migration (24.Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Roeckl W.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there have also been other reports that indicate that the activation of VEGFR-1 can induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis (27.Ziche M. Maglione D. Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. Vincenti V. Granger H.J. Viglietto G. Persico M.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these receptors have also been shown to play critical roles in embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (28.Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar,29.Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells also contain another type of VEGF receptors possessing a lower mass than either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-1 (30.Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently found that these smaller VEGF receptors of the endothelial cells are isoform specific receptors that bind VEGF165 but not VEGF121 (32.Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It was therefore recognized that these receptors are not related to the VEGFR-1 or to the VEGFR-2 receptors, which bind to both VEGF isoforms. An additional search revealed several types of prostate and breast cancer cell lines, which express unusually large amounts of these isoform-specific receptors (33.Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A VEGF165 affinity column was used to purify the receptors from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and sequencing of the receptor revealed it to be the product of the gene for np-1 (34.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). NP-1 is likely to play an important role in the development of the cardiovascular system. Gene disruption studies have indicated that np-1 is probably an important regulator of blood vessel development since mouse embryos lacking a functional np-1 gene die because their cardiovascular system fails to develop properly (35.Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments have shown that np-1 also serves as a receptor for the heparin-binding form of placenta growth factor (PlGF), PlGF-2, and for VEGF-B (36.Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R. Baumann H. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22272-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 37.Makinen T. Olofsson B. Karpanen T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21217-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). np-1 was previously identified as a receptor for semaphorin-3A (38.He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 39.Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and it was demonstrated that the VEGF165 and semaphorin-3A binding sites on np-1 overlap (40.Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Semaphorins act as repellents of growing tips of axons, and it was recently observed that semaphorin-3A inhibits migration of endothelial cells causing a collapse of the actin cytoskeleton (41.Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). NP-1 is part of a receptor family that also contains np-2, a receptor that displays highly similar structural features and is a receptor for semaphorin-3C and for semaphorin-3F. Interestingly, np-1 and np-2 can form complexes (40.Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). NP-2 shares a 44% identity at the amino acids level with np-1. Several alternatively spliced forms of np-2 that can be divided into two broad groups have been identified. Mouse group A variants have insertions of 5, 17, or 22 amino acids at amino acid 809 (42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In humans only one splice form of this group was identified having a 17-amino acid insertion at position 808 (42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Mouse group B isoforms differ in the sequence of the transmembrane and intracellular parts starting from amino acid 809, and two such isoforms have been identified (42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of np-2 differs from that of np-1. Although there are broad overlaps, there are regions in which there is np-1 expression but no np-2 expression. For example, in contrast to np-1, np-2 expression was not detected in the heart or in capillaries but was found in the dorsal aorta colliculus (40.Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The neuropilins have short intracellular domains and are therefore unlikely to function as independent signaling receptors, and it was indeed shown recently that plexins form signaling complexes with both neuropilins (43.Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 44.Tamagnone L.

Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Since np-1 functions as a VEGF receptor, we sought to determine whether np-2 is also a receptor for VEGF family members. We have cloned the np-2 cDNA from HUVEC. We show that np-2 functions as a splice variant specific VEGF receptor that binds VEGF165 but not VEGF121. However, the two receptors do not behave equally with regard to their interactions with VEGF since np-2 is able to bind VEGF145, a VEGF splice form that does not bind to np-1. The VEGF splice forms and PlGF-2 were produced in sF9 cells using appropriate baculoviruses and purified as described previously (9.Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I.

The pBabePuro plasmid was kindly given to us by Dr. Eyal Ben-Gal from the Technion School of Medicine (Haifa, Israel). BS3 was obtained from Pierce. Tissue culture media, sera, and cell culture supplements were from Beth-Haemek Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beth-Haemek, Israel), or from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The pre-stained protein size markers used were purchased from Bio-Rad. The np-1 and np-2 cDNA were reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) from total RNA prepared from HUVEC as described (47.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The cDNA was amplified using the expand high fidelity PCR system kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers used were ACGCGGATCCACCATGGAGAGGGGGCTGCCGCT and AGCGGATCCGTCGACTCATGCCTCCGAATAAGTACTC for np-1 and GCTCTAGAACCATGGATATGTTTCCTCTCACC and GCTCTAGAGT CGACTCATGCCTCGGAGCAGCACTT for np-2. The primers for np-2 generated two cDNA products corresponding to the previously described a17 and a22 forms of np-2 (42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Both strands of the PCR products were sequenced and the nucleotide sequence compared with published sequences. The np-1 cDNA contained one consistent deviation from published sequences. Nucleotide 2197 contains an A instead of a G, giving rise to an isoleucine residue instead a valine residue. The np-1 cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI site of pcDNA3/neo expression vector to generate the pcDNA3/np-1 expression vector, and the two np-2 cDNAs were subcloned into XbaI site of the PECE expression vector (48.Peretz D. Gitay-Goren H. Safran M. Kimmel N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to generate PECE/np-2 expression vectors containing the two splice forms (42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S.

Human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and cultured in M199 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, as described previously (32.Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S.

The PAE cells used throughout this report were cultured as described in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics (24.Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PAE cells were kindly provided by Dr. Carl Heldin. The np-1-expressing PAE cell lines were generated by transfecting PAE cells with the pcDNA3/np-1 expression vector followed by selection of stable transfectants using G418 (0.5 mg/ml). The np-2-expressing cell lines were generated by co-transfecting PAE cells with the PECE/np-2(a17) or PECE/np-2(a22) expression vectors and the pBabePuro plasmid (49.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), followed by selection with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (49.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were subsequently cultured without puromycin or G418. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured as described previously (33.Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding of the VEGF isoforms to cells and cross-linking was carried out essentially as described previously (30.Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

NP-2 was originally characterized as a receptor for semaphorins 3C and 3F, whereas np-1 was originally identified as a semaphorin-3A receptor (39.Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). NP-1 was subsequently found to be a receptor for VEGF165 (34.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). We hypothesized, therefore, that np-2 may also act as a VEGF receptor. Northern blot analysis revealed np-2 mRNA transcripts in HUVEC (data not shown). RT-PCR led to the isolation of two cDNA species encoding two splice forms of human np-2 from HUVEC-derived mRNA. These correspond to the previously identified a17 and a22 splice forms (42.Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs encoding these np-2 forms were stably expressed in PAE cells. 125I-VEGF165 was subsequently bound and cross-linked to the PAE/np-2(a22) cells. The binding was strongly enhanced by heparin, and two125I-VEGF165/np-2 cross-linked complexes of ∼140 and ∼160 kDa could be observed (Fig.1 A, lane 2). The binding was specific since125I-VEGF165 did not bind to parental PAE cells, even though heparin was added during the binding (Fig.1 B, lane 3). Similar results were obtained when PAE/np-2(a17) cells were used (data not shown). It was previously observed that the related receptor encoded by the np-1 gene binds VEGF165 but not VEGF121 (34.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 36.Migdal M. Huppertz B. Tessler S. Comforti A. Shibuya M. Reich R. Baumann H. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22272-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It seems that np-2 behaves similarly since cells expressing the recombinant np-2 forms were not able to bind125I-VEGF121 (Fig. 1 A,lane 4), even though the125I-VEGF121 used bound efficiently to recombinant VEGFR-1 receptors that were expressed in PAE cells (Fig.1 B, lane 2). The affinities of np-1 and np-2 toward VEGF165 were compared using Scatchard analysis. The dissociation constant of VEGF165 from np-2 found to be 1.3 × 10−10m, while the dissociation constant of VEGF165 from np-1 was 1.8 × 10−10m (data not shown). The dissociation constants are thus very similar. NP-1 was also found to function as a VEGF-B receptor and a receptor for the heparin-binding form of placenta growth factor, PlGF-2 (36.Migdal M.

We have therefore asked whether PlGF-2 can also bind to np-2. A complex corresponding in size to a PlGF-2/np-2 complex was observed when 125I-PlGF-2 was bound and cross-linked to PAE cells expressing either the a22 splice form of np-2 (Fig. 2, lane 1) or the a17 form (Fig. 2, lane 3). Similar complexes were absent when 125I-PlGF-2 was bound and cross-linked to parental PAE cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). These experiments indicate that np-2 can also function as a receptor for PlGF-2. np-2 and np-1 bind to different ligands in the central nervous system. Our initial experiments did not reveal any differences between np-1 and np-2 with regard to their interactions with VEGF165 and PlGF-2. However, when VEGF145 was bound and subsequently cross-linked to np-1 and to np-2, it was found that VEGF145is able to bind to np-2 but not to np-1 (Fig.3). VEGF145 is a VEGF splice form that lacks exon 7 and contains instead the peptide encoded by exon 6 of the VEGF gene (9.Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). These results were verified by competition experiments, which have shown clearly that VEGF145 competes with VEGF165 for binding to np-2 but not for binding to np-1 (Fig. 3 B). The affinity of VEGF145 toward np-2 is about 5 fold lower than that of VEGF165 as is revealed by binding/competition experiments (Fig. 4 B). Thus the dissociation constant of VEGF145 is around 7 × 10−10m as compared with 1.3 × 10−10m for VEGF165. However, even 4 μg/ml VEGF145 were not sufficient to inhibit significantly the binding of125I-VEGF165 to np-1, indicating that the affinity of np-1 to VEGF145 is at least 100-fold lower (Fig. 4 A). Because VEGF145 differentiates between the two neuropilin types, we have also looked at the expression of np-2 on the surface of sev"

A dynamic balance of histone acetylation/deacetylation is maintained by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Emerging evidence suggests that a family of histone deacetylases may exist to regulate diverse cellular functions, including chromatin structure, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and oncogenesis. We describe here a novel human histone deacetylase, named HDAC8, cloned from human kidney. HDAC8 encodes 377 amino acid residues and shares extensive homology to several known HDACs, in particular a histone deacetylase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Northern blot analyses revealed that HDAC8 expression pattern for HDAC8 is distinct from that for HDAC1 and HDAC3, and expression of HDAC8 mRNA occurs in multiple organs including heart, lung, kidney, and pancreas. HDAC8 mRNA was also observed in several cell lines derived from cancerous tissues. When expressed in HEK293 cells, HDAC8 exhibited deacetylase activity toward acetylated histone, indicating that this protein is a bona fidehistone deacetylase. Its histone deacetylase activity was inhibited by trichostatin and other known histone deacetylase inhibitors. Furthermore, active recombinant HDAC8 was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli. When ectopically expressed in cells, HDAC8 was found to be localized to the nucleus. Co-transfection experiments demonstrated that expression of HDAC8 repressed a viral SV40 early promoter activity. These results indicate that HDAC8 is a novel member of the histone deacetylase family, which may play a role in the development of a broad range of tissues and potentially in the etiology of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2000501974,"RIM1 is a putative effector protein for Rab3s, synaptic GTP-binding proteins. RIM1 is localized close to the active zone at the synapse, where it interacts in a GTP-dependent manner with Rab3 located on synaptic vesicles. We now describe a second RIM protein, called RIM2, that is highly homologous to RIM1 and also expressed primarily in brain. Like RIM1, RIM2 contains an N-terminal zinc finger domain that binds to Rab3 as a function of GTP, a central PDZ domain, and two C-terminal C2 domains that are separated by long alternatively spliced sequences. Unexpectedly, the 3′-end of the RIM2 gene produces an independent mRNA that encodes a smaller protein referred as NIM2. NIM2 is composed of a unique N-terminal sequence followed by the C-terminal part of RIM2. Data bank searches identified a third RIM/NIM-related gene, which encodes a NIM isoform referred to as NIM3; no RIM transcript from this gene was detected. To test if NIMs, like RIMs, may function in secretion, we investigated the effect of NIM3 on calcium-triggered exocytosis in PC12 cells. NIM3 induced a dramatic increase in calcium-evoked exocytosis (50%), with no significant effect on base-line release, suggesting that NIMs, like RIMs, regulate exocytosis The combination of conserved and variable sequences in RIMs and NIMs indicates that the individual domains of these proteins provide binding sites for interacting molecules during exocytosis, as shown for the zinc finger domain of RIM, which binds to GTP-bound Rab3s. To search for additional interacting proteins for RIMs, we employed yeast two-hybrid screens with the C-terminal half of RIM1. Two members of a new family of homologous brain proteins, referred to as RIM-binding proteins (RIM-BPs), were identified. RIM-BPs bind to RIM in yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays, suggesting a specific interaction. In RIMs, the binding site for RIM-BPs consists of a conserved proline-rich sequence between the two C2domains, N-terminal to the beginning of NIMs. RIM-BPs are composed of multiple domains, including three fibronectin type III-domains and three Src homology 3 domains, of which the second Src homology 3 domain binds to RIMs. With the RIM-BPs, we have identified a partner for RIMs that may bind to RIMs at the synapse in addition to Rab3."
https://openalex.org/W2076439289,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, regulates a variety of cell fates and functions. At present, the molecular mechanism by which BMP2 induces apoptosis has not been fully elucidated. Here we propose a BMP2 signaling pathway that mediates apoptosis in mouse hybridoma MH60 cells whose growth is interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent. BMP2 dose-dependently induces apoptosis in MH60 cells even in the presence of IL-6. BMP2 has no inhibitory effect on the IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, and the bcl-2 gene expression which is known to be regulated by STAT3, suggesting that BMP2-induced apoptosis is not attributed to alteration of the IL-6-mediated bcl-2pathway. We demonstrate that BMP2 induces activation of TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1) and subsequent phosphorylation of p38 stress-activated protein kinase. In addition, forced expression of kinase-negative TAK1 in MH60 cells blocks BMP2-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that BMP2-induced apoptosis is mediated through the TAK1-p38 pathway in MH60 cells. We also show that MH60-derived transfectants expressing Smad6 are resistant to the apoptotic signal of BMP2. Interestingly, this ectopic expression of Smad6 blocks BMP2-induced TAK1 activation and p38 phosphorylation. Moreover, Smad6 can directly bind to TAK1. These findings suggest that Smad6 is likely to function as a negative regulator of the TAK1 pathway in the BMP2 signaling, in addition to the previously reported Smad pathway.

Downstream of the receptor complex, at least two distinct intracellular pathways have been suggested for mediating inductive signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. One pathway involves a family of transcription factors collectively known as Smads. Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8 are phosphorylated by activated type I BMP2/4 receptors and are then associated with a common signaling mediator, Smad4. The resultant heteromeric Smad complex is translocated into the nucleus where they activate transcription (3.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Another pathway is mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade initiated by TAK1 (for TGF-β-activated kinase-1) (6.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). TAK1 was originally identified as a member of MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) activated in response to TGF-β and BMP4 (6.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that TAK1 functions as a mediator of the MKK6-p38 pathway and the MKK7-JNK pathway (7.Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K.

However, a regulatory mechanism of the signal transduction pathway mediated by TAK1 remains to be clarified. After initial activation of the receptors, BMP2 elicits multiple effects ranging from cell differentiation to regulation of early embryogenesis. Because there are tens of different cytokines present simultaneously in vivo, it is sometimes the case that two different signal pathways could cause the synergistic or antagonistic interplay in common target cells. We have recently reported that BMP2 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) act in synergy on cultured fetal neural progenitor cells to induce differentiation into astrocytes, whereas BMP2 or LIF alone do not induce astrocyte development under the same culture conditions (10.Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). LIF is a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, which shares membrane glycoprotein gp130 as a common subunit in the receptor complex (11.Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the receptor triggers the dimerization of gp130, activating gp130-associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in the Janus kinase family and a downstream transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) (11.Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In the case of synergistic effect caused by BMP2 and LIF, respective downstream transcription factors Smad1 and STAT3 form a signal-dependent complex bridged by p300 in the nucleus, thereby exerting the synergy between BMP2 and LIF in astrocyte differentiation (10.Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Moreover, another group has demonstrated the inhibitory cross-talk between the Smad cascade and the signal from a receptor tyrosine kinase: activation of epidermal growth factor receptor leads to MAPK activation, which then phosphorylates Smad1 on serine residues, thereby inhibiting Smad1 translocation into the nucleus (12.Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempt to know the interaction of the signals mediated by IL-6 and those by BMP2 in mouse hybridoma MH60 cells whose growth is IL-6-dependent. We show here that BMP2 induces apoptosis in MH60 cells even in the presence of proliferative signals of IL-6. We show that phosphorylation of STAT3 and expression of its target gene bcl-2 are not affected by BMP2, suggesting that the cell death signaling pathway initiated by BMP2 is independent of the survival signaling by IL-6. The studies presented here further propose a mechanism of BMP2-induced apoptosis in MH60 cells, which appears to be mediated by the TAK1-p38 kinase pathway. In addition, we show that Smad6 unexpectedly blocks BMP2-induced apoptosis and suggest a mechanism by which Smad6 prevents cell death promoted by BMP2. Wild type TAK1 cDNA was subcloned into pEF-BOSE-FLAG vector (13.Nakashima K. Narazaki M. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to generate pEFBOSE-FLAG-TAK1. Mammalian expression vectors encoding HA-BMPR-IA, Myc-XIAP, and FLAG-TAB1 were described previously (14.Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). HA-TAK1 (wild type) and HA-KNTAK1 (K63W) were also described previously (15.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K.

Myc-tagged and FLAG-tagged Smad6-expressing vectors were kind gifts of Drs. Miyazono and Imamura (16.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Mouse Hybridoma MH60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 ng/ml IL-6. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To establish Smad6-overexpressing MH60 cell clones (MH60/Smad6), 20 μg of FLAG-tagged Smad6 expression vector or mock vector was cotransfected with 1 μg of pSV2-NEO using an electroporation method. Transfectants were selected by 500 μg/ml G418, and single cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. Expression of Smad6 was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Cells (2 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate) were cultured in 100 μl of medium containing 2 ng/ml IL-6 and various concentrations of BMP2 for 40 h. The number of viable cells was then examined by a colorimetric assay using the WST-8 cell-counting kit (Wako). First strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The respective first strand cDNAs were then used directly for amplification of bcl-2 and G3PDH genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR reaction was performed using cycling conditions appropriate for each gene. After the cultivation of cells in the presence of 50 ng/ml of BMP2 for 13 or 24 h, cells (5 × 105) were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 10 mm EDTA. After treatment with RNase A and proteinase K, the size of DNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To examine the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, MH60 cells were starved for 1 h without IL-6 and then treated with IL-6 together with BMP2 or IL-6 or with BMP2 alone. After 10 min, the cells were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotted with anti-STAT3 antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate). The proteins were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To examine the p38 activation, MH60 cells were treated with BMP2 (20 ng/ml) for 10 or 20 min after starvation as described above. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoblotting with p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phospho-specific p38 antibody (New England BioLabs), respectively. For the coimmunoprecipitation assay, COS7 cells were transfected with expression constructs using a Trans-IT LT-1 polyamine transfection reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 1 day in culture, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer. Lysates from transfected COS7 cells or MH60 transfectants were incubated with antibody to Myc (Genosys) or FLAG (Sigma) for 2 h, and immune complexes were then precipitated with magnetic protein G (BioMag) for 30 min. Precipitates and, in some cases, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, anti-HA (Santa Cruz), or anti-TAK1 (Santa Cruz). MH60 cells were transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min followed by washing with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed again, and incubated in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody against FLAG-epitope or polyclonal antibody against HA-epitope at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (ImmunoResearch) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) for an additional 1 h. After three times washing, cells were counter-stained with Hoechst 33258. Images were obtained using fluorescent microscopy (AX70, Olympus). Cells were lysed in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Endogenous TAK1 was precipitated using rabbit polyclonal antibody against TAK1-C-terminal peptide (8.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K.

Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) then twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 1 μg of the specific substrate his-MKK6. The kinase reaction was initiated by addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). After 2 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. We have previously demonstrated that BMP2 and LIF exert a synergistic effect on the differentiation of neural progenitor cells (10.Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In an attempt to know whether a similar cooperative mechanism takes place in other cell systems, we tested the effect of BMP2 on the growth of IL-6-dependent mouse hybridoma MH60 cells. As shown in Fig.1, BMP2 dose-dependently suppressed growth of MH60 cells in the presence of IL-6. To know the mechanism of this growth suppression induced by BMP2, we first examined whether BMP2 alters the cell cycle distribution and/or induces apoptosis on MH60 cells cultured with IL-6. BMP2 treatment for 24 h resulted in the cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (data not shown) and genomic DNA fragmentation (Fig.2 A). These observations indicate that treatment of BMP2 causes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and apoptosis in MH60 cells.Figure 2BMP2 induced apoptosis in MH60 hybridomas but did not interfere with the IL-6 signal transduction pathway. MH60 cells were incubated with IL-6 (2 ng/ml) or BMP2 (50 ng/ml) in a combination as indicated above the figure. A, DNA purified after 24-h culture was analyzed for fragmentation in an agarose gel.B, total RNA prepared after 15-h culture was used for reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis with primers specific forbcl-2 and G3PDH.

To examine whether the BMP2 signaling interferes with the IL-6 signaling pathway at the step of STAT3 activation, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the presence or absence of BMP2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, which has been shown to be a prerequisite for STAT3 activation, was induced in MH60 cells by IL-6 stimulation, whereas it was not affected by BMP2 (Fig. 2 C). STAT3 activation has been shown to be important for bcl-2 gene expression and eventually for cell survival by IL-6 (17.Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). These data indicate that BMP2-induced apoptosis in MH60 cells is not caused by the inhibition of STAT3 activation or its downstream targets. It has been shown that Smad6 is a negative regulator of the Smad1, -5, and -8 signaling cascade initiated by BMP2 (16.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Smad6 inhibits BMP2-induced apoptosis, we established stable transfectants with a Smad6 expression vector and examined cell growth after 40 h of BMP2 treatment. Smad6-expressing transfectants (MH60/Smad6; three independent representative clones 4, 5, and 6) were resistant to BMP2, whereas treatment of mock vector transfectants (MH60/control; clones 1, 2, and 3) with BMP2 resulted in significant growth suppression (Fig.3 A). In all three Smad6-expressing clones, chromosomal DNA fragmentation did not occur after BMP2 treatment (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that Smad6 blocks BMP2-induced apoptosis. The result described above that bcl-2 gene expression was not changed at the mRNA and protein levels (not shown) in response to BMP2 suggested the existence of a signaling cascade other than those involving bcl-2 regulation for the apoptotic response of MH60 cells. We then focused on p38 stress-activated protein kinase whose activation has been suggested to be involved in the induction of apoptosis independent of bcl-2 function, in response to various cytotoxic stresses such as UV and x-ray radiation, heat shock, and tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation (18.Xia Z.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether treatment of MH60 cells with BMP2 leads to activation of p38. As shown in Fig.4 A, the level of the activated form of p38, which can be detected by phospho-p38-specific antibody, increased within 5 min after treatment with BMP2. Because it is known that p38 lies downstream of the TAK1-MKK6 pathway (7.Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we next examined the activation of TAK1 kinase by immunocomplex kinase assay using a recombinant his-MKK6 protein as a substrate. Fig. 4 B shows that treatment of MH60 cells with BMP2 significantly enhanced the protein kinase activity of TAK1, which coincided with p38 activation (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that BMP2 activates the TAK1-p38 pathway in MH60 cells. To our surprise, in the Smad6-overexpressing MH60 cells (MH60/Smad6), which are resistant to BMP2-induced apoptosis, activation of p38 and TAK1 did not occur after BMP2 stimulation (Fig. 4, A andB). These results indicate that Smad6 inhibits the activation of the TAK1-p38 pathway in BMP2 signaling. Catalytically inactive TAK1 (TAK1/KN) is known to inhibit the TAK1 signaling pathway (6.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of TAK1 in BMP2-induced apoptosis, we transiently transfected expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged TAK1/KN (FLAG-TAK1/KN) or wild type control ((FLAG-TAK1(WT)) into MH60 cells. Expression of these proteins could be identified by immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody. MH60 cells transfected with the above vectors were stimulated with BMP2 for 14 h, followed by staining for FLAG with the specific antibody. The nuclei were stained with the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258), which detected apoptotic change characterized by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. As shown in Fig.5, no apoptotic cells were detected in MH60 cells expressing FLAG-TAK1/KN even when treated with BMP2 (arrows in Fig. 5, A and B). Cells expressing negligible levels of FLAG-TAK1/KN underwent the apoptotic change (arrowheads in A and B). In contrast, MH60 cells transfected with FLAG-TAK1 (WT) exhibited the apoptotic change by treatment with BMP2, regardless of the expression levels of FLAG-TAK1(WT) (arrows in C andD, high expressing cells; arrowheads inC and D, low expressing cells). These results suggest that TAK1 is involved in mediating BMP2-induced apoptosis and that its endogenous expression level is sufficient. It has previously been shown that kinase activity of TAK1 was increased in cells cotransfected with TAB1 vector (15.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, simultaneous expression of TAK1 and TAB1 was able to enhance transcription of reporter gene under the control of the promoter region of the TGF-β-inducible PAI-1 gene even in the absence of TGF-β (15.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In addition, coinjection of TAK1 andTAB1 mRNA into dorsal blastomeres caused ventralization of the Xenopus embryos, mimicking the effect of BMP2 and BMP4 (23.Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of simultaneous expression ofTAK1 and TAB1 in MH60 cells, we cotransfected both expression vectors into MH60 cells. As shown in Fig.6, MH60 cells expressing bothTAK1 and TAB1 genes exhibited clear apoptotic change even in the absence of BMP2, whereas cells expressingTAK1 or TAB1 alone or neither of the two exhibited no apoptotic change. These observations indicate that activated TAK1 is involved in induction of apoptosis in MH60 cells and mimics BMP2 effect. As described above, Smad6 unexpectedly blocked activation of TAK1, which made us hypothesize that Smad6 can associate with TAK1 directly. To determine the target of Smad6 in the apoptotic pathway initiated by BMP2, we expressed these molecules in COS7 cells and analyzed physical interaction using coimmunoprecipitation assays. Lysates from COS7 cells expressing Myc-tagged Smad6 and FLAG-tagged TAK1 were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against FLAG or Myc and immunoblotted with anti-Myc or -FLAG antibody, respectively, to detect Smad6 or TAK1. As shown in Fig. 7 A, Smad6 was coprecipitated with TAK1 (upper panel) and TAK1 was found in the Smad6 immunocomplex (lower panel). With a similar experimental procedure, binding of the endogenous TAK1 to Smad6 in the MH60/Smad6 transfectant clones was also observed (Fig.7 B). Several recent studies have suggested that there is cross-talk between intracellular signaling pathways of different cytokines or growth factors. For example, epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor can antagonize the effects of BMP2 by inducing phosphorylation of Smad1 (12.Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LIF and BMP2 can elicit the synergistic interplay on differentiation of neural progenitor cells (10.Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In the later case, respective downstream transcription factors Smad1 and STAT3 form a complex bridged by p300 in the nucleus in a signal-dependent manner. In MH60 hybridoma cells, BMP2 opposes the proliferative effect of IL-6. However, our data suggest that BMP2 does not interfere with the IL-6 signal transduction pathway, partly because BMP2 does not alter phosphorylation of STAT3 and expression of bcl-2 gene induced by IL-6. Furthermore, we observed that BMP2 could induce apoptosis efficiently enough in MH60 cells regardless of the presence or absence of IL-6 (data not shown); therefore, BMP2 did not induce apoptosis in these cells more efficiently in the absence of IL-6. These results suggest that BMP2 promotes cell death by activating its own apoptotic pathway. BMP2-induced apoptosis has been reported in vivo so far, for example, in rhombomeres 3 and 5 (24.Graham A. Francis-West P. Brickell P. Lumsden A. Nature. 1994; 372: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and the interdigit field of the limb (25.Yokouchi Y. Sakiyama J. Kameda T. Iba H. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Kuroiwa A. Development. 1996; 122: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) in developing chickens. In addition, an earlier study demonstrated that BMP2 was capable of inducing apoptosis in cultured mouse hybridoma HS-72 cells whose growth is independent of IL-6 (27.Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although the BMP2 signal transduction pathways and molecular nature of their components have been studied in detail, the signaling cascade by which BMP2 induces apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro are not fully understood. BMP2 is a member of the TGF-β superfamily of cytokines whose signals have been suggested to be transduced from receptor serine/threonine kinases to the nucleus via at least two different signaling pathways involving transcription factors Smads and MAPKKK family kinase TAK1. TAK1 was originally identified as a TGF-β-responsive MAPKKK (6.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). No member of the TGF-β superfamily other than TGF-β and BMP4 have been reported so far to directly activate TAK1 (6.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). It was later shown that injection of Xenopus TAK1 (xTAK1) and its activator xTAB1 with bcl-2 in early embryos caused ventralization, mimicking the effect of BMP2 and BMP4 inXenopus and implying that TAK1 participates in the BMP2 and BMP4 signaling pathway (15.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show the first evidence that BMP2 could activate TAK1. Studies on early Xenopus embryos have demonstrated that the constitutively active form of xTAK1 or a combination of normal xTAK1 plus xTAB1 could induce not only ventral mesoderm but also cell death (23.Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been presumed that activation of TAK1 has a potential to induce apoptosis in the Xenopus embryo. Here we demonstrated that cotransfection of TAB1 and TAK1leads to the induction of apoptosis, mimicking the effect of BMP2. Because we have not examined whether Smad1 or Smad5 could induce apoptosis on MH60 cells, the possibility that Smad pathway is involved in the BMP2-induced apoptosis could not be completely excluded. However, BMP2-induced apoptosis was completely blocked in the MH60 cells expressing the kinase-defective form of TAK1, suggesting that TAK1 is essential for BMP2-induced apoptotic signaling. Treatment with BMP2 activates TAK1, which was accompanied by similar kinetics of p38 activation. Moriguchi et al. (7.Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) have shown the existence of a kinase cascade consisting of TAK1-MKK6-p38. Other previous reports show that treatment of cells with ceramide (8.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), IL-1 (28.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (9.Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and TGF-β (29.Zhou G. Lee S.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13133-13138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) results in activation of the TAK1-JNK cascade. JNK and p38, collectively known as stress-activated protein kinases, are involved in apoptosis, probably by inducing expression of a Fas ligand (30.Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Taken together, we conclude that BMP2-induced apoptosis is most likely mediated by the TAK1-p38 signal cascade. Proteins Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8 have been shown to transduce signals, in cooperation with Smad4, of the TGF-β superfamily, which is independent of the TAK1-MAPK cascade (3.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar, 4.Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 5.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar). Smad6, one of the two known inhibitory Smad species (Smad6 and Smad7), blocks the Smad pathway by associating with type I receptors to inhibit Smad1 and Smad2 phosphorylation (16.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) or by sequestration of phosphorylated Smad1 from Smad4 (31.Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an overexpression of Smad6 blocks BMP2-induced apoptosis in MH60 cells. In a similar approach, Ishisakiet al. (27.Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have previously shown that an overexpression of Smad6 suppressed BMP2-induced apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells. They showed that Smad6 blocked BMP2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 in HS-72 cells, as has been demonstrated by other groups. However, because their studies did not explain how BMP2 could trigger apoptosis, it was not clear how Smad6 could prevent BMP2-induced apoptosis. Here we clearly show that BMP2-induced apoptosis is dependent on the TAK1-p38 cascade in MH60 cells and that Smad6 prevents the activation of TAK1-p38 cascade induced by BMP2. Therefore, Smad6 is likely to function as a negative regulator of the TAK1 pathway in the apoptotic signaling of BMP2, in addition to the previously known negative regulatory function in the Smad pathway. It has been reported that Smad6 binds to the type I receptors for the TGF-β superfamily cytokines and inhibits the Smad signaling pathway (16.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). It is important to note that our results show that Smad6 physically interacts with TAK1. This was confirmed in a COS7 cell expression system and also in MH60/Smad6 transfectant clones, in the latter of which endogenous TAK1 was found to bind to Smad6. This suggests that Smad6 directly blocks the TAK1 activity by physical interaction. X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a cytoplasmic molecule that is suggested to interact with BMP type I receptor (BMPR-I) and is involved in linking the BMP2-stimulated receptor to TAK1 (14.Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The possibility that association of Smad6 with BMPR-I releases XIAP from BMPR-I and thereby unlinks the receptor to TAK1 dose not appear to be true, because association of BMPR-I with XIAP was not disrupted by binding of Smad6 to BMPR-I in COS7 cells (data not shown). Taken together with the previous finding that Smad6 is a negative regulator of the Smad signaling, our finding of the potential for Smad6 to also inhibit the TAK1-p38 pathway indicates that Smad6 serves as a general inhibitor of TGF-β superfamily cytokines. Because the transcription of Smad6 mRNA is induced by TGF-β superfamily cytokines (32.Takase M. Imamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), Smad6 may completely block the signaling by the TGF-β superfamily in an autoregulatory negative-feedback manner. Recently, involvement of TAK1 in the signal transduction of cytokines outside the TGF-β superfamily has been suggested, for instance in the NF-κB-inducing kinase-IκB kinase cascade in the IL-1 signaling pathway (28.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar) and in the NF-κB essential modulator like kinase MAPK-like cascade in the Wnt signaling pathway (33.Meneghini M.D. Ishitani T. Carter J.C. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Thorpe C.J. Hamill D.R. Matsumoto K. Bowerman B. Nature. 1999; 399: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34.Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Therefore, our finding suggests that antagonistic cross-talk exists between BMP2 and other cytokines such as IL-1 and Wnt. The molecular mechanism by which Smad6 inhibits TAK1 kinase activation remains to be elucidated. TAK1 is known to be activated by binding with TAB1, and it has been proposed that TAB1 binding to TAK1 induces an activating conformational change (15.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We observed that Smad6 interacted with TAK1 but led to little disruption of the TAK1·TAB1 complex (not shown), implying that Smad6 may not compete with TAB1 for the binding to TAK1 but may block the catalytic site, or alternatively, interaction of Smad6 with the TAK1·TAB1 complex could cause the conformational change of TAK1 back to its inactive form again. Our present study and others (27.Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) show BMP2-induced apoptosis in the mouse hybridomas that were derived from plasmacytomas, the tumors of terminally differentiated B lineage cells. We are in the process of testing the effect of BMP2 on human-equivalent tumors, i.e.multiple myeloma. It is of much interest to note that (i) growth of myelomas are often IL-6-dependent; (ii) myeloma cells produce IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and soluble IL-6R (35.Treson S.P. Anderson K.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 42-48PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) patients with multiple myeloma often exhibit osteoporosis, presumably because of promotion of osteoclast development by IL-6 and soluble IL-6R produced by myeloma cells. BMP2 is known to play an important role in inducing the bone formation. In the bone marrow, BMP2 produced by osteoblasts is suggested to be stored in a latent form bound to bone matrix as in the case of TGF-β (36.Mostov K. Werb Z. Science. 1997; 276: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37.Suzawa M. Takeuchi Y. Fukumoto S. Kato S. Ueno N. Miyazono K. Matsumoto T. Fujita T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When bone resorption is initiated by osteoclasts, BMP2 is released from the deposit in the calcified bone matrix, and thereafter it stimulates the differentiation of osteoblasts. In addition, osteoclasts activated by IL-6 and soluble IL-6R, which are produced by myelomas, may be growth-inhibited by the released BMP2. Because the bone marrow provides an important hematopoietic microenvironment, bone formation and hematopoiesis are closely related there. For instance, Kajkenova et al. (38.Kajkenova O. Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Hauser S.P. Takahashi K. Parfitt A.M. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Lipschitz D.A. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) has previously shown that myeloid progenitors and IL-6 production were significantly increased in the bone marrow of osteoblastogenesis-defective mouse. Taken together, BMP2 might act as a regulatory factor for maintaining a balance between bone formation and hematopoiesis in the bone marrow.

https://openalex.org/W2154648145,"Src homology 3 (SH3) and WW domains are known to associate with proline-rich motifs within their respective ligands. Here we demonstrate that the proposed adapter protein for Src kinases, Sam68, is a ligand whose proline-rich motifs interact with the SH3 domains of p59 fyn and phospholipase Cγ-1 as well as with the WW domains of FBP30 and FBP21. These proline-rich motifs, in turn, are flanked by RG repeats that represent targets for the type I protein arginine N-methyltransferase. The asymmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues within these RG repeats dramatically reduces the binding of the SH3 domains of p59 fyn and phospholipase Cγ-1, but has no effect on their binding to the WW domain of FBP30. These results suggest that protein arginine methylation can selectively modulate certain protein-protein interactions and that mechanisms exist for the irreversible regulation of SH3 domain-mediated interactions.

Structural analysis of Src-like SH3 domains complexed with ligand reveals three points of contact, involving two hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge. Salt bridge formation between a conserved acidic residue in the SH3 domain and the favored arginine residue, either N-terminal (class I ligand) or C-terminal (class II ligand) to the Pro-X-X-Pro motif, plays a key role in the specificity of this interaction. WW domains also display specificity in their binding to distinct proline-rich sequences. To date, four different WW domain binding motifs have been characterized, with each core motif binding to a subset of WW domains to the exclusion of the other motifs. They are: core I, PPXY (where X signifies any amino acid; binds to the YAP (Ref. 12.Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol.

RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar). SF1 is an RNA-binding protein that belongs to the larger family of KH domain-containing proteins. These include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and FMRP (fragile Xmental retardation protein) and the smaller GSG domain subfamily including Sam68, GRP33, GLD-1, and Qk1 (19.Di Fruscio M.

Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This modification, in general, is likely to play an important role in RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and possibly the regulation of nucleic acid interactions (28.Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29.Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S.

The proline-rich motifs that mediate these interactions are flanked by arginine-glycine (RG) repeats, which are reminiscent of recognition motifs for the type 1 protein N-methyltransferase. In what follows, we demonstrate that Sam68 peptides can be asymmetrically dimethylated on arginine residues. Furthermore, we show that when flanking arginine residues are methylated, Src-like SH3 domain binding to isolated Sam68 proline-rich motifs is dramatically reduced. By contrast, WW domain binding to these same Sam68 sequences remains largely unaffected by arginine methylation. These results identify a novel mechanism by which protein-protein interactions can be differentially regulated. WW1 and SH3 domains are structurally distinct modules that are functionally alike in that they bind proline-rich motifs within their corresponding ligands (1.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). The specificity of their interaction is mediated by unique sequences that correlate with binding pockets found on the surface of these domains (2.Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct.

We recently cloned the human transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) gene, which encodes a second receptor for transferrin (Kawabata, H., Yang, R., Hirama, T., Vuong, P. T., Kawano, S., Gombart, A. F., and Koeffler, H. P. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20826–20832). In the present study, the regulation of TfR2 expression and function was investigated. A select Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-TRVb cell line that does not express either TfR1 or TfR2 was stably transfected with either TfR1 or TfR2-α cDNA. TfR2-α-expressing cells had considerably lower affinity for holotransferrin when compared with TfR1-expressing CHO cells. Interestingly, in contrast to TfR1, expression ofTfR2 mRNA in K562 cells was not up-regulated by desferrioxamine (DFO), a cell membrane-permeable iron chelator. In MG63 cells, expression of TfR2 mRNA was regulated in the cell cycle with the highest expression in late G1 phase and no expression in G0/G1. DFO reduced cell proliferation and DNA synthesis of CHO-TRVb control cells, whereas it had little effect on TfR2-α-expressing CHO cells when measured by clonogenic and cell cycle analysis. In addition, CHO cells that express TfR2-α developed into tumors in nude mice whereas CHO control cells did not. In conclusion, TfR2 expression may be regulated by the cell cycle rather than cellular iron status and may support cell growth bothin vitro and in vivo.

Once in the cytosol, iron is utilized as a cofactor for aconitase, the cytochromes, RNA reductase, and heme (among other proteins), or it is stored as ferritin. After release of iron into the endosome, the resultant apo-Tf recombines with TfR1 in the acidic milieu, and the apo-Tf·TfR1 complex is recruited to the cell surface. On the cell surface, apo-Tf is released in the alkaline pH of the extracellular fluid (reviewed in Ref. 8.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar).

(Amst.). 1993; 18: 301-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TfR1 is up-regulated by iron starvation and down-regulated by iron overload. This regulation is essentially performed at the post-transcriptional level with the binding of iron regulatory proteins to iron-responsive elements on TfR1 mRNA (15.Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Expression of TfR1 is also regulated at the transcriptional level through the status of cellular proliferation and oxygen saturation (16.Miskimins W.K. McClelland A. Roberts M.P. Ruddle F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1781-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17.Tacchini L. Bianchi L. Bernelli Z.A. Cairo G. J. Biol.

TfR2codes for at least two alternatively spliced transcripts, α and β. The putative extracellular domain of the TfR2-α protein is highly homologous to TfR1. The TfR2-α protein can bind Tf and mediates iron uptake in CHO cells transfected with TfR2-α cDNA (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Increased expression of TfR2-α mRNA occurs in the liver (and the hepatoma cell line HepG2) and the erythroid compartment (and K562 erythroid leukemia cells). Thus, cells have at least two distinct receptors for Tf, TfR1 and TfR2-α. Numerous studies have clarified the function, regulation of expression, and clinical relevance of TfR1. In contrast, very little is known about TfR2. In a murine TfR1-knockout model, murine TfR2 could not fully compensate for TfR1 function, and the mice were not able to survive beyond embryonic day 12.5 because of severe anemia and neurologic abnormalities (20.Levy J.E. Jin O. Fujiwara Y. Kuo F. Andrews N. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In this study, TfR2 and TfR1 were compared with respect to Tf binding abilities and RNA expression levels. In addition, we have investigated the effects of the expression of TfR2-α protein on cellular growth under in vitro and in vivoconditions.DISCUSSIONIron is a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme that is essential for DNA synthesis (25.Furukawa T. Naitoh Y. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 2059-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If iron is deficient in the cell, both DNA synthesis and cell division are inhibited. DFO retards cell growth through chelation of both intra- and extracellular iron. CHO-TRVb cells, lacking functional Tf receptors, were sensitive to iron deprivation by DFO. However, when the cells were stably transfected with either TfR1 or TfR2-α, these cells became more resistant to DFO in analyses of both clonogenic growth and the cell cycle (Fig. 6). The clonal inhibition of growth by DFO was reversed by simultaneous addition of equimolar amounts of ferric nitrate, suggesting that growth inhibition by DFO was caused by iron deprivation (Fig. 6 A). These results can be rationalized if TfR2-α as well as TfR1 increases the cellular iron pool and supports cell growth even in the presence of DFO. The animal experiments shown in Fig. 7 indicate that both of these receptors support cell growth in CHO-TRVb cells in nude mice. In contrast, the control CHO-TRVb cells were unable to grow under similar conditions. Expression of the two Tf receptors may enhance cell growth by improving iron availability, which may increase levels of DNA synthesis (Fig. 6 B).In addition to the common effect that TfR1 and TfR2-α have on cell growth, other similarities are evident. Both are glycoproteins (Fig.1), both have quite similar primary structures, and both can mediate iron uptake through Tf (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Expression of both TfR1 and TfR2 was cell-cycle dependent in MG63 cells with high expression in late G1 phase, which may be related to the requirement for iron for DNA synthesis during the S phase. Thus, expression of TfR2 as well as TfR1 may be regulated by the cell cycle or cellular proliferation status. In addition, both TfR1 and TfR2-α interact with Tf in a pH-dependent manner; apo-Tf binds to these receptors only at acidic pH and holo-Tf binds at neutral or higher pH. On the other hand, we observed differences between these two receptors with respect to their Tf binding properties and their regulation of expression. A comparison of Tf binding to TfR1 and TfR2-α cells found that the affinity of holo-Tf for TfR2-α was substantially lower than for TfR1. Also, we found that the cellular status of iron had little effect on the regulation of expression of TfR2. DFO enhanced and ferric nitrate reduced expression of TfR1 mRNA in K562 cells (Figs. 3 Aand 4 B), consistent with previous reports (10.Ward J.H. Jordan I. Kushner J.P. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13235-13240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Rouault T. Rao K. Harford J. Mattia E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

In contrast, neither DFO nor ferric nitrate affected expression of TfR2 in K562 cells (Fig. 3). This difference between TfR1 and TfR2 may in part be attributed to the fact that TfR2-α mRNA lacks the iron-response element (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, if the main function of TfR2-α is to transport iron into the cells, iron overload would be expected to suppress expression of TfR2-α to maintain cellular iron homeostasis. This may suggest another function for TfR2 besides cellular iron uptake. In fact, some of the TfR family proteins such as prostate-specific membrane antigen have peptidase activities (28.Heston W.D. Urology. 1997; 49: 104-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The domain that catalyzes this activity (the protease-like domain) is well conserved throughout the TfR family of proteins, though TfR1 has lost this activity (29.Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).The CHO-TRVb cell system used in this report enabled us to probe the function of TfR2-α compared with TfR1. To evaluate the results from this system, expression of Tf receptors was characterized in the TRVb-TfR1 and TRVb-TfR2-α cells. When cultured in normal medium (5% fetal bovine serum in F12 medium), iron uptake by the TfR2-α cells through Tf was almost the same as that of TfR1 cells (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, maximal Tf binding by the TfR2-α cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of the TfR1 cells, which may reflect expression levels of Tf receptors on their cell surface (Fig. 2 B). However, expression of TfR1 on the TfR1 cells was clearly up-regulated by preincubation with DFO, whereas expression of TfR2-α on the TfR2-α cells was not affected by the same treatment (Fig. 4). These results, which are similar to those observed in K562 cells (Fig. 3 A), can be explained by different cDNA introduced into the cells; theTfR1 cDNA has iron-response elements whereas theTfR2-α gene and cDNA do not. Thus, the expression level of Tf receptors on the TfR1 cells depends on their cellular iron status. Another difference observed by us was that the TfR2-α tumors formed in nude mice were much larger than the TfR1 tumors in vivo (Fig. 7). The cloning efficiency of the TfR1 cells in the presence of DFO was much greater than that of the TfR2-α cells (Fig.6), and this may be related to the increase of TfR expression mediated by DFO treatment, which occurred in the TfR1 cells but not in the TfR2-α cells.In the majority of individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, defective HFE (C282Y) cannot bind to TfR1. This results in an increase in cellular iron uptake through Tf (3.Feder J.N. Penny D.M. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Lebron J.A. Watson N. Tsuchihashi Z. Sigal E. Bjorkman P.J. Schatzman R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). However, as the amount of intracellular iron increases, expression of TfR1 would be expected to decrease as described in previous reports (30.De Vos R. Sciot R. van Eyken P. Desmet V.J. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1988; 55: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Sciot R. Paterson A.C. Van den Oord J.J. Desmet V.J. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 3. This down-regulation of TfR1 might alleviate cellular iron accumulation. In contrast, expression of TfR2 did not change significantly in response to iron overload (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, in a state of iron overload such as hemochromatosis, the organs which express TfR2, e.g. liver and erythroid cells, may continue taking iron from serum Fe-Tf, whereas other tissues may diminish their iron uptake through down-regulation of TfR1. In evolution, TfR1 was derived from a peptidase related to prostate-specific membrane antigen (28.Heston W.D. Urology. 1997; 49: 104-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Prostate-specific membrane antigen has a higher homology to TfR2 than to TfR1, which suggests that TfR2 may be a more primitive form of Tf receptor compared with TfR1. Cells may be controlling iron influx by having two different receptors for Tf; one is the higher affinity receptor TfR1 whose expression is regulated by cellular iron status, and the other is the lower affinity receptor TfR2-α whose expression depends on the cell cycle rather than iron status. Iron is essential not only for hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells but for a wide variety of cellular functions including electron transport and DNA synthesis. A major pathway for cellular iron uptake is through internalization of the complex of iron-bound transferrin (Tf)1 and the transferrin receptor (TfR1) (reviewed in Ref. 1.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Tf-TfR1 interaction is modulated by HFE, which forms a complex with TfR1 and is defective in hereditary hemochromatosis (2.Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A.

Nature. 2000; 403: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). After internalization of the Tf·TfR1·HFE complex, iron is released from Tf as a result of the acidic pH in the endosome. The iron is then transported to the cytosol by DMT1/Nramp2 (5.Fleming M.D. Trenor III, C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 6.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L.

Once in the cytosol, iron is utilized as a cofactor for aconitase, the cytochromes, RNA reductase, and heme (among other proteins), or it is stored as ferritin. After release of iron into the endosome, the resultant apo-Tf recombines with TfR1 in the acidic milieu, and the apo-Tf·TfR1 complex is recruited to the cell surface. On the cell surface, apo-Tf is released in the alkaline pH of the extracellular fluid (reviewed in Ref. 8.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar).

Hepatology. 1987; 7: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 3. This down-regulation of TfR1 might alleviate cellular iron accumulation. In contrast, expression of TfR2 did not change significantly in response to iron overload (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, in a state of iron overload such as hemochromatosis, the organs which express TfR2, e.g. liver and erythroid cells, may continue taking iron from serum Fe-Tf, whereas other tissues may diminish their iron uptake through down-regulation of TfR1. In evolution, TfR1 was derived from a peptidase related to prostate-specific membrane antigen (28.Heston W.D. Urology. 1997; 49: 104-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Prostate-specific membrane antigen has a higher homology to TfR2 than to TfR1, which suggests that TfR2 may be a more primitive form of Tf receptor compared with TfR1. Cells may be controlling iron influx by having two different receptors for Tf; one is the higher affinity receptor TfR1 whose expression is regulated by cellular iron status, and the other is the lower affinity receptor TfR2-α whose expression depends on the cell cycle rather than iron status. Iron is a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme that is essential for DNA synthesis (25.Furukawa T. Naitoh Y. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 2059-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If iron is deficient in the cell, both DNA synthesis and cell division are inhibited. DFO retards cell growth through chelation of both intra- and extracellular iron. CHO-TRVb cells, lacking functional Tf receptors, were sensitive to iron deprivation by DFO. However, when the cells were stably transfected with either TfR1 or TfR2-α, these cells became more resistant to DFO in analyses of both clonogenic growth and the cell cycle (Fig. 6). The clonal inhibition of growth by DFO was reversed by simultaneous addition of equimolar amounts of ferric nitrate, suggesting that growth inhibition by DFO was caused by iron deprivation (Fig. 6 A). These results can be rationalized if TfR2-α as well as TfR1 increases the cellular iron pool and supports cell growth even in the presence of DFO. The animal experiments shown in Fig. 7 indicate that both of these receptors support cell growth in CHO-TRVb cells in nude mice. In contrast, the control CHO-TRVb cells were unable to grow under similar conditions. Expression of the two Tf receptors may enhance cell growth by improving iron availability, which may increase levels of DNA synthesis (Fig. 6 B). In addition to the common effect that TfR1 and TfR2-α have on cell growth, other similarities are evident. Both are glycoproteins (Fig.1), both have quite similar primary structures, and both can mediate iron uptake through Tf (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Expression of both TfR1 and TfR2 was cell-cycle dependent in MG63 cells with high expression in late G1 phase, which may be related to the requirement for iron for DNA synthesis during the S phase. Thus, expression of TfR2 as well as TfR1 may be regulated by the cell cycle or cellular proliferation status. In addition, both TfR1 and TfR2-α interact with Tf in a pH-dependent manner; apo-Tf binds to these receptors only at acidic pH and holo-Tf binds at neutral or higher pH. On the other hand, we observed differences between these two receptors with respect to their Tf binding properties and their regulation of expression. A comparison of Tf binding to TfR1 and TfR2-α cells found that the affinity of holo-Tf for TfR2-α was substantially lower than for TfR1. Also, we found that the cellular status of iron had little effect on the regulation of expression of TfR2. DFO enhanced and ferric nitrate reduced expression of TfR1 mRNA in K562 cells (Figs. 3 Aand 4 B), consistent with previous reports (10.Ward J.H. Jordan I. Kushner J.P. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13235-13240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Rouault T. Rao K. Harford J. Mattia E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

In contrast, neither DFO nor ferric nitrate affected expression of TfR2 in K562 cells (Fig. 3). This difference between TfR1 and TfR2 may in part be attributed to the fact that TfR2-α mRNA lacks the iron-response element (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, if the main function of TfR2-α is to transport iron into the cells, iron overload would be expected to suppress expression of TfR2-α to maintain cellular iron homeostasis. This may suggest another function for TfR2 besides cellular iron uptake. In fact, some of the TfR family proteins such as prostate-specific membrane antigen have peptidase activities (28.Heston W.D. Urology. 1997; 49: 104-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The domain that catalyzes this activity (the protease-like domain) is well conserved throughout the TfR family of proteins, though TfR1 has lost this activity (29.Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The CHO-TRVb cell system used in this report enabled us to probe the function of TfR2-α compared with TfR1. To evaluate the results from this system, expression of Tf receptors was characterized in the TRVb-TfR1 and TRVb-TfR2-α cells. When cultured in normal medium (5% fetal bovine serum in F12 medium), iron uptake by the TfR2-α cells through Tf was almost the same as that of TfR1 cells (19.Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, maximal Tf binding by the TfR2-α cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of the TfR1 cells, which may reflect expression levels of Tf receptors on their cell surface (Fig. 2 B). However, expression of TfR1 on the TfR1 cells was clearly up-regulated by preincubation with DFO, whereas expression of TfR2-α on the TfR2-α cells was not affected by the same treatment (Fig. 4). These results, which are similar to those observed in K562 cells (Fig. 3 A), can be explained by different cDNA introduced into the cells; theTfR1 cDNA has iron-response elements whereas theTfR2-α gene and cDNA do not. Thus, the expression level of Tf receptors on the TfR1 cells depends on their cellular iron status. Another difference observed by us was that the TfR2-α tumors formed in nude mice were much larger than the TfR1 tumors in vivo (Fig. 7). The cloning efficiency of the TfR1 cells in the presence of DFO was much greater than that of the TfR2-α cells (Fig.6), and this may be related to the increase of TfR expression mediated by DFO treatment, which occurred in the TfR1 cells but not in the TfR2-α cells. In the majority of individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, defective HFE (C282Y) cannot bind to TfR1. This results in an increase in cellular iron uptake through Tf (3.Feder J.N. Penny D.M. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Lebron J.A. Watson N. Tsuchihashi Z. Sigal E. Bjorkman P.J. Schatzman R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2106850730,"Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy, caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, is an autosomal recessive autoimmune disease characterized by the breakdown of tolerance to organ-specific antigens. The 545 amino acid protein encoded by AIRE contains several structural motifs suggestive of a transcriptional regulator and bears similarity to cellular proteins involved in transcriptional control. We show here that AIRE fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain activates transcription from a reporter promoter, and the activation seen requires the full-length protein or more than one activation domain. At the structural level AIRE forms homodimers through the NH(2)-terminal domain, and molecular modeling for this domain suggests a four-helix bundle structure. In agreement, we show that the common transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) interacts with AIRE in vitro and in yeast nuclei through the CH1 and CH3 conserved domains. We suggest that the transcriptional transactivation properties of AIRE together with its interaction with CBP might be important in its function as disease-causing mutations almost totally abolish the activation effect."
https://openalex.org/W2032328453,"Recently we identified a new family of histone deacetylases in higher eukaryotes related to yeast HDA1 and showed their differentiation-dependent expression. Data presented here indicate that HDAC5 (previously named mHDA1), one member of this family, might be a potent regulator of cell differentiation by interacting specifically with determinant transcription factors. We found that HDAC5 was able to interact in vivo and in vitro with MEF2A, a MADS box transcription factor, and to strongly inhibit its transcriptional activity. Surprisingly, this repression was independent of HDAC5 deacetylase domain. The N-terminal non-deacetylase domain of HDAC5 was able to ensure an efficient repression of MEF2A-dependent transcription. We then mapped protein domains involved in the HDAC5-MEF2A interaction and showed that MADS box/MEF2-domain region of MEF2A interacts specifically with a limited region in the N-terminal part of HDAC5 which also possesses a distinct repressor domain. These data show that two independent class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5 are able to interact with members of the MEF2 transcription factor family and regulate their transcriptional activity, thus suggesting a critical role for these deacetylases in the control of cell proliferation/differentiation.

Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 165-167Google Scholar). Thus far, the specific involvement of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases in the control of individual gene expression has been clearly established (2.Kuo M.H. Allis D. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 3.Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). One major role of these enzymes is the control of cell differentiation in response to specific signals. Evidence exists for the participation of the RPD3-related members in this process (4.Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a new family of higher eukaryotic histone deacetylases, distinct from the already characterized RPD3-related members, has been identified (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These enzymes are related to yeast HDA1 histone deacetylase and within the cloned members, two show sequence homology and the same domain organization and are called HDAC4 and HDAC5 (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Despite this homology, HDAC4 and HDAC5 are probably capable of exerting distinct functions, since immunoprecipitation experiments showed that in cells they can be associated with different partners (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). A member, named mHDA2/HDAC6, shows unique features within deacetylases, in that it possesses two HDA1 homology domains (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In contrast to the RPD3-related members, the expression of these genes is not ubiquitous. HDAC5 and mHDA2/HDAC6 expression is activated upon cell differentiation (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that members of the class II histone deacetylases may play a specific role in the regulation of cell differentiation. Looking for potential partners of HDAC5, we obtained evidence of interaction between HDAC5 and MEF2 transcription factors. We therefore focused our efforts on investigating this issue. The MEF2 family of transcription factors belongs to the large family of MADS box transcriptional regulators present from yeast to humans (8.Theissen G. Kim J.T. Saedler H. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 484-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Besides their established role in myogenesis (9.Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), MEF2 family members have been implicated in gene activation in response to mitogenic signaling (10, 11; for review, see Ref. 9.Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been shown that one member of the class II histone deacetylase, HDAC4, can interact with two different members of MEF2 family, MEF2A (12.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and MEF2C (13.Wang H.A. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Here we show that HDAC5, a distinct member of class II deacetylase, is also able to interact specifically with the MEF2A transcription factor and to repress its transcriptional activator capacity. Data presented here and the fact that the induction of various differentiation programs was found to be associated with an up-regulation of HDAC5 gene expression (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), suggested that HDAC5 might be a general regulator of cell differentiation. We discuss here the possibility that HDAC5 might control the early stages of various differentiation programs by inhibiting the precocious activity of determinant transcription factors. MEF2-Luc, L8G5-Luc, and L8-Luc reporter plasmids were generated from MEF2-CAT1 (14.Yu Y-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) expression vectors have been described before. Deletions in HDAC5 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) in-frame with a N-terminal HA-tag. GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion protein constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction. DNA fragments coding for HDAC5 amino acids 123–673 and 673–1113 were cloned in pcDNA-GAL4 DB, in-frame with the DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) of GAL4. Mouse HDAC4 and human MITR cDNAs have been obtained by polymerase chain reaction from mouse embryo and human skeletal muscle cDNA libraries, respectively (Marathon ready cDNA,CLONTECH). HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well dishes (105 cells/well) and transfected 2 days later with Exgen 500 (Euromedex) according to the supplier's protocol. In each transfection, DNA amount was kept constant with pcDNA3 empty vector. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h post-transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the “Luciferase Assay System” (Promega) and the Luminescent β-Gal Detection kit (CLONTECH), respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were performed as described (16.Hagemeier C. Casewell R. Hayhurst G. Sinclair J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were produced in BL21 Escherichia coli transformed with pGEX-5X-3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), encoding GST alone, or GST fused to various domains of MEF2A protein.35S-Labeled proteins were produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate from pcDNA plasmids using the TNT transcription/translation kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells were transfected with Exgen500 as described above using 5 μg of pMT2-Mef2A or pMT2 vector and 5 μg of pcDNA-HDAC5 (HA tagged) or pcDNA empty plasmid per 100-mm plate. 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) extracts were diluted with 1 volume of lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and incubated with 4 μg of polyclonal anti-MEF2 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. 30-μl aliquots of protein G-Sepharose were added and the incubation was continued for 2 h. Precipitates were washed in lysis buffer containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and finally re-suspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures and immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunofluorescence was performed as described (17.Gorka C. Brocard M.P. Curtet S. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1208-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies have been used: anti-MEF2 (C-21, Santa Cruz), anti-HA (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and anti-HDAC5 (rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide localized at the C-terminal region of the protein). In our previous work we reported the domain organization of HDAC5 histone deacetylase (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The histone deacetylase domain of this protein was found to be located at the C-terminal half of the protein and the N-terminal non-deacetylase domain did not show any significant homology with sequences present in the data base. In order to have insight into the function of HDAC5, we periodically searched the data bank for new sequences homologous to the N-terminal domain of HDAC5. This approach allowed us to identify a Xenopus cDNA presenting significant sequence homology with the non-deacetylase N-terminal domain of HDAC5 (accession number, Z97214, the putative protein encoded by this cDNA is now known as MITR, Ref. 18.Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The GenBank sequence information presented MITR as a potential partner ofXenopus MEF2 homologues. The sequence homology between HDAC5 and MITR suggested that HDAC5 could also be a partner of MEF2 transcription factors. In order to investigate this possibility, we first expressed HDAC5 and MEF2A in HeLa cells and examined the formation of complexes bearing both proteins in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. Extracts obtained from cells transfected with HA-tagged HDAC5, MEF2A, and both expression vectors were immunoprecipitated with anti-MEF2 antibodies. The presence of MEF2A and HA-HDAC5 in immunoprecipitated material was then monitored using anti-HA and anti-MEF2 antibodies. Fig. 1shows that anti-MEF2 antibodies are able to co-immunoprecipitate efficiently HDAC5 when both proteins are expressed in cells (Fig. 1,anti-HA panel, far right). The endogenous MEF2 in HeLa cells can also interact with HDAC5 since ectopically expressed HDAC5 was also found associated with endogenous MEF2, in the absence of exogenous MEF2A expression (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that HeLa cells transfected with HDAC5-expression vector produced two HA-tagged HDAC5 proteins (Fig. 1, input panel) and within these two proteins only the full-length one could interact with MEF2A. In order to investigate the possibility of direct interaction between HDAC5 and MEF2A, we prepared bacterially expressed fusion proteins containing GST fused to different regions of MEF2A and examined the interaction of these proteins with 35S-labeled full-length HDAC5. Fig.2 A shows that a GST fusion protein harboring the N-terminal half of MEF2A is able to interact efficiently with HDAC5 (Fig. 2 A, GST-MEF2A 1–243), while the C-terminal half and the middle part of the protein did not recognize HDAC5 (Fig. 2 A, GST-MEF2A 244–507 and GST MEF2A 87–243). This observation suggested that the region encompassing MADS box and the so-called MEF2 domain, has the ability to interact with HDAC5. To know whether MADS box or MEF2 domain or both are involved in the interaction with HDAC5, we fused both or each of these domains to GST and analyzed the interaction with HDAC5 as above. These experiments showed that MADS box/MEF domain is sufficient to direct an efficient interaction with HDAC5 (Fig. 2 A, GST MEF2A 1–86). However, the MADS box alone was found to be able to interact weakly with HDAC5 (Fig. 2 A, GST MEF2A 1–57) while the MEF2 domain was not able to do so (Fig. 2 A, GST MEF2A 58–86). The specificity of this interaction was shown by considering the capacity of MEF2A N-terminal region to interact with two other deacetylases, HDAC1 and mHDA2/HDAC6. In this experiment we also used HDAC4 and MITR as known partners of MEF2. Data show in Fig. 2 B confirmed the interaction of these proteins with MEF2A as it has been reported very recently (12.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 13.Wang H.A. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, no interaction between MEF2A and HDAC1 or mHDA2/HDAC6 was observed in these conditions (Fig. 2 B), showing the specific interaction between HDAC5 and MEF2A in our assays. To determine regions in HDAC5 involved in the interaction with MEF2A, expression vectors encoding HDAC5 deletion mutants were prepared and used to obtain corresponding 35S-labeled proteins. These proteins were incubated with a GST-MEF2A MADS box/MEF2 domain fusion protein and a pull-down was performed. A truncated HDAC5 molecule lacking the first 123 amino acids was capable of interacting with MEF2A, while the removal of additional 57 amino acids completely abolished the binding (Fig. 2 C, compare HDAC5 123–1113 and 180–1113 proteins). This observation showed that the region of 57 amino acids, located between amino acids 123 and 180 plays a major role in interaction with MEF2A. In order to confirm these findings, we expressed35S-labeled polypeptides corresponding to the 123–292 and 123–673 regions of HDAC5 and found that both interact efficiently with MEF2A (Fig. 2 C, HDAC5 123–292 and HDAC5 123–673, respectively). In these assays the deacetylase domain of HDAC5 could not interact with MEF2A (Fig. 2 C, HDAC5 674–1113). These experiments showed that a limited region of HDAC5 encompassing amino acids 123–180 plays an essential role in the direct interaction with MEF2A. A transient transfection assay was designed to evaluate the role of HDAC5-MEF2A interaction on the transcriptional activity of MEF2A. The reporter system used consisted of the minimal promoter region of myosin heavy chain gene flanked by two MEF2-binding sites (14.Yu Y-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), cloned upstream of a luciferase gene. In HeLa cells, the expression of MEF2A led to a 20-fold activation of reporter gene expression (Fig. 3 A). Co-expression of MEF2A and HDAC5 showed a very efficient inhibition of the activator capacity of MEF2A. Indeed, the use of as little as 1 or 5 ng of HDAC5 expression vector in these co-transfection assays, repressed significantly MEF2A activity (Fig. 3 A). We then showed that the repression of MEF2A activity by HDAC5 was as efficient as that observed by HDAC4 (12.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, the capacity to repress MEF2A was not shared by all members of class II histone deacetylases, since the expression of the third member of this family (mHDA2/HDAC6) did not alter MEF2A activity (Fig. 3 B). We then tried to show whether HDAC5-MEF2A interaction is necessary to repress MEF2A activity. HeLa cells were co-transfected with the MEF2 responsive reporter, a MEF2A expression vector and vectors expressing different deletion mutants of HDAC5. As shown before, the expression of full-length HDAC5 repressed efficiently MEF2A activity (Fig. 3 D, 1–1113 construct). Interestingly, this repression was found to be independent of the deacetylase domain. Indeed a truncated HDAC5 bearing only the non-deacetylase domain of the protein was almost as efficient in repressing the MEF2A transcriptional activity as the full-length HDAC5 (Fig. 3 D, compare 1–1113 and 123–673 constructs). This repression was found to be dependent on MEF2A-HDAC5 interaction, since a deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal region, defined to be the site of interaction with MEF2A, was absolutely inefficient in repression (Fig. 3 D, 180–1113 construct). However, HDAC5/MEF2A interaction alone was not sufficient to repress transcription since two constructs expressing truncated versions of the N-terminal non-deacetylase domain of HDAC5, able to interact with MEF2Ain vitro, were unable to repress transcription (Fig.3 D, 123–292 and Δ241–292 constructs, respectively). This experiment showed that the N-terminal region of HDAC5 possesses in addition to the MEF2-binding domain, a distinct repression domain. This region is localized C-terminal to the MEF2-binding domain and covers a region that encompasses amino acids 241–292 of HDAC5. Indeed, the deletion of this region abolished HDAC5 repressive activity. However, amino acids located C-terminal to this region are also important for this repressive activity, since the 123–292 version of HDAC5 were unable to repress transcription. The expression of the deacetylase domain alone did not show any repressive activity (Fig. 3 D, 674–1113 construct). Western blots presented in Fig. 3, Cand E, show that the vectors used in these experiments express efficiently all the expected proteins. However, it appeared that most of the constructs used, besides the expected protein (Fig.3 E, arrows), produced at least another protein. We could show that these products are not a result of degradation but are generated after the splicing of a fraction of the messenger transcribed from the plasmid. Indeed the use of different antibodies and the cloning of a mRNA generated after transfection, showed that the full-length mRNA transcribed from the plasmid can undergo splicing and generate variants (not shown and see Fig. 5 B). Since the deacetylase domain of HDAC5 was found to be unnecessary to repress MEF2A transcriptional activity, one could question the ability of this domain to repress transcription. In order to investigate this issue, we targeted the HDAC5 deacetylase domain into a promoter containing GAL4-binding sites. The reporter system used contained eight copies of the binding sites for LexA immediately adjacent to five copies of the binding site for GAL4 (15.Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), all cloned upstream of a luciferase gene. In the presence of LexA-VP16 fusion co-activator and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone (GAL4-DB), this reporter was activated to high levels of expression (Fig.4, GAL4-DB). An expression vector was prepared expressing a fusion protein containing the deacetylase domain of HDAC5 (amino acids 674–1113) fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Co-expression of LexA-VP16 and GAL4-HDAC5 showed that the HDAC5 deacetylase domain could inhibit by 10-fold the transcriptional activity of LexA-VP16 (Fig. 4, HDAC5 674–1113 construct). We showed also that the non-deacetylase domain of HDAC5 possesses an independent repression domain capable of repressing MEF2A transcriptional activity (Fig. 3 D). To confirm this finding we also fused HDAC5 N-terminal non-deacetylase domain (amino acids 123–673) to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The expression of this fusion protein together with LexA-VP16 led also to an efficient repression of LexA-VP16 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4,HDAC5 123–673 construct). In order to show the specificity of this repressive activity, we prepared an expression vector encoding GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the MEF2-binding domain of HDAC5 (amino acid 123–292). This region of HDAC5 possesses the ability to interact with MEF2A (Fig. 2 C) but does not repress its transcriptional activity (Fig. 3 D). Therefore, it should not be able to repress the VP16-dependent transcriptional activation. As expected, the expression of this protein did not affect the ability of LexA-VP16 to direct an efficient transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 4, HDAC5 123–292). These data showed that the HDAC5 deacetylase domain, although unnecessary to repress MEF2A transcriptional activity, is an active repressor domain. They also confirmed that besides the deacetylase domain, HDAC5 possesses another repression domain located in its N-terminal region. The present report and those published recently indicate that HDAC4 and HDAC5 are able to interact with members of MEF2 transcription factors. These two members of class II deacetylases, although sharing similar domain organization and sequence homology, may be able to ensure different functions in cells, as they have been found to be associated with distinct partners (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In order to obtain more evidence of functional differences between these two deacetylases, we transfected HeLa cells with HA-tagged HDAC4 and HDAC5 expression vectors and examined the cellular distribution of these proteins using an anti-HA antibody. In cells transfected with HDAC4 expression vector a significant proportion of cells showed foci of HDAC4 accumulation in the nucleus (Fig.5 A, top left), as it has been previously shown (7.Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) while none of the cells transfected with HA-HDAC5 expression vectors showed this particular pattern of expression (Fig. 5 A, top right). In the majority of these cells, a homogenous distribution of HA-HADC5 was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 5 A, HDAC5 panel). Moreover, Western blot analysis of cells transfected with HA-HDAC5 expression vectors showed the expression of two major forms of the protein, one presenting the expected size and the other was found to have a molecular mass around 83 kDa (Fig. 5 B, HDAC5 panel, α-HA, arrows). The use of an antibody raised against the very C-terminal region of HDAC5 revealed the same bands (Fig. 5 B, HDAC5 panel, α-HDAC5, arrows). This experiment showed that the smaller band is not the result of proteolysis but rather is an altered form of the protein, possessing both the N-terminal HA-tag and the C-terminal epitope. This observation suggests that a fraction of the messenger produced from the vector undergo splicing giving rise to HDAC5 variants. Indeed, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA produced after transfection and confirmed the above hypothesis (not shown). Interestingly, the smaller HDAC5-related protein is not able to interact with MEF2A in vivo (Fig. 1, compare, input and IP α-MEF2). It appeared therefore that transfected cells are capable of generating at least one form of HDAC5 that is unable to interact with MEF2A transcription factor. We are currently analyzing the presence of such HDAC5 variants produced from the endogenous HDAC5 gene. Western blot analysis of cell transfected with HA-HDAC4 showed the presence of a single band at the expected size. These data show that HDAC4 and HDAC5, although both interacting with MEF2A and modulating its activity, are different proteins and are probably involved in distinct regulatory pathways. Within class II histone deacetylases, HDAC4 and HDAC5 encoded by two independent genes, show similar domain organization and sequence homology (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, the analysis of associated proteins showed that in cells these deacetylases might enter functionally distinct complexes. Indeed, HDAC4, but not HDAC5 was found associated with RbAp48 (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Data presented here further support this idea and show that when expressed in cells, HDAC4 and HDAC5 present very different patterns of nuclear localization. Moreover, an altered form of HDAC5, unable to interact with MEF2A could be generated in cells after transfection. Differentially spliced forms of HDAC5 have been already observed in different tissues and cell lines (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 2C. Lemercier, A. Verdel, B. Galloo, S. Curtet, M.-P. Brocard, and S. Khochbin, unpublished observations. All these observations suggest that HDAC4 and HDAC5 exert distinct functions in cells and are probably involved in different regulatory pathways. Our data showed, however, that HDAC5, like HDAC4, is capable of interacting specifically with the MEF2A transcription factor. This interaction completely abolished the transcriptional activity of MEF2A. We were surprised to find that this repression was independent of the deacetylase activity of HDAC5. Indeed, the N-terminal region of HDAC5 was found to interact with MEF2A and repress its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we found that MEF2A interaction and transcriptional repression are ensured by distinct regions of HDAC5 N-terminal non-deacetylase domain. The repression domain in this region of HDAC5 might recruit cellular histone deacetylases to ensure its repressive activity. Indeed, it has been shown that MITR, which shows significant sequence homology with the non-deacetylase domain of HDAC5 can interact with HDAC1 (18.Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and moreover, both HDAC4 and HDAC5 were found to be associated with HDAC3 (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). One may question the role of the histone deacetylase domain of HDAC5 in the activity of this protein. We showed here that this domain is fully functional in repressing transcription when it is targeted to a promoter via the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. We believe therefore that HDAC5 is a multifunctional repressor; it is capable of a repressive activity, independent of or dependent on its own deacetylase domain. However, one should keep in mind that the deacetylase activity of HDAC5 may be required to repress transcriptional activity of endogenous MEF2A-responsive genes. MEF2A, and other transcription factors, may target HDAC5 into chromatin where the deacetylase domain could participate in a chromatin remodeling activity. Moreover, HDAC5 like RPD3-related members, may enter distinct multifunctional complexes via “adaptors.” Indeed, evidence does exist that HDAC4 can form a complex when expressed in HeLa cells (7.Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The way HDAC5 and HDAC4 are used in the regulation of gene expression appears therefore to be similar to that of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Indeed, these RPD3-related deacetylases are capable of interacting directly with transcription factors, i.e. YY1, Sp1, etc. (19.Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 20.Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and/or they may enter various complexes via interaction with molecules such as Sin3. Sin3 seems to play a pivotal role in targeting RPD3-related HDACs into various and distinct complexes (4.Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, Sin3 was not found associated with HDAC4 and HDAC5 (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) indicating that other molecules may accomplish a Sin3-like function in targeting HDAC5 and HDAC4 into different complexes. Interestingly, HDAC4, HDAC5, and a new member of the class II histone-deacetylase, HDAC7, were found to interact directly with corepressors N-CoR and SMRT (21.Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the fact that these new deacetylases can target various complexes in a Sin3-independent fashion. The fact that RbAp48 was found to form a complex specifically with HDAC4 (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) provides some hints concerning the nature of complexes containing this deacetylase. Indeed, RbAp48, besides its involvement in NRD and Sin3 complexes (23.Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 24.Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), where HDAC4 was not found (6.Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), is associated with chromatin assembly machinery (25.Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,26.Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). A role for HDAC4 in histone metabolism is therefore possible. The inhibition of MEF2A and MEF2C by HDAC4 (12.Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 13.Wang H.A. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), as well as that of MEF2A by HDAC5 reported here, indicate the possible involvement of these proteins in various regulatory pathways. Since MEF2 transcription factors regulate the activity of numerous muscle-specific genes and play an important role in myogenesis, HDAC4/HDAC5 could be considered as potential regulators of myogenesis. However, a different role for these two proteins in myogenic differentiation could be envisaged since we have observed spliced forms of HDAC5 messenger (but not HDAC4) in myoblasts. 3C. Lemercier, A. Verdel, B. Galloo, S. Curtet, M.-P. Brocard, and S. Khochbin, unpublished data. Moreover, since MEF2 members are also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, one might also propose a connection between HDAC4/HDAC5 activity and MEF2 function in this process. Previously, we showed that the expression of HDAC5 was up-regulated during a variety of differentiation programs (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A careful examination of the timing of HDAC5 expression during the induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells, showed a transient activation of HDAC5 gene expression (5.Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This accumulation occurs between 6 and 12 h of induction and is followed by decay in mRNA content. This period precedes the commitment and the induction of globin gene expression (17.Gorka C. Brocard M.P. Curtet S. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1208-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The same transient induction of HDAC5 gene expression was observed during the in vitro differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes.3 It is therefore tempting to think that HDAC5 plays a role in the pre-commitment period of various differentiation programs and functions as an early and transient inhibitor of specific transcription factors.

Nucleic Med. 1997; 24: 691-705PubMed Google Scholar), they cannot measure glucose uptake in single, living cells. We have recently developed a fluorescent d-glucose derivative, 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG)1 (8.Yoshioka K. Takahashi H. Homma T. Saito M. Ki-Bong O. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), that allows a more sensitive measurement of glucose uptake in real time in single, living cells. Another advantage of measuring glucose uptake by the 2-NBDG molecule is that it allows concomitant measurement of other cellular activities, such as the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), pH, or membrane potential by different methods. However, it has not been established that 2-NBDG is incorporated into mammalian cells, in which glucose is transported by facilitated diffusion through a family of glucose transporters GLUTs (9.Bell G.I. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Lin D. Fukumoto H. Seino S. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Among the several GLUTs identified to date, GLUT2 has highK m for glucose and is abundant in cells that sense glucose, such as pancreatic β-cells (9.Bell G.I. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Lin D. Fukumoto H. Seino S. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It is thought that when the blood glucose level is elevated, glucose uptake into the pancreatic β-cells through GLUT2 is increased and that this incorporated glucose is then metabolized within the cell. Among the various metabolic products, ATP is an essential molecule for insulin secretion (10.Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar); an increase in the intracellular ATP concentration in the β-cell closes the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, leading to plasma membrane depolarization and influx of Ca2+ through the voltage-gated calcium channels. The subsequent rise in [Ca2+]itriggers insulin secretion. However, the correlation between glucose uptake and changes in [Ca2+]i in response to glucose stimulation has not been shown directly in single insulin-secreting β-cells. To determine whether living, mammalian cells incorporate 2-NBDG through GLUT, we examined 2-NBDG uptake activity of cells in which GLUT2 is overexpressed or abundant, using fluorescence microscopy. We monitored glucose uptake activity and the [Ca2+]i level in single, living pancreatic islet cells using 2-NBDG as a tracer of glucose and fura-2 as an intracellular calcium indicator. Our results suggest that 2-NBDG should be useful in analysis of the mechanisms underlying glucose uptake and concomitant cellular functions in mammalian cells. Culture and transfection of COS-1 cells was carried out as described previously (11.Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J.

Briefly, COS-1 cells were plated on 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/dish 24 h prior to transfection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (450 mg/dl glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Two micrograms of human GLUT2 expression vector (pCMVGLUT2) was transfected into COS-1 cells with LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As control, COS-1 cells transfected with vector (pCMV) alone were used. MIN6 cells were cultured in the same medium as COS-1 cells. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from 8–12-week-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (12.Yada T. Itoh K. Nakata M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1685-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated islets were dissociated into single cells by incubation in Ca2+-free Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing 1 mm EGTA but no added Ca2+. KRB was composed of 129 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mmNaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, the single cells were resuspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 60 μg/ml kanamycin, plated on coverslips, and cultured up to 3 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were mounted in a chamber and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope and superfused with KRB containing various concentrations of 2-NBDG at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min (12.Yada T. Itoh K. Nakata M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1685-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Delivery and removal of superfusate was by peristaltic or vacuum pump. Fluorescence of 2-NBDG was collected by a silicon intensified target camera at 520–560-nm wavelength (excitation wavelength 465–495 nm). Images of 15–100 cells/each preparation were digitized in 8 bit, and integrated 16 or 64 times at video rate by an Argus-50 system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). After background subtraction, fluorescence intensity was calculated as the difference in the average fluorescence of cells before and after application of 2-NBDG. Adequate neutral density filters were selected so that 2-NBDG fluorescence intensity was in the linear range of fluorescence versus concentration of 2-NBDG. In time and temperature dependence experiments, MIN6 cells (13.Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki T. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) were superfused in d-glucose-free KRB for 15 min, and then the superfusate was changed to d-glucose-free KRB containing 600 μm 2-NBDG. After superfusion for the periods indicated at 25 or 37 °C, the cells were washed for 5 min, and the fluorescence images were collected. Concentration dependence experiments were carried out under the same condition except that the cells were superfused for 1 min at 37 °C ind-glucose-free KRB containing the concentrations of 2-NBDG indicated. Similarly, the effect of d-glucose on 2-NBDG uptake was estimated by incubating the cells for 1 min at 37 °C in KRB containing 600 μm 2-NBDG in the presence of the concentrations of d-glucose indicated. The effects of cytochalasin B and phloretin on 2-NBDG uptake were examined by superfusing the cells for 15 s with 200 μm 2-NBDG in the presence of 5.6 mmd-glucose at 25 °C; the experiments on overexpression of GLUTs in COS-1 cells were also performed under the same condition. The islet cells were incubated with 1 μmfura-2/acetoxymethylester (14.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB containing 2.8 mm glucose. The cells were then mounted in the chamber and superfused with KRB containing a basal (2.8 mm) or elevated (16.8 mm) concentration of glucose at 37 °C as described above. Fura-2 fluorescence was detected by a silicon intensified target camera every 5 or 10 s at 500–520-nm wavelength following excitation at 340-nm (F340) and 380-nm (F380) wavelengths, and the ratio image (F340/F380) was calculated by an Argus-50. After measurement of [Ca2+]i, 2-NBDG uptake into the same cells was estimated by superfusion at 37 °C for 1 min in KRB containing 200 μm 2-NBDG and 2.8 mmd-glucose. In some experiments, the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i response and 2-NBDG uptake were measured in the presence of 50 μm of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Because DNP has an effect of elevating basal [Ca2+]i (15.Fujitani S. Okazaki K. Yada T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), high glucose was applied when this elevation was stabilized. After measuring the fluorescence of 2-NBDG and [Ca2+]i, COS-1 cells or islet cells were fixed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde and pretreated with 1% bovine serum albumin before incubation with anti-GLUT2, anti-insulin, or anti-glucagon antibody. For staining of GLUT2, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse GLUT2 antibody (1: 400) (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) (Cappel, West Chester, PA) for 20 min at room temperature. For staining β-cells, the cells were incubated with guinea pig anti-swine insulin antibody (1:100) (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (1:500) (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. To stain α-cells, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-porcine glucagon antibody (prediluted, Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) (Cappel, West Chester, PA) at room temperature for 1 h. Rhodamine fluorescence was examined by a silicon intensified target camera with a 590-nm longpass filter (excitation wavelength 510–560 nm). To determine whether 2-NBDG is transported through mammalian glucose transporters, we measured the uptake of 2-NBDG into cells overexpressing human GLUT2. The mammalian expression vector carrying GLUT2 cDNA (pCMVGLUT2) or vector alone (pCMV) was transfected into COS-1 cells, and 48 h later the cells were loaded for 15 s with the medium containing 200 μm 2-NBDG, followed by washout. 5 min later, the fluorescence intensity of the cells was measured at 540-nm wavelength by fluorescence microscopy. COS-1 cells often showed granular autofluorescence in the cytosol before incubation in the presence of 2-NBDG (Fig. 1,B and G). After application of 2-NBDG, the fluorescence intensity of COS-1 cells transfected with GLUT2 expression vector was remarkably increased, and the cells can be more clearly discerned (Fig. 1, A–C). The net increase in fluorescence intensity of the cells is shown in Fig. 1 D as a subtraction image; the fluorescence intensity before application of 2-NBDG was subtracted from that after its application. On the contrary, COS-1 cells transfected with the vector alone showed no remarkable difference in fluorescence before or after application of 2-NBDG (Fig. 1, F–I). These results were confirmed in eight separate experiments. To confirm that the COS-1 cells showing strong 2-NBDG fluorescence actually expressed abundant GLUT2, the cells were immunocytochemically stained with anti-GLUT2 antibody after measurement of 2-NBDG uptake. As shown in Fig. 1 E, the COS-1 cells that emitted 2-NBDG fluorescence stained with anti-GLUT2 antibody, but the control cells did not (Fig. 1 J). Uptake of 2-NBDG into COS-1 cells transfected with GLUT1 or GLUT3 also was increased compared with those of mock transfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). To confirm that 2-NBDG is transported thorough glucose transporters, the time course and concentration dependence of 2-NBDG uptake were measured in MIN6 cells, mouse insulin-secreting clonal β-cells. MIN6 cells are known to exhibit glucose-inducible insulin secretion comparable with normal mouse islet cells and also to express GLUT2 at a high level but GLUT1 at a barely detectable level, as do mouse pancreatic β-cells (13.Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki T. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The MIN6 cells were superfused with 600 μm 2-NBDG in the absence of glucose for 15 s to 20 min at 37 °C followed by washing for 5 min, and the uptake of 2-NBDG was evaluated by fluorometry. As shown in Fig.2 A, the time course was almost linear up to 2 min, and 2-NBDG fluorescence intensity at 2 min approached 43% (mean of two independent experiments) of that at 20 min at 37 °C. The initial velocity of 2-NBDG uptake into the MIN6 cells, therefore, was determined by the difference in the fluorescence intensity before and after 1-min superfusion with 2-NBDG at 37 °C in the absence of glucose. It increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B), and Eadie-Hofstee transformation of these data resulted in a nonlinear curve with two kinetic components, apparent K mvalues of 13.3 and 1.6 mm (Fig. 2 C). 2-NBDG uptake was temperature-sensitive, and the initial velocity of the 2-NBDG uptake at 25 °C was approximately half that at 37 °C (Fig.2 A). To further confirm that 2-NBDG is incorporated thorough glucose transporters, the effects of d-glucose and cytochalasin B, an antagonist of glucose transporters (4.Axelrod J.D. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2222-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16.Kletzien R.F. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. Milburn J.L. Lodish H.F. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6548-6551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on the uptake of 2-NBDG into MIN6 cells were examined. The cells were incubated with 600 μm 2-NBDG for 1 min in the absence or presence of various concentrations of d-glucose. 2-NBDG uptake was inhibited byd-glucose in a dose-dependent manner; it was inhibited by 37.9 ± 10.1, 52.5 ± 6.3, and 70.1 ± 7.8% (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments) in the presence of 5.6, 11.2, and 22.4 mmd-glucose, respectively. Cytochalasin B was added to the medium 5 min prior to superfusion of the cells in the medium containing 2-NBDG. As seen in Fig. 3, the fluorescence intensity of the MIN6 cells that was increased after incubation with 200 μm 2-NBDG was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B. These results were confirmed in six separate experiments. The increase in fluorescence intensity also was inhibited by 100 μm phloretin (data not shown). These results demonstrate that 2-NBDG is transported into cells through mammalian glucose transporters. Glucose uptake activity and the glucose responsiveness of single pancreatic islet cells were measured. 2-NBDG was used as a tracer of glucose uptake, and changes in the [Ca2+]i level in response to high glucose stimulation were monitored using fura-2 as an indicator. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.4. Seven of the nine islet cells showed marked increases in [Ca2+]i when the extracellular glucose concentration was transiently elevated from 2.8 to 16.8 mm (Fig. 4, A and B, cells 1–7). The [Ca2+]i of these seven cells returned to basal level upon reversal of the glucose concentration to 2.8 mm (Fig. 4 B). We then examined uptake of 2-NBDG into the same cells. The seven glucose-responsive cells emitted strong 2-NBDG fluorescence when 200 μm 2-NBDG was applied (Fig.4, A–E, cells 1–7). On the contrary, the two other islet cells that showed no increase in [Ca2+]i in response to a high concentration of glucose emitted no significant 2-NBDG fluorescence (Fig. 4, A–E, cells 8 and 9). Morphologically, the cells that showed no glucose responsiveness or 2-NBDG uptake appeared somewhat smaller than the glucose-responsive cells, suggesting that the glucose-responsive cells are β-cells and the unresponsive cells are non-β-cells (18.Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The same cells were then characterized immunocytochemically after measurement of [Ca2+]i and 2-NBDG uptake. As shown in Fig.4 F, the seven glucose-responsive islet cells stained with anti-insulin antibody (cells 1–7), but the other two cells did not (cells 8, 9), further suggesting that only the cells showing both glucose responsiveness and 2-NBDG uptake are β-cells. We confirmed that all of the 93 cells that exhibited significant rapid 2-NBDG uptake were β-cells in 12 separate experiments. Most of these cells (82 cells) exhibited an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to glucose, but 11 of them did not, although they did respond to the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (0.5 mm) (data not shown). To examine the effect of glucose metabolism on the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i increase in β-cells, DNP, an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (15.Fujitani S. Okazaki K. Yada T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19.Atwater I. Dawson C.M. Ribalet B. Rojas E. J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 575-588PubMed Google Scholar), was used. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.5. The increase in [Ca2+]i in response to 16.8 mmglucose was strongly inhibited in the presence of 50 μmDNP, but the responsiveness was restored after washout of DNP. The cells also responded to 0.5 mm tolbutamide, and the same cells emitted strong 2-NBDG fluorescence when 200 μm2-NBDG was applied. These results were found in all glucose-responsive cells examined (34 cells) in five separate experiments. We also examined the effect of DNP on 2-NBDG uptake. 2-NBDG (200 μm) was applied to β-cells in the presence of 50 μm DNP, but 2-NBDG uptake into the β-cells was unaffected (five separate experiments; data not shown). To ascertain the inability of non-β-cells to incorporate 2-NBDG, an experiment with glucose and tolbutamide was performed, as shown in Fig.6. Three of the four islet cells showed a [Ca2+]i increase in response to both 16.8 mm glucose and 0.5 mm tolbutamide and incorporated significant 2-NBDG (Fig. 6, A–E, cells 1–3). The one islet cell that exhibited no [Ca2+]iincrease in response to either glucose or tolbutamide also did not show significant 2-NBDG uptake and was stained with anti-glucagon antibody (Fig. 6, A–F, cell 4). We performed eight separate experiments, and nine of the thirteen cells that exhibited no glucose- or tolbutamide-induced [Ca2+]i increase also incorporated no significant 2-NBDG rapidly and were stained with anti-glucagon antibody. The other four cells were not stained, indicating that they are non-β-, non-α-cells such as somatostatin-secreting δ-cells or pancreatic polypeptide-secreting PP cells. In contrast, no glucose- or tolbutamide-responsive cells were stained with anti-glucagon antibody (43 cells). To ascertain that the non-β-cells incorporate 2-NBDG after longer incubation, 2-NBDG uptake into islet cells was estimated after 10-min superfusion with 200 μm 2-NBDG. In a representative experiment, all 95 of the islet cells eventually showed 2-NBDG uptake, although there was extremely weak flouresence intensity in a small population of the cells (18 cells). We determined that 10 of the 18 cells were α-cells by staining with anti-glucagon antibody, and the average fluorescence intensity of the α-cells (379.1 ± 37.4; mean ± S.E.) was about one-tenth that of β-cells measured under the same condition (3000–6000). These results were confirmed in three independent experiments. 2-NBDG is a fluorescent derivative of d-glucose that has been modified with a 2-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino group at the C-2 position. We have shown in previous studies that 2-NBDG is taken into the cytoplasm of both Escherichia coli cells and yeastCandida albicans cells and that it is useful for assaying viability of cells (8.Yoshioka K. Takahashi H. Homma T. Saito M. Ki-Bong O. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20.Yoshioka K. Oh K.-B. Saito M. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 400-404PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake of 2-NBDG into these cells is inhibited by d-glucose but not by l-glucose, suggesting that it is transported into the cells through the glucose transporter system (8.Yoshioka K. Takahashi H. Homma T. Saito M. Ki-Bong O. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20.Yoshioka K. Oh K.-B. Saito M. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 400-404PubMed Google Scholar), but this has not been determined in mammalian cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that 2-NBDG is incorporated into mammalian cells through GLUTs. 2-NBDG was incorporated into the mouse insulin-secreting clonal MIN6 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and kinetic analysis revealed two K m components of 13.3 and 1.6 mm. These values are similar to those ford-glucose and the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue, 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (17.Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. Milburn J.L. Lodish H.F. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6548-6551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), found in pancreatic islets and cultured pancreatic β-cells, in which GLUT1 is expressed at low levels, whereas GLUT2 is much more abundant (21.Yasuda K. Yamada Y. Inagaki N. Yano H. Okamoto Y. Tsuji K. Fukumoto H. Imura H. Seino S. Seino Y. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22.Heimberg H. De Vos A. Pipeleers D. Thorens B. Schuit F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8971-8975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because MIN6 cells also express GLUT1 at a very low level (13.Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki T. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the high K m and lowK m correspond to the affinities of 2-NBDG for GLUT2 and GLUT1, respectively. Ishihara et al. (23.Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.-I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) have reported that the uptake of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose is rapid and that equilibration is 80% complete in 1 min in MIN6 cells. This is comparable with the time course of 2-NBDG uptake into MIN6 cells reported in this study, although the 2-NBDG uptake is somewhat slower. A fluorescent derivative of d-glucose, 6-NBDG, which is modified at the C-6 position, has been developed by Speizer et al. (24.Speizer L. Haugland R. Kutchai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). They found 6-NBDG to be incorporated into human erythrocytes but gradually to come out of the cell without any modification, probably because it does not enter the glycolytic pathway, glucose metabolism beginning with phosphorylation at the 6-hydroxyl group of d-glucose. In contrast, 2-NBDG is metabolized to a phosphorylated fluorescent derivative at the C-6 position, i.e. 2-NBDG 6-phosphate, after incorporation, and then decomposes to a nonfluorescent derivative in E. colicells (8.Yoshioka K. Takahashi H. Homma T. Saito M. Ki-Bong O. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 25.Yoshioka K. Saito M. Oh K.-B. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. Natsume M. Abe H. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1899-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of fluorescence intensity of 2-NBDG may be equilibrium of generation and decomposition of the fluorescent derivative. 2-NBDG fluorescence was not noticeably reduced up to 30 min after loading in this study (data not shown). We then used 2-NBDG to evaluate glucose uptake activity together with changes in [Ca2+]i in response to glucose stimulation in single, living pancreatic islet cells. It is thought that although an increase in glucose metabolism is essential for insulin secretion, the capacity for glucose uptake is very high, so transport is not rate-limiting. Gorus et al. (26.Gorus F.K. Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1196-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have separated β-cells from non-β-cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and shown that [14C] d-glucose or 3-O-methyl-d-glucose is rapidly equilibrated within 2 min across the plasma membrane in β-cells at both low (600 μm) and high (20 mm) glucose concentrations. In contrast, they showed that intracellular [14C]d-glucose or 3-O-methyl-d-glucose remains much lower and does not equilibrate even 30 min after incubation in α-cells. However, it has been difficult to evaluate the relationship between the glucose uptake activity and the glucose responsiveness of the cells in real time at the singe cell level. We show here that single pancreatic β-cells in which [Ca2+]i increases in response to a high concentration of glucose have high 2-NBDG uptake activity. Not all of the β-cells with significant uptake of 2-NBDG exhibited an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to glucose, however. These results suggest that not only glucose uptake but also the subsequent glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in glucose-induced insulin secretion from β-cells (27.Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E1-E13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by the finding of the glucose-induced increase in [Ca2+]i that is inhibited reversibly by the metabolic inhibitor DNP in β-cells, even though these cells show significant uptake of 2-NBDG. Because DNP had no effect on the 2-NBDG uptake into β-cells, it is suggested that glucose metabolism has little effect on the rapid equilibration of glucose uptake in β-cells. On the other hand, a small population of the islet cells showed no similar significant, rapid incorporation of 2-NBDG. All of these cells also lacked glucose-induced [Ca2+]i responsiveness. These cells, therefore, were non-β-cells or possibly α-cells; although they eventually showed 2-NBDG uptake after longer incubation, their fluorescence intensities were much weaker than those of β-cells. These results show that 2-NBDG is an effective tracer of glucose transport activity in pancreatic β-cells. 2-NBDG should also be helpful in clarifying the mechanisms underlying dynamic glucose uptake-function coupling in other glucose-responsive tissues and cells. We are grateful to Drs. S. Seino (Chiba University) and S. Nagamatsu (Kyorin University) for the gift of GLUT2 expression vector and GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression vectors, respectively. We also thank Dr. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University) for providing us with MIN6 cells."

It is generally accepted that PSII and PSI act in series, electrons provided by PSII being used to reduce PSI electron donors through a general scheme known as the “Z scheme” of photosynthesis. According to the endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts originate from a cyanobacterial ancestor (1.Gray M.W. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 294-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in which both oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration were likely functioning in the same cellular compartment. In existing cyanobacteria, photosynthesis is located in thylakoid membranes, and respiration is located both in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes (2.Scherer S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been shown that respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains function in close relationship within thylakoid membranes, where they share in common some electron transport components, such as the plastoquinone pool (2.Scherer S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Whether thylakoid membranes of existing chloroplasts have kept relics of this ancestral respiration and what could be the role of plastid respiration in the bioenergetics of modern chloroplasts are intriguing questions that have been a subject of controversy during the past few years (3.Bennoun P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a respiratory chain should involve at least two electron transport components in addition to the PQ pool: one performing the nonphotochemical reduction of the PQ pool using stromal reductants and the other allowing reoxidation of reduced PQs and reduction of O2. However, although the existence of enzymatic systems allowing nonphotochemical reduction of the PQ pool is rather well documented (5.Peltier G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4791-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Godde D. Trebst A. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 127: 245-252Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8.Guedeney G. Corneille S. Cuiné S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), the existence of an oxidase operating on the PQ pool has been a matter of debate (6.Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 59-66Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11.Gans P. Rébeillé F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 150-155Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, no molecular or biochemical evidence support the existence of a plastidial oxidase in Chlamydomonas cells.Mass spectrometry using 18O-labeled O2 on PSI-deficient mutants is a powerful way to determine whether electrons produced at PSII (measured as unlabeled O2 from water photolysis) can be diverted toward a terminal oxidase consuming O2. Using this approach, it was reported that, in the absence of PSI, a steady state electron flow occurs in the light from PSII to O2 (12.Peltier G. Thibault P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 319-324Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13.Cournac L. Redding K. Bennoun P. Peltier G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, based on the effect of respiratory inhibitors and of uncouplers, it was initially concluded that reducing equivalents were produced by PSII through a Δψ-dependent reaction and subsequently transferred toward mitochondria for reoxidation (12.Peltier G. Thibault P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 319-324Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14.Redding K. Peltier G. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt- Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 349-362Google Scholar). Using 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and cytb 6 f mutants, it was shown that the light-induced electron flow involved the PQ pool but not the cytb 6 f, and it was hypothesized that it relied on a putative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase functioning in a reverse mode (12.Peltier G. Thibault P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 319-324Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In the present paper, we have reinvestigated this question by measuring electron transfer reactions occurring in the absence of PSI inChlamydomonas strains lacking either the PSI complex or the cyt b 6 f complex. These strains have been obtained through chloroplast deletion of entire coding regions and are therefore particularly stringent. By performing measurements on chloroplast fractions and using different inhibitors, we show that electrons provided by PSII can be diverted at a significant rate toward a chloroplast oxidase. The nature of this oxidase, which is sensitive to propyl gallate but poorly sensitive to cyanide and insensitive to azide, CO, and SHAM, is discussed in relation to the properties of a recently discovered chloroplast quinol oxidase implicated in carotenoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis(15.Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16.Wu D.Y. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).RESULTSWhen PSI-deficient algae are illuminated, simultaneous O2 production by PSII (monitored as16O2 release resulting from water photolysis) and stimulation of O2 uptake are observed using18O-labeled O2 and mass spectrometry (13.Cournac L. Redding K. Bennoun P. Peltier G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Redding K. Cournac L. Vassiliev I.R. Golbeck J.H. Peltier G. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10466-10473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the light-dependent O2 production and the light-stimulated O2 uptake are of the same amplitude, illumination of PSI-deficient strains does not provoke any change in the apparent rate of O2 uptake assayed without isotopic labeling (using a Clark-type electrode for instance). We found that the maximal light-dependent O2 production by PSII measured in different PSI-deficient mutants was relatively constant when normalized to the number of cells (250–350 nmol O2min−1 10−9 cells) or to the amount of protein (8–13 nmol O2 min−1 mg−1protein). As previously reported in nuclear mutants deficient in PSI (12.Peltier G. Thibault P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 319-324Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we found that 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, an inhibitor blocking photosynthetic electron transfer between QA (the primary quinone acceptor of PSII) and QB (the secondary quinone acceptor), strongly inhibited the PSII-driven oxygen production. Also, the PSII-dependent electron flow was observed in the absence of the cytb 6 f complex in aChlamydomonas double transformantpsaAΔ-petAΔ lacking both PSI and cytb 6 f.As reported earlier (12.Peltier G. Thibault P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 319-324Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the PS II-dependent pathway was sensitive to the presence of inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 1). Simultaneous addition of myxothiazol (an inhibitor of the mitochondrial cytbc 1 complex) and of SHAM (an inhibitor of the alternative oxidase) inhibited both dark respiration and the PSII-dependent electron flow, whereas myxothiazol or SHAM alone inhibited neither respiration nor photosynthetic oxygen evolution. The effect of the inhibitors on PSII activity could be the consequence of either the mitochondrial inhibition or a synergistic effect of myxothiazol and SHAM on chloroplast processes. To identify clearly the site of action of myxothiazol, we introduced a mitochondrial cyt b gene conferring resistance to myxothiazol (MUD2; Ref. 20.Bennoun P. Delosme M. Kück U. Genetics. 1991; 127: 335-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into a strain deficient in PSI (psaBΔ). In this strain, myxothiazol had no effect either on the PSII-driven electron flow or on respiration when added alone or in combination with SHAM (Fig. 1). When myxothiazol was replaced by antimycin A, another inhibitor of the cyt bc 1complex acting at a distinct site, the inhibition was again observed. The same results were obtained using a psaAΔ MUD2 strain (not shown). This clearly shows that the effect of myxothiazol on the PSII-dependent flow is specifically related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.The sensitivity of the photosynthetic flow to inhibition of mitochondrial activity can be interpreted in two different ways. As initially proposed by Peltier and Thibault (12.Peltier G. Thibault P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 319-324Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the light-stimulated O2 uptake may be located in mitochondria, with reducing power produced at PSII being transported to mitochondria by means of metabolic shuttles. Another possibility would be that O2uptake occurs in the chloroplast but is indirectly affected by the metabolic changes resulting from mitochondrial inhibition. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we investigated O2 exchange using 18O2 and mass spectrometry in chloroplast fractions. Chloroplast isolation is rather difficult in Chlamydomonas because of the presence of a cell wall and the large size of the chloroplast, leading to chloroplast disruption when sufficient force is used to break the algal cell. For this reason, we constructed a Chlamydomonas strain deficient in both PSI and cell wall biosynthesis by crossing cw10 (a cell wall-less strain) with psaBΔ7 (PSI-deficient). In this strain, isolation of chloroplasts was possible using mild Yeda press disruption (21.Rolland N. Dorne A.J. Amoroso G. Sultemeyer D.F. Joyard J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6713-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). O2 exchange activity was measured in chloroplasts and in thylakoids following fractionation of disrupted cells on a Percoll gradient.Both chloroplast and thylakoid fractions exhibited a significant light-driven O2 production by PSII (measured from16O2 release in the medium), which averaged (on a chlorophyll basis) around 60 and 50%, respectively, of that measured in whole cells (Fig. 2). In both chloroplasts and thylakoids, like in intact cells, O2evolution by PSII was accompanied by a stimulation of O2consumption (Fig. 2). In all systems tested, light-induced O2 production and stimulation of O2 uptake were of the same amplitude. To check whether the activity of electron transport measured in chloroplast fractions (particularly O2 uptake) was relying on contaminating mitochondria, we tested the sensitivity of the photosynthetic flow to mitochondrial inhibitors. We found that neither PSII-driven O2 production (Fig. 3) nor light-dependent O2 uptake (not shown) measured in isolated chloroplasts or thylakoids were significantly affected by the simultaneous addition of myxothiazol and SHAM, thus showing that electron transport was not relying on contaminating mitochondria.Figure 2Oxygen exchange in intact cells and chloroplasts of the cw10 psaBΔ strain. Results are shown as cumulative μmols of O2 exchanged in the measurement vessel as a function of time. Chlorophyll concentration was set to 20 μg ml−1 in both experiments.

In the psaAΔ petAΔ strain (deficient in PSI and in the cyt b 6 fcomplex) measurements were performed on “intact cells,” on “permeabilized cells” resulting from mild Yeda press disruption, and on “thylakoids” resulting from French press disruption. In the double mutant cw10 psaBΔ deficient in PSI and cell wall-less, measurements were performed on intact cells and on chloroplast fractions resulting from Yeda press disruption and separation on a Percoll gradient. Two fractions were analyzed: a “chloroplast” fraction and a “thylakoid” fraction. Number of cells was determined visually on intact algae by counting in Malassez vessels; for the fractions, an “equivalent” number was estimated by comparing chlorophyll concentrations in the extracts and in the intact cells sample. Light intensity during measurements was 300 μmol of photons m−2 s−1.

We used the psaAΔ petAΔ strain and prepared thylakoids by French press disruption. Maximal electron transport activity in these thylakoids represented about 24% of that measured in intact cells. Noticeably, this activity was fully insensitive to myxothiazol and SHAM (Fig. 3 and TableI). In parallel experiments,psaAΔ petAΔ cells were permeabilized using Yeda press disruption, which should better preserve chloroplast structures and keep the mitochondria within the cell. In this system, about 80% of the light-dependent oxygen evolution activity was retained but was almost insensitive to myxothiazol and SHAM, suggesting that the loss of metabolites following cell permeabilization considerably decreased the influence of mitochondria upon chloroplast electron transport (Fig. 3). We conclude from these experiments that the electron flow from PSII to O2 observed in intact cells occurs within chloroplasts, thus suggesting the existence of a plastidial activity mediating plastoquinol oxidation.Table IEffect of different inhibitors and reactive oxygen species scavengers on photosynthetic activity of thylakoids from Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in PSI and cyt b6fTreatmentInhibition of photosynthetic O2 production% of control3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyurea (10 μm)>95Dibromothymoquine (1 μm)nsMyxothiazol (20 μm)nsSHAM (4 mm)nsMyxothiazol (4 μm) + SHAM (0.8 mm)nsAntimycin A (20 μm)nsKCN (1 mm)nsKCN (5 mm)15CO (3% v/v eq)nsNaN3 (5 mm)nsPropyl gallate (1 mm)90Ascorbate (5 mm)nsSuperoxide dismutase (500 units ml−1) + catalase (1000 units ml−1)nsMeasurements of O2 production by PSII were performed by monitoring 16O2 release, using 18O2 and mass spectrometry, on thylakoids prepared from the psaAΔ petAΔ mutant strain.

Inhibitions are expressed as a percentage of the gross O2evolution rate measured in the absence of inhibitors (around 70 nmol of O2 min−1 10−9 cells). There were at least three replicates per inhibitor; nonsignificant (p > 0.05) effects are shown as ns. Open table in a new tab To characterize further the chloroplast PQ oxidation activity, we used several compounds known as inhibitors of either the mitochondrial cytc oxidase (cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide), or the mitochondrial alternative oxidase (propyl gallate, SHAM). The effects of these inhibitors were studied on light-driven O2production by PSII (measured from 16O2 release) and light-dependent O2 uptake in thylakoid extracts from the psaAΔ petAΔ double mutant. KCN, a cytochrome oxidase inhibitor, which has also been described as inhibiting chlororespiration (3.Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Peltier G. Ravenel J. Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 83-90Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31.Garab G. Lajko F. Mustardy L. Marton L. Planta. 1989; 179: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) had no effect up to concentrations reaching 5 mm (Table I). NaN3 (5 mm) and CO (3% v/v eq) had no significant effect upon PSII activity or O2 uptake. PSII-driven oxygen exchange measured in thylakoids from PSI-deficient mutants was insensitive to 4 mm SHAM but was strongly inhibited by 1 mmpropyl gallate (Table I). Fig. 4 shows that propyl gallate also inhibited the PSII-dependent O2 production in intact Chlamydomonas cells deficient in PSI. The stimulation by light of O2 uptake was inhibited by propyl gallate in the same way, whereas noticeably, the oxygen uptake in the dark was not affected by this compound (not shown). The effect of propyl gallate was similar in the cell wall-lesscw10 psaBΔ strain to that observed in other PSI-deficient mutants, except that comparable inhibitions were found at lower concentrations. This is likely due to better penetration of propyl gallate into cells lacking a cell wall. However, in the same concentration range, this compound had no significant effect on the photosynthetic oxygen production measured in the cw10 strain (Fig. 4), thus showing that linear electron flow involving both PSII and PSI is not affected by this compound. Because propyl gallate is also known as a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species (32.Kahl R. Weinke S. Kappus H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 264: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we checked the effect of other reactive oxygen species scavengers such as superoxide dismutase (in association with catalase) and α-tocopherol. None of these agents had a significant effect on the PSII-driven O2 evolution or oxygen uptake (Table I).Figure 4Effect of propyl gallate on photosynthetic O2 production measured in intact Chlamydomonascells. ●, cw10 strain deficient in cell wall but with normal photosynthetic activity; ○, psaAΔ strain deficient in PSI; ▾, cw10 psaBΔ strain cell wall-less and deficient in PSI.

Ravenel J. Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 83-90Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33.Ravenel J. Peltier G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 57-63Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). When dark-adapted Chlamydomonas cells are submitted to a single turnover saturating flash on a rapid oxygen electrode, a transitory elevation of the oxygen level is observed, which has been shown to result not from production of oxygen by PSII, but from a transient inhibition of the chlororespiratory electron flow mediated by PSI (4.Peltier G. Ravenel J. Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 83-90Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A transitory lowering of the oxygen signal in PSI-deficient mutants, interpreted as a transient stimulation of an O2 uptake process, has also been reported (33.Ravenel J. Peltier G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 57-63Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We found that both the flash-induced stimulation of oxygen uptake observed in PSI-deficient mutants and the flash-induced inhibition of uptake in WT are inhibited by propyl gallate (Fig. 5) but are insensitive to SHAM (not shown). We conclude from these experiments that the oxidase involved in the PSII electron flow to O2is also involved in chlororespiration.Figure 5Effect of propyl gallate on the amperometric signal recorded following the flash illumination of intactChlamydomonas cells. Algae were deposited on a bare O2 platinum electrode and adapted in the dark for 30 min before measurements. A single turnover saturating flash was fired when indicated by the arrow.

Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) prompted us to ask if the IM product exhibited a measurable quinol oxidase activity and if a homologue of IM existed in Chlamydomonas thylakoids. We tested the potential oxidase activity of IM after expression inE. coli cells. After induction of the chimeric gene, the oxidase activity of membrane preparations was assayed. NADH addition initiates oxygen consumption in membranes from both control cells and from cells expressing IM. KCN addition (1 mm) inhibited almost completely oxygen consumption in control membranes. In contrast, a significant cyanide-resistant oxygen consumption was consistently observed in membranes from the IM-expressing cells. 2E. M. Josse, A. J. Simkin, J. Gaffé, A. M. Laboré, M. Kuntz, and P. Carol, manuscript submitted. We tested the sensitivity of this cyanide-resistant oxidase activity to propyl gallate (Fig. 6) and found that it was sensitive with an I50 around 0.1 mm in this system. The oxidase was at least 10 times less sensitive to SHAM (not shown). In agreement with other data (37.Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we found that propyl gallate did not interfere with the normal electron flow in E. colimembranes (not shown).Figure 6Titration of propyl gallate inhibition of quinol oxidase activity of the recombinant IM protein expressed inE. coli.

InChlamydomonas thylakoid membranes, the anti-IM antibody recognized a 43-kDa polypeptide, which was almost undetectable in total membranes (Fig. 6, inset). During oxygenic photosynthesis, electron transfer reactions involve the cooperation of two photosystems to produce O2at PSII1 and reduce NADP+ at PSI. It is generally accepted that PSII and PSI act in series, electrons provided by PSII being used to reduce PSI electron donors through a general scheme known as the “Z scheme” of photosynthesis. According to the endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts originate from a cyanobacterial ancestor (1.Gray M.W. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 294-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in which both oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration were likely functioning in the same cellular compartment. In existing cyanobacteria, photosynthesis is located in thylakoid membranes, and respiration is located both in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes (2.Scherer S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been shown that respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains function in close relationship within thylakoid membranes, where they share in common some electron transport components, such as the plastoquinone pool (2.Scherer S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Whether thylakoid membranes of existing chloroplasts have kept relics of this ancestral respiration and what could be the role of plastid respiration in the bioenergetics of modern chloroplasts are intriguing questions that have been a subject of controversy during the past few years (3.Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Peltier G. Ravenel J. Verméglio A. Biochim. Biophys.

To investigate which of these activities is important for the cellular functions of Dna2, we have identified separation of function mutations that selectively inactivate the helicase or nuclease. We describe the effect of six such mutations on ATPase, helicase, and nuclease after purification of the mutant proteins from yeast or baculovirus-infected insect cells. A mutation in the Walker A box in the C-terminal third of the protein affects helicase and ATPase but not nuclease; a mutation in the N-terminal domain (amino acid 504) affects ATPase, helicase, and nuclease. Two mutations in the N-terminal domain abolish nuclease but do not reduce helicase activity (amino acids 657 and 675) and identify the putative nuclease active site. Two mutations immediately adjacent to the proposed nuclease active site (amino acids 640 and 693) impair nuclease activity in the absence of ATP but completely abolish nuclease activity in the presence of ATP. These results suggest that, although the Dna2 helicase and nuclease activities can be independently affected by some mutations, the two activities appear to interact, and the nuclease activity is regulated in a complex manner by ATP. Physiological analysis shows that both ATPase and nuclease are important for the essential function of DNA2 in DNA replication and for its role in double-strand break repair.

Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Budd, M. E., and Campbell, J. L. (2000) Mutat. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Dna2 is a 170-kDa protein with six motifs characteristic of DNA helicases in the C-terminal third of the protein. A schematic diagram of the protein is shown in Fig. 1. Genes homologous to DNA2have been identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Xenopus laevis, Caenorhabditis elegans, and humans (6.Eki T. Okumura K. Shiratori A. Abe M. Nogami M. Taguchi H. Shibata T.

Immunoaffinity-purified Dna2 has DNA-dependent ATPase activity, DNA helicase activity that requires a 5′ non-hybridized tail adjacent to the duplex region unwound, and a potent endonuclease activity (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9.Budd M.E. Choe W.-C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The helicase and ATPase activities are required for the essential function of Dna2 since mutation of the ATP binding motif (K1080E) abolishes both ATPase and helicase and results in a gene that does not complement either a dna2–1 or adna2Δ mutant (9.Budd M.E. Choe W.-C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Other dna2 mutations that reduce but do not abolish ATP binding and/or hydrolysis support growth under some conditions, showing that the full helicase activity is not essential for viability, and leading to the suggestion that it is the nuclease activity that is essential (4.Formosa T. Nitiss T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent analysis suggests that Dna2 falls into the RecB class of helicase/nuclease proteins, with homology to the nuclease localized to a short motif in the N-terminal half of the protein, corresponding to the putative active site of RecB nuclease (see Fig. 1). Preliminary characterization of the nuclease activity associated with immunoaffinity-purified Dna2 suggested that it was a so-called structure-specific nuclease, in that it removed 5′ single-stranded tails adjacent to a duplex region, but not 3′ single-stranded tails and did not digest duplex DNA (10.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that Dna2 might have an intrinsic nuclease and/or that it might copurify with yeast flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), which has similar substrate specificity (12.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both interpretations appear to be correct. FEN-1 is a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease that also functions as an endonuclease on a 5′ single-stranded flap structure adjacent to a duplex region, cutting at (or near, depending on the context) the junction between the single- and double-stranded region. The human FEN-1 homologue participates in the maturation of Okazaki fragments synthesized during an in vitro SV-40 DNA replication reaction (14.Ishimi Y. Claude A. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19723-19733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 16.Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast FEN-1 is encoded by the RAD27 gene (17.Johnson R.E. Gopala K.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18.Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the phenotype of rad27Δ mutants suggests, albeit indirectly, that the mutants are defective in Okazaki fragment maturation. For instance, rad27Δ mutants are viable at 23 °C but not at 37 °C, cause a high level of mutagenesis, but are not defective in repair (17.Johnson R.E. Gopala K.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18.Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). rad27Δ mutants show an increased frequency of duplications at repeated structures, which might occur due to faulty Okazaki fragment processing (19.Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). rad27Δ mutants accumulate expansions of di- and tri-nucleotide repeat DNA tracts, which could be explained by fold-back of FLAP structures on Okazaki fragments at stalled replication forks (17.Johnson R.E. Gopala K.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20.Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A.

We have documented strong genetic interactions between DNA2 andRAD27. Overexpression of RAD27 complementsdna2–1 strains and overproduction of DNA2suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect ofrad27Δ strains. rad27Δ dna2–1strains are inviable. Biochemical studies showed that the affinity-purified Dna2 preparations contained FEN-1 and that FEN-1 and Dna2 co-immunoprecipitated from yeast extracts. This genetic and biochemical evidence led us to propose that Dna2, like FEN-1, functions in Okazaki fragment maturation (10.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), but left the mechanism ill defined. Dna2 could either substitute for FEN-1, or assist FEN-1 in its function, or repair errors made by FEN-1. Overexpression ofRAD27 also suppresses this sensitivity of dna2mutants to x-rays (5.Budd, M. E., and Campbell, J. L. (2000) Mutat. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar), suggesting again an interaction or functional overlap between the two, although rad27Δ strains are proficient in DSB2 repair (17.Johnson R.E. Gopala K.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We next purified Dna2 from a rad27Δ strain, and we found that a potent nuclease activity was still present, suggesting that, in addition to associating with FEN-1, DNA2 encodes an integral nuclease (10.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). That Dna2 is itself a nuclease was strongly supported by more extensive characterization of a nuclease associated with recombinant yeast Dna2 protein produced in insect cells (11.Bae S. Choi E. Lee K. Park J. Lee S. Seo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These workers found that highly purified Dna2 cleaves single-stranded DNA endonucleolytically, that it prefers 5′ single-stranded tails to 3′ single-stranded tails, and that it has very low endonuclease activity on limited stretches of single-stranded DNA flanked by two regions of duplex (11.Bae S. Choi E. Lee K. Park J. Lee S. Seo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, it has the specificity to tailor the 5′ ends of Okazaki fragments during their maturation into continuous DNA strands, providing a biochemical basis for a role in Okazaki fragment maturation. Although several helicase/nucleases are required for DNA repair, Dna2 is the first replication protein that contains both functions. Herein, we further characterize the Dna2 nuclease/helicase biochemically and genetically. Our results highlight the fact that Dna2 is a vigorous endonuclease, as opposed to a strictly structure-specific nuclease, and that it is regulated by ATP. More important, we show by mutations that eliminate nuclease activity but that leave helicase intact, that the nuclease is integral to Dna2 and that the nuclease domain is essential both for viability of yeast and for repair of x-ray induced damage. Yeast strains used were: BJ5459 (MATa ura3–52 trp1 lys2–801 leu2Δ200 his3Δ200 pep4Δ:1–1153 prb1Δ1.6r) and 4X154–2D (MATa ura3–52 trp1 his3 leu2). Strain dna2–1 for complementation analysis was as described (10.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The strain used for the x-ray sensitivity study (Fig. 6 E) was MB-2–2-5G-6A (MATa trp1 leu2 ura3 his3 dna2–2::LEU2 sgs1–3::TRP1). Oligonucleotides used for construction of mutants and helicase and nuclease assays were: MB55, GGAATGCCAGGGACTGGGGAAACTACTGTTATCGCAGA; MB87, GTTCTTCTGTGGCGTTCCAGGACCACCCAAGCTAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACATATGGACGATCTCTTCAATTG; MB95, AAATAATACATCGGAATTTAGCACCAACAGGTT; MB94, GAAGCTCTTCTTATTCCCCGGATCCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGACTTTCATACTCTTGTAGAAT; MB140, TATTGGAGACCAAATGTTCGCTGCCGCTGCAATCACATTGGATATAGA; hpr3, AGCTCTTGATCGTAGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG; hpr7, AGCTAGCTCTTGATCGTAGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG; hpr8, AGCTCTTGATCGTAGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGC (44-mer, 30 nt complementary to M13mp18). The plasmid pB/S:DNA2 has the 6110-bpEcoRI fragment containing the DNA2 gene cloned into the EcoRI site of pB/S SK−. The next B/S plasmids were created by site-directed mutagenesis with the above oligonucleotides. The plasmid B/S:87 has the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope YPYDVPDYASLGGP fused to oligonucleotide AA1 and was created by hybridizing pB/S:DNA2 with MB87. In addition an EcoRI site was inserted 3 nucleotides upstream of the ATG. The plasmid B/S:87.94 was constructed by hybridizing B/S:87 with MB94, creating a DNA2 gene with a HA epitope tag at the N terminus and 6-histidine tag at the C terminus. The plasmid B/S:87.94.55 was created by hybridizing MB55 to B/S:87.94, resulting in a K1080E mutation in the ATP binding motif. B/S:87.94.95 was created by hybridizing MB95 to B/S:87.94, resulting in a P504Sdna2–1 mutation. The plasmid B/S:87.94.140 was made by hybridizing MB140 to B/S:87.94, resulting in a DIEE640AAA mutation. The plasmid pGAL:DNA2 was created by cloning the 5.4-kb EcoRI fragment from B/S:87.94 into the EcoRI site of pGAL18. The plasmid pGAL:Dna2:K1080E was created by cloning the 5.4-kb fragment from B/S:87.94.55 into the EcoRI site of pGAL18. The plasmid pGAL:Dna2:E640A was created by cloning the 5.4-kb EcoRI site from B/S:87.94.140 into the EcoRI site of pGAL18. The pGAL plasmids containing the tagged D657A, E675A, and Y293A mutant Dna2 proteins were created exactly as pGAL:Dna2:E640A. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are available on request. The plasmid pGAL:Dna2:P504S was created by cloning the 5.4-kb EcoRI fragment from B/S:87.94.95 into the EcoRI site of pGAL18. The baculovirus expression vector was prepared by inserting the full-length DNA2 gene in pB/S SK− using the 6-kbEcoRI insert from Ycp154–2 containing the DNA2gene (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A BamHI site was engineered at the ATG translation start site of the DNA2 gene by site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotides GATCGTCAGGGGATCCATGCCCGG after purification of U-rich single-stranded phagemid as described in the Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). Full-lengthDNA2 was transferred to the baculovirus expression vector pFASTbac HTb (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing a 6xHis tag, usingBamHI and XhoI to give pbacDNA2. This yields a 6xHis tag at the N terminus of DNA2. The plasmid pbacDNA2N, containing the N-terminal 2980 bp of DNA2 was prepared by deletion of the PvuII-ShoI fragment within theDNA2 gene. pbacDNA2C was prepared by cloning of the C-terminal 1719 bp of DNA2, prepared by polymerase chain reaction, into pFASTbacHTb. Yeast Dna2 was expressed in insect SF9 cells using the Bac to Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). pFast Dna2 was introduced into Escherichia coli DH10BAC and placed on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ml tetracyclin, 100 μg/ml Bluo-gal, and 40 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described in the supplier's manual. White colonies were picked and grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ml tetracyclin, and recombinant bacmid DNA was prepared. Bacmids were prepared and introduced into SF9 (or HI5) insect cells using Cell-fectin reagent; recombinant virus were collected and amplified. Cells were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline buffer and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mix). Cells were lysed by sonication. After cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column. Dna2-containing fractions were collected with lysis buffer containing 600 mm NaCl after several washes with lysis buffer. The fraction was incubated with Ni2+/NTA-agarose) equilibrated with binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. After thorough washing with lysis buffer (100 column volumes), Dna2 was eluted with a gradient from 0 mmto 150 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. The Dna2-containing fraction was dialyzed in 10 volumes of lysis buffer. The Dna2-containing fraction was loaded onto a 1-ml FPLC Mono Q column. After washing, Dna2 was eluted with a gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl in lysis buffer. Dna2-containing fractions (eluting at 270 mm NaCl) were pooled and loaded onto a 5-ml 15–40% glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a SW 50.1 rotor for 24 h. Dna2 was identified at all purification steps by DNA-dependent ATPase assay and Western blotting with anti-Dna2 polyclonal antibody. A summary of the purification is shown in Table I.Table IPurification of 6xHis-Dna2 from insect cellsAmountVolumeSpecific activitymgmlμmol/30 min/mgExtract808Heparin-agarose18100.35Ni2+/NTA2.842Mono Q0.031.5129Glycerol gradient0.010.5160 Open table in a new tab The pGAL18 plasmids described above were transformed into BJ5459, and cells were grown and extracts were prepared as described previously (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To purify Dna2 on the Ni2+/NTA-agarose column, the ammonium sulfate precipitated extract was dialyzed in TBSG, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.025 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein (100 mg) was loaded onto a 1-ml Ni2+/NTA-agarose column. The column was washed with 50 volumes of TBSG, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was further washed with 20 mm imidazole in TBSG, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100. His-tagged Dna2 was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in TBSG, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml and frozen. Approximately 100-fold purification was obtained. Dna2 was immunoprecipitated by incubating 5 μg of Ni2+/NTA-agarose-purified Dna2 with 5 μg of 12CA5 antibody for 1.5 h at 4 °C. 10 μl of 10% protein A beads was added followed by a 1-h incubation. Beads were washed five times with TBSG, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA, then two times with 2× assay buffer. 2× ATPase assay buffer is 20% glycerol, 0.08m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.01 MgCl2, 0.05 mNaCl, 0.002 m DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA. 2× helicase assay buffer is 20% glycerol, 0.08 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.01m MgCl2, 0.05 m NaCl, 0.002m DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA. 12CA5 was coupled to CL-4B-agarose beads at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. When 12CA5-coupled beads were used, 5 μg of Ni2+/NTA-purified protein was incubated with 5 μl of 12CA5-coupled beads for 2 h. The protein was then washed as above. When Dna2 was purified from ammonium sulfate precipitates of crude extracts, 0.5 mg of protein was incubated with 10 μg of 12CA5 for 1.5 h, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 10% protein A beads. The substrate was added in a volume of 10 μl and incubated at 37 °C. The helicase assay contained 4 mm ATP, 0.01 pm oligonucleotide hpr3 hybridized to M13. 2× helicase assay buffer is 20% glycerol, 0.08 mTris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.015 m MgCl2, 0.05m NaCl, 0.002 m DTT, 8 mm ATP. The standard ATPase assay contained 0.1 mg/ml poly(dA) and 0.2 mm ATP at 25 μm/1 μCi. For 5′-labeled substrate, oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with32P using polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides were hybridized to M13mp18 by heating to 65 °C for 5 min and annealing by cooling to room temperature. Free oligonucleotides were removed by gel filtration using Sepharose CL-4B. For 3′-labeled substrate, the oligonucleotide was annealed to M13mp18 DNA and labeled using Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dTTP. Unincorporated dTTP was removed by gel filtration. Purified Dna2 was incubated in a 20-μl reaction (same as ATPase reaction) containing 15 fmol of substrate at 37 °C for 15 min. For denaturing gel analysis, after mixing with sequencing gel loading buffer, samples were boiled and loaded onto a 20% sequencing gel. The gel was run for 90 min at 20 W. Gels were dried and the nuclease products were analyzed with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). TheDNA2 gene used in this study contains the full-lengthDNA2, including the 105-amino acid, N-terminal segment absent from the gene used in our previous studies (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This region does not appear to perform an essential function and shares no homology withDNA2 genes from other organisms. However, the 105-amino acid region may have a role in transcriptional silencing, since overexpressing this portion of the protein leads to derepression of genes normally silenced at telomeres (22.Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.e. Goggin C. Nahowald M. Gottschling D.E. Genetics. 1998; 150: 613-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In evaluating the essential functions of DNA2, it seems more prudent to use the full-length protein. The DNA2 gene was tagged at the N terminus with 6 histidines, cloned, expressed in SF9 insect cells, and extensively purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and TableI. In addition to the wild type protein, a K1080E mutant protein, a protein consisting of the 963 N-terminal amino acids (120 kDa), and a protein consisting of the 573 C-terminal amino acids (65 kDa) were expressed and purified. Similar levels of expression and purity were obtained with each of the mutant proteins (Fig. 2). To determine if Dna2, like other helicases, is multimeric, gel filtration analysis was carried out. The Dna2 protein is found primarily as a dimer (Fig.3). In addition, there is a significant peak of tetramers (Fig. 3) and even some hexamers (not visible in the tracing in Fig. 3). Only the dimeric form of the Dna2 protein shows DNA-dependent ATPase activity, suggesting that the form of the protein active as an ATPase is a dimer (Fig. 3).Figure 3Size exclusion analysis of Dna2.Partially purified Dna2 (0.5 mg, Ni2+/NTA-agarose fraction) was loaded onto an FPLC Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Dna2 polyclonal antibody. The relative amount of Dna2 in each fraction was measured by densitometer tracing of the Dna2 Western blot. ATPase activity was assayed with 2 μl of each fraction in 20-μl reactions in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP for 30 min. The column was calibrated with thyroglubulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). The peaks of these markers were in fractions 25, 29, and 32, respectively. ▪, Dna2; ♦, ATPase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4 A, the ATPase activity of the wild type protein requires single-stranded DNA. Either poly(dA) or single-stranded circular M13 DNA is an effective cofactor. Double-stranded DNA fails to stimulate the ATPase. The K1080E mutation abolishes the ATPase activity (Fig. 4 A), identifying the Walker A box as part of the active site of the DNA-dependent ATPase. The N-terminal 120-kDa protein and the C-terminal 65-kDa protein both lack ATPase (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that the two domains may interact to activate the ATPase or that the C-terminal fragment does not fold properly, even though it is expressed at levels similar to the wild type (data not shown). TheK m for the ATPase activity was determined from the data in Fig. 4 B and is 165 μm. Since we have previously shown that 4 mm ATP is required for the DNA helicase activity (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the low K m was surprising. Below, we reconcile this discrepancy by showing that much lower concentrations of ATP (100 μm) are required for helicase activity when the nuclease is inactivated by mutation. It is noteworthy that the specific activity of the ATPase associated with yeast Dna2 is almost 100 fold higher than that found in X. laevis Dna2 (8.Liu Q. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be some differences between the enzymes from different species. As reported previously for yeast Dna2 expressed in insect cells and forXenopus Dna2 expressed in insect cells (8.Liu Q. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11.Bae S. Choi E. Lee K. Park J. Lee S. Seo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), at the levels of protein used here, there was no detectable helicase activity in our preparations on any of the substrates used to assay the activity of the Dna2 protein purified from yeast (for example Fig.5 A). The difficulty of detecting helicase in recombinant Dna2 is further addressed under “Discussion” but is not the subject of this paper, which focuses on the nuclease activity. The Dna2 preparations are active as nucleases. To further characterize the substrates and products of the Dna2 nuclease activity, we chose substrates, labeling configurations, and reaction conditions not investigated previously with the recombinant yeast Dna2 protein from insect cells (11.Bae S. Choi E. Lee K. Park J. Lee S. Seo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, we compared the wild type Dna2 protein with the K1080E mutant protein. First, we used the helicase substrate, an M13 single-stranded DNA circle hybridized to a 38-nt oligonucleotide with a 14-base noncomplementary 5′ tail (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The 38-mer was labeled at the 5′ terminus with 32P. The digestion products were analyzed on a native gel. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lanes 2,4, 7, 9, 11, and12), the major labeled product of the nuclease was 10 nt, with some smaller products, suggesting a preference for cutting this substrate 4 nt away from the junction of duplex and single-stranded DNA (but see below). Lanes 1 and 6 are controls with protein from mock-infected insect cells carried through the same purification procedure. The K1080E mutant was as active as the wild type protein (compare lanes 2 and 4, 3and 5, 7 and 9,"

Some mutations intau exon 10 (E10) and immediately adjacent sequences cause disease by altering E10 splicing. To determine the mechanism of normal E10 splicing regulation and how FTDP-17 mutations alter splicing, mutational analysis of E10 was performed. The results show that E10 contains a complex array of both enhancer and inhibitorcis-acting elements that modulate usage of a weak 5′ splice site. The 5′ end of E10 contains a previously unrecognized multipartite exon splicing enhancer (ESE) composed of an SC35-like binding sequence, a purine-rich sequence, and an AC-rich element. Downstream of this ESE is a purine-rich exon splicing inhibitor. Intronic sequences immediately downstream of E10 also are inhibitory. The results support an alternative model in which I10 inhibitory sequences appear to function as a linear sequence. The cis-elements described are not redundant, and all appear required for normal E10 splicing. Results with double mutations demonstrate that the ESE and the intronic inhibitory element collaborate to regulate splicing. Thus splicing oftau E10 is regulated by a complex set ofcis-acting elements that span nearly the entire exon and also include intronic sequences."

IB1 is expressed at high levels in pancreatic β cells and may therefore exert a tight control on signaling events mediated by JNK in these cells. Activation of JNK by interleukin 1 (IL-1β) or by the upstream JNK constitutive activator ΔMEKK1 promoted apoptosis in two pancreatic β cell lines and decreased IB1 content by 50–60%. To study the functional consequences of the reduced IB1 content in β cell lines, we used an insulin-secreting cell line expressing an inducible IB1 antisense RNA that lead to a 38% IB1 decrease. Reducing IB1 levels in these cells increased phosphorylation of c-Jun and increased the apoptotic rate in presence of IL-1β. Nitric oxide production was not stimulated by expression of the IB1 antisense RNA. Complementary experiments indicated that overexpression of IB1 in insulin-producing cells prevented JNK-mediated activation of the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF2, and Elk1 and decreased IL-1β- and ΔMEKK1-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that IB1 plays an anti-apoptotic function in insulin-producing cells probably by controlling the activity of the JNK signaling pathway.

Chronic exposure of pancreatic islets or of β-derived cell lines to IL-1β had been shown to lead to the selective death of the β cells, whereas non-β cells such as glucagon-producing cells appeared more resistant to the action of the cytokine (reviewed in Refs. 11.Mauricio D.

The molecular basis for the preferential killing of pancreatic β versus α cells by IL-1β is not fully understood. One important player in this phenomenon is the inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene iNOS, which is specifically expressed in the β cells upon IL-1β treatment (16.Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L.

A number of reports have indeed clearly shown that β cell apoptosis is NO-dependent (see for example two recent reports (21.Thomas H.E. Darwiche R. Corbett J.A. Kay T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1562-1569PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Grey S.T. Arvelo M.B. Hasenkamp W. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)). In line with this, pancreatic islets from iNOS KO mice show a better resistance to IL-1β cytotoxicity (23.Flodstrom M. Tyrberg B. Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).This NO-dependent killing of β cells has been, however, challenged by several reports pointing to the existence of NO-independent death signaling pathways (24.Delaney C.A. Pavlovic D. Hoorens A. Pipeleers D.G. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2610-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25.Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Rabinovitch A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5290-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, there is no direct correlation between expression of iNOS and sensitivity to IL-1β between β cells at different stages of differentiation (26.Nielsen K. Karlsen A.E. Deckert M. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Nerup J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2324-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, the iNOS inhibitor l-NMMA does not prevent IL-1β-induced β cell death in rat or human islets (24.Delaney C.A. Pavlovic D. Hoorens A. Pipeleers D.G. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2610-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25.Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Rabinovitch A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5290-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is also possible to block NO synthesis by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways, however, without any positive effect on cell survival (17.Larsen C.M. Wadt K.A. Juhl L.F. Andersen H.U. Karlsen A.E. Su M.S. Seedorf K. Shapiro L. Dinarello C.A. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15294-15300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).To better understand the molecular mechanisms that specifically sensitize β cells to IL-1β-induced death, we recently used two different subclones of the pluripotent pancreatic endocrine stem cell clone (MSL). The MSL AN697C1 subclone gave rise to two derived cell lines, namely the glucagon-secreting AN-glu, and after stable transfection with the transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1, the insulin secreting AN-ins (27.Serup P. Jensen J. Andersen F.G. Jorgensen M.C. Blume N. Holst J.J. Madsen O.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite having similar rates of NO synthesis, we found that the AN-ins cells were more susceptible to apoptosis elicited by IL-1β. The AN-ins cells show a markedly increased activation of JNK in response to IL-1β, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed difference in their IL-1β sensitivity. In these cell systems, we demonstrated that the two MAP kinases p38 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase were fully dispensable to promote the apoptotic response. In contrast, JNK activation is essential as blocking JNK with the use of the JNK binding domain (JBD) of JIP-1/IB1 (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) prevented apoptosis by more than 90%. 2A. Ammendrup, A. Oberson, K. Nielsen, N. Andersen, P. Serup, O. Madsen, T. Mandrup-Poulsen, and C. Bonny, submitted for publication. 2A. Ammendrup, A. Oberson, K. Nielsen, N. Andersen, P. Serup, O. Madsen, T. Mandrup-Poulsen, and C. Bonny, submitted for publication. Not only did JBD prevent apoptosis, but also a significant fraction of cells exposed to the cytokine were able to retain their ability to divide in culture.2Taken together, these data indicate that activation of the JNK pathway certainly plays an important role in IL-1β-mediated apoptosis. Because IL-1β is known to activate JNK through MKK7 in different cell lines and tissues (7.Cuenda A. Dorow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8.Finch A. Holland P. Cooper J. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9.Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10.Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) and because both kinases interact with the scaffold protein IB1, these data suggest that the control of the MKK7-JNK signaling pathway by IB1 may interfere with the response of cells activated by IL-1β. In this report, we specifically examined the role of IB1 in IL-1β-induced apoptosis in pancreatic β cell lines.DISCUSSIONWe showed herein that stress events decrease IB1 levels in insulin-producing cells. Our results using a cell line expressing IB1 antisense RNA indicate that this single event sensitizes cells to IL-1β-induced apoptosis without an increase in NO synthesis. Because IL-1β is recognized as one of the key mediators of pancreatic β cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes, we propose that the high amount of IB1 normally present in insulin-producing cells is a critical parameter that preserves cells from cytokine-induced destruction (Fig.8).The absence of increased NO production in response to IL-1β in the INS-1 AS7 relative to INS-1 CTR1 cells indicates that activation of other pathways is responsible for the higher apoptotic rate of this cell line. This does not preclude NO as a necessary mediator of apoptosis in this cell system. Indeed, INS-1 cells have been shown to be protected from the deleterious effects of IL-β by the iNOS inhibitor l-NMMA (39.Hohmeier H.E. Thigpen A. Tran V.V. Davis R. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Rather, these and previous data indicate that NO is not the only player mediating β cell apoptosis and that independent activation of JNK is also required.2In this sense, endogenous regulators of JNK may play a specific role in the development of β cell apoptosis.Our results indicate that IB1 plays an important role in limiting the effects of JNK signaling on the fate of insulin-producing cells. Three lines of evidences support this conclusion. First, decreasing IB1 levels with an antisense RNA sensitizes the INS AS7 cells to IL-1β-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). This effect is likely to result from an increased ability of JNK to phosphorylate its substrates including c-Jun (Fig. 7). Second, overexpression of IB1 protects pancreatic β cell lines against the two proapoptotic stimuli IL-1β and ΔMEKK1 (Fig. 2). This effect correlates with the ability of IB1 to block JNK-mediated activation of c-Jun and ATF2 (Fig. 4,A and B). Third, we found a correlation in INS-1 cells between the decrease in IB1 levels and the proapoptotic potential of the three cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ alone or in combination (Fig. 1 B).IB1/JIP-1 binds three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, which together constitute an ordered three-partite signaling module leading to activation of JNK. We described IB1 as being localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of pancreatic β cells (1.Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because IB1 is expressed at very high levels in pancreatic β cells compared with most other cell types, the high amount of IB1 in pancreatic β cells may exert a very stringent control on JNK signaling. High levels of IB1 may be expected to have negative effects on the ability of the JNK cascade to transmit signaling (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 3.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 5.Kim I.J. Lee K.W. Park B.Y. Lee J.K. Park J. Choi I.Y. Eom S.J. Chang T.S. Kim M.J. Yeom Y.I. Chang S.K. Lee Y.D. Choi E.J. Han P.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and in β cells, this may be accounted for by two distinct mechanisms. First, high amounts of IB1 may have a “dispersive” effect by favoring the formation of incomplete, nonproductive signaling complexes (i.e. complexes lacking either one of the three kinases that normally transmit signaling) (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 3.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). This situation occurs in experimental conditions like the transfection studies used in this study and as a result leads to uncoupling of JNK from its upstream activators MKK7 and MLK3. This leads to inefficient JNK activation that translates into low c-Jun, ATF2, or Elk1 phosphorylation (5.Kim I.J. Lee K.W. Park B.Y. Lee J.K. Park J. Choi I.Y. Eom S.J. Chang T.S. Kim M.J. Yeom Y.I. Chang S.K. Lee Y.D. Choi E.J. Han P.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Second, IB1 may have a “competitive” effect in the nucleus acting against the binding of c-Jun and ATF2 to JNK. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that IB1/JIP-1 binds ∼100-fold more tightly to the same domain of JNK than does c-Jun or ATF2 (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In conditions where most of the JNKs available in a cell would be bound to IB1, c-Jun and ATF2 would be efficiently prevented to interact with and to be activated by JNK. As a consequence, high amounts of IB1 may “route” JNK signaling toward factors, such as Elk1 that do not use a “JNK binding domain” similar to that of c-Jun, ATF2, or IB1 to become substrate of JNK (40.Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar,41.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Our data indicate that the near absence of c-Jun and ATF2 activation at late time points (3–6 h of IL-1β, Fig. 3 A) in whole cell lysates occurs despite a robust activation of JNK (Fig. 3 B). There is thus dissociation between JNK activation and c-Jun and ATF2 phosphorylation in these cells. Transient transfection experiments employing ΔMEKK1 indicate that only Elk1 is strongly activated by JNK, in contrast to c-Jun and ATF2 (Fig. 4 B). In control experiments performed with HeLa and Swiss 3T3 cells (which express only minute amounts of IB1), activation of the three factors reached similar high levels.3 Therefore in pancreatic β cells, JNK signaling appears to be “routed” preferentially toward Elk1 activation, and our data indicate that IB1 may play a role in this process (Figs. 4 B and 7). The selective activation of Elk1 in detriment to c-Jun and ATF2 is presumably not sufficient to induce apoptosis (42.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). If the model holds true, the observed IB1 decrease following JNK stimulation is therefore likely to represent an important control step to allow for the apoptotic response to develop (Fig. 8). The mechanisms by which the stability of IB1 is regulated by JNK is not known yet, but we may speculate that it involves a phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination process, as observed with other JNK targets (34.Fuchs S.Y. Xie B. Adler V. Fried V.A. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32163-32168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar).The critical role of IL-1β as mediator of pancreatic β cell death in type 1 diabetes is well recognized (12.Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 14.Mandrup-Poulsen T. Zumsteg U. Reimers J. Pociot F. Morch L. Helqvist S. Dinarello C.A. Nerup J. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our data have demonstrated the essential role that activation of the JNK pathway plays in IL-1β-induced β cell apoptosis.2 The intracellular events that transmit IL-1β signaling involve the sequential activation of the two kinases MKK7 and JNK (7.Cuenda A. Dorow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8.Finch A. Holland P. Cooper J. Saklatvala J. Kracht M.

These kinases are held together in a multiple protein complex by the scaffold protein IB1. Here, we have established that high expression of this scaffold protein in pancreatic β cells limits the output of JNK signaling toward apoptosis induced by IL-1β. As this protective effect may be attenuated following the observed decrease of IB1 in IL-1β-treated cells, our results may lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving IB1 function in pancreatic β cells. IB1/JIP-1 are recently characterized mammalian scaffold proteins involved in the regulation of the JNK1 signaling pathway (1.Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol.

Functionally, this mutation led to an increased susceptibility of JNK-mediated apoptosis in different cell systems, implying a presumably important functional role of IB1 in controlling the cell response to proapoptotic stimuli (6.Waeber G. Delplanque J. Bonny C. Mooser V. Steinmann M. Widmann C. Maillard A. Miklossy J. Dina C. Hani E.H. Vionnet N. Nicod P. Boutin P. Froguel P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interleukin 1 (IL-1β), which activates JNK essentially through the MKK7 pathway in several cells and tissues (7.Cuenda A.

Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), is believed to play a key role in the process of selective β cell destruction observed in type 1 diabetes. Chronic exposure of pancreatic islets or of β-derived cell lines to IL-1β had been shown to lead to the selective death of the β cells, whereas non-β cells such as glucagon-producing cells appeared more resistant to the action of the cytokine (reviewed in Refs. 11.Mauricio D.

The molecular basis for the preferential killing of pancreatic β versus α cells by IL-1β is not fully understood. One important player in this phenomenon is the inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene iNOS, which is specifically expressed in the β cells upon IL-1β treatment (16.Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L.

A number of reports have indeed clearly shown that β cell apoptosis is NO-dependent (see for example two recent reports (21.Thomas H.E. Darwiche R. Corbett J.A. Kay T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1562-1569PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Grey S.T. Arvelo M.B. Hasenkamp W. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)). In line with this, pancreatic islets from iNOS KO mice show a better resistance to IL-1β cytotoxicity (23.Flodstrom M. Tyrberg B. Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This NO-dependent killing of β cells has been, however, challenged by several reports pointing to the existence of NO-independent death signaling pathways (24.Delaney C.A. Pavlovic D. Hoorens A. Pipeleers D.G. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2610-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25.Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Rabinovitch A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5290-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, there is no direct correlation between expression of iNOS and sensitivity to IL-1β between β cells at different stages of differentiation (26.Nielsen K. Karlsen A.E. Deckert M. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Nerup J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2324-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, the iNOS inhibitor l-NMMA does not prevent IL-1β-induced β cell death in rat or human islets (24.Delaney C.A. Pavlovic D. Hoorens A. Pipeleers D.G. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2610-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25.Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Rabinovitch A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5290-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is also possible to block NO synthesis by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways, however, without any positive effect on cell survival (17.Larsen C.M. Wadt K.A. Juhl L.F. Andersen H.U. Karlsen A.E. Su M.S. Seedorf K. Shapiro L. Dinarello C.A. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15294-15300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular mechanisms that specifically sensitize β cells to IL-1β-induced death, we recently used two different subclones of the pluripotent pancreatic endocrine stem cell clone (MSL). The MSL AN697C1 subclone gave rise to two derived cell lines, namely the glucagon-secreting AN-glu, and after stable transfection with the transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor-1, the insulin secreting AN-ins (27.Serup P. Jensen J. Andersen F.G. Jorgensen M.C. Blume N. Holst J.J. Madsen O.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite having similar rates of NO synthesis, we found that the AN-ins cells were more susceptible to apoptosis elicited by IL-1β. The AN-ins cells show a markedly increased activation of JNK in response to IL-1β, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed difference in their IL-1β sensitivity. In these cell systems, we demonstrated that the two MAP kinases p38 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase were fully dispensable to promote the apoptotic response. In contrast, JNK activation is essential as blocking JNK with the use of the JNK binding domain (JBD) of JIP-1/IB1 (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) prevented apoptosis by more than 90%. 2A. Ammendrup, A. Oberson, K. Nielsen, N. Andersen, P. Serup, O. Madsen, T. Mandrup-Poulsen, and C. Bonny, submitted for publication. 2A. Ammendrup, A. Oberson, K. Nielsen, N. Andersen, P. Serup, O. Madsen, T. Mandrup-Poulsen, and C. Bonny, submitted for publication. Not only did JBD prevent apoptosis, but also a significant fraction of cells exposed to the cytokine were able to retain their ability to divide in culture.2 Taken together, these data indicate that activation of the JNK pathway certainly plays an important role in IL-1β-mediated apoptosis. Because IL-1β is known to activate JNK through MKK7 in different cell lines and tissues (7.Cuenda A. Dorow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8.Finch A. Holland P. Cooper J. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9.Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10.Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) and because both kinases interact with the scaffold protein IB1, these data suggest that the control of the MKK7-JNK signaling pathway by IB1 may interfere with the response of cells activated by IL-1β. In this report, we specifically examined the role of IB1 in IL-1β-induced apoptosis in pancreatic β cell lines. DISCUSSIONWe showed herein that stress events decrease IB1 levels in insulin-producing cells. Our results using a cell line expressing IB1 antisense RNA indicate that this single event sensitizes cells to IL-1β-induced apoptosis without an increase in NO synthesis. Because IL-1β is recognized as one of the key mediators of pancreatic β cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes, we propose that the high amount of IB1 normally present in insulin-producing cells is a critical parameter that preserves cells from cytokine-induced destruction (Fig.8).The absence of increased NO production in response to IL-1β in the INS-1 AS7 relative to INS-1 CTR1 cells indicates that activation of other pathways is responsible for the higher apoptotic rate of this cell line. This does not preclude NO as a necessary mediator of apoptosis in this cell system. Indeed, INS-1 cells have been shown to be protected from the deleterious effects of IL-β by the iNOS inhibitor l-NMMA (39.Hohmeier H.E. Thigpen A. Tran V.V. Davis R. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Rather, these and previous data indicate that NO is not the only player mediating β cell apoptosis and that independent activation of JNK is also required.2In this sense, endogenous regulators of JNK may play a specific role in the development of β cell apoptosis.Our results indicate that IB1 plays an important role in limiting the effects of JNK signaling on the fate of insulin-producing cells. Three lines of evidences support this conclusion. First, decreasing IB1 levels with an antisense RNA sensitizes the INS AS7 cells to IL-1β-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). This effect is likely to result from an increased ability of JNK to phosphorylate its substrates including c-Jun (Fig. 7). Second, overexpression of IB1 protects pancreatic β cell lines against the two proapoptotic stimuli IL-1β and ΔMEKK1 (Fig. 2). This effect correlates with the ability of IB1 to block JNK-mediated activation of c-Jun and ATF2 (Fig. 4,A and B). Third, we found a correlation in INS-1 cells between the decrease in IB1 levels and the proapoptotic potential of the three cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ alone or in combination (Fig. 1 B).IB1/JIP-1 binds three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, which together constitute an ordered three-partite signaling module leading to activation of JNK. We described IB1 as being localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of pancreatic β cells (1.Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because IB1 is expressed at very high levels in pancreatic β cells compared with most other cell types, the high amount of IB1 in pancreatic β cells may exert a very stringent control on JNK signaling. High levels of IB1 may be expected to have negative effects on the ability of the JNK cascade to transmit signaling (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 3.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 5.Kim I.J. Lee K.W. Park B.Y. Lee J.K. Park J. Choi I.Y. Eom S.J. Chang T.S. Kim M.J. Yeom Y.I. Chang S.K. Lee Y.D. Choi E.J. Han P.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and in β cells, this may be accounted for by two distinct mechanisms. First, high amounts of IB1 may have a “dispersive” effect by favoring the formation of incomplete, nonproductive signaling complexes (i.e. complexes lacking either one of the three kinases that normally transmit signaling) (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 3.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). This situation occurs in experimental conditions like the transfection studies used in this study and as a result leads to uncoupling of JNK from its upstream activators MKK7 and MLK3. This leads to inefficient JNK activation that translates into low c-Jun, ATF2, or Elk1 phosphorylation (5.Kim I.J. Lee K.W. Park B.Y. Lee J.K. Park J. Choi I.Y. Eom S.J. Chang T.S. Kim M.J. Yeom Y.I. Chang S.K. Lee Y.D. Choi E.J. Han P.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Second, IB1 may have a “competitive” effect in the nucleus acting against the binding of c-Jun and ATF2 to JNK. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that IB1/JIP-1 binds ∼100-fold more tightly to the same domain of JNK than does c-Jun or ATF2 (2.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In conditions where most of the JNKs available in a cell would be bound to IB1, c-Jun and ATF2 would be efficiently prevented to interact with and to be activated by JNK. As a consequence, high amounts of IB1 may “route” JNK signaling toward factors, such as Elk1 that do not use a “JNK binding domain” similar to that of c-Jun, ATF2, or IB1 to become substrate of JNK (40.Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar,41.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Our data indicate that the near absence of c-Jun and ATF2 activation at late time points (3–6 h of IL-1β, Fig. 3 A) in whole cell lysates occurs despite a robust activation of JNK (Fig. 3 B). There is thus dissociation between JNK activation and c-Jun and ATF2 phosphorylation in these cells. Transient transfection experiments employing ΔMEKK1 indicate that only Elk1 is strongly activated by JNK, in contrast to c-Jun and ATF2 (Fig. 4 B). In control experiments performed with HeLa and Swiss 3T3 cells (which express only minute amounts of IB1), activation of the three factors reached similar high levels.3 Therefore in pancreatic β cells, JNK signaling appears to be “routed” preferentially toward Elk1 activation, and our data indicate that IB1 may play a role in this process (Figs. 4 B and 7). The selective activation of Elk1 in detriment to c-Jun and ATF2 is presumably not sufficient to induce apoptosis (42.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). If the model holds true, the observed IB1 decrease following JNK stimulation is therefore likely to represent an important control step to allow for the apoptotic response to develop (Fig. 8). The mechanisms by which the stability of IB1 is regulated by JNK is not known yet, but we may speculate that it involves a phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination process, as observed with other JNK targets (34.Fuchs S.Y. Xie B. Adler V. Fried V.A. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32163-32168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar).The critical role of IL-1β as mediator of pancreatic β cell death in type 1 diabetes is well recognized (12.Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 14.Mandrup-Poulsen T. Zumsteg U. Reimers J. Pociot F. Morch L. Helqvist S. Dinarello C.A. Nerup J. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our data have demonstrated the essential role that activation of the JNK pathway plays in IL-1β-induced β cell apoptosis.2 The intracellular events that transmit IL-1β signaling involve the sequential activation of the two kinases MKK7 and JNK (7.Cuenda A. Dorow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8.Finch A. Holland P. Cooper J. Saklatvala J. Kracht M.

These kinases are held together in a multiple protein complex by the scaffold protein IB1. Here, we have established that high expression of this scaffold protein in pancreatic β cells limits the output of JNK signaling toward apoptosis induced by IL-1β. As this protective effect may be attenuated following the observed decrease of IB1 in IL-1β-treated cells, our results may lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving IB1 function in pancreatic β cells. We showed herein that stress events decrease IB1 levels in insulin-producing cells. Our results using a cell line expressing IB1 antisense RNA indicate that this single event sensitizes cells to IL-1β-induced apoptosis without an increase in NO synthesis. Because IL-1β is recognized as one of the key mediators of pancreatic β cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes, we propose that the high amount of IB1 normally present in insulin-producing cells is a critical parameter that preserves cells from cytokine-induced destruction (Fig.8).

These kinases are held together in a multiple protein complex by the scaffold protein IB1. Here, we have established that high expression of this scaffold protein in pancreatic β cells limits the output of JNK signaling toward apoptosis induced by IL-1β. As this protective effect may be attenuated following the observed decrease of IB1 in IL-1β-treated cells, our results may lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving IB1 function in pancreatic β cells. We are grateful to Christian Widmann for the generous gift of the ΔMEKK1 expressing plasmid and for helpful discussions."

Recently, oxidative stress was shown to activate transfected PKC isoforms via tyrosine phosphorylation, but PKD activation was not demonstrated. Here, we report that oxidative stress initiated by addition of H2O2 (0.15–10 mm) to quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts activates PKD in a dose- and time- dependent manner, as measured by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, syntide-2. Oxidative stress also activated transfected PKD in COS-7 cells but not a kinase-deficient mutant PKD form or a PKD mutant with critical activating serine residues 744 and 748 mutated to alanines. Genistein, or the specific Src inhibitors PP-1 and PP-2 (1–10 μm) inhibited H2O2-mediated PKD activation by 45%, indicating that Src contributes to this signaling pathway. PKD activation by H2O2 was also selectively potentiated by cotransfection of PKD together with an active form of Src (v-Src) in COS-7 cells, as compared with PDB-mediated activation. The specific phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122 partly blocked H2O2-mediated but not PDB-mediated PKD activation. In contrast, PKC inhibitors blocked H2O2 or PDB-mediated PKD activation essentially completely, suggesting that whereas Src mediates part of its effects via phospholipase C activation, PKC acts more proximally as an upstream activator of PKD. Together, these studies reveal that oxidative stress activates PKD by initiating distinct Src-dependent and -independent pathways involving PKC.

However, the mechanisms whereby ROS-induced signals are propagated to critical downstream targets remain largely undefined. Several laboratories have proposed that PKC may mediate some of the cellular effects of oxidative stress (15.Brawn M.K. Chiou W.J. Leach K.L. Free Radical Res. 1995; 22: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16.Whisler R.L. Goyette M.A. Grants I.S. Newhouse Y.G. Arch. Biochem.

Acta. 1995; 1269: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PKC is an enzyme of central importance in mammalian signal transduction (18.Weinstein I.B. Environ. Health Persp. 1991; 93: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). A family of PKC isoforms has been identified by molecular cloning techniques and grouped on the basis of differential regulation (20.Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 21.Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of classical (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, and θ) PKCs is stimulated either by diacylglycerol (DAG), which is synthesized rapidly in response to stimuli which activate phospholipase C/D enzymes (22.Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 23.Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), or by nonphysiological DAG analogues, such as the biologically active phorbol esters (19.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). The activity of the classic PKCs is also increased in response to elevations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In contrast, atypical (ι/λ and ζ) isoforms do not respond to DAG/phorbol esters or Ca2+ rises, but increase their activities in response to other lipids including products of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase activity (24.Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a variety of substrates and binding proteins have been identified as PKC-interacting targets, precise information regarding the flow of information through signal transduction pathways dependent on PKC isoforms remains incomplete. Recently, Nishizuka and co-workers (25.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) demonstrated that multiple PKC isoforms exhibit increases in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to oxidative stress and that these tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCs are persistently stimulated, remaining catalytically active in vitro in the absence of cofactors. The lack of lipid cofactor sensitivity exhibited by oxidative stress-activated PKCs implies that they may be conformationally distinct from allosterically activated PKCs and that their activities may not be membrane-delimited. Furthermore, activation of the PKCδ isoform by tyrosine phosphorylation altered its substrate selectivity toward exogenous substrates (26.Haleem-Smith H. Chang E.Y. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9112-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest the intriguing possibility that oxidative stress can influence the subcellular movements and/or substrate selectivity of PKCs. Interestingly, oxidative stress did not activate PKC-related kinases including protein kinase B/Akt/RAC kinase and protein kinase activated by nerve growth factor (25.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The recently identified protein kinase D (PKD, the murine homologue of human PKCμ) (27.Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) is a serine protein kinase with structural and enzymological properties distinct from those of all members of the PKC family (29.Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PKD consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain comprising a putative transmembrane domain, two cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs and a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain that is divergent from PKCs and catalyzes phosphorylation of distinct substrates. PKD catalytic activity can be stimulated directly in vitro by interaction of diacylglycerols or phorbol esters with the regulatory domain (30.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the enzyme is activated within cells via a PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway (31.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In intact Swiss 3T3 cells, either direct PKC stimulation by phorbol esters, membrane-permeant diacylglycerols, or bryostatin-1, or receptor-mediated stimulation with a variety of neuropeptides or PDGF, led to PKD conversion from a low catalytic state to an activated state that persisted during immunopurification and assay procedures (31.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 32.Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20245-20250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The specific PKC inhibitors, GF I and Ro 31-8220, completely block PKD activation during cell stimulation by all these factors (31.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, cotransfection of PKD together with active mutant forms of PKC ε and η dramatically increased PKD catalytic activity in the absence of cell stimulation (31.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and led to complex formation between PKD and PKCη (34.Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings, which were extended to a variety of tissues and cell types (35.Brooks G. Goss M.W. Rozengurt E. Galiananes M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2273-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 36.Abedi H. Rozengurt E. Zachary I.

Physiol. 2000; 278: C33-C39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a link between PKCs and PKD and implied that PKD lies downstream of PKC in a novel signal transduction pathway. However, the effects of oxidative stress on PKD activation remains unknown. Here we describe, for the first time, that cell treatments with H2O2 induces dramatic PKD activation. We also demonstrate, using specific inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases and by transfection experiments with v-Src, that this H2O2-mediated PKD activation is partially dependent on the activity of Src or a related tyrosine kinase. Our results suggest that oxidative stress activates PKD via signal transduction pathways utilizing Src, PLC, and PKC. The requirement for Src distinguishes oxidative stress-induced PKD activation from PKD activation mediated by PDB and by signaling from activated bombesin receptors. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. For experiments, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6–8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent. COS-7 cells were maintained in 10-cm tissue culture plates by subculturing every 3–4 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. For experimental dishes, confluent cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/ml in 6-cm dishes 8–18 h prior to transfections. Plasmid constructs encoding wild-type (30.Van Lint J.

Biol. 1985; 5: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) used in this study were described previously. All transfections and cotransfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA (5 μg/dish for single transfections, 3 μg of each DNA for cotransfections), using vector pcDNA3 as the control DNA added to single transfections. Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 10 μl/dish, added to cells in a final volume of 2.5 ml/dish following formation of DNA-Lipofectin complexes according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cultures, incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, were allowed to take up complexes in the absence of fetal bovine serum for 5–6 h or overnight, then fetal bovine serum (10% final concentration) in Opti-MEM was added to the dishes to yield a final volume of 5 ml/dish. Cells were used for experiments after another 72 h of incubation. For experimental treatments, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and oxidative stress was induced by addition of H2O2 in serum-free medium for times and at concentrations indicated in figures. Treatments were terminated by removing medium and addition of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) to cells on ice. These lysates were subjected to further analysis following immunoprecipitations or direct SDS-PAGE and Western analysis as described below. Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cell cultures or COS-7 cells either transfected with wild-type or mutant PKD or cotransfected with PKD forms together with v-Src were treated as indicated in figures, and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Small amounts (typically 1/10) of these total lysates were saved and combined with equal volumes of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.2 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) for Western blot analysis. PKD was isolated by immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 3 h using the PA-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution) raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the predicted C-terminal region of PKD, as described previously (30.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were recovered using protein A coupled to agarose. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Autophosphorylation reactions were initiated by combining 20 μl of immune complexes with 10 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/reaction diluted with cold ATP to give a final concentration of 100 μm) in kinase buffer. Reactions were transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min, then terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer and placed on ice. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted for SDS-PAGE analysis by addition of sample buffer. Dried SDS-PAGE gels were subjected to autoradiography to visualize radiolabeled protein bands. Quantitation of autoradiographic band intensities was performed using the Multi-analyst program (Bio-Rad) to measure optical densities of scanned autoradiograms. For assays of exogenous substrate phosphorylation, immune complexes were processed as for autophosphorylation reactions, then substrate peptide (syntide-2 at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) was added in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/reaction diluted with cold ATP to give a final concentration of 100 μm) in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 μl), and transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 75 mm H3PO4, and 75 μl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 μm H3PO4, dried, and radioactivity incorporated into peptides was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. For Western blot analysis, samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), as described previously (32.Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with antisera specifically recognizing PKD at a dilution of 1 μg/ml, or the phosphospecific pS916 recognizing PKD phosphorylated at serine 916 (1:500) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat dried milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequent enhanced chemiluminescence detection or125I-labeled protein A followed by autoradiography. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein A-agarose and AEBSF (Pefabloc) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antiserum (PKD C-20) used in Western blot analysis was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Palo Alto, CA). PP-1 and PP-2 were from Calbiochem. Opti-MEM and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were from standard suppliers or as described in the text, and were the highest grade commercially available. To examine whether oxidative stress induces PKD activation, confluent, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated for 15 min with serum-free medium containing 2.5 mmH2O2, a condition extensively used to induce oxidative stress in many systems (25.Konishi H.

As a positive control, parallel cultures were stimulated with 200 nm PDB for 10 min to maximally activate PKD. The cells were then lysed, and PKD was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the PA-1 antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with [32P]ATP and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to detect the 110-kDa band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In agreement with previous results, PKD exists in unstimulated Swiss 3T3 cells in a state of low catalytic activity, and stimulation with PDB induced dramatic (approximately 11-fold) PKD activation (Fig. 1 A). Shown here for the first time, exposure to H2O2 also produced robust PKD activation as measured by autophosphorylation. H2O2 treatment activated PKD by approximately 10-fold, or to 85% of the level measured after maximal stimulation by PDB (Fig. 1 A). As an independent measure of PKD activation induced by oxidative stress, we also examined phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate using syntide-2 (43.Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquet D.

Similar to previous results, immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells showed only a low basal activity to phosphorylate syntide-2, and those from PDB-stimulated cells showed increased activity. Consistent with the results of autophosphorylation assays, syntide-2 phosphorylation assays also showed that cells stimulated with H2O2 had dramatically increased PKD activity (Fig. 1 A). Recent studies have demonstrated that PKD participates in multiple protein-protein interactions (34.Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

To confirm that the activity observed in in vitro kinase assays was not due to the presence of a coimmunoprecipitating protein kinase, COS-7 cells transfected with either vector DNA or plasmids encoding either wild-type PKD or the kinase-deficient mutant PKD construct, PKD-K618M (31.Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.W. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), were stimulated with either H2O2 or PDB. Cells were then lysed and PKD was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and subjected to autophosphorylation assays. Transfected PKD was present within unstimulated cells in a state of very low catalytic activity and was activated by either PDB stimulation or H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, PKD activity in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with PKD-K618M was indistinguishable from that of vector-transfected controls (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis of transfected cell lysates revealed similar expression levels of PKD and PKD-K618M protein (data not shown). These results indicated that the phosphorylation activity induced by H2O2 was indeed due to PKD rather than to a co-immunoprecipitating protein kinase. Recently, an antiserum specifically recognizing the phosphorylated form of a PKD C-terminal residue, serine 916, was developed and used to detect in vivo autophosphorylation at this site by active PKD generated by PDB treatment of either transfected COS-7 cells or B lymphocytes or by antigen receptor engagement of lymphoid cell lines or primary T lymphocytes (37.Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, the pS916 antiserum provides a novel approach for detecting conversion of PKD to an active form within cells. Here, lysates from PKD-transfected COS-7 cells stimulated with either PDB or H2O2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using the pS916 antiserum (Fig.1 C). Consistent with previous results (37.Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the immunoreactivity of the PKD band increased dramatically following PDB treatments (Fig. 1 C). Stimulation with H2O2 also strongly increased the immunoreactivity of this band (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, results in Fig. 1 provide multiple lines of evidence indicating that oxidative stress induced by addition of H2O2 to serum-free medium in the absence of other factors strongly activates PKD either endogenously expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells or transfected into COS-7 cells. The effects of oxidative stress are known to be dependent on both the time of exposure and the oxidant concentrations to which cells are exposed. We therefore determined the extent of endogenous activation induced by exposure of confluent, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells to different doses of H2O2 for 10, 20, or 30 min, followed by lysis and autophosphorylation assays (Fig.2 A). The results presented in Fig. 2 A demonstrate that H2O2activated PKD in a dose-dependent manner during each of these different stimulation periods. Interestingly, the concentration of H2O2 required for PKD activation varied with the time of exposure. Whereas the half-maximal concentration for PKD activation by 10 min of stimulation was approximately 1.5 mm, that for activation after 20 min was reduced 10-fold to approximately 0.15 mm, and that for activation after 30 min was reduced further, to approximately 0.08 mm (Fig.2 A). These data revealed a concentration-dependent delay in activation, which may reflect the time required for effective concentrations of H2O2 to permeate the plasma membrane. We next examined the time course of activation in response to continuous stimulation by 2.5 mmH2O2. As shown in Fig. 2 B, activation occurred after a lag period of at least 5 min, reached maximal activity in approximately 10 min, and remained maximal for approximately 30 min, declining thereafter. To examine whether the continuous presence of H2O2 outside cells was necessary for activation, the cultures were exposed to H2O2 for 1 min, washed with fresh serum-free medium, and incubated in this medium for increasing periods of time prior to lysis, PKD immunoprecipitation, and autophosphorylation assays. As shown in Fig. 2 B, transient exposure to H2O2 was sufficient to induce maximal PKD activation that was more persistent than the continuous stimulation, remaining maximal for at least 1 h (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, the time-dependence of the H2O2 dose response and the lack of requirement for the continuous presence of H2O2 outside cells suggest that H2O2 mediates PKD activation only after permeating the plasma membrane. To further establish the role of ROS in activating PKD, we examined the ability of the ROS scavenging agent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to block H2O2-mediated activation in Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 3). Confluent, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cell cultures were stimulated with H2O2 ("

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying bile acid-mediated gene regulation using GADD153 as our model gene. Promoter deletion analyses revealed that the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor was crucial for deoxycholic acid (DCA)-mediated GADD153 gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfection analyses demonstrated that both DNA binding and transactivation activities of AP-1 were induced by DCA in a dose-dependent manner. The AP-1 complex induced by DCA consisted of JunD, Fra-1, and c-Fos. Examination of the signaling pathways stimulated by DCA showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) were required for AP-1 activation. Inhibition of ERK by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 or by expression of a dominant negative mutant ERK suppressed AP-1 activation. Notably, the PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, also abolished DCA-induced AP-1 activation but did not affect DCA-mediated ERK activation, suggesting that ERK and PKC function in separate signaling pathways that cooperatively mediate DCA-induced AP-1 activation. Hence, bile acid-stimulated signaling appears to converge on the AP-1 protooncogene.

The primary bile acids, cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, are synthesized in the liver and are excreted into the duodenum where they facilitate absorption of dietary lipids. Most of these bile acids are reabsorbed in the intestine; however, a small quantity remains unabsorbed and passes into the colon where it is converted to secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and lithocholic acids, by enteric bacteria. These secondary bile acids, particularly deoxycholic acid (DCA),1 have been linked to colon cancer. Comparison of populations with diverse eating habits have shown that consumption of a high fat/low fiber diet leads to elevated fecal concentrations of secondary bile acids, which is associated with an increased incidence of colon cancer (1.Armstrong B. Doll R. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). However, the most compelling data implicating bile acids in colon tumorigenesis come from animal studies where manipulation of fecal bile acid concentrations, in conjunction with carcinogen treatment, leads to increased tumor formation (2.Cohen B.I. Raicht R.F. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 3759-3760PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Reddy B.S. Lipids. 1992; 27: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Importantly, bile acids by themselves cannot induce colon tumors, indicating that bile acids function as tumor promoters rather than complete carcinogens. However, the mechanism of this tumor promoter activity is unknown. Although there is some evidence that bile acids may induce DNA damage (4.Cheah P.Y. Bernstein H. Cancer Lett. 1990; 49: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5.Kandell R.L. Bernstein C. Nutr. Cancer. 1991; 16: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), because of the inability of bile acids to initiate tumorigenesis by themselves, the general consensus is that bile acids are contributing to colonic carcinogenesis by disturbing the fine balance between proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the colonic epithelial cells (6.Hague A. Elder D.J. Hicks D.J. Paraskeva C. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Instead, it has been suggested that bile acids act by modifying intracellular signaling and gene expression, perhaps by altering the activity of protein kinase C (PKC). PKC is a group of important signaling molecules consisting of at least 11 isozymes. These PKC isotypes are subdivided into three groups: the conventional PKC members (cPKCs), the novel PKCs (nPKCs), and the atypical PKCs. PKC plays key roles in the regulation of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, tumor promotion, and apoptosis (7.Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that bile acids activate PKC in both normal colonic epithelial cells and colon tumor cell lines (8.Huang X.P. Fan X.T. Desjeux J.F. Castagna M. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9.Craven P.A. Pfanstiel J. DeRubertis F.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, several genes, such as cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, major histocompatibility complex class I, and cyclooxygenase-2, are regulated by bile acids through activation of PKC (10.Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 1359-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Hirano F. Tanaka H. Makino Y. Okamoto K. Inaba M. Miura T. Makino I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Hence, activation of PKC and modification of signal transduction and gene expression appears to be an important aspect of the effect of bile acids in tumor promotion. The purpose of this study was to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying bile acid-stimulated gene expression. Promoter deletion analyses were performed on the GADD153 (growtharrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153) promoter, which we previously showed, was inducible by DCA (13.Zheng Z.Y. Bernstein C. Payne C.M. Martinez J.D. Gerner E.W. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar). We found that an activator protein-1 (AP-1)-binding site was crucial for activation of the GADD153 promoter by DCA. Further examination demonstrated that activation of both PKC and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) were required for DCA-induced AP-1 activation. Importantly, these two kinases appear to regulate the activity of two distinct signaling pathways that converge on AP-1. Hence, bile acids can stimulate signaling through at least two different pathways that regulate the activity of AP-1 proteins. p5W1, a human GADD153 promoter-CAT reporter gene construct, was kindly provided by Dr. Nikki J.

Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). LipofectAMINE and enzymes including restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Acetyl-CoA and the sodium salts of cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), DCA, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) were from Sigma. All of the bile acids were maintained as 100 mmstock solutions in water. Calphostin C, PD 98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone), and SB 202190 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole) were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and were maintained as stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. All stock solutions were stored at −20 °C except for acetyl-CoA aquatic solution, which was stored at −70 °C. Serial and internal deletions of human GADD153 promoter region in p5W1 (−954 to +91) were performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. For serial deletion, a common downstream primer and several upstream primers located at different positions on the GADD153 upstream region were designed for corresponding promoter-reporter gene constructs as follows: downstream primer, 5′-TACCAAGCTTCTCCTCAGGTTCCAGCTC-3′ (+91 to +72); upstream primers, pGC10 5′-TACGATCGATGATAGCCGTTGGGGCCGT-3′ (−437 to −418); pGC20 5′-TACCATCGATCGCATGACCTCACCCACCTC-3′ (−247 to −229); pGC70 5′-TACCATCGATCCCACCTCCTCCGTGAAG-3′ (−237 and −220); pGC30 5′-ATCCATCGATCCGACACTACGTCGACC-3′ (−192 to −174); and pGC40 5′-TACGATCGATGGTAAAAGATTACAGCCAGG-3′ (−34 to −13). The PCR reactions were performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.75, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 ng of BamHI linearized p5W1, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μm 5′- and 3′- primers, 5% Me2SO, and 0.5 units of clonedPfu DNA polymerase. The following cycling program was used: 94 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 40 s, 50∼55 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 1–2 min for 20 cycles and then 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were cloned into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II SK (±) (Stratagene product), and the sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The amplified promoter fragments were excised from pBluescript and inserted into pGC0, a control plasmid for CAT assay that was made by excision of the whole GADD153 upstream sequence between ClaI and HindIII (−954 to +91) from p5W1. One of the serial deletion constructs, p5W1CX1, was generated by removal of the 5′-terminus of GADD153 upstream region (−954 to −650) from p5W1 by digestion and religation atClaI and XhoI sites. In construction of the internal deletion constructs, following PCR primers were synthesized and used in combination with some of the primers used in serial deletion to amplify the promoter fragments and construct the promoter-CAT reporter gene constructs with a procedure similar to that described above: 5′-TACCGATATCGTTTGGCAACCGGTGTCTG-3′ (−311 to −329); 5′-TACCGATATCCCCGCCCCCCTTTCC-3′ (−301 to −285); 5′-TACCATCGATGGTGAAACGTAGTCTCGCTC-3′ (−954 to −933); 5′-TACCGATATCGCCTTGGTCGCCCCTAG-3′ (−438 to −454); and 5′-TACCGATATCGCGCGCGGAGGGGAG-3′ (−248 to −263). These constructs include: (i) pGC15.60, where only the putative C/EBP site at −310 was deleted from pGC10 (−310 to −302); (ii) pGC15.70 and pGC85.70, the DNA fragment between −237 and −248 containing both the putative C/EBP and AP-1-binding sites was deleted from pGC10 and p5W1, respectively; and (iii) pGC89.40 and pGC110.40, the DNA fragments deleted in pGC10 (−954 to −438) and deleted in pGC20 (−437 to −248) were liked to the minimal promoter fragment in pGC40, respectively. For pGC211.40, 54 base pairs of the GADD153 promoter fragment (−247 to −194) containing an AP-1-binding site was amplified by PCR from p5W1 using the following primers: upstream primer, 5′-TACCATCGATCGCATGACCTCACCCACCTC-3′ (−247 to −229) and downstream primer: 5′-TACCGATATCCCGGAAGTGGCTTTGGGT-3′ (−194 to −212). After cloning and sequencing, the DNA fragment was linked to the GADD153 minimal promoter in pGC40 that contains only a TATA box and the transcription start site. PGC0 was used as a negative control plasmid in all transfection assays. All these constructs were transiently transfected into HCT116 cells, and the cellular CAT activities were assayed. The basal activities of the deletion constructs were expressed relative to p5W1, and the induction ratios for indicated treatments were expressed relative to untreated controls. HCT116, a cell line derived from an adenocarcinoma patient with Lynch's syndrome, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an incubator containing 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were grown to 80–95% confluency. Treatment of the cells with bile acids and PKC or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors was performed by pretreating the cells with the inhibitors for 30 min prior to addition of bile acids. Transient transfection was conducted by cationic lipid-mediated DNA transfection using LipofectAMINE. In brief, 3 × 105HCT116 cells were seeded in a 35-mm dish and cultured for about 48 h when the cells reached 50–70% confluency. The cells were washed with serum/antibiotic-free DMEM medium prior to transfection. 1 μg of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent diluted in 100 μl of serum/antibiotic-free DMEM medium, respectively, were mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. After adding 0.8 ml of serum/antibiotic-free DMEM medium, the lipid·DNA complex was placed onto the cells. The transfection was performed at 37 °C in the incubator with 5% CO2 for 5 h. After transfection, the lipid·DNA complex was replaced with fresh culture medium with or without the reagents as indicated for designed treatments to the cells. The cells were then cultured for another 12 h before harvest. Stable transfection of HCT116 cells with pCMV-p41(Ala54Ala55)MAPK or the vector plasmid pCMV-BamH-neo was performed by a calcium phosphate precipitation method (17.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). The stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418, and individual clones were subcultured. CAT assays using [14C]chloramphenicol were performed essentially as described in Ref. 17.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar. The spots of 14C-labeled chloramphenicol and acetylated chloramphenicol were visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The percentage of conversion of chloramphenicol to the acetylated form was calculated and normalized to protein content. Control or treated HCT116 cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 (at 4 °C), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 15 min, and the nuclear pellet resuspended in one-half volume of low salt buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9 (at 4 °C), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.02 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Nuclear proteins were extracted by dropwise addition of high salt buffer (the composition is the same with the low salt buffer except substituting 1.0 m KCl for 0.02 mKCl) and subsequent incubation on ice for 30 min with gentle agitation. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C for 1.5 h against the dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 (at 4 °C), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The proteins and/or nuclear acids precipitated during the dialysis were then removed by microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 20 min. The nuclear protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Gel shift assays were performed with 5 μg of nuclear protein extract and 10 ng of [α-32P]dATP end-labeled double strand 19-mer oligonucleotides containing the AP-1-binding site TGACTCA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element) and the flanking sequence in human GADD153 promoter (5′-TTGCGCATGACTCACCCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGGGTGAGTCATGCGCAA-3′ (antisense)) (14.Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G. Fargnoli J. Fornace Jr., A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in a 15–20-μl reaction mixture. Briefly, 5 μg of the nuclear protein extract was preincubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the dialysis buffer at room temperature (20 °C) for 10 min, and then 10 ng of the32P-labeled double strand probe was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For supershift assays, 450 ng of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against various Fos and Jun proteins (Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Nm23-H1 as control were added to the binding reaction after the 30-min incubation at room temperature. Samples were then incubated for an additional 60 min at room temperature. In the competition experiment, 1-, 50-, or 100-fold excess unlabeled double strand oligonucleotides with the intact 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element or mutated 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (5′-TTGCGCAgGtCTCACCCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGGGTGAGaCcTGCGCAA-3′ (antisense)) were added to the reaction mixture along with the labeled probe. Samples were subjected to nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 4% gels. The gels were dried, and protein·DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. 50 μg of the total cellular protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels. Western blot analyses for expression and activation of MAPKs were performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERK, p38, and JNK or the corresponding phospho-specific antibodies, which recognize activated phosphorylated MAPK isoforms (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA) and Luminol ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize the specific immunocomplexes. Total cellular RNA was isolated from treated and untreated HCT116 cells using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred onto BiotransTM nylon membrane (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH). The human GADD153 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by nick translation and hybridized separately with the RNA blot at 68 °C in 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.25m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The membrane was washed after hybridization for 30 min twice in 1 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 68 °C. GADD153 has been characterized as a stress response gene that is activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents and physiological stresses (18.Luethy J.D. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5-10PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous study, we found that the GADD153 promoter responded to DCA induction in a dose-dependent manner (13.Zheng Z.Y. Bernstein C. Payne C.M. Martinez J.D. Gerner E.W. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis also showed a dose-dependent significant induction of GADD153 mRNA by DCA in HeLa cells and human colon tumor cell lines, such as HCT116 cells (data not shown). The mRNA induction became to be evident by 2∼4 h and increased along with further exposure of the cells to 200∼500 μm DCA. These results indicate that GADD153 gene could be transcriptionally regulated by bile acids. These features make GADD153 an ideal model gene to explore the molecular mechanism and signal transduction underlying bile acid-mediated gene regulation. To identify the bile acid response elements in the GADD153 promoter, serial and internal deletions of the promoter were constructed and linked to a CAT reporter gene (Fig.1 A). The reporter constructs were transiently transfected into HCT116 cells and either basal activity (Fig. 1 B) or DCA-inducible activity quantified. Although serial deletion resulted in a progressive reduction in basal activity, DCA inducibility of the constructs remained relatively constant until the 190 base pairs between −437 and −247 were deleted from pGC10 to generate pGC20. Eight-fold induction was observed using pGC20, whereas constructs containing the C/EBP element within this region were ∼4-fold or less (Fig. 1 C). This C/EBP-binding site was previously implicated by Sylvester et al. (19.Sylvester S.L. ap Rhys C.M. Luethy-Martindale J.D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20119-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as being an important regulatory element in the GADD153 promoter. To further elucidate the role of this element, the construct pGC15.60 was generated from pGC10, which lacked the nine base pairs of consensus C/EBP-binding sequence (5′-ATTGCATCA-3′). Transient transfection experiments using this construct showed a dramatic increase in basal activity of the promoter and a moderate increase in DCA inducibility. This suggested that the C/EBP-binding site might be a constitutive repressor of GADD153 promoter activity. None of the DNA sequence between −954 and −248, including the C/EBP-binding motif could confer DCA inducibility when linked to a basal promoter (Fig. 1 C, pGC89.40 and pGC110.40). Hence, C/EBP appears to repress the GADD153 promoter. The effect of DCA on this transcription factor remains to be determined. Other elements in the GADD153 promoter acted as positive regulators. In this regard we noted that deletion of 55 base pairs (−247 to −192) from pGC20 to generate pGC30 resulted in a marked decrease in DCA inducibility, dropping from ∼8-fold induction to ∼4-fold induction (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, splicing this region onto pGC40, which did not respond to DCA, restored DCA inducibility (Fig. 1 C, pGC211.40). Although there is a putative Ets1-binding site located within 40 base pairs of the AP-1-binding site, it is unlikely that this element contributes to GADD153 activation because pGC30, which does not contain this element, exhibits the same degree of activation as pGC70 which does contain the Ets1 element. However, the fact that both of these deleted promoters exhibit moderate DCA inducibility suggests that an additional positive regulatory element was located nearer to the transcription start site. There are several Sp1 consensus binding sites that may be responsible for this activity. This notion is based on the observation that pGC30 remains sensitive to stimulation by DCA and that both pGC15.70 and pGC85.70 exhibited similar moderate basal activity and similar DCA fold induction despite deletion of both the C/EBP- and AP-1-binding sites. We concluded that the major regulatory elements resided between −437 and −34 and that the important sequences likely included binding sites for the C/EBP and AP-1. Sp1 may also contribute to activation of the GADD153 promoter. Our GADD153 promoter deletion experiments showed that the AP-1-binding site at −243 (5′-TGACTCA-3′) functioned as a DCA-inducible positive regulatory element. To explore this further we investigated the effect of DCA on both DNA binding and transactivation activities of AP-1. HCT116 cells were treated with different concentrations of DCA for 4 h, nuclear protein extracts were prepared, and mobility shift assays were performed using 19-mer double-strand radiolabeled GADD153 promoter sequence containing the AP-1-binding site as a probe. An AP-1·DNA complex was found in untreated cells and significantly stimulated by DCA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). Time course analysis (Fig. 2 B) showed that the AP-1 DNA binding activity was stimulated as early as 2 h after treatment with 250 μm DCA and that the response reached a maximum by 4 h. Subsequently, the AP-1 DNA binding activity declined. Specificity of the protein/DNA interaction was confirmed by competition assays with the wild type and mutated probes (Fig. 2 C). In the mutated probe, two base pairs of mutation were made within the consensus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (20.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar) as shown under “Materials and Methods.” 50- or 100-fold excess unlabeled wild type probe caused a significant reduction in DNA binding, whereas the same concentrations of mutated probe had little or no effect. The specificity of the AP-1 DNA binding was further confirmed by supershift assays using anti-Fos and anti-Jun antibodies as discussed later (see Fig. 4). These results indicated that AP-1 DNA binding activity specific to the consensus AP-1-binding site on the GADD153 promoter was significantly induced by DCA in a dose- and time-dependent manner.Figure 4DCA-induced AP-1 complex consists of JunD, Fra-1, and c-Fos in HCT116 cells. 5 μg of nuclear protein extract prepared from the HCT116 cells treated with 250 μm DCA for 4 h was subjected to supershift assays. The nuclear proteins were incubated for 30 min with radiolabeled GADD153 AP-1 probe, and then 450 ng of each antibodies against various Fos or Jun proteins as indicated were added. Incubation was continued for an additional 60 min. Controls were incubated with or without (Control) 450 ng of the antibodies specific for Nm23-H1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether DCA induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity correlates with functional activation of AP-1, pGC211.40, which contains the human GADD153 AP-1-binding sequence linked to the minimal GADD153 promoter driving a CAT reporter gene, was transiently transfected into HCT116 cells. The transfected cells were treated with increasing doses of DCA (Fig. 2 D). CAT activity from pGC211.40 was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that DCA not only stimulated AP-1 DNA binding activity but also induced AP-1 transactivation. It has been suggested that different bile acids have different biological effects on cell growth (21.Martinez J.D. Stratagoules E.D. LaRue J.M. Powell A.A. Gause P.R. Craven M.T. Payne C.M.

Hepatol. 1998; 13: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For example, DCA and CDCA function as tumor promoters, which accelerate carcinogen-induced tumor formation and cell transformation, whereas UDCA acts as a chemopreventive agent, which suppresses cell proliferation and colon tumor development. CA has no discernible biological effect on cells. In previous studies, we found that different bile acids exhibited distinct biological effects on the HCT116 cell growth, i.e. DCA and CDCA inhibited cell growth by inducing apoptosis, whereas UDCA inhibited cell proliferation but did not induce apoptosis (21.Martinez J.D. Stratagoules E.D. LaRue J.M. Powell A.A. Gause P.R. Craven M.T. Payne C.M. Powell M.B. Gerner E.W. Earnest D.L. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 31: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We reasoned that different bile acids might have differing effects on AP-1 activity. To examine the effects of different bile acids on AP-1 activation, we treated HCT116 cells with four different bile acids for 4 h at 250 μm. AP-1 DNA binding activity was examined by gel shift assays (Fig. 3 A). Notably, DCA and CDCA caused a significant induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity, but UDCA and CA did not. The corresponding AP-1 transactivation induction assays were also conducted using pGC211.40 in HCT1"

By using human components, we have evaluated how binding to the lipoyl domains of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) produces the predominant changes in the rates of phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component by PDK2 and PDK3. E2 assembles as a 60-mer via its C-terminal domain and has mobile connections to an E1-binding domain and then two lipoyl domains, L2 and L1 at the N terminus. PDK3 was activated 17-fold by E2; the majority of this activation was facilitated by the free L2 domain (half-maximal activation at 3.3 μm L2). The direct activation of PDK3 by the L2 domain resulted in a 12.8-fold increase in k catalong with about a 2-fold decrease in the K m of PDK3 for E1. PDK3 was poorly inhibited by pyruvate or dichloroacetate (DCA). PDK3 activity was stimulated upon reductive acetylation of L1 and L2 when full activation of PDK3 by E2 was avoided (e.g.using free lipoyl domains or ADP-inhibited E2-activated PDK3). In marked contrast, PDK2 was not responsive to free lipoyl domains, but the E2–60-mer enhanced PDK2 activity by 10-fold. E2 activation of PDK2 resulted in a greatly enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by pyruvate or DCA; pyruvate was effective at significantly lower levels than DCA. E2-activated PDK2 activity was stimulated ≥3-fold by reductive acetylation of E2; stimulated PDK2 retained high sensitivity to inhibition by ADP and DCA. Thus, PDK3 is directly activated by the L2 domain, and fully activated PDK3 is relatively insensitive to feed-forward (pyruvate) and feed-back (acetylating) effectors. PDK2 was activated only by assembled E2, and this activated state beget high responsiveness to those effectors.

The fractional PDC activity is set by the competing steady state activities of two classes of dedicated enzymes, the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP). These highly regulated enzymes catalyze the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively, of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component of PDC (1.Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl.

The availability of the individual PDK isoforms allows determination of their unique functional and regulatory properties, a step toward understanding how the required tissue-specific regulation of PDC activity is achieved.

When fatty acid oxidation is not used by a tissue or when glucose is being converted to fatty acids, the activity of PDC must be regulated very differently. Consequently, PDC limits the nearly exclusive use of glucose as an oxidative energy source in neural tissues and facilitates the conversion of glucose to fatty acids in adipose tissue when there is surplus glucose. Thus, it seems likely that different PDK (and PDP) isoforms have developed to meet the distinct tissue-specific and metabolic state-specific requirements for proper tuning of PDC activity. Variation in the distribution of specific mRNAs for the PDK isoforms supports this conclusion (22.Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 23.Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem.

The organization of PDC plays an important role in supporting PDC activity and in the regulation of PDC by PDKs and PDPs. The core structure of PDC is formed by association of 60 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) subunits. E2 is a segmented protein with four domains connected by mobile linker regions (25.Thekkumkara T.J. Ho L. Wexler I.D. Pons G. Lui T.-C. Patel M.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26.Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Twenty trimers of the C-terminal inner domain of E2 assemble at the vertices of dodecahedron; these trimers catalyze the transacetylation reaction (27.Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28.Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24650-24656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Via linker regions, this inner core domain is first connected to an E1-binding domain and then two lipoate-bearing domains, an inner domain (L2) and an N-terminal domain (L1). The dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase-binding proteins (E3BP) has a similar segmented structure (29.Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Wu P. Jeng J. Popov K.M. J. Biol.

E3BP then contains an E3-binding domain and a lipoyl domain (designated L3) set off by linker regions. The assembled E2-E3BP are estimated to bind 6–12 E3 and 20–30 E1 α2β2 tetramers (3.Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Bovine PDK and PDP activities have also been shown to be markedly enhanced via binding to this central E2-E3BP core structure via the lipoyl domain region of E2 (30.Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S.

By using recombinant constructs of the L1 and L2 domains of E2, unspecified isoforms of bovine PDK were shown to bind preferentially to the L2 domain via an interaction that requires the lipoyl prosthetic group (36.Liu S.

Here we begin the characterization of purified human PDKs and evaluate the functional activation and the changes in regulatory properties of two kinase isoforms, PDK2 and PDK3, as a result of their specific interactions with the lipoyl domains of human E2 and human E3BP. Our ability to produce individual lipoyl domains and E2–60-mer structures with or without E3BP allow us to sort the direct effects of individual lipoyl domains and unique contributions of the assembled complexes to activated PDK function and regulation.

Pyruvate and ADP, serving as signals indicating abundant substrate and low energy, act synergistically to inhibit PDK activity by direct binding to PDKs (44.Hucho F. Randall D.D. Roche T.E.

By using an all human system, we establish that marked changes in catalytic efficiency and effector responsiveness of human PDK2 and PDK3 occur as a consequence of their association with E2. Recombinant human E2, K46AE2, and K173AE2 were prepared as described previously (37.Yang D. Gong X. Yakhnin A. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Homogeneous lipoyl domain constructs were prepared in a fully lipoylated state either as free domains or fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) as described elsewhere (49.Liu S. Baker J.C. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by log phase expression in Escherichia coli BL21 that prevented modifications of the lipoyl domains introduced by E. coliJM109 (33.Gong X.

The lipoyl domain constructs of E2 used include the following: outer lipoyl domain, L1; inner lipoyl domain, L2; bilipoyl structure, L1-L2; and the lipoyl domain of E3BP, designated L3. The specific design for constructing, expressing, and preparing purified GST-L3 and, from this, preparing free L3 (residues 1–98) will be described elsewhere.2 Porcine heart E3 and thrombin were from Sigma, [γ-32P]ATP from NEN Life Science Products, and TALON affinity purification resin fromCLONTECH. Human E3 expression system was provided by M. Patel, and human E3 was prepared as described previously (50.Liu T.-C. Korotchkina L.G. Hyatt S.L. Vettakkorumakankav N.N. Patel M.S. J. Biol.

PreScission protease is a product of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; BL21(DE3) E. coli and pET28a vector were obtained from Novagen. GroESL plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony Gatenby at DuPont (51.Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Synthetic DNA was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA. The cloning vectors harboring the human PDK2 and PDK3 cDNA inserts were a kind gift from Kirill M. Popov and Robert A. Harris (6.Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28989-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For PDK2, PCR was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using primers that produced a 1.2-kilobase pair product encoding mature PDK2 with a 5′ NheI site and a 3′ HindIII site introduced. The product was ligated into pET28a vector at the NheI andHindIII sites using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) by standard procedures (52.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The resulting plasmid was co-transformed along with a plasmid encoding GroEL and GroES into E. coliBL21(DE3) made competent by the method of Inoue et al. (53.Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Selection for the presence of both plasmids was done on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The pET28a vector provides a start codon and encodes an N-terminal polyhistidine sequence followed by a sequence encoding a thrombin cleavage site. Along with this construct, which provided high quality PDK2, a second expression vector was constructed in which the thrombin cut site coding region was replaced by a region coding for the PreScission protease cleavage site. This was made by removing DNA from the plasmid between NcoI and NdeI sites and replacing it with a synthesized DNA segment to encoding a cut site specific for human rhinovirus 3C protease (54.Cordingley M.G. Callahan P.L. Sardana V.V. Garsky V.M. Colonno R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9062-9065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For construction of PDK3 expression plasmid, a 270-base pair PCR fragment was generated using primers that matched the 5′SacI site at the beginning of the mature sequence and a 3′BamHI site matching the unique internal BamHI site in PDK3 cDNA. This PCR-amplified region of PDK3 was then recovered and used as a template for a second round of PCR that changed the 5′ restriction site to NheI and maintained the 3′BamHI site. After restriction treatment, this was ligated with the remaining PDK3 coding region produced by digestion withBamHI and XhoI and pET28a plasmid opened fromNheI to XhoI sites. This was followed by transformation and subsequent re-engineering, as described for PDK2, to produce two expression vectors, one encoding a thrombin cut site and the other a PreScission protease site, with each expressing N-terminal polyhistidine tags. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing performed by the Automated Sequencing Facility at Kansas State University. PDK plasmid-containing bacteria were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 ≈0.6) in LB media containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Then expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 22–24 °C for 16 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and frozen at −80 °C. Following thawing, bacterial pellets were resuspended to 10% (w/v) in HN buffer (20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol). Ice water-cooled suspensions were sonicated by six repetitions of 50% pulsing at 250 watts for 30 s followed by at least 1 min of cooling. Supernatants were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and Pluronic-F68 was added to the supernatant to a level of 0.1% (w/v). 1 ml of equilibrated TALON resin was added per 50 ml of supernatant, and this suspension was gently mixed for 60 min at 4 °C. The mixture was transferred to a column, and the gel resin was washed first with 4 column volumes of HN buffer + 0.1% Pluronic-F68 + 20 mmimidazole and then with 3 column volumes of HN buffer containing 0.1% Pluronic-F68 plus 25 mm imidazole. PDK was then eluted with buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. PDK containing fractions were pooled, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and either 50 units of thrombin plus 2 mm Ca2+ or 100 units of PreScission protease were added for a 1- or a 3-h incubation on ice, respectively. Following thrombin digestion, EGTA was added to 2 mm and glycerol was then added to 20%. Following PreScission protease digestion, protease was removed by passing the mixture through a column with 0.25 ml of GSH-Sepharose equilibrated with HG buffer (16 mm Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Pluronic F-68, 1% ethylene glycol, 20% glycerol). PDK preparations were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with HG buffer for PDK2 and HG buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl for PDK3. PDK preparations were stored unfrozen at −20 °C. Final PDK recovery was typically 5–10 mg per liter of bacterial growth media for PDK2 and 2–4 mg per liter of growth media with PDK3. Much greater purity was obtained using the Co2+-containing Talon system than with nickel-affinity columns. PDKs were stored for over 9 months in an unfrozen state at −20 °C with <30% loss of activity. However, aged preparations of PDK3 needed to be preincubated with E2 at 4 °C for 60 min to exhibit maximal activity. PDK2 could be concentrated to >10 mg/ml, whereas PDK3 had to be maintained at <0.3 mg/ml to avoid development of insoluble aggregates. PDK activity was measured in duplicate as the initial rate of incorporation of [32P]phosphate into E1 (42.Ravindran S. Radke G.A. Guest J.R. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

We cloned cDNA and genomic DNA encoding a chicken HDAC, chHDAC-3, which was localized in both the nuclei and cytoplasm in DT40 cells. Although one of the two chHDAC-3 alleles could be disrupted with high efficiency, no homozygous mutants were obtained after a second round of the gene-targeting technique due to its necessity for DT40 cells. We introduced a chHDAC-3 transgene under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter into the heterozygous mutant and subsequently disrupted the remaining endogenous chHDAC-3 allele to generate the homozygous chHDAC-3-deficient mutant, ΔchHDAC-3/FHDAC3. Inhibition of the expression of the regulatable chHDAC-3 transgene caused apoptotic cell death of the mutant. Complementation experiments involving truncated and missense chHDAC-3 mutant proteins revealed that the 1–23 N-terminal sequence, the 389–417 C-terminal sequence, the nuclear export signal, and the deacetylation activity of chHDAC-3 were essential for the cell viability. Taken together, these results indicate that chHDAC-3 plays an essential role, probably as a scavenger in the cytoplasm, in the proliferation of DT40 cells.

The molecular mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression through alterations in the chromatin structure have been rapidly elucidated in eukaryotes. The chemical modification of core histones with acetyl groups has been thought to be of fundamental importance as to conformational changes of the chromatin (1.Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R.

The level of acetylation is related to transcriptional activity, and the acetylation induces an open chromatin conformation that allows the transcription machinery access to promoters. The acetylation of core histones is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs),1 which are homologs of yeast Gcn5p (general controlled nonrepressed protein) (1.Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A.

Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), which are homologs of yeast Rpd3, which negatively regulates the global expression of genes (13.Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol.

In higher eukaryotes, Mad-Max heterodimers require the interaction of Mad with mSin3, the mammalian homolog of Sin3, to repress transcription (14.Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L.

The transcriptional corepressors SMRT and N-CoR act as silencing mediators for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (19.Alland L. Muhle R. Hou Jr H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. Depinho R.A.

Transcriptional repression by nuclear receptors is mediated by a complex containing SMRT or N-CoR, mSin3, and HDAC. Mammalian HDAC-1 is recruited by the retinoblastoma protein to repress transcription (22.Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

These results therefore indicate that a complex containing HDAC deacetylates nucleosomal core histones, producing alterations in the chromatin structure that block transcription. It has been reported that multiple forms of HDACs exist like HATs, there being at least three human HDACs (12.Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings led us to expect that HDAC family members each play an individual, particular role and then participate in combination with one another and/or with HAT family members in the acetylation of core histones, which is related to transcriptional activity. To understand the overall picture of transcription regulation through the formation of (and/or alterations in) the chromatin structure based on the acetylation of core histones, it should be essential to determine the role of each of the multiple HDACs and HATs in vivo. The DT40 chicken B cell line incorporates foreign DNA by means of targeted integration at frequencies similar to those for random integration at a number of different genomic loci, including the histone gene cluster (27.Takami Y. Nakayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28.Takami Y. Nakayama T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29.Takami Y. Takeda S. Nakayama T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using the conventional gene targeting technique, we generated two homozygous DT40 mutants, ΔchHDAC-1 and -2 devoid of two alleles of chHDAC-1 and -2 (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Systematic analyses of the mutants obtained led us to some noticeable conclusions as follows. The protein patterns on two-dimensional PAGE were obviously changed for ΔchHDAC-2, but the changes were insignificant for ΔchHDAC-1. In particular, the amounts of IgM H- and L-chains increased in the former mutant. Furthermore, of the two forms of the IgM H-chain, the secreted form increased, but the membrane-bound form decreased. Interestingly, the IgM H-chain gene was transcribed more in ΔchHDAC-2 than in DT40 cells. The alternative processing of IgM H-chain pre-mRNAs preferentially occurred in the mutant, resulting in increases in the amounts of secreted-form mRNAs. Thus, chHDAC-2 dually controls the amounts of the secreted-form IgM H-chain at the steps of both the transcription of its gene and the switch from membrane-bound form to secreted form mRNAs, probably through alterations in the chromatin structure restricted to narrow regions surrounding the IgM H-chain gene and putative switch-related factor gene(s), which should be due to the remaining acetyl groups of particular Lys residue(s) of core histones. Most or all of the specific functions of chHDAC-2 can not be compensated for by any other chHDACs, including chHDAC-1, all of which should be different from the former in substrate specificity,i.e. in core histone subtypes, histone variants, or deacetylatable Lys residues. The difference in the functions of chHDAC-1 and -2, i.e. in the participation in the accumulation of the IgM H-chain (and IgM L-chain), should be due to the difference in their C-terminal regions of approximately 50 amino acids, where the two enzymes exhibit relatively low homology (∼50%), although they show extensive homology (∼95%) in the remaining regions of approximately 430 amino acids. Our previous screening of both DT40 cDNA and genomic DNA libraries revealed not only that there was another form of chHDAC, but also that it differed remarkably in size from both chHDAC-1 and -2, suggesting that the novel chHDAC enzyme should be different in function from these two enzymes. In this study, therefore, we first cloned cDNA and genomic DNA encoding the remaining chHDAC, designated as chHDAC-3, which was localized in both the nuclei and cytoplasm. The HDAC activity in the chHDAC-3 immunoprecipitate was abolished by treatment with TSA. Using the conventional gene targeting technique, we could easily generate a heterozygous chHDAC-3-deficient mutant but not a homozygous one, indicating that chHDAC-3 is essential for DT40 cells. Next, we generated a homozygous chHDAC-3-deficient mutant, ΔchHDAC-3/FHDAC3, carrying a chHDAC-3 transgene, encoding FLAG-tagged chHDAC-3 under the control of a tetracycline (tet)-responsive promoter. The inhibition of the expression of the chHDAC-3 transgene caused the slow growth of ΔchHDAC-3/FHADC3 before dying. Complementation experiments, involving truncated or missense chHDAC-3 mutant proteins, revealed that the N-terminal region, the C-terminal region, the proper nuclear export signal, and the deacetylation activity of chHDAC-3 are necessary for the specific function of the enzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that chHDAC-3 is essential for the viability of the DT40 cell line. To obtain full-length chHDAC-3 cDNA using the resultant chHDAC-related PCR product as a probe, we screened a DT40 λ ZAP II cDNA library, as described (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The entire sequences of both strands of the full-length cDNA were sequenced by the dye terminator method (Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin-Elmer). Using chHDAC-3 cDNA obtained as a probe, genomic DNA specific for chHDAC-3 was isolated on the screening of a DT40 genomic DNA library in a λ phage, as described (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The organization of the resultant genomic DNA was determined by the PCR-sequencing protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two blunt-ended cassettes carrying neo and hisD (30.Hartman S.C. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8047-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), transcribed by the chicken β-actin promoter (31.Fregien N. Davidson N. Gene. 1986; 48: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32.Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene. 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), were obtained as described (33.Seguchi K. Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30664-30670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using these cassettes, we generated targeting vectors for the disruption of chHDAC-3, as follows. To obtain the pΔchHD-3/neo or pΔchHD-3/hisD construct, we replaced the genomic sequence between exons 5 and 6 of chHDAC-3 with the neo- or hisD-carrying cassette. Namely, the 1.5-kb upstream sequence generated by PCR with the genomic clone as a template was ligated to the 5′-end of the cassette carrying neo or hisD, followed by ligation of the 1.7-kb HincII/BglII fragment derived from downstream of exon 6 of the gene to the 3′-end of either cassette. Probe A was the 1.8-kb BamHI fragment derived from intron 2 of chHDAC-3. Probes B and C were derived from neo and hisD, as described (33.Seguchi K. Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34.Takami Y. Takeda S. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30664-30670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To construct the ptetFHDAC3 vector expressing FLAG-tagged chHDAC-3 under the control of the tet operator (tetO) and cytomegalovirus minimal promoter, the PCR-amplified cDNA product encoding FLAG epitope-tagged chHDAC-3 was inserted into the pUHD13–3 plasmid (35.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), and concurrently its constituent luciferase gene was replaced. To obtain the ptTA-bleo construct, a cassette of the bleomycin-resistant gene driven by the β-actin promoter was inserted into the pUHD15–1 plasmid, which contains the tet transactivator gene, controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter (35.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). For the complementation assay, we generated chHDAC-related expression vectors as follows. To obtain the HA-tagged chHDAC-1, -2, or -3 expression plasmid, each of three HA-tagged full-length chHDAC cDNAs was generated by PCR and then inserted into pApuro (36.Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Various 5′- and 3′-truncated fragments of chHDAC-3 were generated by PCR and cloned into pApuro to obtain their HA-tagged expression plasmids. Single missense mutations (H135A, H193F, and Y404F) or a double missense mutation (L29I,L31M) was generated with a Quick ChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pβHAHDAC3 (the HA-tagged chHDAC-3 expression plasmid obtained above) as a template. All gene constructs were verified by sequencing. The details of the plasmid constructs are available on request. DT40 cells and all subclones were cultured essentially as described (37.Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 38.Takami Y.

Transfection by the electroporation method was carried out essentially as described (34.Takami Y. Takeda S. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30664-30670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37.Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S.

Drug-resistant colonies were selected on 96-well plates in medium containing appropriate concentrations of several drugs, i.e. 2 mg of G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.)/ml, 0.3 mg of phleomycin (Sigma)/ml, 0.8 mg of histidinol (Sigma)/ml, or 0.4 μg of puro (Sigma)/ml. To suppress the expression of the tet-responsive FHDAC3 transgene, deoxycycline (tet) (Sigma) was added at the concentration of 100 ng/ml. To generate antiserum against chHDAC-3, the cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal region of amino acids 363–428 of chHDAC-3 was subcloned into the pGEX-2T plasmid (CLONTECH) in-frame, and then the chHDAC-3 C-terminal peptide-GST fusion protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli, extracted, and purified to more than 95% homogeneity. According to a standard immunization protocol, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized, and then preimmune and immune sera were collected. To remove the anti-GST antibodies, the crude antiserum was passed through a column of GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads. To avoid the cross-reaction with chHDAC-1 and -2, the anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum was successively passed through columns of chHDAC-1 and -2 C-terminal peptide-GST-conjugated glutathione-agarose beads (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106) were lysed in 200 μl of SDS buffer, and then aliquots (20 μl) of the resultant cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane filter as described (40.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filter was probed with a 1/1000 dilution of anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum, anti-FLAG antiserum (Sigma), or anti-HA antiserum (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by the addition of a 1/1000 dilution of secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako)). As a control, the preimmune serum was used at a 1/1000 dilution. The signal was detected with a Super Signal Ultra (Pierce). Genomic DNAs were digested with the indicated enzymes, separated in a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane, and then hybridized with 32P-labeled probe A, B, or C, as described (41.Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar). A radioimmunoprecipitation experiment was performed as described (42.Blackwood E.M. Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 107) were metabolically labeled for 1 h with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys and then lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Aliquots (500 μl) of the cell extract obtained were incubated with anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum (10 μl) in either the presence or absence of 5 μg of the chHDAC-3-related fusion protein and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose 4FF beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in SDS buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then examined by autoradiography. The in vitro HDAC activity in the immunoprecipitate obtained with anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum was assayed essentially as described (12.Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Cells (4 × 107) were lysed in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and then aliquots (500 μl) of the extract were immunoprecipitated and washed with HD buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol). The resultant immunocomplex was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μg (5 × 104 dpm) of acid-soluble histones isolated from [3H]acetate-labeled DT40 cells. The released [3H]acetic acid was extracted with ethyl acetate and then measured. Pretreatment of the immunoprecipitated sample with 100 nm TSA was performed for 2 h at 4 °C before the addition of the labeled histones. To determine the HDAC activity of various chHDAC-3 mutant proteins, plasmids expressing them were transiently transfected into COS7 cells. After transfection for 36 h, the cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation. A portion of each of the supernatants obtained was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antiserum as mentioned above to determine the amounts of the chHDAC-3-related recombinant proteins. The remainder of each of the supernatants was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), and then the HDAC activity in the immunoprecipitate was assayed as described (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An immunofluorescence microscopy involving anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (NEN Life Science Products). DT40 subclones on slides were fixed in 4% formalin. The primary antibody (affinity-purified rabbit anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum) was incubated at 1:20 dilution, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) as a secondary antibody at 1:1000 dilution. After incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated thyramide (NEN Life Science Products), the cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated thyramide-labeled chHDAC-3 and nuclei were examined by fluorescence microscopy. At the indicated times, cells were labeled with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min, and then the resultant cells (1 × 106) were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C (or for a few days at −20 °C), and analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting Vantage instrument (Becton-Dickinson) as described (43.Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Fluorescence data were displayed as dot plots using the Cell Quest software (Becton-Dickinson). To determine the ability of chHDAC-3 or its derivatives to rescue the tet-induced lethality of ΔchHDAC-3/FHDAC3 (cl 18-tet2-5), a complementation assay was carried out essentially as described (44.Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The mutant cells (1 × 107) were transfected with pβHAHDAC3 or its derivatives for 24 h and then split into two portions. One portion was incubated in 96-well microtiter plates with medium containing 0.4 μg of puro/ml to determine the frequency of transfection, and the other was incubated in 96-well microtiter plates with medium containing 0.4 μg of puro/ml plus 100 ng of tet/ml. After incubation for 10 days, the numbers of surviving colonies were determined. The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper has been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession number AF039753. To identify the chicken HDACs as novel enzymes, we have cloned and sequenced their cDNAs. Forty-one clones, obtained in our previous screening using the HDAC-related PCR product of a DT40 cDNA library, were classified into three groups based on their restriction enzyme patterns. The two largest cDNA inserts of two of the three groups appeared to contain the full-length sequences of two different chicken HDAC cDNAs, chHDAC-1 and -2 (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the largest cDNA insert of the remaining group, designated as clone 24, revealed that it contained both an initiation codon and a 3′ poly(A) tail and, thus, appeared to contain the full-length sequence of another chicken HDAC cDNA. The amino acid sequence deduced from its nucleotide sequence is shown together with those of human and mouse HDAC-3s, yeast Rpd3, and chHDAC-1 and -2 in Fig.1. The protein encoded by clone 24 comprises 428 amino acids including a putative initiation Met and exhibits approximately 97% identity in amino acid sequence to human and mouse HDAC-3s. Thus, this protein is the chicken HDAC-3 homolog and is designated as chHDAC-3. Compared with chHDAC-1 and -2, chHDAC-3 lacks 6–7 amino acids and approximately 50–60 amino acids at its N-terminal and C-terminal ends. In addition, within the considerably constant background in the corresponding regions of the three chicken enzymes, chHDAC-3 is noticeably different from the other two, especially in the N-terminal region of approximately 140 amino acids and the C-terminal region of approximately 100 amino acids. As described previously (26.Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have isolated two different genomic DNAs specific for chHDAC-1 and -2. Further detailed analysis involving the PCR method followed by sequencing revealed not only that another genomic DNA obtained was specific for chHDAC-3 but also that it comprised 14 exons and was 15 kb in length (see the middle panel of Fig. 3 A). Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that the 5′-upstream region of the gene was rich in GC, and typical TATA boxes were not observed in the region (data not shown). Western blotting using anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum against the recombinant chHDAC-3 C-terminal peptide (of amino acids 363–428)-GST fusion protein, which was absorbed with C-terminal regions of chHDAC-1 and -2, revealed a protein of 45 kDa (p45) in DT40 cells (Fig. 2 A). The radioimmunoprecipitation experiment, after labeling with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, also revealed the p45 protein in the immunoprecipitate with anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum (Fig.2 B). The block + (Fig. 2 B) experiment established that the 45-kDa protein did not appear when anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum was preincubated with the chHDAC-3 C-terminal peptide-GST fusion protein. Moreover, no other polypeptides co-precipitated specifically with anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum were present in the chHDAC-3 immunoprecipitate. Next, we examined whether or not the HDAC activity was present in the chHDAC-3 immunoprecipitate prepared from DT40 cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 2 C, as expected, this immunocomplex exhibited significant HDAC activity compared with the precipitate with the control preimmune antiserum. To confirm the HDAC activity in the immunoprecipitate, we examined the influence of TSA. Treatment with TSA reduced the enzyme activity to a background level, indicating that the activity is really due to chHDAC-3. In the immunofluorescence microscopy involving anti-chHDAC-3 antiserum we examined the subcellular localization of chHDAC-3 in DT40 cells. As shown in upper panels 1 and 2 of Fig.2 D, chHDAC-3 was localized in both nuclei and the cytoplasm, although both chH"

Although GluRδ2 belongs to an ionotropic GluR family, little is known about its pharmacological features and downstream signaling cascade. To study molecular mechanisms underlying GluRδ2-dependent motor learning, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate GluRδ2-interacting molecules and identified protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPMEG. PTPMEG is a family member of band 4.1 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases and is expressed prominently in brain. Here, we showed by in situhybridization analysis that the PTPMEG mRNA was enriched in mouse thalamus and Purkinje cells. We also showed that PTPMEG interacted with GluRδ2 as well as with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor GluRε1 in cultured cells and in brain. PTPMEG bound to the putative C-terminal PDZ target sequence of GluRδ2 and GluRε1 via its PDZ domain. Examination of the effect of PTPMEG on tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 unexpectedly revealed that PTPMEG enhanced Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 in its PTPase activity-dependent manner. Thus, we conclude that PTPMEG associates directly with GluRδ2 and GluRε1. Moreover, our data suggest that PTPMEG plays a role in signaling downstream of the GluRs and/or in regulation of their activities through tyrosine dephosphorylation.

Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar). The GluR channel family can be divided into seven subfamilies according to the primary structure and pharmacological feature. For example, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptors that are formed by two or more of the four α subunits are sensitive to α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate.N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, consisting of heterooligomers of one or two ζ subunit(s) and two or three ε subunits, are sensitive to NMDA. Regarding the δ subfamily, both the pharmacological and structural features remain to be understood (2.Mayat E. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GluRδ2 subunit is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, specifically at the synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells (3.Araki K. Meguro H. Kushiya E. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Mishina M. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 4.Takayama C. Nakagawa S. Watanabe M. Mishina M. Inoue Y. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 92: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This restricted expression pattern suggests that the GluRδ2 subunit plays an important role in cerebellum-dependent motor learning. A study with GluRδ2 knock-out mice revealed that GluRδ2 is crucial in the synapse formation between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells, switching of climbing fiber innervation from multiple to mono-innervation, LTD induction, and motor coordination (5.Kashiwabuchi N. Ikeda K. Araki K. Hirano T. Shibuki K. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Kutsuwada T. Yagi T. Kang Y. et al.Cell. 1995; 81: 245-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition, the phenotype of Lurcher mice, which is characterized by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, is caused by a point mutation in the third transmembrane domain of GluRδ2 (6.Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to define the pharmacological feature of GluRδ2 and GluRδ2-mediated signaling. Intensive studies in the last decade have revealed that protein phosphorylation is one of the most important mechanisms regulating synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. For example, induction of LTP/LTD at the CA1 region of the hippocampus is regulated by calmodulin kinase II and calcium-calmodulin dependent phosphatase (calcineurin) activities (7.Lisman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Recently, tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src family PTKs was also reported to be involved in synaptic plasticity and downstream signaling subsequent to GluR activation (8.Hayashi T. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1999; 397: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9.Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W.

However, in contrast to Ser/Thr phosphatases, little is known about how PTPases might function in GluR signal transduction. PTPMEG (11.Gu M.X. York J.D. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The band 4.1 domain is considered to be responsible for targeting proteins to the cytoskeleton-membrane interface. Consistently, PTPMEG is associated with membrane structures in cells (15.Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are present in some scaffold proteins and recognize C-terminal end (S/T)X(V/L/I) sequences (16.Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

Because of segment-specific expression of PTPH1 in diencephalon, PTPH1 is suggested to play a crucial role in thalamocortical connections (19.Sahin M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Gusella J.F. Hockfield S.

Here, we report that PTPMEG interacts with GluRδ2 and GluRε1. Moreover, our study suggests involvement of PTPMEG in the function of GluRδ2 and GluRε1 subunits. Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using the L40 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes HIS3 and β-galactosidase under the control of upstream LexA-binding sites.

We utilized the cDNA encoding rat NR2A instead of mouse GluRε1 to construct the expression plasmid of GluRε1 (24.Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To prepare the FLAG epitope-tagged GluRδ2 (GluRδ2FLAG) deletion mutants, GluRδ2 cDNA was inserted in-frame with the oligonucleotides encoding a FLAG epitope sequence DYKDDDDK between amino acid residues 51 and 52. To prepare the HA epitope-tagged GluRε1 (GluRε1HA) deletion mutants, GluRε1 cDNA was inserted in-frame with the oligonucleotides encoding a HA epitope sequence YPYDVPDYASL between amino acid residues 56 and 57. For the constructs of the expression vectors of deletion mutants, the cDNA fragments encoding PTPMEG and GluRδ2FLAG deletion mutants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction techniques.

In short, the cDNA fragments corresponding to the N terminus proximal region of mouse PTPMEG (amino acids 11–142) was amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pBluescript II vector. After confirming the DNA sequence, we generated antisense and sense cRNA probes from the plasmid by in vitro transcription in the presence of [35S]UTP. Parasagittal sections of brain (a thickness of 10 μm) were prepared from C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 17 (P17). cRNA probes (about 107 cpm) were applied to each slide for hybridization. Coverslip slides were then incubated overnight in humidified chambers at 55 °C. After washing, slides were air-dried and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film for 5 days. The emulsion radioautogram was done for 4 weeks. Rabbit anti-PTPMEG polyclonal antibodies were raised against the GST mouse PTPMEG (amino acids 436–926) and affinity purified. Rabbit anti-GluRδ2 polyclonal antibodies were raised against GST-GluRδ2 (amino acids 852–931) and affinity purified. Rabbit anti-PSD-95 polyclonal antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were raised against the GST-human PSD-95 (amino acids 1–45) and affinity purified.

Anti-PY (4G10) monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-influenza HA monoclonal antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. 293T cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under 37 °C, 5% CO2 condition. 293T cells (1 × 106/10-cm dish) were transfected with combinations of expression plasmids (total, 20 μg) by the standard calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 145 mmNaCl) containing 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μm Pefabloc SC (Merck). Insoluble fraction was excluded by centrifugation at 15 Krpm for 20 min. Total cell lysates (TCLs) were boiled in the presence of sample buffer. Affinity purified antibodies (1–3 μg) were added to the precleared cell lysates to obtain protein immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitates and TCL were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gel) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST solution for 2 h at room temperature and treated with primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Renaissance Plus reagent (NEN Life Science Products) were used to visualize the immunoreactive proteins. Isolation of subcellular fractions of brain was performed as described previously (31.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (total protein, 15 μg) of fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For immunoprecipitation, cerebella or telencephalons from 12–18-week-old C57BL/6 or GluRδ2 knock-out mice were homogenized with 10 volumes (v/w) of homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μm Pefabloc SC). The synaptosome and mitochondria fractions were prepared as described previously (31.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and were lysed in 1% deoxycholate buffer (32.Roche K.W. Ly C.D. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of proteins from the lysates was performed as described above. To identify GluRδ2-interacting molecules, we employed yeast two-hybrid system using the C terminus proximal residues of GluRδ2 (amino acids 922–1007) as a bait (Fig.1 A). We screened approximately 106 yeast transformants and obtained six positive clones that activated expression of selection markers His3 and LacZ. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that they encoded a GTPase exchange factor, three PTPases, and two PDZ containing-scaffold proteins that did not belong to the PSD-95 family. One of the PTPase-encoding clones carried a sequence for C-terminal two-thirds of PTPMEG (Fig. 1 B). PTPMEG belongs to a family of intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases that contain a band 4.1 domain, a PDZ domain, and a catalytic PTP domain (Ref. 11.Gu M.X. York J.D. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5867-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and Fig.1 B). PTPMEG is expressed highly in brain (15.Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTPMEG may have important functions in the central nervous system. To confirm the interaction between GluRδ2 and PTPMEG, 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged PTPMEG and/or GluRδ2 expression plasmids, and then protein lysates were prepared from the transfected cells. By probing the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates of the lysates with anti-GluRδ2 or anti-Myc antibody, we showed that GluRδ2 co-precipitated with Myc-tagged PTPMEG only when both proteins were expressed (Fig. 1 C, left panel). Conversely, PTPMEG was present in the GluRδ2 immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 C, right panel), indicating that PTPMEG associated with GluRδ2 in heterologous 293T cells. Previous reports indicated that expression of GluRδ2 was confined to cerebellar Purkinje cells (3.Araki K. Meguro H. Kushiya E. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Mishina M. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast, the precise distribution of PTPMEG in brain remained to be established. Because GluRδ2 immunoreactivity in cerebellum increased dramatically during synaptogenesis (postnatal 2–3 weeks) (2.Mayat E. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we compared expression pattern of PTPMEG with that of GluRδ2 in brain during this same stage of development. Using the cRNA probes corresponding to mouse PTPMEG (amino acids 11–142), we performed in situ hybridization analysis of P17 mouse brain parasagittal sections (Fig.2 A). The antisense probe showed intense signals in the thalamus and the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Moderate signals were detected in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, and weak signals were detected broadly. No specific hybridization was detected using the sense cRNA probe (data not shown). Dark and bright field photomicrographs of cerebellum revealed that the PTPMEG mRNA was abundant in Purkinje cells (Fig.2, B and C). These data suggested co-expression of GluRδ2 and PTPMEG mRNA in Purkinje cells during synaptogenesis, which was consistent with our observation that GluRδ2 interacted with PTPMEG. We also detected abundant PTPMEG mRNA in the regions of the anterior nucleus and the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The molecules that would interact with PTPMEG in these regions have not been known. GluRδ2 subunits are targeted to the postsynaptic fraction of Purkinje cells (4.Takayama C. Nakagawa S. Watanabe M. Mishina M. Inoue Y. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 92: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To compare the subcellular localization of PTPMEG with that of GluRδ2 in the neural cells, we prepared subcellular fractions of adult mouse cerebellum and telencephalon and performed immunoblot analysis (33.Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C. DeSouza S. Abagyan R. Valtschanoff J.G. Weinberg R.J. Ziff E.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 35.Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, PTPMEG was present in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction where glutamate receptors were concentrated (upper panel). PTPMEG in the PSD fraction was about 3% of PTPMEG in the total soluble fraction. Note that the proteins in the PSD fraction prepared as above corresponded to about 0.5% of total soluble proteins. The validity of subcellular fractionation was proved by immunoblotting the proteins in the subcellular fractions with antibodies against various brain specific proteins such as GluRδ2, GluRε1, PSD-95, and synaptophysin (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether GluRδ2 and PTPMEG interact in cerebellum, anti-GluRδ2 immunoprecipitates from cerebellar lysates were probed with anti-PTPMEG antibodies. The data clearly showed that PTPMEG was co-precipitated with GluRδ2 (Fig. 3 B). In reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-PTPMEG immunoprecipitates from cerebellar lysates were probed with anti-GluRδ2 antibodies. The data showed that anti-PTPMEG immunoprecipitates contained GluRδ2. To identify the amino acid sequences responsible for the interaction between GluRδ2 and PTPMEG, we constructed deletion mutants of PTPMEG and GluRδ2 (Fig. 4, A andB), and combinations of GluRδ2 and PTPMEG constructs were transfected into 293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the lysates of the transfectants showed that wild-type PTPMEG and its mutants containing the PDZ domain, except mutant “e” interacted with wild-type GluRδ2 (Fig. 4 C). It is likely that the sequence between the band 4.1 domain and the PDZ domain had an inhibitory effect on the interaction when exposed at the N terminus. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also revealed that removal of the putative PDZ target sequence Thr-Ser-Ile from the C terminus of GluRδ2 and the point mutation at the C terminus (Ala-1007 instead of Ile-1007) abolished interaction between the two proteins (Fig.4 D). Thus, we concluded that at least some PTPMEG proteins were co-localized with GluRδ2 and that these two proteins interacted with each other in brain. Our present data suggest that PTPMEG associates directly with the putative C-terminal PDZ target sequence of GluRδ2 via its PDZ domain. Because the Ser-Asp-Val sequence of the C terminus of GluRε1 is a typical target of the PDZ domain, GluRε1 may also interact with PTPMEG. To examine this possibility, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged PTPMEG and/or GluRε1, and the lysates of the transfectants were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation experiments. By probing anti-Myc immunoprecipitates with anti-GluRε1 or anti-Myc antibodies, we showed that GluRε1 co-precipitated with Myc-tagged PTPMEG only when both proteins were expressed (Fig.5 A). To demonstrate the interaction between GluRε1 and PTPMEG in brain, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the lysates from mouse telencephalons. As shown in Fig. 5 B, we detected PTPMEG in the anti-GluRε1 immunoprecipitates (left panel) and GluRε1 in the anti-PTPMEG immune-complex (right panel). The data suggested that PTPMEG interacted with GluRε1 in vivo. To address the mechanism of the interaction, we expressed various PTPMEG mutants (Fig. 4 A) together with GluRε1 in 293T cells. From the lysates of the transfectants, we could co-immunoprecipitate GluRε1 with wild-type PTPMEG and with mutants that carried the PDZ domain (Fig. 5 D). Mutant e of PTPMEG, which did not interact with GluRδ2, could associate with GluRε1. We do not have good explanation for this observation. However, it is possible that the three-dimensional structure around the C terminus of GluRε1 is different from that of GluRδ2, which could cause different affinities of mutant e construct to the GluRs. In reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments with various HA-tagged GluRε1 mutants (Fig. 5 C), we could detect wild-type GluRε1 and its mutants containing the C-terminal PDZ target sequence in the PTPMEG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 E). Furthermore, the point mutant of the C terminus of GluRε1 (GluRε1HA-V1464A) did not associated with PTPMEG in 293T cells. Thus, we conclude that the PDZ domain of PTPMEG and the C terminus of GluRε1 are critically important for the interaction between PTPMEG and GluRε1. Because the biochemical and pharmacological features of NMDA receptors had been better characterized than those of GluRδ2, we decided to explore the biological significance of PTPMEG-GluRε1 interaction. We first examined the effect of PTPMEG on tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1. Because PTPMEG has PTPase activity, we expected that PTPMEG might compete with Fyn in tyrosine phosphorylating GluRε1. To test this possibility, the expression vectors encoding constitutively active Fyn (FynF) and/or PTPMEG were transfected into 293T cells together with GluRε1, and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 was examined. Unexpectedly, coexpression of PTPMEG enhanced Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 (Fig.6). Furthermore, coexpression of PTPase inactive mutant of PTPMEG (termed PTPMEG-DA) did not increase Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1. We also showed that the PTPase active mutant (Fig. 4 A, construct f) facilitated phosphorylation of GluRε1 more effectively than wild-type PTPMEG. These data showed that PTPMEG enhanced Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 in a PTPase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, introduction of the V1464A point mutation of GluRε1 significantly reduced Fyn-mediated GluRε1 phosphorylation in the presence of PTPMEG. Because the GluRε1 mutant was unable to interact with PTPMEG, the data supported our conclusion that Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 was enhanced by the interaction between PTPMEG and GluRε1. A slight enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of the GluRε1 mutant observed in the presence of PTPMEG could be due to nonspecific microenvironmental changes induced by the phosphatase activity. The overall level of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the cells expressing GluRε1, FynF in the presence of PTPMEG was significantly lower than that in the absence of PTPMEG (data not shown), suggesting that PTPMEG was active in the cells. Moreover, the effect of PTPMEG on tyrosine-phosphorylation of GluRε1 was not caused by the further activation of FynF, because in vitro kinase assays showed that the activity of FynF was not dependent on the PTPase activity of PTPMEG (data not shown). In this report, we have shown that a protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPMEG interacts with GluRδ2 as well as GluRε1 both in vivo and in vitro. The interaction is mediated by the PDZ domain of PTPMEG and the C-terminal PDZ target sequences of these GluRs. Because the C termini of the four GluRε subunits contain Glu-Ser-(Asp/Glu)-Val sequences, we assume that all of them would interact with PTPMEG. In fact, we observed the interaction between PTPMEG and GluRε2 in 293T cells (data not shown). Both the GluRε subunits and GluRδ2 also bind to other PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as PSD-95 family proteins (16.Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 17.Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Roche K.W. Ly C.D.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). These proteins are thought to be important to localize the GluR subunits to the postsynaptic cell membrane, serving as scaffold proteins. Unlike these, PTPMEG is a catalytical protein associated with PTPase activity. Therefore, the biological significance of its interaction with GluRs ought to be distinct from the scaffold function. We showed here that PTPMEG stimulated Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 in a manner dependent on its PTPase activity. Although we previously reported that PSD-95 could stimulate Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 (24.Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms of stimulation mediated by PSD-95 and by PTPMEG would be different from each other. Apparently, it is important to clarify the mechanism by which the interaction between GluRs and the PDZ domain-containing proteins, including PTPMEG, is regulated. The band 4.1 domain is observed in several membrane-cytoskeleton linker proteins such as ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM proteins). ERM proteins associate with the transmembrane protein CD44 through their band 4.1 domains (37.Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The band 4.1 domain of ERM proteins can also interact with Rho GDI and Dbl and links ERM proteins to the signal transduction pathways controlled by Rho GTPases (38.Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 39.Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Hotta I. Takaishi K. Imamura H. Nakano K. Kodama A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3279-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the band 4.1 domain of PTPMEG functions as the binding domain for another transmembrane protein or as the adapter domain involved in the Rho GTPase signaling cascade to regulate the organization of actin cytoskeleton. We propose that the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton around GluRε1 might make GluRε1 more susceptible to tyrosine phosphorylation by Fyn PTK. It would be a likely mechanism by which PTPMEG exerts its effect on Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRδ2 was not observed so far, suggesting that PTPMEG would play another role by interacting with GluRδ2. NMDA receptors play crucial roles in the neuronal functions, such as development, synaptic plasticity, and neurotoxicity (28.Wieloch T. Science. 1985; 230: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 40.Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). NMDA receptor activation induces calcium influx, followed by activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes including a calcium-activated neutral protease (calpain). In platelets, the phosphatase activity of PTPMEG is activated upon cleavage by calpain in response to calcium ionophore and thrombin (15.Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, NMDA receptor stimulation may activate PTPMEG through the activation of calpain. This would result in further activation of NMDA receptor, because PTPMEG enhances Fyn-mediated GluRε1 phosphorylation and because tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε1 could stimulate the channel activity of the NMDA receptor (41.Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 445-452Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, these possibilities need clarification by experimentation in primary neurons. We have shown that PTPMEG is prominently expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and in the cells at thalamus where GluRδ2 (3.Araki K. Meguro H. Kushiya E. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Mishina M. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and the four GluRε subunits (42.Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), respectively, are rich. Therefore, PTPMEG could interact with distinct GluRs depending on the cell types in which it is expressed. In addition, because PTPH1, a PTPase highly similar to PTPMEG, is also expressed significantly in thalamus, it is intriguing to address whether PTPH1 also interacts with GluRε subunits. Finally, our present study suggests that PTPMEG could function as a regulator as well as a downstream signal transducer of GluRδ2 and GluRε subunits. Further investigations, such as those aimed at elucidating the roles of PTPMEG in GluRs signaling pathway, will provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of GluRδ2-dependent motor learning as well as NMDA receptor functions.

Mcm proteins are one of the components of the replication licensing system that permits only a single round of DNA replication per cell cycle. It has been reported that Mcm proteins are phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinases in vivo, suggesting that these two factors are cooperatively involved in the regulation of DNA replication. Our group has reported that a 600-kDa Mcm4,6,7 complex has a DNA helicase activity that is probably necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. Here, we examined the in vitro phosphorylation of the Mcm complexes with cyclin A/Cdk2 to understand the interplay between Mcm proteins and cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin A/Cdk2 mainly phosphorylated the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex. The phosphorylation was associated with the inactivation of its DNA helicase activity. These results raise the possibility that the inactivation of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity by Cdk2 is a part of the system for regulating DNA replication.

Our group has reported that a 600-kDa Mcm4,6,7 complex has a DNA helicase activity that is probably necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. Here, we examined the in vitro phosphorylation of the Mcm complexes with cyclin A/Cdk2 to understand the interplay between Mcm proteins and cyclin-dependent kinases. The cyclin A/Cdk2 mainly phosphorylated the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex. The phosphorylation was associated with the inactivation of its DNA helicase activity. These results raise the possibility that the inactivation of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity by Cdk2 is a part of the system for regulating DNA replication. 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid In eukaryotic cells, a number of proteins are involved in the initiation of DNA replication including ORC, Cdc6, Mcm, Cdc45 proteins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase, and Cdc7 kinase (1.Dutta A.

Nature. 1988; 332: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), which permits only a single round of DNA replication per cell cycle in Xenopusegg extracts (28.Kubota Y. Mimura S.

Mcm proteins bind to chromatin before the initiation of DNA replication and detach from it as the replication proceeds (31.Yan H. Merchant A.M. Tye B.K.

These findings suggest that the binding of Mcm proteins confers to the chromatin the ability to replicate once in a cell cycle, and Mcm proteins that have completed the function in DNA replication are inactivated during S phase (34.Thömmes P. Blow J.J. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 75-90PubMed Google Scholar). Mcm proteins are phosphorylated during S and G2/M phases (32.Todorov I.T. Attara A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 35.Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36.Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cyclin B/Cdc2 complex is mainly responsible for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at G2/M phase (37.Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38.Coue M. Kearsey S.E. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 39.Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, several consensus sites of cyclin-dependent kinases are clustered in the amino-terminal region of Mcm4. Thus, it appears that Mcm proteins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases are cooperatively involved in restricting DNA replication once in a cell cycle. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation remains to be analyzed.All of the Mcm proteins have a common DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in the central domain (40.Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our group recently showed that Mcm4,6,7 proteins form a 600-kDa complex and function as a DNA helicase in vitro (41.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that Mcm2 inhibits the DNA helicase activity by converting the 600-kDa Mcm4,6,7 complex to a 450-kDa Mcm2,4,6,7 complex (42.Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To understand the interplay between Mcm proteins and cyclin-dependent kinase during S phase, we examined the effect of phosphorylation with cyclin A/Cdk2 on the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex. The results show that the kinase phosphorylates Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex and thereby inactivates its DNA helicase activity. These findings suggest that Mcm4 in the Mcm complex is a crucial substrate of the kinase that plays an essential role in preventing over-replication.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that cyclin A/Cdk2 efficiently phosphorylates Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex, which is associated with the inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the complex. The DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex is probably necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. It has been suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase and Mcm proteins are cooperatively involved in the regulation of DNA replication. Thus, the findings of the present study raise the possibility that the inactivation of Mcm helicase activity by cyclin A/Cdk2 is a constituent of this regulatory system.Mcm4 is phosphorylated during the cell cycle, as was shown inXenopus egg extracts and mouse cells. At G2/M phase in Xenopus, Mcm4 is highly phosphorylated by a cyclin B/Cdc2 complex, which has been shown by Coue et al. (38.Coue M. Kearsey S.E. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They reported that a chromatin-unbound form of Mcm4 is hypophosphorylated at early S phase, and in contrast, almost all of the chromatin-bound form of Mcm4 is partially phosphorylated: the level of the latter appears to be similar to that detected in the present study. Similar results have been obtained in mouse FM3A cells by Fujitaet al. (39.Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). They have observed that chromatin-bound forms of Mcm4 are more phosphorylated than the chromatin-unbound form of Mcm4 at S phase in FM3A cells. In addition, they have shown that the phosphorylation of mouse Mcm4 at G2/M phase is due to the cyclin B/Cdc2 complex using a temperature-sensitive mutant of the kinase. Although the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at S phase remains to be determined, it is likely that cyclin A/Cdk2 is involved. Thus, the present in vitro reaction may mimic phosphorylation of Mcm proteins during S phase. Therefore, we propose that Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity, which has functioned at the initiation of DNA replication, is inactivated by cyclin A/Cdk2 during S phase. Mcm4 protein is highly phosphorylated at G2/M phase inXenopus (37.Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of Mcm4 prevents the binding of Mcm complex to chromatin. Although whether this phosphorylation directly affects the chromatin binding of Mcm complex remains to be determined, the phosphorylation by cyclin B/Cdc2 may play a role in preventing the initiation of DNA replication at G2/M phase.We have shown that the DNA helicase activity is intrinsic to Mcm proteins, because site-directed mutagenesis of ATP-binding site of Mcm proteins abolished DNA helicase activity (43.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we suggested that an ATP-binding site in Mcm4 contributes to the DNA helicase activity through the binding with single-stranded DNA, and the site in Mcm6 plays a role in high affinity binding with ATP. We examined the change in single-stranded DNA binding activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex after phosphorylation with cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig.2 E). The results showed that the phosphorylated Mcm4,6,7 complex, which migrated more slowly than the original complex on native gel, exhibited a reduced level of single-stranded DNA binding activity. The Mcm4,6,7 complexes containing Mcm4 deleted at amino-terminal region (Fig. 5) also showed the reduced level of the single-stranded DNA binding activity and almost no DNA helicase activity (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 plays a role in single-stranded DNA binding ability of the Mcm4,6,7 complex, and phosphorylation with Cdk2 of Mcm4 in this region affects the single-stranded DNA binding activity. Because the inhibition of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity was detected at earlier stages of Cdk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B), however, the effect of phosphorylation on the single-stranded DNA binding as well as the structural change of the Mcm4,6,7 complex (Fig. 2 C) may not be directly linked to the inhibition of the helicase activity.Cdc6 protein is required for the loading of Mcm proteins onto chromatin and the replication origin in S. cerevisiae (3.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 4.Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.C. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces pombe, overproduction of Cdc18 protein (Cdc6 homolog) can induce over-replication (45.Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), indicating that Cdc18 plays a critical role in determining the initiation of DNA replication. The phosphorylation of Cdc18 protein by Cdk induces the degradation of Cdc18 protein in S. pombe (46.Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consistently, it has been reported that Clb-dependent kinases prevent the formation of the prereplication complex in S. cerevisiae (25.Detweiler C. Li J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2384-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47.Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Cdc6 protein is excluded from nuclei by the phosphorylation with cyclin A/Cdk2 complex (48.Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.-H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 49.Peterson B.O. Lukas J. Sørensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdk2 plays a critical role in the regulation of DNA replication by inactivating the function of Cdc6. However, Piatti et al. (47.Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) have reported that forced production of Cdc6 protein after late G1 phase no longer promotes DNA replication in S. cerevisiae. These findings suggest the presence of other target(s) of cyclin-dependent kinases that play an essential role in preventing over-replication. It has been shown that Cdk2 can inhibit loading of DNA polymerase α onto chromatin in S. cerevisiae (50.Desdouets C. Santocanale C. Drury L.S. Perkins G. Foiani M. Plevani P. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); this may be another reaction in the regulation of DNA replication by Cdk2. These results suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate several replication proteins including Mcm4 protein during S and G2/M phase to ensure a single round of DNA replication per cell cycle. In eukaryotic cells, a number of proteins are involved in the initiation of DNA replication including ORC, Cdc6, Mcm, Cdc45 proteins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase, and Cdc7 kinase (1.Dutta A.

Thus, it appears that Mcm proteins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases are cooperatively involved in restricting DNA replication once in a cell cycle. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation remains to be analyzed. All of the Mcm proteins have a common DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in the central domain (40.Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our group recently showed that Mcm4,6,7 proteins form a 600-kDa complex and function as a DNA helicase in vitro (41.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that Mcm2 inhibits the DNA helicase activity by converting the 600-kDa Mcm4,6,7 complex to a 450-kDa Mcm2,4,6,7 complex (42.Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To understand the interplay between Mcm proteins and cyclin-dependent kinase during S phase, we examined the effect of phosphorylation with cyclin A/Cdk2 on the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex. The results show that the kinase phosphorylates Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex and thereby inactivates its DNA helicase activity. These findings suggest that Mcm4 in the Mcm complex is a crucial substrate of the kinase that plays an essential role in preventing over-replication. DISCUSSIONThis study shows that cyclin A/Cdk2 efficiently phosphorylates Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex, which is associated with the inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the complex. The DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex is probably necessary for the initiation of DNA replication. It has been suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase and Mcm proteins are cooperatively involved in the regulation of DNA replication. Thus, the findings of the present study raise the possibility that the inactivation of Mcm helicase activity by cyclin A/Cdk2 is a constituent of this regulatory system.Mcm4 is phosphorylated during the cell cycle, as was shown inXenopus egg extracts and mouse cells. At G2/M phase in Xenopus, Mcm4 is highly phosphorylated by a cyclin B/Cdc2 complex, which has been shown by Coue et al. (38.Coue M. Kearsey S.E. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They reported that a chromatin-unbound form of Mcm4 is hypophosphorylated at early S phase, and in contrast, almost all of the chromatin-bound form of Mcm4 is partially phosphorylated: the level of the latter appears to be similar to that detected in the present study. Similar results have been obtained in mouse FM3A cells by Fujitaet al. (39.Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). They have observed that chromatin-bound forms of Mcm4 are more phosphorylated than the chromatin-unbound form of Mcm4 at S phase in FM3A cells. In addition, they have shown that the phosphorylation of mouse Mcm4 at G2/M phase is due to the cyclin B/Cdc2 complex using a temperature-sensitive mutant of the kinase. Although the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Mcm4 at S phase remains to be determined, it is likely that cyclin A/Cdk2 is involved. Thus, the present in vitro reaction may mimic phosphorylation of Mcm proteins during S phase. Therefore, we propose that Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity, which has functioned at the initiation of DNA replication, is inactivated by cyclin A/Cdk2 during S phase. Mcm4 protein is highly phosphorylated at G2/M phase inXenopus (37.Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of Mcm4 prevents the binding of Mcm complex to chromatin. Although whether this phosphorylation directly affects the chromatin binding of Mcm complex remains to be determined, the phosphorylation by cyclin B/Cdc2 may play a role in preventing the initiation of DNA replication at G2/M phase.We have shown that the DNA helicase activity is intrinsic to Mcm proteins, because site-directed mutagenesis of ATP-binding site of Mcm proteins abolished DNA helicase activity (43.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we suggested that an ATP-binding site in Mcm4 contributes to the DNA helicase activity through the binding with single-stranded DNA, and the site in Mcm6 plays a role in high affinity binding with ATP. We examined the change in single-stranded DNA binding activity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex after phosphorylation with cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig.2 E). The results showed that the phosphorylated Mcm4,6,7 complex, which migrated more slowly than the original complex on native gel, exhibited a reduced level of single-stranded DNA binding activity. The Mcm4,6,7 complexes containing Mcm4 deleted at amino-terminal region (Fig. 5) also showed the reduced level of the single-stranded DNA binding activity and almost no DNA helicase activity (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that the amino-terminal region of Mcm4 plays a role in single-stranded DNA binding ability of the Mcm4,6,7 complex, and phosphorylation with Cdk2 of Mcm4 in this region affects the single-stranded DNA binding activity. Because the inhibition of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity was detected at earlier stages of Cdk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B), however, the effect of phosphorylation on the single-stranded DNA binding as well as the structural change of the Mcm4,6,7 complex (Fig. 2 C) may not be directly linked to the inhibition of the helicase activity.Cdc6 protein is required for the loading of Mcm proteins onto chromatin and the replication origin in S. cerevisiae (3.Coleman T.R.

The phosphorylation of Cdc18 protein by Cdk induces the degradation of Cdc18 protein in S. pombe (46.Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J.

In mammalian cells, Cdc6 protein is excluded from nuclei by the phosphorylation with cyclin A/Cdk2 complex (48.Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.-H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdk2 plays a critical role in the regulation of DNA replication by inactivating the function of Cdc6. However, Piatti et al. (47.Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) have reported that forced production of Cdc6 protein after late G1 phase no longer promotes DNA replication in S. cerevisiae. These findings suggest the presence of other target(s) of cyclin-dependent kinases that play an essential role in preventing over-replication. It has been shown that Cdk2 can inhibit loading of DNA polymerase α onto chromatin in S. cerevisiae (50.Desdouets C. Santocanale C. Drury L.S. Perkins G. Foiani M. Plevani P. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); this may be another reaction in the regulation of DNA replication by Cdk2. These results suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate several replication proteins including Mcm4 protein during S and G2/M phase to ensure a single round of DNA replication per cell cycle. This study shows that cyclin A/Cdk2 efficiently phosphorylates Mcm4 in the Mcm4,6,7 complex, which is associated with the inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the complex.

We studied the inhibitory effects of ascorbate on both NADH and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) oxidation by peroxynitrite generated in situ from 3-morpholinosydnonimineN-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1). SIN-1 (150 μm)-mediated oxidation of NADH (200 μm) was half-maximally inhibited by low ascorbate concentrations (61–75 μm), both in the absence and presence of CO2. Control experiments performed with thiols indicated both the very high antioxidative efficiency of ascorbate and that in the presence of CO2 in situ-generated peroxynitrite exclusively oxidized NADH via the CO⨪3 radical. This fact is attributed to the formation of peroxynitrate (O2NOO−/O2NOOH) from reaction of NO2· with O⨪2, which is formed from reaction of CO⨪3 with NADH. SIN-1 (25 μm)-derived oxidation of DHR was half-maximally inhibited by surprisingly low ascorbate concentrations (6–7 μm), irrespective of the presence of CO2. Control experiments performed with authentic peroxynitrite revealed that ascorbate was in regard to both thiols and selenocompounds much more effective to protect DHR. The present results demonstrate that ascorbate is highly effective to counteract the oxidizing properties of peroxynitrite in the absence and presence of CO2 by both terminating CO⨪3/HO⋅ reactions and by its repair function. Ascorbate is therefore expected to act intracellulary as a major peroxynitrite antagonist. In addition, a novel, ascorbate-independent protection pathway exists: scavenging of NO2· by O⨪2 to yield O2NOO−, which further decomposes into NO2− and O2.

The continuous formation of low amounts of ONOO− can be simulated in experimental systems with the O⨪2 and ⋅NO-releasing compound SIN-1.1 The pathological activity of ONOO− and its conjugated acid (hydrogen oxoperoxonitrate (1−), ONOOH), collectively often referred to as peroxynitrite, may be related to its capability to nitrate tyrosine (3.Kooy N.W.

Ascorbate is not believed to be an important scavenger of peroxynitrite because the intracellular concentration of ascorbate (roughly 1 mm, e.g. in human lung (Ref. 8.Slade R. Stead A.G. Graham J.A.

Sharov V.S. Klotz L.-O. Briviba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27812-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We recently observed that peroxynitrite and radicals derived from it rapidly react with NADH (7.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to yield O⨪2/H2O2 and NAD+. Using both authentic peroxynitrite and peroxynitrite generated in situ from SIN-1, we studied the inhibitory effects of ascorbate on the oxidation of both NADH and DHR in the absence and presence of CO2. Although ascorbate turned out to be a very potent antioxidant against peroxynitrite-derived oxidations reactions in general, surprising differences were found for its antioxidative functions on DHR and NADH oxidation, respectively. Catalase from beef liver (EC 1.11.1.6), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes (EC1.15.1.1), NADH, and NADPH were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Manganese dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, DTPA, GSH, cysteine, and HClO4 (suprapure) were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Ascorbic acid was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0 and nitrogen 5.0 (20.5% O2, 79.5% N2; “synthetic air”) and commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0 and nitrogen 5.0 and carbon dioxide 4.6 (20.5% O2, 74.5% N2, 5% CO2) were purchased from Messer-Griessheim (Oberhausen, Germany; 5.0 and 4.6 mean purities of 99.999% and 99.996%, respectively). SIN-1 and its decomposition product, SIN-1C, were generously provided by Dr. K. Schönafinger (Hoechst Marion Roussel, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Peroxynitric acid (O2NOOH) solutions (1.57 ± 0.02 m) were prepared freshly each day as described by Appelman and Gosztola (26.Appelman E.H. Gosztola D.J. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 787-791Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 0.52 g of NaNO2was dissolved in 1.5 ml of 30% H2O2, and 150 μl of 70% HClO4 was mixed with 1 ml of 30% H2O2. Both solutions were cooled in an ice/H2O/NaCl bath to −17 °C. The following procedure was also performed at this temperature. The nitrite peroxide solution was carefully added to the stirred perchloric acid solution in 5-μl aliquots. After each 250-μl addition of nitrite peroxide solution, an additional 100 μl of 70% HClO4 were further added. The resulting product solution is stable for a few hours at −17 °C and was used within 45 min. Oxoperoxonitrate (1−) (0.73 m) was prepared by isoamylnitrite-induced nitrosation of hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol of isoamylnitrite, 100 ml of H2O2 (1m) plus DTPA (2 mm)) and purified (e.g. solvent extraction, removal of excess H2O2, N2 purging) as described by Uppu and Pryor (27.Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 242-249Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and stored at −79 °C. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Care was taken to exclude possible contamination by either bicarbonate/carbon dioxide and transition metals. Doubly distilled water was bubbled (2 liters/min) with synthetic air at room temperature for 20 min. This water was used for synthesis of oxoperoxonitrate (1−), NaOH (0.01–0.5 n) and for all other solutions. Phosphate buffer solutions (50 mm) were treated with the heavy metal scavenger resin Chelex 100 (0.3 g/0.5 g in 10 ml) in the absence and presence of ascorbate (400 mm) by gently shaking for 18 h in the dark. After low speed centrifugation for 5 min, the solutions were carefully decanted from the resin. The resin treatment resulted in an increase of pH by about 0.25 units. Various additives (DTPA, NADH, thiols) were then added. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 at 37 °C, and the solution was again bubbled (2 liters/min) with synthetic air or with the CO2 mixture for 20 min. In the case of CO2 bubbling, the pH had to be readjusted to 7.5. SIN-1 solutions were prepared as 100× stock solutions at 4 °C in 50 mmKH2PO4 and used within 15 min. SIN-1 was added to 1 ml of phosphate buffer and incubated in 12-well cell culture plates (volume of each well: 7 ml; Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany). Under HCO3−/CO2-free conditions, these plates were placed in an air-tight vessel (10 liters). During the first 15 min of each experiment, these vessels were flushed (5 liters/min) with synthetic air in a warming incubator (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). In the presence of HCO3−/CO2 the plates were placed in an incubator for cell culture (37 °C, humidified atmosphere of 95% authentic air and 5% CO2; Labotect, Göttingen, Germany). The experiments with authentic peroxynitrite (2 μl of 25–125 mm ONOO− in 0.5n NaOH was added to 1 ml of reaction solution) and with peroxynitric acid (1 μl of 1.57 m O2NOOH was added to 1 ml of reaction solution) were performed in reaction tubes (1.4 ml; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) by using the drop-tube vortex mixer technique as described previously (28.Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Under HCO3−/CO2-free conditions, the experiments with authentic peroxynitrite and peroxynitric acid were performed in a glove-bag (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) under synthetic air. Ascorbate was quantified by reading its absorbance at 265 nm (εM = 14500m−1 cm−1; Ref. 29.Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) after the pretreatment of the stock solution with Chelex 100. SIN-1 and SIN-1C were quantified by capillary zone electrophoresis on a Beckman P/ACE 5000 apparatus as described previously (28.Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Formation of RH was quantified spectrophotometrically at 500 nm (εM = 78,000m−1 cm−1) (30.Haddad I.Y. Crow J.P. Hu P. Ye Y. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L242-L249PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the peroxynitric acid stock solution (0.2 μl) was quantified by the amount of O2 released in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (1 ml) at pH 11. O2 was determined polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Saur, Reutlingen, Germany). NAD(P)H was quantified by reading its fluorescence with excitation at 339 nm and emission at 460 nm (31.Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VII. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). Standard calibration curves were prepared from known amounts of NAD(P)H. Additionally, the oxidation of NAD(P)H was followed photometrically at 340 nm using ε340 = 6200m−1 cm−1 (31.Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VII. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). Both methods gave identical results; therefore, only one parameter, the decrease of fluorescence, will be shown here. Superoxide radicals were determined by using the modified ferricytochrome c reduction technique of McCord and Fridovich (32.McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (100 μm) was vortexed to the reaction solution in the presence of both NADH (500 μm) and cytochromec 3+ (20 μm) and in the absence and presence of SOD (625 nm, i.e. 100 units/ml). NADH was added in surplus amounts to prevent reaction of (residual) peroxynitrite with SOD and cytochrome c 2+formed. The resulting mixture was stored for 2 min at 37 °C. Cytochrome c 2+ formation was determined by reading its absorbance at 550 nm (Δε550 = 21,000m−1 cm−1) (33.Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The difference in cytochrome c reduction in the presence and absence of SOD was used to calculate the amount of trapped O⨪2. The experiments with SIN-1 were carried out as end point determinations after 3–4 h of incubation at 37 °C. After that time, SIN-1 (25–150 μm) was completely degraded, as checked by capillary zone electrophoresis (data not shown). In the absence of HCO3−/CO2 about 80 μm residual NADH was found after incubation of 150 μm SIN-1 with 200 μm NADH (Fig.1 A). Under this condition, ONOOH is apparently the decisive oxidant (7.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A 6.2-fold surplus of GSH had to be used to achieve a half-maximal NADH protection (IC50: 1240 ± 20 μm GSH), in good agreement with the fact that ONOOH has been estimated to react ∼7.4 times faster with NADH than with GSH (7.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13.Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Ascorbate was 16.5-fold more effective to prevent NADH oxidation (IC50: 75 ± 2 μm) as compared with GSH. As ONOOH reacts ∼6-fold faster with GSH than with ascorbate (11.Bartlett D. Church D. Bounds P.L. Koppenol W.H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12.Squadrito G.L. Xia J. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), the protection on NADH oxidation exerted by ascorbate in the absence of HCO3−/CO2 cannot be explained by direct reaction with ONOOH. In the presence of HCO3−/CO2, about 60 μm residual NADH was detected after a 4-h incubation with SIN-1 (Fig. 1 B). GSH now had largely lost its capability to protect NADH; a high concentration of ∼15 mm had to be applied to achieve a half-maximal protection. In contrast, the strong protective effect of ascorbate was even further increased in the presence of HCO3−/CO2 (IC50: 61 μm). Similar results were obtained by replacing NADH with NADPH (data not shown). The fact that ascorbate was 249-fold more effective than GSH to prevent NADH oxidation suggests that the CO⨪3 radical should be the main oxidant, because it is known that CO⨪3 reacts 260 times faster with ascorbate than with GSH (1.Ross A.B. Mallard W.G. Helman W.P. Buxton G., V. Huie R.E. Neta P. NDRL/NIST Solution Kinetics Database 3.0. NDRL/NIST, Gaithersburg, MD1998Google Scholar). To provide further evidence for this assumption, a comparison between the IC50/[NADH] ratios and the ratios of the corresponding rate constants, namelyk(NADH+CO⨪3)/k(scavenger+CO⨪3), was made (Table I). The IC50/[NADH] ratios correlated reasonably well with the ratios of the corresponding rate constants, supporting the view that NADH was most likely attacked by the CO⨪3 radical.Table IEffect of scavengers on SIN-1-dependent oxidation of NADHScavengerRate constant of the scavenger with CO⨪3IC50IC50/[NADH]k(CO⨪3+NADH) a,bk(CO⨪3+scavenger)k/m −1 s −1 × 10 −6μmAscorbate1400 (1)61 ± 30.30.5Cysteine46 (1)3000 ± 6015.015.2GSH5.3 (1)15,200 ± 20076.0132.1DTT440cDetermined at pH 11.

In the presence of CO2, two radicals, namely CO⨪3and NO2·, are produced from peroxynitrite. Both radicals are expected to rapidly oxidize NADH (7.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the question rose as to why NO2· was apparently not involved in the SIN-1-induced oxidation of NADH. Since reaction of peroxynitrite with NADH yields O⨪2 in the absence of CO2 (7.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and because formation of peroxynitrate (O2NOO−,t 1/2 = 0.7 s, pK a = 5.9; Ref. 34.Logager T. Sehested K. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10047-10052Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) has been observed from reaction of peroxynitrite with various substrates in the presence of CO2 (19.Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3458-3463Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20.Hodges G.R. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10695-10701Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we speculated that NO2· has been transformed into O2NOO− in these experiments. In fact, we found that O⨪2 was formed from the reaction of authentic peroxynitrite (100 μm) with NADH (500 μm) in the presence of CO2 as well (3.8 ± 0.3 μm O⨪2, three experiments performed in duplicate). As there is no specific detector molecule for peroxynitrate presently available, we tried to provide further evidence for the formation of this compound by analyzing parameters that reflect the underlying reaction mechanism. As has been shown by Halliwell (35.Halliwell B. Planta. 1978; 140: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), O2 uptake correlates strictly with NADH consumption when NADH is non-enzymatically oxidized by one-electron oxidants (Scheme I). 2 NADH+2 one­electron oxidant →products+2 NAD· 2 NAD·+2 O2 →2 NAD++2 O⨪2 2 O⨪2+2 H+ →H2O2+O2 SCHEME IHowever, such a correlation should not exist in the present system when peroxynitrate is nearly stoichiometrically formed as an intermediate (Scheme II).

Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36.Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Schmidt K.

Toxicol. 1998; 11: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (TableII). On the other hand, addition of 200 μm NADH resulted in the consumption of ∼40 μm O2. Thus, O2NOO− is unlikely to be formed in stoichiometric amounts under these conditions. In the presence of CO2, only ∼16 μm O2was formed from the decay of 1 mm peroxynitrite. In sharp contrast to the CO2-free situation, the yield of O2 found in the presence of NADH (200 μm) was only slightly altered although the same amount of NAD+ was formed. This observation strongly supports the intermediary formation of peroxynitrate.Table IIEffects of authentic peroxynitrite on O2 formation and NADH consumptionConditionsPresence of CO2O2ΔO2aReferred to “No additives”; separately calculated for the absence and presence of CO2.Residual NADHμmNo additivesNo225.0 ± 4Peroxynitrite (250 μm)No269.3 ± 3+44.3Peroxynitrite (250 μm) plus NADH (200 μm)No185.3 ± 2−39.7119.2 ± 3No additivesYes210.0 ± 3Peroxynitrite (1000 μm)Yes225.5 ± 3+15.5Peroxynitrite (1000 μm) plus NADH (200 μm)Yes221.2 ± 2+11.2119.4 ± 3Authentic peroxynitrite (1 mm) was added under normoxic conditions in the absence and presence of HCO3−/CO2 (25 mm/5%) or NADH (200 μm) to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (37 °C, pH 7.5).

Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of six experiments. The formation of O2NOO− from reaction of NO⋅2 with O⨪2 a prioricannot be regarded as an inactivation process for NO⋅2, because peroxynitrate has been reported to oxidize NADH even at pH 7.1 (38.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 36: 4156-4162Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since the efficiency of this reaction is unknown, we studied the authentic peroxynitrate-derived NADH oxidation and the antioxidative effect of ascorbate on it (Fig. 2). Irrespective of the presence of CO2, about 45 μm NADH was oxidized from reaction of peroxynitrate (1.57 mm) with NADH (200 μm), i.e. only ∼3% of the added O2NOO− was able to oxidize NADH. A virtual identical yield was observed with lower peroxynitrate concentrations (0.25–1 mm, data not shown). Ascorbate protected NADH against the attack of peroxynitrate in a roughly linear manner, and the inhibitory effect was not influenced by the addition of HCO3−/CO2. However, relatively high concentrations of ascorbate were necessary to inhibit peroxynitrate-induced oxidation of NADH (IC50: 1150 ± 60 μm). A comparison of the IC50/[NADH] ratio (= 5.8) with the ratio of the corresponding rate constants (k(NO⋅2 + NADH)/k(NO⋅2 + ascorbate) = 10 × 107m−1s−1 (7.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)/1.8 × 107m−1 s−1 (Ref. 39.Forni, L. G., Mora-Adrellano, V. O., Packer, J. E., and Willson, R. L. (1986) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 1–6Google Scholar) =5.6) strongly indicates that ascorbate protected NADH by terminating NO⋅2. The result that peroxynitrate mediates its oxidative properties via NO⋅2 is in line with data of Goldstein et al. (40.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merenyi G. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 3943-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence, it can be concluded that after the reaction of NO⋅2 with O⨪2about 97% of the amount of NO⋅2 was inactivated regarding its properties to oxidize NADH. As compared with ascorbate, GSH (0–30 mm) exhibited only a very weak protective effect against authentic peroxynitrate. From the present data, it can be calculated that a 50% protection level should be attainable at ∼88 mm GSH (data not shown). Thus, ascorbate is ∼80 times more effective than GSH on inhibiting peroxynitrate-mediated oxidation of NADH. Formation of peroxynitrate via reaction of ONOOH with DHR is highly unlikely, because the intermediately formed DHR radical dismutates quantitatively into DHR and RH (24.Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and is therefore not expected to generate O⨪2.

https://openalex.org/W1983924502,"To investigate further the relationship of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to activation of the B2 bradykinin (BK) receptor, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells to stably express the human receptor and either wild-type ACE (WT-ACE), an ACE construct with most of the cytosolic portion deleted (Cyt-del-ACE), or ACE with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (GPI-ACE). BK or its ACE-resistant analogue were the agonists. All activities (arachidonic acid release and calcium mobilization) were blocked by the B2 antagonist HOE 140. B2 was desensitized by repeated administration of BK but resensitized to agonist by ACE inhibitors in the cells expressing both B2 and either WT-ACE or Cyt-del-ACE. In GPI-ACE expressing cells, the B2 receptor was still activated by the agonists, but ACE inhibitors did not resensitize. Pretreatment with filipin returned the sensitivity to inhibitors. In immunocytochemistry, GPI-ACE showed patchy, uneven distribution on the plasma membrane that was restored by filipin. Thus, ACE inhibitors were inactive as long as GPI-ACE was sequestered in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. WT-ACE and B2 receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-immunoprecipitated with antibody to receptor, suggesting an interaction on the cell membrane. ACE inhibitors augment BK effects on receptors indirectly only when enzyme and receptor molecules are sterically close, possibly forming a heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W2086634862,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) constitute a family of structurally related proteins that forms a subset of the Ras superfamily of regulatory GTP-binding proteins. Like other GTPases, activation of ARFs is facilitated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). In chromaffin cells, ARF6 is associated with the membrane of secretory granules. Stimulation of intact cells or direct elevation of cytosolic calcium in permeabilized cells triggers the rapid translocation of ARF6 to the plasma membrane and the concomitant activation of phospholipase D (PLD) in the plasma membrane. Both calcium-evoked PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in permeabilized cells are strongly inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of ARF6, suggesting that the ARF6-dependent PLD activation near the exocytotic sites represents a key event in the exocytotic reaction in chromaffin cells. In the present study, we demonstrate the occurrence of a brefeldin A-insensitive ARF6-GEF activity in the plasma membrane and in the cytosol of chromaffin cells. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoreplica analysis indicate that ARNO, a member of the brefeldin A-insensitive ARF-GEF family, is expressed and predominantly localized in the cytosol and in the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. Using permeabilized chromaffin cells, we found that the introduction of anti-ARNO antibodies into the cytosol inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, both PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in calcium-stimulated cells. Furthermore, co-expression in PC12 cells of a catalytically inactive ARNO mutant with human growth hormone as a marker of secretory granules in transfected cells resulted in a 50% inhibition of growth hormone secretion evoked by depolarization with high K+. The possibility that the plasma membrane-associated ARNO participates in the exocytotic pathway by activating ARF6 and downstream PLD is discussed. ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) constitute a family of structurally related proteins that forms a subset of the Ras superfamily of regulatory GTP-binding proteins. Like other GTPases, activation of ARFs is facilitated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). In chromaffin cells, ARF6 is associated with the membrane of secretory granules. Stimulation of intact cells or direct elevation of cytosolic calcium in permeabilized cells triggers the rapid translocation of ARF6 to the plasma membrane and the concomitant activation of phospholipase D (PLD) in the plasma membrane. Both calcium-evoked PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in permeabilized cells are strongly inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of ARF6, suggesting that the ARF6-dependent PLD activation near the exocytotic sites represents a key event in the exocytotic reaction in chromaffin cells. In the present study, we demonstrate the occurrence of a brefeldin A-insensitive ARF6-GEF activity in the plasma membrane and in the cytosol of chromaffin cells. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoreplica analysis indicate that ARNO, a member of the brefeldin A-insensitive ARF-GEF family, is expressed and predominantly localized in the cytosol and in the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. Using permeabilized chromaffin cells, we found that the introduction of anti-ARNO antibodies into the cytosol inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, both PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in calcium-stimulated cells. Furthermore, co-expression in PC12 cells of a catalytically inactive ARNO mutant with human growth hormone as a marker of secretory granules in transfected cells resulted in a 50% inhibition of growth hormone secretion evoked by depolarization with high K+. The possibility that the plasma membrane-associated ARNO participates in the exocytotic pathway by activating ARF6 and downstream PLD is discussed.

ARFs are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells with an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved across diverse species, suggesting a fundamental role in cellular physiology. Initially discovered as cofactors of the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs (1.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ARFs appear to be critical to vesicular trafficking in various subcellular compartments of the cell (2.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). More recently, members of the ARF family have been shown to activate phospholipase D (PLD) in several cellular systems as well as in isolated membranes (3.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 4.Cockroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I.

The ARF family has been divided into three classes based on size, sequence homology, gene structure, and phylogenetic analysis. Class I ARFs (ARFs 1–3) were initially identified as components of vesicles that originate from the Golgi (6.Strearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,7.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas class III ARF6, which is the most structurally divergent member of the family, has more recently been implicated in the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways at the plasma membrane (9.D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10.Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorscht V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Little is known about class II ARF4 and ARF5.Like other G proteins, ARFs cycle between a GDP-bound and a GTP-bound conformation. The GTP-induced conformational change is the “on” signal that permits the ARF proteins to bind to and activate specific protein effectors. Isolated ARFs have little detectable GTPase activity and exchange bound nucleotide very slowly. In cells, their GTPase cycle requires an interaction with GTPase-activating proteins and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which catalyze the nucleotide exchange activity on ARF. The identification of ARF1 GEFs was facilitated by the discovery that the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) disrupts Golgi trafficking by inhibiting a Golgi-associated ARF1 exchange factor (13.Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Several GEF activities have been described, but the breakthrough toward the identification of GEFs acting on ARF proteins was the cloning of two related BFA-sensitive ARF1 GEFs-encoding genes in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Gea1 and Gea2 (14.Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This lead to the discovery of cytohesin-1 (15.Meacci E. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), ARNO (ARF nucleotide-binding-site opener, Ref. 16.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and GRP1 (17.Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) which promote guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF1 by a BFA-insensitive catalytic mechanism. Subsequent studies demonstrated that ARNO, GRP1, and cytohesin-1 can also promotes GDP/GTP exchange on ARF6 in both cell free and intact cell assays (18.Frank S. Upendert S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19.Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) isolated a novel protein, EFA6, which triggers rapid and efficient exchange on ARF6, and it was suggested that EFA6 represents the first identified ARF6-specific GEF. All known ARF GEFs share a conserved central region, the Sec7 domain, responsible for their exchange activity and displaying a high degree of homology with the yeast sec7p, a molecule required for membrane traffic from the yeast (22.Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11711-11717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarities between the ARNO-related GEFs comprise also a coiled coil N terminus and a C-terminal plekstrin homology domain required for phosphoinositide binding and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)P2-dependent activation of ARNO exchange activity (16.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 17.Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).We recently described the presence of a secretory granule-associated ARF6 protein in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (11.Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Secretagogue-evoked stimulation of chromaffin cells triggers the rapid translocation of ARF6 from secretory granules to the plasma membrane and the concomitant activation of PLD in the plasma membrane (23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The observation that both calcium-evoked PLD activation and calcium-induced catecholamine secretion can be inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of myristoylated ARF6, led us to propose that ARF6 participates in the exocytotic reaction by controlling a plasma membrane-bound PLD and the generation of fusogenic lipids at the exocytotic sites (23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the intracellular localization and function of the nucleotide exchange factor for ARF6 in chromaffin cells in order to identify the partners of ARF6 in calcium-evoked secretion. Our data reveal the presence of a BFA-insensitive ARNO-related GEF activity for ARF6 in both cytosolic and plasma membrane-bound fractions. Furthermore, the introduction of anti-ARNO antibodies into the cytosol of permeabilized chromaffin cells strongly inhibited calcium-evoked PLD activation and catecholamine secretion. In line with this observation, overexpression of a catalytically inactive ARNO mutant reduced to a similar extent stimulated exocytosis in PC12 cells. We propose that ARNO plays a critical role in the exocytotic pathway in chromaffin cells, by controlling the ARF6 GTPase cycle at the plasma membrane and thereby the ARF6-dependent activation of PLD.DISCUSSIONARF proteins have traditionally been thought to play a role in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking (40.Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). ARF1, which is the best characterized of the six mammalian ARFs, is recruited from the cytosol to the Golgi complex where it mediates the binding of coat proteins and adaptins to Golgi membranes (2.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12.Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 41.Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is clear from recent work that ARF6 serves distinct functions in eukaryotic cells. In contrast to ARF1 which is generally associated with the Golgi complex, ARF6 has been localized at the plasma membrane where it is likely to modulate some aspects of the vesicular trafficking to and from the cell surface (9.D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10.Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorscht V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 12.Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 43.Millar C.A. Powell K.A. Hickson G.X.R. Bader M.F. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17619-17625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence also support a unique role for ARF6 in regulating cortical actin structure and function (44.D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 45.Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the convergence in molecules and mechanisms underlying the multiple steps of intracellular vesicular transport, we previously investigated the possible function of members of the ARF family in calcium-regulated exocytosis (11.Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our findings suggested that a granule-bound ARF6 plays a direct role in the late stages of exocytosis, most likely by stimulating a PLD activity located at the plasma membrane.Important to our understanding of ARF6 function in the exocytotic pathway will be the identification of the factors which catalyze nucleotide exchange (GEFs) and GTP hydrolysis (GTPase-activating proteins). In the present study, we report the presence of a GEF activity for ARF6 in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. It is worth noting that no GEF activity could be detected on purified secretory granules. This observation suggests that ARF6 is in its inactive GDP-bound conformation when associated with the chromaffin granule membrane. Previous results obtained by chemical cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation indicated that the membrane receptor that stabilizes the interaction of ARF6 with chromaffin granules is likely to be the Gβγ subunits of trimeric G protein (11.Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In line with these results, it has been previously reported that the interaction between ARF1 and Gβγ is favored when ARF1 is in its GDP-liganded form (46.Franco M. Paris S. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47.Colombo M.I. Inglese J. D'Souza-Schorey C. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24564-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because ARF6 is apparently not cytosolic in chromaffin cells (11.Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it may be predicted that ARF6 undergoes its GTPase cycle and becomes activated at the plasma membrane where its GEF appears to be located. This idea correlates well with our previous observations showing the activation of an ARF6-regulated PLD at the plasma membrane in secretagogue-stimulated cells (23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results support a model in which docking of secretory granules to the exocytotic sites at the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation allows ARF6 to transiently switch from the granular Gβγ complex to the plasma membrane-associated GEF. Formation of GTP-bound ARF6 subsequently activates downstream effector(s) in the exocytotic machinery, in particular the ARF6-regulated PLD present at the plasma membrane (23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In view of the strong inhibition induced by the synthetic N-terminal domain of ARF6 on both PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in permeabilized chromaffin cells (11.Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), ARF6-dependent activation of the plasma membrane-associated PLD is likely to represent a key event in the exocytotic pathway.We report here that the brefeldin A-insensitive GEF, ARNO, colocalizes with ARF6 at the plasma membrane in stimulated chromaffin cells. Indeed, both PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in permeabilized chromaffin cells are insensitive to brefeldin A. In agreement, recent work indicates that brefeldin A disrupts the Golgi membranes, but does not affect the pattern of catecholamine release monitored by carbon fiber amperometry nor does it modify the calcium sensitivity, granule mobilization, or initial rate of exocytosis in single rat chromaffin cells (48.Xu J. Tse F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ARNO-related proteins, first characterized as efficient exchange factors for ARF1 (16.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 49.Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have subsequently been shown to regulate ARF6 activity and functions in intact cells (19.Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27099-27104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether an exchange factor specific for ARF6 might be expressed in chromaffin cells. EFA6, a protein mainly expressed in brain (50.Perletti L. Talarico D. Trecca D. Ronchetti D. Fracchiolla N.S. Maiolo A.T. Neri A. Genomics. 1997; 46: 215-259Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), promotes nucleotide exchange preferentially on ARF6 (21.Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). EFA6 was an attractive candidate to play the role of an ARF6-specific GEF in the exocytotic machinery since studies in transfected HeLa cells indicate that the protein is preferentially localized in the subplasmalemmal region where it seems to regulate membrane trafficking and the organization of peripheral actin filaments (21.Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, EFA6 was not detectable in chromaffin cells both in RT-PCR and Western blot expression studies. Furthermore, the introduction of anti-ARNO antibodies, but not anti-EFA6 antibodies, into the cytosol of permeabilized chromaffin cells, inhibited to a similar extent PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in calcium-stimulated cells. Consistent with this result, overexpression of a catalytically inactive ARNO mutant reduced the secretory activity in transfected PC12 cells. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that the plasma membrane-associated ARNO described here represents the endogenous GEF for ARF6 in the exocytotic pathway in chromaffin cells.In contrast to a recent report describing ARNO mostly as a cytosolic protein in HeLa cells (51.Monier S. Chardin P. Robineau S. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found here that a large portion of ARNO is associated with the plasma membrane in chromaffin cells. This localization of ARNO was apparently not modified in secretagogue-stimulated cells. An obvious candidate for targeting ARNO to the plasma membrane is its C-terminal plekstrin homology domain (16.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Plekstrin homology domains are generally thought to mediate recruitment of proteins to membrane surfaces through their interaction with phosphoinositides (52.Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Fergusson K.M. Klausner R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Plekstrin homology domains have been subdivided into classes based on their affinity for different polyphosphoinositide species (53.Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A.K. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent work indicates that ARNO exhibits a much higher affinity for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate than for either phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate in vitro (54.Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 55.Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, insulin-dependent translocation of ARNO to the plasma membrane requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (55.Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These observations fit well with our previous findings that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase present in the subplasmalemmal region in chromaffin cells plays a critical function in the pathway leading to catecholamine secretion (56.Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Thiersé D. Dirrig S. Vlahos C.J. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2347-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be quite interesting to determine whether there is regulatory cross-talk between ARNO and the generation of 3-phosphorylated inositides in the plasma membrane during exocytosis.The present observations that ARNO antibodies inhibited in parallel PLD activation and catecholamine secretion in permeabilized chromaffin cells are consistent with the predicted importance of the ARNO/ARF6/PLD cascade in the exocytotic machinery in neuroendocrine cells (23.Caumont A.S. Galas M.C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid and choline. The conversion of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid in the plasma membrane replaces a nonfusogenic phospholipid with a fusogenic one, a potentially positive lipid modification that may allow the membrane fusion machinery to function. On the other hand, the fact that an ARF6-dependent PLD activation accompanies the exocytotic reaction does not necessarily preclude the occurrence of some other downstream effector(s) for ARNO/ARF6 in the regulated secretory pathway. ARF6 is unique in its ability to regulate the structure of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (44.D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 45.Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of ARNO in HeLa cells promotes a protein kinase C-dependent remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, similar to those observed in cells expressing GTP-bound ARF6 (19.Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In secretory cells, actin filaments form a cortical barrier that excludes the majority of secretory granules from the subplasmalemmal zone. Secretagogue-evoked stimulation produces a specific reorganization of the actin network, which is a prerequisite for exocytosis enabling docking and fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane (31.Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar,57.Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 446-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 58.Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester treatment disrupts cortical F-actin and increases both the number of granules within the subplasmalemmal zone and the initial rate of stimulated catecholamine secretion in chromaffin cells (58.Vitale M.L.

In view of their actin remodeling properties, ARNO/ARF6 represent attractive candidates capable of mediating actin rearrangements underlying membrane trafficking at the site of exocytosis. One molecule that has been shown to play a role in the ARF6-induced cytoskeletal reorganization is the Rac1-interacting protein POR1 (44.D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D.

The occurrence of POR1 in secretory cells is currently unknown, but would represent an interesting subject of investigation in view of the coordinated control apparently exerted by ARF6 and Rho-related GTPases on regulated exocytosis (42.Gasman S.

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs)1 are a group of structurally related GTP-binding proteins that form a subset of the Ras superfamily. ARFs are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells with an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved across diverse species, suggesting a fundamental role in cellular physiology. Initially discovered as cofactors of the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs (1.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ARFs appear to be critical to vesicular trafficking in various subcellular compartments of the cell (2.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). More recently, members of the ARF family have been shown to activate phospholipase D (PLD) in several cellular systems as well as in isolated membranes (3.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R.

U937 cells express group IV phospholipase A2(cPLA2), but neither its level nor its phosphorylation state increases upon differentiation. A group VI PLA2(iPLA2) that is sensitive to a bromoenol lactone inhibitor catalyzes arachidonate hydrolysis from phospholipids in some cells and facilitates arachidonate incorporation into glycerophosphocholine (GPC) lipids in others, but it is not known whether U937 cells express iPLA2. We confirm that ionophore A23187 induces substantial [3H]arachidonate release from differentiated but not control U937 cells, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI/MS) analyses indicate that differentiated cells contain a higher proportion of arachidonate-containing GPC species than control cells. U937 cells express iPLA2 mRNA and activity, but iPLA2 inhibition impairs neither [3H]arachidonate incorporation into nor release from U937 cells. Experiments with phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAPH) and phospholipase D (PLD) inhibitors coupled with ESI/MS analyses of PLD-PAPH products indicate that differentiated cells gain the ability to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) via PLD-PAPH. DAG promotes arachidonate release by a mechanism that does not require DAG hydrolysis, is largely independent of protein kinase C, and requires cPLA2activity.

The first PLA2 enzymes to be well characterized have low molecular masses (∼14 kDa), require mm[Ca2+] for catalysis, and function as extracellular, secreted enzymes (sPLA2) (6.Dennis E.A.

A. 1990; 87: 7708-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The cPLA2 enzyme is induced to associate with its membrane substrates by rises in cytosolic [Ca2+], is also regulated by phosphorylation, and prefers substrates with sn-2 arachidonoyl residues (5.Gijon M.A. Leslie C.C.

Both undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells undergo a similar rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] when treated with Ca2+ ionophores (3.Rzigalinski B.A. Blackmore P.F. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Because Ca2+-store depletion also induces arachidonate release from differentiated U937 cells (3.Rzigalinski B.A. Blackmore P.F. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) raise the questions of whether U937 cells express iPLA2 and whether differentiation increases its expression. Differentiation induced expression of Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity does occur in HL-60 cells (22.Hullin-Matsuda F. Tsuhishita Y. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a human myeloblast cell line that, like U937 cells, differentiates when treated with Me2SO (1.Harris P. Ralph P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 37: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). U937 cells have been reported to express a Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity that participates in Fas-induced apoptosis and arachidonate release under conditions in which cPLA2 is inactivated proteolytically by caspases (23.Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but whether this activity resides in iPLA2 gene product(s) has not been established. The possible participation of iPLA2 in U937 cell apoptosis (23.Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) is of interest because Ca2+-store depletion induces apoptosis of pancreatic islet β-cells by a mechanism that does not require a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] but that does require arachidonate release and metabolism (24.Zhou Y.-P. Teng D. Drayluk F. Ostrega D. Roe M.W. Philipson L. Polonsky K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ca2+-store depletion also induces arachidonic acid hydrolysis from β-cell phospholipids by a BEL-sensitive mechanism thought to reflect iPLA2 action (20.Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Ma Z. Hsu F.-F. Bohrer A. Turk J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The iPLA2 enzyme has also been proposed to provide lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acceptors for arachidonate incorporation into glycerophosphocholine (GPC) lipids in murine P388D1 cells (25.Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackerman E.J. Conde-Friebos K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,26.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

If increased iPLA2 expression occurred upon U937 differentiation and accelerated arachidonate incorporation into GPC, any resultant accumulation of arachidonate-containing GPC lipids might increase hydrolysis of arachidonate from U937 cell phospholipids by cPLA2. Increasing the mole fraction of arachidonate-containing GPC species in lipid vesicles has been reported to facilitate hydrolysis of substrates by cPLA2 in a cooperative manner (27.Burke J. Witmer M.R. Tredup J. Micanovic R. Gregor K.R. Lahiri J. Tramposch K.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15165-15174Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although this effect is influenced by other lipids in such vesicles (28.Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we examine effects of differentiation on U937 cell GPC lipid composition, expression of Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity, sensitivity of this activity to BEL, and effects of BEL on arachidonate incorporation into and release from U937 cell phospholipids.

U937 cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2% glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids (w/v). Differentiation was induced by treating (96 h) cells (2.5 × 105/ml) with 1.2% Me2SO (v/v). Cells were labeled (24 h) with [3H]arachidonic acid (0.1 μCi/ml) and washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to remove unincorporated label.

These products were then digested with endonuclease AvaI, which converted the RT-PCR product for LH-iPLA2 into two products (396 and 119 bp) and for SH-iPLA2 (353 bp) into two products (234 and 119 bp). These products correspond to the lengths expected from the corresponding cDNA sequences (15.Ma Z. Wang X. Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Turk J. J. Biol.

INS-1 insulinoma cells provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard (University of Texas-Southwestern, Dallas) were cultured as described (35.Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J.

Cells were disrupted by sonication (Vibra Cell, High Intensity Ultrasonic Processor) in homogenization buffer (0.25m sucrose, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1). Homogenates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 45 min) to yield a cytosolic supernatant, and protein content was determined. Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity in aliquots of cytosol (20 μg of protein) was assayed after injection in ethanol (5 μl) of the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (final concentration 5 μm) and incubating (5 min, 37 °C) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, total volume 200 μl). Lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC, and PLA2-specific activity was calculated from released [14C]arachidonate dpm and protein content as described (36.Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cytosol was preincubated (4 min, room temperature) with various concentrations of BEL before activity assays. U937 cell or INS-1 cell cytosolic proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoreactive iPLA2 was visualized with an antibody from Dr. Simon Jones (Genetics Institute, Boston), as described previously (31.Ramanadham S.

Assays examined conversion of [glycerol-14C]phosphatidic acid (PA) to [14C]diglyceride by cytosolic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAPH) and were performed as described previously (31.Ramanadham S.

U937 cells (106/ml) were preincubated (15 min, 37 °C) with vehicle only (control) or BEL (25 μm) in RPMI 1640 medium containing supplements described above. After preincubation, incorporation experiments (10–60 min, 37 °C) were initiated by adding [3H]arachidonic acid (0.5 μCi/ml, 5 nm). Cells were washed three times to remove unincorporated label. Lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC to isolate phospholipids, and their 3H content was determined as described (31.Ramanadham S. Hsu F.-F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For radiochemical experiments, U937 cells were labeled (24 h) with [3H]palmitic acid (3 μCi/106 cells), washed free of unincorporated label, and incubated without or with ionophore A23187 in the presence or absence of ethanol. Lipids were extracted, mixed with 18:1/18:1-phosphatidylethanol standard, and analyzed by TLC on silica gel G plates (Whatman) using the upper phase of a solvent system prepared with ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid/water (13:2:3:10). The phosphatidylethanol band was identified with iodine vapor and its 3H content determined. For ESI/MS analyses of U937 cell phosphatidylethanol species, experiments were similar, except that cells were not labeled with [3H]palmitate, and no standard phosphatidylethanol was added. For radiochemical experiments, U937 cells were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid as above and incubated without or with ionophore A23187 (1.5 μm) for 1–10 min. Lipids were extracted, mixed with 10 μg of dinonadecadienoin standard, and analyzed by TLC to isolate diacylglycerol (DAG) (31.Ramanadham S. Hsu F.-F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The3H content of the DAG was then determined. For ESI/MS analyses of U937 cell DAG species, experiments were similar, except that cells were not labeled with [3H]palmitate, and no dinonadecadienoin standard was added. Student's t test was used to compare two groups, and multiple groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Newman-Keul's analyses. When control, undifferentiated U937 cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonate and incubated with or without Ca2+ ionophore A23187, less than 2% of incorporated 3H was released into the medium. In similar experiments with Me2SO-differentiated U937 cells, A23187 induced release of 18% of incorporated 3H, and this was suppressed by the PLA2 inhibitor (39.Rosenthal M.D. Lattanzio K.S.

When phospholipids into which [3H]arachidonic acid was incorporated were examined by NP-HPLC, control U937 cells incorporated the majority of 3H into glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) lipids and a smaller amount into glycerophosphocholine (GPC) lipids (Table I). Differentiated U937 cells incorporated a greater proportion of 3H into GPC lipids than did control cells (Table I). Quantitation of arachidonate content of phospholipid extracts by isotope dilution GC/NIEC/MS after saponification indicated that the amount of esterified arachidonate per nmol of lipid phosphorus in differentiated U937 cells exceeded that in control cells (Table I). This suggests that differentiation of U937 cells is associated with an increased content of arachidonate-containing phospholipid species, and this possibility was examined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI/MS) analyses of U937 cell GPC and GPE lipids isolated by NP-HPLC.Table IEsterified arachidonate mass in U937 cell lipids and distribution of [ 3 H]arachidonate label among phospholipid classes[3H]Arachidonate content of phospholipid classU937 cellsTotal esterified arachidonate massPhosphatidylethanolaminePhosphatidic acidPhosphatidylcholineResting (R)R-A23187Resting (R)R-A23187Resting (R)R-A23187Resting (R)R-A23187pmol/nmol lipid Pdpm/nmol lipid PUndifferentiated173 ± 7−1.9 ± 0.41761 ± 331−122 ± 67439 ± 141−26 ± 25990 ± 20863 ± 58Me2SO-treated275 ± 1050 ± 1.92115 ± 432346 ± 283872 ± 167156 ± 1492223 ± 368823 ± 182Control and Me2SO-treated U937 cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonate, washed free of unincorporated label, and incubated without or with ionophore A23187 as in Fig. 1.

L., Ren, J., and Goss, D. J. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 1910–1916). We report here that the interaction between PABP and eIF-iso4G has a substantial effect on the ATPase activity and RNA helicase activity of (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF-iso4F) complex. ATPase kinetic assays show, in the presence of poly(U), PABP can increase the parameter (k cat/K m) by 3.5-fold with a 2-fold decrease of K m for the (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complex. In the presence of globin messenger RNA, the ATPase activity of the complex (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) was increased 2-fold by the presence of PABP. RNA helicase assays demonstrated that the presence of PABP enhanced the RNA duplex unwinding activity of the initiation factor complex. These results suggest that, in terms of the scanning model of translation initiation, PABP may enhance the mRNA scanning rate of the complex formed by eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F or eIF-(iso)4F and increase the rate of translation.

The cap-dependent binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosome is mediated by at least three eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF),1 eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B, and requires energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (1.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar, 2.Merrick W.C. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that the cap structure and poly(A) tail act in a cooperative manner to regulate the translation of mRNAs (3.Munroe D. Jacobson A. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 91: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4.Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated that the cooperative effect is related to the interaction among eIF-iso4G, eIF4B, and PABP, which increases the poly(A) binding affinity of PABP and the m7G-cap binding affinity of eIF4F and eIF-iso4F (5.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 6.Wei C.C.

In wheat germ and other plants, an isozyme form of eIF4F called eIF-iso4F has been found (7.Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF-iso4F shows an indistinguishable function from eIF4F in supporting in vitro translation (8.Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains two subunits, a 28-kDa eIF-iso4E and an 86-kDa eIF-iso4G. The eIF-iso4E acts as the binding site of m7GpppN cap. The function of eIF-iso4G is not well characterized. It binds to mRNA in an ATP-dependent manner, may interact with eIF4A and eIF4B (9.Balasta M.L. Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Perez R.A. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18599-18603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, more interestingly, may interact with PABP (5.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). cDNA analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence of eIF-iso4G contained possible motifs for ATP binding, metal binding, and phosphorylation (10.Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both eIF4F and eIF-iso4F show RNA-dependent ATPase activity, which is stimulated by the presence of eIF4A (11.Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP-dependent helicase activity in the presence of eIF4A (12.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C.

Recently, four initiation factors of wheat germ, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF-iso4E, and eIF-iso4G, were expressed inEscherichia coli (14.van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translation measurements indicated that expressed initiation factors had the same capacity to support translation in wheat germ extracts as native factors purified from wheat germ (14.van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic protein biosynthesis, the binding of mRNA to the small (40 S) ribosomal subunit is the rate-limiting step and is a key target for regulation (15.Jagus R. Anderson W.F. Safer B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1981; 25: 127-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 17.Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

Two models were proposed for the pathway of binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In the first model (1.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar), the first step in mRNA binding is the recognition of m7GpppN cap by eIF4F or eIF-iso4F, and then unwinding of secondary structure in combination with eIF4A and eIF4B in the 5′-untranslated region, to create a single-strand RNA, which serves as the binding site for the 43 S preinitiation complex. In the second model (19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi B. Minich W.B. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), eIF4E binds to m7GpppN cap first and then associates with eIF4G, which is already bound to the 43 S complex. Despite the differences in the two models, both models require that, once bound to the cap, the eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B complex must scan along mRNA to unwind secondary structure before reaching the initiation codon AUG. Therefore, the scanning step is most likely the rate-limiting step for mRNA binding to the 43 S preinitiation complex, and a potential target for regulation. The communication between 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail is a key regulation pathway for mRNA translation (reviewed in Ref. 4.Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, the role of PABP in the scanning step has not been determined. In order to begin to answer this question, in this investigation, we have studied the effect of PABP on ATPase and RNA helicase activity of wheat germ initiation factors. PABP stimulates the ATPase activity of initiation factors in a poly(U)- or mRNA-dependent manner. The helicase activity is also enhanced, suggesting a role for PABP in the rate of scanning by the initiation factor complex. eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF-iso4E, and eIF-iso4G were expressed in E. coli containing the constructed pET3d or pET23d (for eIF4A only) vector in BL21(DE3) pLyS as described elsewhere (14.van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A HiTrap SP column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech was used to purify eIF-4B, eIF-iso4E, and eIF-iso4G by the following procedure. E. coli cells were disrupted by alumina, suspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) containing 600 mm KCl (B-600), and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 2 h. The supernatant was diluted with B-0 to a final concentration of 60 mm KCl, and loaded onto a 2 × 5-ml Hitrap SP column and washed by B-60 buffer to base line. A 60–1000 mm KCl linear gradient of a total volume 80 ml was used to elute the proteins. 1.0-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by 10% SDS-gel electrophoresis. All steps were carried out in a cold box at approximately 5 °C. The pH of buffer B used for eIF-iso4E and eIF-iso4G purification was 7.0; for eIF4B it was 7.5. The proteins appeared in the 200–300 mm KCl fractions. eIF4A was purified by using a 10-ml column and His-Bind kits from Novagen. The binding and washing buffer was 5.0 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9. eIF4A was eluted by 100 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9. The purification procedure of PABP was as described previously (21.Le H. Chang S.C. Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with some modification. The 30–60% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of the 50-g wheat germ extract was loaded onto a 100-ml Affi-Blue gel column. The column was washed with 4 m NaCl in buffer A (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mmKOAc, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgOAc, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 mm DTT), and PABP was eluted with 2.0 mguanidine hydrochloride in buffer A. The eluted protein was dialyzed in buffer A containing 10% glycerol, then 0.2 mg/ml poly(C) was added, and the sample was loaded onto a 2.0-ml poly(A)-Sepharose 4B column, and washed to base line by buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl. PABP was eluted by 1 m urea and 2 m LiCl in buffer A, and subsequently dialyzed against buffer A. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method, with bovine serum albumin as a standard (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity was determined by measuring the release of 32Pi as described previously (23.Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay was carried out in a reaction volume of 20 μl, which contained 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgOAc, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (total amount of ATP was 2000 pmol; 200–800 cpm/pmol were used), 0.1 μg of poly(U), and indicated amounts of initiation factors. For the ATPase kinetic assay, 5-μl aliquots of reaction mixture were taken from the standard assay solution at the indicated times. The extent of hydrolysis of ATP was measured within 5% of the initial ATP concentration in the kinetic assays. All assays were performed at 25 °C. All values were corrected for the amount of 32Pi released in the absence of poly(U) and initiation factors. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys, and were purified by precipitation with 2 volumes of ethanol in TES (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA) adjusted to 0.5m ammonium acetate, chilling at −20 °C for 2 h, centrifuging and then washing with cold 70% ethanol. A 12-mer RNA oligonucleotide (5′-GCUUUACGGUGC), the bottom strand of the RNA duplex used in the helicase assay, was synthesized by Cybergen and purified by a denaturing (8.0 m urea) 20% polyacrylamide (19:1 bisacrylamide:acrylamide) gel. The top strand of RNA duplex used in RNA helicase assay, 5′-GGGGAGA(A4C)5UAGCACCGUAAAGCACGC (a 50-mer RNA oligonucleotide), was synthesized by in vitrotranscription using T7 RNA polymerase. The template for transcription was composed of the following synthetic DNA oligonucleotides: T7 polymerase promotor, 5′-GAATTTAATACGACTCACTATA, and 3′-CTTAAATTATGCTGAGTGATAT*CCCCTCT(TTTTG)5ATCGTGGCATTTCGTGCG-5′ (* denotes the transcription start site). The transcription reaction was performed using Ambion's MegashortscriptTMtranscription kit following the manufacturer's instructions. After the reaction, the transcription solution was mixed with 10 murea, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and loaded on to a denaturing (8.0m urea) 20% polyacrylamide (19:1 bisacrylamide:acrylamide) gel. The bands containing the transcription product were cut out and extracted with 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 2.0 mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. Synthesized RNA oligonucleotide was precipitated from the extraction buffer with 2.5 volumes of ethanol, washed with ethanol, lyophilized, and resuspended in RNase-free water. Concentrations of RNA oligonucleotides were measured by UV spectroscopy. A value of 33 μg/1.0 A 260 was used to determine the concentration. The bottom strand of RNA duplex (12-mer) was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Forty picomoles of bottom strand RNA oligonucleotide and 10 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) were combined with 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (20 μl final volume), and the reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled RNA oligonucleotide was purified by a denaturing (8.0 m urea) 20% polyacrylamide (19:1 bisacrylamide:acrylamide) gel as described above. The RNA duplex used in the helicase reaction was made by combining the top strand (50-mer) and32P-labeled bottom strand (12-mer) oligonucleotides in a 1.5:1 ratio. The complementary strands were annealed (20 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EDTA) in a water bath heated to 98 °C for 5.0 min, and cooled slowly in a cold box (about 5 °C) with gentle stirring. Under these conditions, about 75% of the labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized. The assay was performed as described previously (24.Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) in a buffer that contained 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 2.0 mm DTT, 2.0 mm magnesium acetate, and 2.0 units/μl RNase inhibitor RNAsin (Promega). The concentration of ATP was 2.0 mm, duplex concentration was about 2.5 nm, and the concentrations of eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF-iso4F, and PABP were 1.0 μm. The final reaction volume was 10 μl. The reaction was started by addition of eIF4A or the initiation factor complex (as indicated in Fig. 6), and incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 2.5 μl of a solution containing 50% glycerol, 2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Unwinding reaction products were analyzed by separating the displaced labeled bottom strand from the duplex by electrophoresis on 12% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer at ambient temperature (about 25 °C). Radioautographs were generated by exposing the gels to Fuji RX x-ray film and developed by standard procedures. The bands containing the unwound labeled bottom strand and the duplex were cut and counted. The percentage of unwound duplex was calculated by the following formula: % unwound = (cpm of bottom band − cpm of background of bottom band)/(cpm of top band + cpm of bottom band − cpm of background of bottom band). The cpm of the background of bottom band was obtained from the corresponding band of the RNA duplex in the absence of proteins (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). According to the scanning model of translation initiation, the scanning step, i.e. scanning along mRNA and unwinding secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA by the complex formed by eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F, requires energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (1.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar, 19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi B. Minich W.B.

Recent studies have shown that, in the wheat germ system, the communication between cap and poly(A) tail involved the interaction between PABP and eIF-iso4G and eIF4B. The interaction increased the poly(A) binding affinity of PABP and m7GTP binding affinity of eIF-iso4F and eIF4F (5.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These results suggest PABP may also affect ATPase and helicase activity. Fig. 1 shows the effect of PABP on the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complex. Clearly, PABP stimulates substantially the ATPase activity of the complex. The effect of PABP on ATPase activities of initiation factores and their complexes are summarized in Table I. The ATPase activity of eIF4B or PABP alone, if any, is hardly detectable. eIF4A or eIF-iso4G alone exhibits ATPase activity, consistent with previous observations (11.Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of equimolar concentrations of eIF-iso4E and eIF-iso4G has the same ATPase activity as eIF-iso4G alone. The ATPase activity of expressed eIF-iso4G or (eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G) is higher than eIF-iso4F purified directly from wheat germ (11.Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, from Table I we can see the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G) is higher than the additive ATPase activity of eIF4A and (eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G) (Table I, 201 pmol > 26 + 91 pmol), indicating eIF4A has a synergistic stimulatory effect on eIF-iso4F ATPase activity. However, the extent of stimulation of eIF4A on ATPase activity of eIF-iso4F is much lower than its effect on eIF-iso4F purified from wheat germ (11.Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to the fact that expressed eIF-iso4F is more active than the native eIF-iso4F purified from wheat germ. One possible interpretation of this difference is that the phosphorylation state of expressed eIF-iso4F is different from that of native eIF-iso4F purified from wheat germ. cDNA analysis indicated that eIF-iso4G has two potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (amino acids 396–399 and 501–504) and two potential casein kinase phosphorylation sites (amino acids 627–631 and 703–708) (10.Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which may be involved in translational regulation. Phosphorylation of eIF4E has been shown to affect its binding affinity for the cap structure (26.Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the function of eIF-iso4F might be regulated by phosphorylation, which is a post-translational phenomena (27.Gallie D.R. Le H. Caldwell C. Tanguay R.L. Hoang N.X. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1046-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite the difference in ATPase activity, expressed eIF-iso4F exhibited the same capacity to supportin vitro translation as native eIF-iso4F purified from wheat germ when satellite tobacco necrosis viral RNA was used as the messenger (14.van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IATPase activities of initiation factors and their complexes in the standard assay solution containing 0.1 μg of poly(U)No.4A4Biso4Eiso4GPABPPi releasedμgpmol11.526263389246151.565061.5665872.589181.52.5820191.52.586647101.58193111.586525121.562.58198131.562.586506141.562.586425 (0.1 mm m7GTP)153.635163.6486The errors in picomoles of Pi released for a given set of experiments were about ±5% (1 ς).

Open table in a new tab The errors in picomoles of Pi released for a given set of experiments were about ±5% (1 ς). Variation among replicate experiments was about 25% for different protein preparations; however, the magnitude of the PABP stimulation varied less than 10% among replicate experiments. PABP exhibits a strong stimulation of ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complex (Fig. 1 and Table I). The ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G + PABP) complex is 3 times the activity of the complex without PABP (Table I, 647 pmol versus 201 pmol). The presence of other initiation factors, such as eIF4B and eIF-iso4E, has no substantial effect on the stimulatory effect of PABP (Table I). However, 0.1 mm m7GTP (same as the concentration of ATP in the assay solution) does produce inhibition of the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G) complex (TableI, nos. 9 and 14). The inhibitory effect of m7GTP is mediated by its interaction with eIF-iso4E, since no inhibition was observed in the mixture without adding eIF-iso4E. The stimulatory effect of PABP is shown more clearly in Fig.2. The ATPase activity of eIF4A is enhanced 2-fold by the presence of eIF4B, and is further stimulated by the presence of PABP (Fig. 2 A). The interaction between PABP and eIF-iso4G greatly enhances the ATPase activity of the initiation factor mixture (Fig. 2 B). The ATPase activity of eIF-iso4G alone is enhanced more than 2-fold by the presence of PABP (Table I, nos. 15 and 16). But the ATPase activity of eIF-iso4G in the presence of PABP accounts for less than one third of the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4G) or (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complex in the presence of PABP (Table I, comparing no. 16 to no. 9 or 11). PABP enhances the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) by stimulating the synergistic effect of the two factors. The above results were obtained in the presence of poly(U). It is known that the ATPase activity of the initiation factor complex is dependent on the properties of the RNA present in the assay solution (11.Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of PABP on the ATPase activity of the initiation factor complex in the presence of globin mRNA. Fig.3 shows the effect of PABP on the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complex in the presence of globin messenger RNA. PABP increased the ATPase activity of the complex about 2-fold. However, the ATPase activity of the complex in the presence of globin mRNA is about half the activity in the presence of poly(U). An unexpected observation is that the stimulatory effect of PABP is dependent on poly(U) concentration. Poly(U) at higher concentration abolishes much of the effect of PABP on the ATPase activity of the (eIF4A + eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G) mixture (Fig.4 A). In the absence of PABP, increasing the poly(U) concentration leads to slight enhancement of ATPase activity (Fig. 4 B). It has been shown that (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) or (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complexes have different ATPase activity when different RNA were present in the assay solution (11.Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23.Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this is not clear since the mechanism of (eIF4A + eIF4F) complex unwinding of RNA structure with energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is not well understood. An interpretation of the effect of poly(U) (shown in Fig. 4 A) is that the inhibitory effect of high poly(U) concentrations may be due to a mechanism whereby the release of poly(U) is prior to the release of (ADP + Pi). If poly(U) release is the rate-limiting step and is reversible, an increase in poly(U) concentration would slow down the rate of the reaction. Interestingly, such a mechanism would provide a motor force for the movement along RNA. The parameters K m andk cat/K m were determined for the ATPase activity of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4E + eIF-iso4G) complex in the presence or absence PABP (Fig. 5,A and B). The K m value for the mixture in the presence of PABP is 40 ± 5 μm; in the absence of PABP, K m is 93 ± 22 μm. The presence of PABP induces a 2-fold decrease inK m value. In addition, PABP leads to a 3-fold increase in k cat/K m value. There is no unique interpretation for the effect of PABP on theK m ork cat/K m value of (eIF4A + eIF-iso4F) complex since the ATPase activity of the complex is enhanced synergistically by the presence of the both factors, while the mechanism of this effect is unknown. The above results clearly demonstrate that PABP increased the ATPase activity of the initiation factor complex. The effect of PABP on the RNA helicase activity of the initiation factor complex therefore was investigated. Fig. 6 shows the autoradiography results of the RNA helicase assay. Fig. 6 Ashows that PABP alone has no helicase activity. ATP hydrolysis is required (lanes 5 and 6). Two nonspecific RNA-binding proteins: MAX, which also binds DNA, and T7 RNA polymerase, had no effect on the unwinding reaction (lanes 7–9). Wheat germ eIF4A has no significant unwinding activity of the RNA duplex (radiograph not shown; Fig. 6 C). eIF4B has some stimulation effect on the unwinding activity of eIF4A (Fig. 6 C; radiograph not shown), whereas the same RNA duplex can be unwound successfully by mammalian eIF4A and (eIF4A + eIF4B) complex (24.Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF-iso4F) complex exhibits full RNA helicase activity of the RNA duplex (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1–5). The RNA helicase activity of the complex is ATP-dependent. In the absence of ATP, no detectable unwinding of the RNA duplex is observed for the (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF4-iso4F) complex (Fig. 6 A, lane 5; data not shown). Additionally, PABP increases the RNA duplex unwinding activity of (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF-iso4F) complex (Fig.6, b (lanes 6–10) and c). These results suggest that the RNA helicase activity of the (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF-iso4F) complex is coupled with the ATPase activity of the complex. PABPs have been found in all eukaryotic cells studied thus far. Sequence analysis has revealed the extensive evolutionary conservation of the yeast, plant, and human PABP-encoding genes (20.Yang J. Hunt A.G. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21.Le H. Chang S.C. Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Early studies have suggested that PABP may be the mediator of the role of poly(A) tail (reviewed in Ref. 3.Munroe D. Jacobson A. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 91: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggestion has been confirmed by recent studies, which demonstrated that interactions among eIF4G, eIF4B, and PABP enhance the cap binding affinity of eIF-iso4F and poly(A) binding affinity of PABP (5.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 6.Wei C.C. Balasta M.L. Ren J. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the interaction of PABP with eIF4G and eIF4B can increase the ability of the initiation factor complex to discriminate between capped and polyadenylated mRNA from capped nonpolyadenylated mRNA, or uncapped and polyadenylated mRNA, and therefore provide a competitive advantage for the efficient translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNA. Mutagenesis studies in the yeast system demonstrated that the interaction between eIF4G and PABP is a prerequisite for the stimulatory effect of poly(A) tail and the synergistic stimulatory effect of cap and poly(A) tail on in vitro translation (4.Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 28.Otero L.J. Ashe M.P. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29.Kessler S.H.

A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that PABP is involved in translation initiation as part of the initiation factor complex. In terms of the scanning model, the initial recognition of cap and poly(A) tail by the eIF4E and PABP in the initiation factor complex is the first step for the binding of 40 S ribosome to mRNA, which is followed by the unwinding of secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA with the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP (1.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar, 19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi B. Minich W.B.

The previous studies indicated that the interaction between PABP and eIF4G enhances the initial recognition of cap and poly(A) tail by eIF4E and PABP (5.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our present results show that the interaction between PABP and eIF4G and eIF4B also promotes the unwinding of secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA by the (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF-iso4F) complex. In the scanning model of translation initiation, it is likely the scanning step, which seems to be a multiple step process (24.Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), is the rate-limiting step of translation initiation, and a key target for translation regulation. The present results demonstrate that the interaction between PABP and eIF-iso4G increases both the ATPase activity and RNA helicase activity of the (eIF4A + eIF4B + eIF-iso4F) complex. Clearly, these results implicate PABP as an important component in the regulation of translation. The mechanism of how the initiation factor complex unwinds RNA secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA during translation initiation is not well understood. Our present results and the results of previous assays demonstrate that the full RNA helicase activity of eIF4A needs the concerted action of two other factors, eIF4B and eIF4F or eIF-iso4F (24.Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). It has been suggested recently that eIF4A might undergo a cycle of conformational changes during ATP hydrolysis and that such conformational changes might be used by eIF4A to transduce the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to physical work to unwind RNA secondary structure (31.Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since there is no direct interaction between PABP and eIF4A (5.Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), the role of PABP in the RNA helicase activity might be to stimulate the actions of eIF4B and eIF4F or eIF-iso4F in promoting the conformational change of eIF4A. Another possibility, suggested by the concentration dependence of poly(U) stimulation of ATPase activity (Fig. 4), is that PABP is involved in the release step of mRNA binding, which allows movement along the mRNA. A simple mechanism would involve binding of eIF4A to mRNA, stimulated by the presence of eIF4F or eIF-iso4F. eIF4B subsequently stimulated the ATPase activity by increasing the release of ADP, possibly through a cycle of conformational changes. PABP, interacting with eIF4G, stabilizes the complex and allows movement along the mRNA by promoting release from one binding site, which has now become single-stranded, and progression further along the mRNA to continue unwinding activity.

For example, the upstream signaling that accounts for up-regulation of p21 and p16 has been less understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)1 are serine/threonine kinases that play a central role in a wide variety of signaling pathways in eukaryotic organisms. They are activated at most downstream in the signaling cascade, which are initiated by various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and stresses. Subsequently, they convert those stimuli to intracellular signals that control gene expression, eventually leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (9.Davis R.J. J.

In mammalian cells, MAP kinases have been classified into three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and 2, JNK, and p38 kinase.

These enzymes are catalytically activated by MAPK kinase (MAPKK) through dual phosphorylation at two key regulatory threonine and tyrosine residues (12.Thomas G. Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The substrates of ERK1/2 distribute throughout cells from plasma membrane to the nucleus. Thus, subcellular localization of ERK1/2 is an important determinant of their functions. In response to extracellular stimuli, ERK1/2 are activated and translocate into the nucleus, while they are largely cytoplasmic in unstimulated cells (13.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H.

In this study, we investigated activation and localization of ERK1/2 in replicatively senescent human fibroblasts and tried to elucidate their involvement in cellular senescence. Given the positive role of ERK1/2 in cell cycle entry, it was suspected that the signaling pathway controlled by ERK1/2 should be down-regulated somehow in the senescent cells that withdraw from cell cycle irreversibly. We show evidence that nuclear localization but not activation of ERK1/2 is impaired in the senescent cells and that relocalization of ERK1/2 in the nuclei of the senescent cells is sufficient or required for overcoming some of the senescent phenotypes. TIG-3 and TIG-7, the human cell lines of normal diploid fibroblasts, provided by the Japanese Cancer Resources Bank were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The cultures were divided 1:4; 1 passage was comparable to 2 PD (population doublings). We considered the cell population around 60 PD as the senescent stage when less than 6% of the cells incorporated BrdUrd after 72 h and more than 90% were senescence-associated β-galactosidase positive, which is a biomarker of cellular senescence (16.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Smith O.P. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Monoclonal antibodies used in this study are anti-HA epitope (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-SV40 large T antigen (Pub101, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-pan ERK1/2 (ERK1 + ERK2, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-activated MAP kinase (Sigma), and anti-Myc tag (Invitrogen). Polyclonal antibodies are anti-Sp-1 (sp-1(pep2)-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-active ERK1/2 (the dual-phosphorylated p44/42MAPK, Promega), anti-phospho-Elk-1 (Ser383) (New England Biolabs), anti-HA (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-luciferase (Transformation Research, Inc.). Secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody were purchased from DAKO. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) or disrupted with Dounce homogenizer and fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and -resistant fractions in the buffer (10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The proteins were quantified using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts were loaded in each lane. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were then probed with a primary antibody followed by a secondary one. The immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's protocol (NENTM Life Science Products). ERK kinase activity was measured with p44/42 MAP Kinase Assay Kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, immune complex precipitated by anti-active ERK1/2 antibody was incubated with a Elk-1 fusion protein in the presence of ATP, and phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Ser383, which was a major phosphorylation site by ERK1/2, was evaluated by Western blotting using a phospho-Elk-1 antibody. The bands derived from phospho-Elk-1 was quantified by Lightcapture (ATTO, Co., Tokyo) and normalized by total amount of ERK1/2 existing in the starting material of cell lysate. A series of HA-tagged ERK2 expression vectors, including wild-type, nuclear localization signal (NLS)-added (+NLS), and kinase-defective (kd) vectors, was constructed using a pCG-HA vector (17.Hirai H. Suzuki T. Fujisawa J. Inoue J. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3584-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of ERK2 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and inserted into the vector with or without a NLS sequence. The NLS sequence used here was derived from SV40 large T antigen and expressed at the N-terminal of the resulting fusion protein with ERK2. A kinase-defective ERK2 derivative (kd-ERK) mutated at Lys44 to Arg and Lys45 to Arg (18.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Nishida (Kyoto University). The luciferase reporters were based on the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). Promoter fragments of c-fos (−2.2 or −0.74 kilobases) were subcloned into the vector to yield c-fos(−2.2) and (−0.74) luciferase reporter. The c-fos SRE sequence was mutated using the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CCCTCCCCCCTTACAACTGATGTCCATATTAGG-3′ to yield mSRE/fos luciferase reporter (21.Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). SV40 large T antigen expression plasmid, SV0ri9-8-16, was obtained from DNA Bank, Tsukuba Life Science Center, RIKEN. E1A expression plasmid, pAd2-12S.E.1A (22.Nakajima T. Nakamura T. Tsunoda S. Nakada S. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2837-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Oda (Science University of Tokyo). TIG-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips. After 24 h, plasmids were microinjected into the nuclei in the culture medium buffered with 0.01 m Hepes for 0.3 s at the constant pressure of 60 hPa. Effector and reporter plasmids were diluted with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to final concentrations of 10 and 250 μg/ml, respectively. The injection marker, mouse or rabbit normal IgG, was microinjected together with the plasmids at a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml when needed. Injections were performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 135, Eppendorf 5171 micromanipulater, and Eppendorf 5242 injector. Cells, plated on glass coverslips, were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 8 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with PBS and nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells on the coverslips were then incubated successively with the primary and secondary antibody diluted in PBS/bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Each incubation was accompanied by four washes in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min each. Subsequently, coverslips were incubated for 2 min in a 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution (0.5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS) to stain DNA, rinsed with PBS, and mounted with glycerol. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using an Axioskope microscope (Carl Zeiss). As for the luciferase assay, the reporter and the injection marker, mouse normal IgG (mIgG), or the effector plasmid were co-microinjected into the cells. The injected cells were identified by immunostaining using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody alone or in combination with anti-HA. Luciferase positive cells were visualized by immunostaining using anti-luciferase antibody and microscopically counted. A BrdUrd incorporation assay was performed with a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effector plasmids (10 μg/ml) were microinjected with the injection marker, rabbit normal IgG (10 mg/ml), into the senescent TIG-7 cells. After labeling with BrdUrd, the cells were fixed and incubated with the anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody, followed by a mixture of secondary antibodies to mouse IgG (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled) and to rabbit IgG (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled). The DNA was stained with DAPI to locate the nuclei. We first examined the activation of ERK1/2 upon growth stimuli in pre- and senescent TIG-3 and -7 human normal diploid fibroblasts. The results of Western blotting using the antibody that specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 (anti-active ERK1/2) clearly showed that both ERK1/2 were phosphorylated in senescent cells in response to 10% FCS as efficiently as in presenescent cells with the same time course (Fig. 1 A). To verify and compare the kinase activity of ERK1/2 quantitatively between pre- and senescent cells, in vitro kinase assay was performed using Elk-1 as a substrate. In parallel with the increase in phosphorylation, kinase activity of ERK1/2 was remarkably elevated in the cell lysate from the senescent cells as well as that from presenescent cells in response to 10% FCS (Fig. 1 B). Almost equal levels of activation were observed in pre- and senescent cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner to the stimulus. Together, the results clearly demonstrated that the signals were properly transmitted from cell surface receptors to ERK1/2 in the senescent cells. Despite the proper activation accompanying the phosphorylation, which was reported to be sufficient to cause nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 (14.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), we found that the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 in the senescent cells were distributed exclusively in the 0.1% Triton-soluble fraction and not in the insoluble fraction containing nuclei either in the presence or absence of the stimulus. In the presenescent cells, the increase in the phosphorylated forms was observed not only in the soluble but also insoluble fractions. The increase in the insoluble fraction appeared to be underestimated possibly because of redistribution of the nuclear proteins during fractionation of the cells (Fig. 1 C). To investigate the localization of ERK1/2 in the cells in further detail, we conducted immunostaining. When the presenescent cells were immunostained with the antibody to ERK1/2 after treatment with PDGF, strong nuclear staining was observed with faint residual staining in the cytoplasm from 30 to 120 min after stimulation in all of the cells, as originally found by Chen et al. (23.Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). In the senescent cells, however, the staining signals were not concentrated in the nuclei but diffusely distributed within the cells at any time point from 1 to 120 min after the stimulation as shown in Fig. 2 B. Essentially the same results were obtained using an antibody to active forms of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2 C). In this case, faint nucler staining was sometimes observed in nearly but not completely senescent cells. However, even in such cells, the nuclear staining was remarkably weak compared with that in the presenescent cells. Therefore, it was most likely that the nuclear localization of the activated forms of ERK1/2 was significantly depressed in the senescent cells. Subsequently, we confirmed the above result using HA-tagged ERK2 exogenously expressed by microinjection and visualized with the antibody to the tag. Nuclei were barely stained in the senescent cells (Fig.3 B), while strong nuclear signals were observed in the presenescent cells in response to serum stimulation (Fig. 3 A). Since Sp1 transcription factor was detected in the nuclei of the senescent cells (Fig. 2 B, right panels), the accessibility of antibodies to the nuclei did not appear to be generally hindered during preparation of the senescent cells.Figure 3Nuclear localization of ERK2 but not NLS-dependent nuclear transport was inhibited in the senescent cells. A and B, the expression plasmid of HA-tagged ERK2 (wild-type) was microinjected into pre- (A) or senescent (B) TIG-7 cells and the cells were incubated in a serum-starved medium. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with 10% FCS for 0 (−) and 1 h (+) and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling with the antibody against the HA epitope (left panel). DNA was stained with DAPI (right). In 89.5% of the presenescent cells, ERK2 was localized in the nuclei in response to serum, while 12.0% of the senescent cells examined showed nuclear localization of ERK2. C, D, and E, SV40 large T antigen (C), HA-tagged −/+NLS-ERK2 plasmids (D and E) were microinjected into the pre- (D) or senescent (Cand E) cells. After 24 h, the cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling using the antibody to SV40 large T antigen (C) or HA epitope (D and E); representative fields are shown in the left panels. DNA was stained with DAPI (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the above notion was correct, it was reasoned that substrates of ERK1/2 in the nuclei should remain unphoshorylated in the senescent cells even when the cells were stimulated to activate the kinase. This possibility was examined using a transcription factor, Elk-1, which was a well established substrate of ERK1/2 in the nuclei (11.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 30.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 31.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). To this end, the expression plasmid of Myc-tagged Elk-1 was introduced into the cells by microinjection. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with PDGF, and the phosphorylation of Elk-1 was visualized by immunostaining with the antibody to phospho-Elk-1. As predicted, the nuclei of the senescent cells were hardly immunostained with the anti-phospho-Elk antibody despite the successful expression of the Elk-1 protein, which was proven by immunostaining with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4 A). Under the same condition, the nuclei of the presenescent cells were distinctively stained with the antibody in response to the stimulus (Fig.4 A). The fraction of the nuclei positive for phosphorylation of Elk-1 was estimated microscopically, and the abolishment of Elk-1 phosphorylation in the senescent cells was evidently shown (Fig.4 B). Similarly, the phosphorylation of Elk-1 in the nuclei was significantly inhibited in the senescent cells when the constitutive active form of MAPKK was expressed to activate ERK1/2 instead of the PDGF treatment (Fig. 4 C). Only in 7.0% of the senescent cells, the phosphorylation of Elk-1 occurred, whereas 89.7% nuclei were positive in the presenescent cells. These experiments provided further support for the conclusion that nuclear localization was impaired in the senescent cells. This phenomenon was observed not only in the senescent cells obtained from both TIG-3 and -7 but also in quasi-senescent young cells that were exposed to H2O2 and irreversibly ceased to proliferate long before replicatively senescing (data not shown). In addition, similar observations were reported in senescent and terminally differentiated melanocytes (24.Medrano E.E. Yang F. Boissy R. Farooqui J. Shah V. Matsumoto K. Nordlund J.J. Park H.-Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this case, however, ERK2 was retained in the cytoplasm only because it was not phosphorylated and thus inactive. These results implied that the inhibition of nuclear translocation was closely associated with the irreversible growth-arrested state and not merely a defect as a consequence of an accumulative number of cell divisions of the senescent cells. In accordance with this notion, ERK1/2 were found to be localized in the nuclei in an immortalized TIG-3 derivative that had overcome the growth-arrested state of senescence and undergone an infinite number of cell divisions (data not shown). The above results would seem to indicate that the nuclear transport system of cellular proteins is generally impaired in the senescent cells. However, this was not the case as demonstrated in Fig.3 C. We examined the localization of SV40 large T antigen whose nuclear translocation depends on its NLS (25.Adam S.A. Gerace L. Cell. 1991; 66: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). SV40 large T antigen was found to be localized exclusively in the nuclei of the senescent cells as well as in normal cells, suggesting that the NLS-dependent nuclear transport system was not impaired in the senescent cells. Since nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 was independent of the NLS (13.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the machinery specific to ERK1/2 transportation appeared to be inhibited. Concerning the mechanism by which ERK1/2 are transported into nuclei, several possibilities have been proposed (11.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 13.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 15.Lenormand P. Brondello J.-M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26.Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); however, the details are still a matter for discussion. Inhibition of nuclear localization in senescent cells might result from the nuclear export of ERK1/2 by a nuclear export signal-like sequence, which predominated over their import. However, this is unlikely because even in the presence of leptomycin B, which is a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export signal function (27.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), ERK1/2 did not accumulate in the nuclei of the senescent cells (data not shown). Another possibility was that ERK1/2 were somehow masked or degraded so promptly in the nuclei of the senescent cells that they escaped detection. This was also unlikely, because +NLS-ERK2 (ERK2 carrying the NLS sequence of SV40 large T antigen at its N-terminal) that was forced to be localized in the nuclei by its NLS was clearly detected in the nuclei of the senescent cells by a similar immunofluorescence technique (Fig.3 E). The next question to be addressed here is as to whether relocalization of ERK1/2 could restore any of the senescent phenotypes. Although several transcription factors have been known to be substrates for ERK1/2 in the nuclei (9.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the biological significance of the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 had been unclear until the recent work done by Brunet et al. (11.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) which substantially showed that the inhibition of this translocation repressed the gene expression as well as the re-entry of cells to the S phase following growth factor stimuli. These results, together with our above observations, suggested that inhibition of some nuclear events in the senescent cells, including gene expression and DNA synthesis, was partly due to the retention of ERK1/2 in cytoplasm under growth stimuli, thereby blocking the signals to the nuclei. To test this hypothesis, we first focused on the c-fos gene expression in response to serum stimulation, which was repressed in the senescent cells (28.Seshadri T. Campisi J. Science. 1990; 247: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In quiescent young cells, c-fos is induced immediately after serum stimulation (29.Treisman R. Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), which depends on the relocalization of ERK1/2 into the nuclei (11.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The efficient transcriptional response of c-fos to serum is mediated via ternary complex formation on the serum response element (SRE) of the gene (21.Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As proven by Gille et al. (30.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 31.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), ERK1/2 played essential roles in this complex formation through phosphorylation of Elk-1, one of the components of the ternary complex. In the present study, transcriptional activity of the c-fos gene was monitored using the luciferase reporter that was placed under the 2.2-kilobase upstream sequence encompassing the c-fosenhancer/promoter. Prior to the experiment, we tested whether this reporter responded to serum appropriately. We microinjected the reporter plasmid together with an injection marker, mouse IgG, into the nuclei of pre- and senescent cells. Following 48 h of incubation in a serum-starved medium, cells were stimulated with 10% FCS for 2 h and immunostained with the antibody to luciferase (Fig.5 B). In the quiescent presenescent population, the number of luciferase positive cells increased from 10% of the basal level to 40% by serum stimulation (Fig. 5 A, bar 1, pre/-FCS; 2, Pre/+ FCS). In contrast, only 10% of the cells were luciferase positive even after serum stimulation of the senescent population (Fig. 5 A, bar 3, Senes/-FCS; 4, Senes/+ FCS). Thus, this assay was thought to reflect the transcriptional behavior of the endogenous c-fosgene. In addition, the increase in reporter activity was completely abrogated when the kinase-defective/dominant-negative ERK2 was co-microinjected with the reporter plasmid in the presenescent cells (data not shown), verifying the crucial role of ERK2 in the transcriptional response of c-fos in our system, as presented before (11.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 30.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 31.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we tried to recover c-fos inducibility in the senescent cells by forcing ERK to localize in the nuclei. To this end, we used the aforementioned +NLS-ERK2. The +NLS-ERK2 expression vector was co-microinjected with the c-fos reporter plasmid into the nuclei of the senescent cells; the cells were incubated for 48 h under the continuous presence of serum to ensure that the expressed +NLS-ERK2 was activated before being guided to the nuclei. The transcriptional activity was visualized as shown in Fig. 5 D, and the ratios of luciferase positive to injected cells are shown in Fig. 5 C. As expected, +NLS-ERK2 was localized in the nuclei as visualized with anti-HA (Fig. 5 D, middle panel(green)), and could recover c-fos transcriptional activity in the senescent cells (Fig. 5, C, bar 4, +NLS-ERK/fos, and middle of D(red)). Its efficiency in inducing c-fostranscription was as high as that in the presenescent cells stimulated with serum (Fig. 5, C, bar 1, Pre-mIgG/fos). In contrast, -NLS-ERK2, which remained in the cytoplasm, could not stimulate c-fos transcriptional activity even when overexpressed (Fig. 5, C, bar 3, -NLS-ERK/fos, and top of D). This transcriptional activation of the reporter by +NLS-ERK2 was considered to be relevant based on the following reasons. First, +NLS-ERK2 did not affect the transcriptional activity of transglutaminase that was expressed specifically in keratinocytes (data not shown). This suggested that the substrate(s) targeted by +NLS-ERK2 in the nuclei was specific to the c-fos enhancer/promoter. Second, kinase-defective +NLS-ERK2 (kd-ERK) did not induce an increase in the c-fos transcription (Fig. 5 C, bar 6, +NLS-kd-ERK/fos, and bottom ofD). Finally, the effect of +NLS-ERK2 was reduced to 40% when the ternary complex formation on SRE, which was assumed to be the nuclear target of ERK1/2, was specifically impaired by point mutations (21.Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 C, bar 5,+NLS-ERK/mSREfos). Therefore, one of the key targets of +NLS-ERK2 in the nuclei was thought to be Elk-1 in the ternary complex, and not to be nonphysiological substrates. The residual activity of 40% was thought to be attributable to other transcriptional elements such as cAMP response element adjacent to SRE and activated indirectly by ERK1/2 (32.Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greengerg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings substantially supported our hypothesis that the loss of c-fos inducibility in the senescent cells was the consequence of cytoplasmic retention of ERK1/2, and that nuclear targeting of ERK2 was sufficient for the transcriptional reactivation of c-fos. Previously, Atadja et al. (33.Atadja P.W. Stringer K.F. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported on hyperphosphorylation of serum response factor (SRF), another component in the ternary complex, resulting in the loss of SRE binding activity and transcriptional inhibition of c-fos in senescent cells. They proposed an age-specific phosphatase activity as one of the regulators of SRF phosphorylation, although neither the phosphorylation sites nor the phosphatase have been identified. On the other hand, phosphorylation at a specific serine residue of SRF has been demonstrated to increase its binding ability to DNA (34.Heidenreich O. Neininger A. Schratt G. Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Kraft R. Kostka S. Gaestel M. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14434-14443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Among the kinases that have been shown to phosphorylate the site of SRF are pp90 rsk and MAPKAP2, both of which are substrates of ERKs (34.Heidenreich O. Neininger A. Schratt G. Zinck R.

Therefore, to be compatible with the above results, it was speculated that nuclear-targeted ERK2 could improve not only Elk-1 activity directly but also the SRF activity indirectly through activation of either of the two kinases, leading to complete recovery of the ternary complex formation on SRE. The c-fos gene is the first to be activated in response to extracellular stimuli and thereafter affects the expression pattern of genes in a transcription factor network. Keeping in mind other transcription factors targeted by ERK1/2 in the nuclei, such as c-myc and NF-IL6 (9.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose activities also appeared to be repressed in the senescent cells, restoration of nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 could have profound effects on the expression pattern of a large number of genes in the senescent cells, leading to phenotypic rejuvenation of the cells. Next, we tested whether nuclear-targeted ERK2 counteracts cell cycle arrest during senescence. We micoinjected the expression plasmids of ERK2 into senescent cells and the effect on DNA synthesis was examined. After microinjection, the cells were incubated with BrdUrd in the presence of 10% serum for 48 h and then analyzed for BrdUrd incorporation by an immunofluorescence technique. In the senescent cells, +NLS-ERK2 alone could not induce DNA synthesis (data not shown). One of the reasons was thought to be a high expression of p16INK4a that was not suppressed by +NLS-ERK2. 2J. K.-Kaneyama, K. Nose, and M. Shibanuma, unpublished data. If so, adenovirus E1A protein could aid +NLS-ERK2 in stimulating DNA synthesis in the senescent cells, since E1A is able to cancel the effect of p16INK4a through binding to Rb. Actually, +NLS-ERK2 but not -NLS-ERK2 could stimulate DNA synthesis in the presence of E1A in 25.6% of the cells, when the basal level of DNA synthesis was only 2.1% (Fig. 6 A). This potentiation of DNA synthesis by +NLS-ERK2 in collaboration with E1A was reproducibly observed but the effect of +NLS-ERK2 seemed to be only modest. Based on these observations, we changed the approach and investigated the requirement of nuclear localization of ERK1/2 for reprogramming the senescent cells to proliferate. Given that the cellular senescent process comprises multiple stages and that the irreversible growth arrested state is brought about by several kinds of sequentially occurring events during the process (8.Stein G.H. Drullinger L.F. Soulard A. Dulic V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), it seemed natural that nuclear relocalization of ERK was not sufficient by itself to release the senescent cells from the constraints of the growth arrest. Instead, we hypothesized that nuclear relocalization of ERK could be one of the essential requirements for reinitiation of DNA synthesis. As natural sources to impose the senescent cells to re-enter cell cycle, viral oncogenes are famous to have such activity. Among them, SV40 large T antigen was the strongest inducer of DNA synthesis. It could induce DNA synthesis in 69.3% of the senescent cells in our system (Fig. 6 D, lane −), while E1A induced DNA synthesis in only 12.8% of them (Fig. 6 A, lane−). If nuclear localization of ERK1/2 is indispensable for overcoming the senescence-associated cell cycle arrest, it should accompany the effect of SV40 large T antigen in restoring DNA synthesis. Actually, nuclear localization of endogenous ERK1/2 (active forms) was detected in the senescent cells following expression of SV40 large T antigen by microinjection (Fig. 6,B and C). When the HA-tagged ERK2 was expressed exogenously together with SV40 large T antigen and the cells were stimulated with 10% FCS for 30 min, the signals visualized by either of anti-HA or anti-active ERK1/2 were concentrated in the nuclei of 58% of the senescent cells as a maximal response (Fig. 6 C, lanes SV40). With or without ERK2 exogenously overexpressed, similar results were obtained. E1A could also localize ERK1/2 in the nuclei to some extent (Fig. 6 C, lane E1A). However, it was less effective compared with SV40 large T antigen, which was in good agreement with the extent to which each protein could induce DNA synthesis. More importantly, DNA synthesis induced by SV40 large T antigen was significantly inhibited by co-microinjection of +NLS-kinase-defective/dominant-negative-ERK2 (Fig. 6 D). This suggested that the ability of SV40 large T antigen to induce DNA synthesis in the senescent cells was largely dependent on the activities of ERK1/2 within nuclei. These results strongly support the idea that localization of active ERK1/2 in the nuclei is one of the critical requirements for overcoming senescence along with other activities such as telomerase activity. In conclusion the growth-arrested state of senescent cells was accompanied by inhibition of the translocation of ERK1/2 into nuclei, which resulted in abrogation of nuclear activities such as gene expression and DNA synthesis in response to growth stimuli. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon would not only lead to a better understanding of senescence but also enable us to control the process pharmacologically or genetically.

They are co-secreted in response to changes in glucose concentration, and their mRNA levels are also regulated by glucose. The promoters of both genes share similar cis-acting sequence elements, and both bind the homeodomain transcription factor PDX1, which plays an important role in the regulation of the insulin promoter and insulin mRNA levels by glucose. Here we examine the role of PDX1 in the regulation of the human IAPP promoter by glucose. The experiments were facilitated by the availability of a human β-cell line (NES2Y) that lacks PDX1. NES2Y cells also lack operational KATPchannels, resulting in a loss of control of calcium signaling. We have previously used these cells to show that glucose regulation of the insulin gene is dependent on PDX1, but not calcium. In the mouse β-cell line Min6, glucose (16 mm) stimulated a 3.5–4-fold increase in the activity of a −222 to +450 IAPP promoter construct compared with values observed in 0.5 mm glucose. In NES2Y cells, glucose failed to stimulate transcriptional activation of the IAPP promoter. Overexpression of PDX1 in NES2Y cells failed to reinstate glucose-responsive control of the IAPP promoter. Glucose effects on the IAPP promoter were observed only in the presence of PDX1 when normal calcium signaling was restored by overexpression of the two KATP channel subunits SUR1 and Kir6.2. The importance of calcium was further emphasized by an experiment in which glucose-stimulated IAPP promoter activity was inhibited by the calcium channel blocker verapamil (50 μm). Verapamil was further shown to inhibit the stimulatory effect of glucose on IAPP mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that like the insulin promoter, glucose regulation of the IAPP promoter is dependent on the activity of PDX1, but unlike the insulin promoter, it additionally requires the activity of another, as yet uncharacterized factor(s), the activity of which is calcium-dependent.

Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). IAPP was originally isolated from amyloid deposits in islets of Langerhans from non-insulin-dependent diabetic pancreas and insulinomas (2.Westermark P. Wernstedt C. Wilander E. Hayden D.W.

In the case of insulin, multiplecis-acting elements located within a relatively short region (−1 to −360) upstream of the start site contribute to the regulation of the gene by glucose and other nutrients (11.German M.

J. 1994; 303: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, the cell signaling pathway linking glucose metabolism to the regulation of PDX1 DNA binding and insulin promoter activity has been described (16.Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). According to this model (17.Docherty K. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 29: 103-123Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), glucose stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, which in turn activates stress-activated protein kinase-2 (which is also known as RK or p38). This leads to phosphorylation and activation of a cytoplasmic form of PDX1 that migrates to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of the insulin gene. PDX1 also binds to A-box elements in the IAPP promoter (18.Bretherton-Watt D. Gore N. Boam D.S.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The present study was therefore undertaken to define the role of PDX1 in the regulation of IAPP gene transcription by glucose. The experiments utilized a human pancreatic β-cell line (NES2Y) that lacks PDX1. NES2Y is a proliferating human β-cell line derived from a patient with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (20.Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that these cells lack functional levels of the PDX1 protein (21.Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, NES2Y cells also lack functional KATP channels. As a consequence, NES2Y cells demonstrate a loss of stimulus/secretion coupling of insulin release (21.Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx into pancreatic β-cells represents a critical step in the regulation of both insulin and IAPP secretion (22.Wollheim C.B. Lang J.L. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). Using NES2Y cells as a model, it has previously been shown that glucose regulation of the insulin gene is dependent on the activity of PDX1, but occurs independently of any changes in [Ca2+]i (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, the results demonstrate that glucose regulation of the IAPP promoter is also dependent on the activity of PDX1, but additionally requires the activity of another, as yet uncharacterized factor(s), the activity of which is calcium-dependent. NES2Y cells were derived from islets of Langerhans isolated from the pancreas of a patient with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy as described previously (21.Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Isolated intact human islets were prepared and maintained as described previously (24.London N.J.M. Robertson C.S.M. Chadwick D.R. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Bell P.R.F. Clin. Transplant. 1994; 8: 421-459PubMed Google Scholar). Min6 cells, a β-cell line derived from transgenic mice expressing the SV40 large T antigen under the control of the rat insulin promoter (25.Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated myoclone fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 2 mm l-glutamine. IAPP gene promoter plasmids pTKCAT, pTAC−2798, pTAC−477, pTAC−391, pTAC−222, and pTAC−138 were constructed as described previously (19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the QIAGEN endotoxin-free maxipreparation method and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Transfection procedures and selection of G418-resistant stable cell lines were performed as described previously (26.Macfarlane W.M. Chapman J.C. Shepherd R.M. Hashmi M.N. Kamimura N. Cosgrove K.E. Hart A.W. Docherty H.M. Lindley K.L Aynsley-Green A. James R.F.L. Docherty K. Dunne M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34059-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All cell lines were derived by stable transfection of NES2Y cells: NES-PDX1 cells overexpress PDX1; NESK cells overexpress SUR1 and Kir6.2; and NISK9 cells overexpress PDX1, SUR1, and Kir6.2. Overexpression of the appropriate transgenes was confirmed by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and analysis of ion channel activity as described previously (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Macfarlane W.M. Chapman J.C. Shepherd R.M. Hashmi M.N. Kamimura N.

Transient CAT reporter gene assays were performed using the Quant-T-CAT assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Where appropriate, cells were incubated in the presence of 50 μm verapamil for 30 min prior to stimulation with 20 mm glucose. Samples were equalized for protein content as measured by the standard Bradford assay. Total RNA was prepared from Min6 cells using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using, as probe, a full-length human IAPP cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. A. Clark, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom) and a human insulin cDNA. Specific hybridization was then detected and quantified by direct imaging using a Packard Instantimager. The anti-PDX1 antibody was from Dr. C. V. E. Wright (Vanderbilt University), and the anti-IAPP antibody was from Dr. A. Clark. The monoclonal anti-insulin antibody (3B1) was from Professor C. N. Hales (University of Cambridge); the anti-GLUT2 antibody was from BioGenosys; the anti-glucokinase antibody was from Dr. S. Lenzen (University of Hannover); and the anti-PC3 and anti-PC2 antibodies were from Dr. D. F. Steiner (University of Chicago). NES2Y cells were grown on 8-chamber slides to 50% confluence, washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 0.7% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were added to each chamber in blocking buffer, and the samples were left overnight at 4 °C. Following four washes in blocking buffer, secondary antibody was added to each well at 1:400 dilution in blocking buffer. The samples were then gently rocked for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed in 0.4% Tween 20, 0.7% glycerol, and 2% bovine serum albumin for 1–2 h with gentle rotation at room temperature in the dark before mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added, and coverslips were affixed. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss Axiolan II with a Photometrics Sensis camera, and data were captured using the VijsisQuip program. Control samples containing primary antibody only, secondary antibody only, and nonimmune mouse or rabbit serum all stained negative. NES2Y is a proliferating human β-cell line derived from a patient with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (20.Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Squires P.E. Johnson P.R.V. James R.F.L. Milla P.J. Aynsley-Green A. Lindley K.J. Dunne M.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In keeping with the clinical features of this disease, i.e.profound hypoglycemia due to inappropriate hypersecretion of insulin, NES2Y cells secrete high levels of insulin and are unresponsive to glucose. The cells exhibit a loss of KATP channel activity, with a resultant loss of [Ca2+]i regulation. In addition, expression of PDX1 is impaired, leading to a loss of glucose-responsive insulin gene transcription (21.Macfarlane W.M. Cragg H. Docherty H.M. Read M.L. James R.F.L. Aynsley-Green A. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A normal insulin secretory response to changes in glucose concentrations within the physiological range can be achieved by stably transfecting NES2Y cells with cDNAs encoding SUR1, Kir6.2, and PDX1 (26.Macfarlane W.M. Chapman J.C. Shepherd R.M. Hashmi M.N. Kamimura N. Cosgrove K.E. Hart A.W. Docherty H.M. Lindley K.L Aynsley-Green A. James R.F.L. Docherty K. Dunne M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34059-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, NES2Y cells were used between passages 14 and 20. Under these conditions, the cells secreted insulin (11.13 ng/106 cells/24 h) and, in addition to insulin, showed normal expression of IAPP, PC2, PC3, GLUT2, and glucokinase as measured by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1). The cells did not express glucagon (data not shown) or PDX1 (Fig. 1). In preliminary experiments, we were able to confirm (27.Novials A. Sorri Y. Casamitjana R. Rivera F. Gomis R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1514-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by Northern blot analysis that IAPP mRNA levels were increased in human islets of Langerhans incubated in 20 versus 3 mmglucose (data not shown). We next investigated the effect of glucose on the IAPP promoter in Min6 and NES2Y cells. The human IAPP promoter is complex, being regulated by sequences both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site (19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reporter gene analysis was performed in the mouse β-cell line Min6 using a series of constructs containing regions −2798 to +450 (pTAC−2798), −477 to +450 (pTAC−477), −391 to +450 (pTAC−391), −222 to +450 (pTAC−222), and −133 to +450 (pTAC−133) of the human IAPP promoter (Fig.2). These analyses confirmed the findings of Carty et al. (19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), who identified a “minimal control region” of the human IAPP promoter, spanning sequences from −222 to +450 base pairs relative to the transcriptional start site. To investigate whether this minimal control region of the human IAPP promoter was responsive to glucose, the pTAC−222 construct was transfected into Min6 cells (Fig.3 A), which were then incubated in 0.5 or 16 mm glucose. In Min6 cells, the pTAC−222 construct gave a 3.5–4-fold increase in transcriptional activity in high glucose compared with low glucose concentrations. No significant effect of glucose was observed on the control construct pTKCAT. In NES2Y cells (Fig. 3 B), no effect of glucose was observed on either construct. These results are reminiscent of those observed for the insulin promoter, which was responsive to glucose in Min6 cells, but not in NES2Y cells (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether, as for the insulin promoter (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), PDX1 was essential for the glucose effects on the human IAPP minimal promoter, pTAC−222 was transfected into NES-PDX1 cells. NES-PDX1 cells contain the signaling pathway necessary for activation of PDX1. Thus, in low glucose, PDX1 is localized around the perimeter of the nucleus as described previously (28.Rafiq I. Kennedy H. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29.Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton-Edkins Z.M. Cragg H. James R.F.L. Docherty K J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). When NES-PDX1 cells were incubated in high glucose, PDX1 was activated as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown) and became localized within the nucleus (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, there was no effect of glucose on the pTAC−222 construct in NES-PDX1 cells (Fig.5 A). Like the parental NES2Y cell line, NES-PDX1 cells exhibit impaired voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K.

To determine whether changes in [Ca2+]i might be important in regulating the human IAPP promoter, we generated a cell line (NESK) in which NES2Y cells were stably transfected with the two components of the KATP channel, i.e. SUR1 and Kir6.2. Overexpression of SUR1 and Kir6.2 in the NESK cell line has previously been shown to restore normal KATP channel activity, normal glucose regulation of [Ca2+]i, and normal glucose-regulated insulin secretion (26.Macfarlane W.M. Chapman J.C. Shepherd R.M. Hashmi M.N. Kamimura N. Cosgrove K.E. Hart A.W. Docherty H.M. Lindley K.L Aynsley-Green A. James R.F.L. Docherty K. Dunne M.J. J. Biol.

Glucose had no effect on the human IAPP promoter activity or on the control construct (pTKCAT) in NESK cells (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Effect of glucose on IAPP promoter activity in NES2Y-derived cell lines. NES-PDX1 (A), NESK (B), and NISK9 (C) cells were transfected with the control construct pTKCAT or the pTAC−222 construct, which contains the −222 to +450 region of the human IAPP gene promoter, as indicated. Transfected cells were incubated for 3 h in 0.5 mm (white bars) or 16 mm(black bars) glucose.

These cells have normal KATP channel activity and modulate voltage-dependent [Ca2+]i signals in response to glucose (26.Macfarlane W.M. Chapman J.C. Shepherd R.M. Hashmi M.N. Kamimura N. Cosgrove K.E. Hart A.W. Docherty H.M. Lindley K.L Aynsley-Green A. James R.F.L. Docherty K. Dunne M.J. J. Biol.

NISK9 cells showed a pattern of human IAPP promoter activity similar to that observed in Min6 cells, with 20 mm glucose promoting a 3.5–4-fold increase in pTAC−222 transcriptional activity compared with that observed in 3 mm glucose (Fig. 5 C). These results demonstrate that regulation of the human IAPP promoter by glucose is dependent on PDX1, but additionally requires normal glucose elevation of [Ca2+]i. To confirm that changes in [Ca2+]i were required for glucose regulation of the human IAPP promoter, glucose stimulation of NISK9 and Min6 cells was performed in the presence of the calcium channel blocker verapamil. In both NISK9 and Min6 cells, glucose elicited a 3.5–4-fold increase in pTAC−222 transcriptional activity, which was inhibited by the addition of 50 μm verapamil (Fig. 6). Neither glucose nor verapamil had any effect on the control construct (pTKCAT) in either cell line. To determine whether calcium also played a role in mediating glucose effects on IAPP mRNA levels, Northern blot analysis was performed on RNA extracted from Min6 cells incubated in 0.5 or 16 mmglucose. Glucose was shown to increase the levels of both IAPP and insulin mRNAs (Fig. 7). Verapamil (50 μm) inhibited the effect of glucose on IAPP mRNA (Fig. 7 A), but had no effect on glucose-stimulated insulin mRNA levels (Fig. 7 B). These results further confirm that glucose stimulation of IAPP gene transcription is dependent on changes in [Ca2+]i, whereas it is independent of changes in [Ca2+]i in the case of insulin.Figure 7Effect of glucose and verapamil on endogenous IAPP and insulin mRNA levels in Min6 cells. Min6 cells were grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mm glucose. They were then incubated for 6 h in medium containing 0.5 mm glucose (white bars), 16 mm glucose (black bars), or 16 mmglucose containing 50 μm verapamil (hatched bars). Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting using human IAPP and insulin cDNA probes as indicated. Specific hybridization was then detected and quantified using a Packard Instantimager. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. Results were compared with those obtained for cells grown in medium containing 16 mm glucose by a Mann-WhitneyU test: ***, p < 0.005; **,p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There is evidence that the IAPP and insulin genes are coordinately regulated, as seen, for example, in the response to hypoglycemia and fasting in the rat (8.Alam T. Chen L. Ogawa A. Leffert J.D. Unger R.H. Luskey K.L. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that the levels of each hormone can be regulated independently. For example, in chronic streptozotocin diabetes in rats, IAPP mRNA levels, as measured by quantitative in situ hybridization, were increased or unaffected by low and high doses of streptozotocin, whereas insulin mRNA levels were unaffected or reduced (30.Mulder H. Ahren B. Sundler F Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1008-E1014PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of dexamethasone to low dose streptozotocin-treated rats resulted in an increase in IAPP mRNA levels, whereas insulin mRNA levels were markedly reduced (30.Mulder H. Ahren B. Sundler F Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1008-E1014PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin and IAPP gene expression was also shown to be uncoupled in pluripotent rat tumor cell lines under certain culture conditions and following passage in vivo (31.Madsen O.D. Nielsen J.H. Michelsen B. Westermark P. Bersholtz C. Nishi M. Steiner D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In human islets of Langerhans, following treatment with high glucose for relatively long periods, there was a greater stimulation of IAPP than insulin mRNA levels (27.Novials A. Sorri Y. Casamitjana R. Rivera F. Gomis R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1514-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings that insulin and IAPP mRNA levels are regulated separately are therefore compatible with the results reported in the present study demonstrating that the regulation of the IAPP and insulin promoters by glucose involved different mechanisms. Both are dependent on PDX1, but whereas the effects of glucose on the insulin promoter are independent of changes in [Ca2+]i (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the effects on the IAPP promoter are calcium-dependent. We also show that this difference in calcium dependence can also be seen at the level of glucose effects on insulin and IAPP mRNAs. This latter effect on IAPP mRNA levels is consistent with the previous findings of Gasa et al.(32.Gasa P. Gomis R. Casamitjana R. Novials A. Regul. Pept. 1997; 68: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Regulation of IAPP gene expression is dependent on a large and complex promoter region, the activity of which is modified by sequence elements lying both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site (19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The critical promoter sequences for transcriptional activation lie between −222 and +450 relative to the transcriptional start site. The intronic region from +104 to +434 base pairs appears to be important in post-transcriptional regulation of IAPP expression (19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the promoter proximal region between −222 and −91 base pairs holds the key to the transcriptional regulation of the IAPP gene. This region contains three A-box DNA-binding motifs (CTAATG), which occur at positions −83 (A1), −144 (A2), and −202 (A3) relative to the transcriptional start site. A-boxes occur at similar sites in the insulin promoter, where they have been shown to bind the homeodomain transcription factor PDX1. The A2 site in the IAPP promoter, which has been best characterized, also binds PDX1 (18.Bretherton-Watt D. Gore N. Boam D.S.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, Wang and Drucker (33.Wang M. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 243-251PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Isl1, which, like PDX1 (34.Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), plays a role in development of the pancreas (35.Ahlgren U. Pfaff S.L. Jessel T.M. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1997; 385: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), may also bind at the A2 site. Isl1 does not function in the regulation of the insulin promoter, although it does activate the IAPP promoter (33.Wang M. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 243-251PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Isl1, although not restricted to β-cells, may be the additional calcium-dependent factor involved along with PDX1 in mediating the effects of glucose on the IAPP gene. Differences in the transcriptional regulation of the human insulin and IAPP genes may be of strategic therapeutic value. It has been proposed that overexpression of IAPP contributes to the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (36.Butler, P. C., Eberhardt, N. L., and O'Brien, T. D. (1994) in Molecular Biology of Diabetes (Drazin, B., and LeRoith, D., eds) Part 1, pp. 381–389, Humana Press Inc., Towota, NJGoogle Scholar), a view supported by transgenic mouse studies involving the overexpression of human IAPP in islets of Langerhans (37.Fox N.

Targeting PDX1 by using inhibitors such as SB203580 or LY294002, directed at the cell signaling pathway involved in its activation (16.Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), would certainly affect IAPP expression, but would also affect expression of the insulin gene. A better strategy would be to target factors involved in IAPP gene expression that are not essential for expression of other β-cell-specific genes. The present study, by demonstrating significant differences in the regulation of the insulin and IAPP genes, suggests that such IAPP-specific factors (possibly Isl1) exist and remain to be identified. In conclusion, the present study has established that critical differences exist between the regulation of the human insulin and IAPP promoters. Although sharing many common sequence elements, glucose regulation of each promoter has distinct requirements. Previous studies have established that regulation of the human insulin gene promoter is dependent on the activity of PDX1, but occurs entirely independently of any changes in [Ca2+]i (23.Macfarlane W.M. Shepherd R. Cosgrove K. James R.F.L. Dunne M.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have now shown that glucose regulation of IAPP gene transcription is also dependent on the activity of PDX1. However, IAPP gene transcription additionally requires the activity of another transcription factor(s), the activity of which appears to be dependent on glucose-induced Ca2+influx into the pancreatic β-cell. We thank Drs. M. D. Carty and W. C. Soeller (Pfizer) for supplying pTKCAT and the IAPP gene promoter constructs."

One variant of severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by an absence of ZAP-70, a protein-tyrosine kinase that is recruited to the phosphorylated ζ chain of the TCR following its stimulation (1.Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). ZAP-70-deficient patients are characterized by a selective inability to produce CD8+ T cells and an inability of mature CD4+ T cells to respond to TCR stimulation (2.Arpaia E. Shahar M. Dadi H. Cohen A. Roifman C.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 947-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 3.Chan A.C. Kadlecek T.A. Elder M.E. Filipovich A.H. Kuo W.L. Iwashima M. Parslow T.G. Weiss A.

It is interesting to note that the phenotype of ZAP-70-deficient mice and humans are distinct, with ZAP-70-mutant mice exhibiting an earlier block in T cell development, at the CD4+CD8+ thymocyte stage (5.Negishi I. Motoyama N. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Senju S. Hatakeyama S. Zhang Q. Chan A.C. Loh D.Y. Nature. 1995; 376: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 6.Wiest D.L. Ashe J.M. Howcroft T.K.

Although the bases for the differential role of ZAP-70 in human and murine T cell development remain unclear, it is likely that compensatory mechanisms exist in ZAP-70–/– patients that allow CD4+ T cells to mature and emigrate to the periphery. One potential substitute for ZAP-70 is the structurally homologous Syk protein-tyrosine kinase. The compensatory role of Syk is likely more pronounced in the thymus than in peripheral T cells because it is down-regulated during T cell development (7.Chan A.C. van Oers N.S.C. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a TCR-induced response can be elicited in Syk-expressing thymocytes derived from a ZAP-70-deficient patient but not in peripheral CD4+ T cells from the same individual (8.Gelfand E.W. Weinberg K. Mazer B.D. Kadlecek T.A. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It remains important to test whether the differential activation of ZAP-70 and Syk participates in the modulation of a T cell response. In favor of distinct roles for ZAP-70 and Syk in T cell activation are the observations that Syk kinase activity is 100-fold higher than that of ZAP-70 (9.Latour S. Chow L. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22782-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and that the ability of Syk to be activated in an Lck-independent fashion is not shared by ZAP-70 (10.Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11.Couture C. Baier G. Altman A. Mustelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, studies of a recently established ZAP-70−/Syk− Jurkat clone (p116) have demonstrated that transient expression of ZAP-70 but not Syk reverses the defect in ζ chain phosphorylation (15.Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has not been possible to use the above-mentioned clone to assess the biological effects of Syk because its stable introduction has not been tolerated. Indeed, there is presently no ZAP-70-deficient T cell model in which Syk is expressed at high levels, making it difficult to assess the precise role of Syk in modulating the response of a T cell to TCR stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that proliferation of polyclonal populations of nontransformed CD4+ T cells derived from ZAP-70-deficient patients is consistently associated with significant increases in Syk levels, suggesting that Syk substitutes for ZAP-70 in transducing extracellular signals. Indeed, whereas ZAP-70-deficient T cells expressing only low levels of Syk demonstrated a defective response to TCR stimulation, proliferating ZAP-70–/– cells that expressed high levels of Syk (Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells) exhibited an elevated calcium flux in response to CD3 engagement. However, the ensemble of downstream molecules activated in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T versus control T cells was distinct with decreased Erk,1 JNK, and p38 MAPK activities in the former. This phenotype was associated with a profound defect in TCR-induced proliferation and IL-2 secretion. Thus, although Syk can compensate for ZAP-70 in activating several downstream effector molecules, our data demonstrate that Syk and ZAP-70 are differentially coupled to the TCR signaling cascade. The Jurkat T cell line E6–1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the ZAP-70+/Syk+ Jurkat clone 77–6.8 was generously provided by Dr. K. A. Smith (New York, NY). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation from two patients, products of a consanguineous relationship, and normal donors following institutional review board approval and informed consent. CD3+/CD4+ αβ T cells were purified using αCD4 coated magnetic beads as per the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal, Inc., Great Neck, NY). Cells were cultured in Yssel's medium (16.Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. Van Blitterswijk W. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% human AB+ serum and recombinant human IL-2 at 100 u/ml (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). Cells were stimulated weekly during the first month in culture and every other week thereafter with PHA (0.5 μg/ml) (Murex, Dartford, United Kingdom) and irradiated feeder cells consisting of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed JY cells as described previously (17.Spits H. Yssel H. Terhorst C. de Vries J.E. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 95-99PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments described here, αCD3 and IL-2 stimulations were performed on cells in “resting phase” that had not been stimulated with irradiated feeder cells for at least 10 days prior to use. Prior to activation, cells were cultured overnight in Yssel's medium without IL-2. An Ab recognizing the dually phosphorylated Thr183–Tyr185 form of Erk1/Erk2 (anti-ACTIVE-MAPK) was obtained from Promega (Charbonnière, France). Abs recognizing the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of p38 and SAPK/JNK were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The αErk2 mAb and αPLC-γ1 pAb were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and the 4G10 α-phosphotyrosine mAb and the αLAT pAb were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Agarose-conjugated polyclonal αErk1/Erk2 Abs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An αZAP-70 mAb and polyclonal and monoclonal αSyk Abs were the generous gifts of A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The 9.3 αCD28 mAb was generously provided by C. June (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The αCD3 OKT3 hybridoma line was purchased from the ATCC, and the αCD3 UCHT1 mAb was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). An α-mouse F(ab′)2 fragment was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France). TCR Pan αβ, CD3, CD4, CD8, and IgG isotype control Abs used for FACS analyses were purchased from Immunotech. Standard direct immunofluorescent methods were used for single and double staining of cells for these surface markers. Fluorescence was then examined using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells (1 × 105 in a total volume of 100 μl) were cultured in triplicate in flat-bottomed 96-well plates in the presence or absence of exogenous IL-2 (100 u/ml) and immobilized OKT3 mAb (1 μg/ml). After 3 days in culture, cells were [3H]thymidine-labeled (1 μCi/well) (CEA, Saclay, France) for 12 h, harvested, and counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000SC). The stimulation index for each cell type was determined by the following formula: [3H]thymidine incorporation in mitogen-treated cells/[3H]thymidine incorporation in nonactivated cells. For measurement of secreted IL-2, cells were activated as described above, and cell-free supernatants were collected 24 h following activation. A commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for IL-2 (Immunotech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For fluorometry experiments, T cells were loaded with 3 μm (final) Indo-1-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 20 °C for 45 min. Cells were then washed and resuspended in N-α-Hanks' buffered salt solution (2 nm CaCl2, 145 nm NaCl, 5 nm KCl, 1 nm MgCl2, 5 nm d-glucose, 20 nm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and maintained at 20 °C. Cells (5 × 105) were stimulated with the αCD3 UCHT1 mAb (1–5 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a constantly stirred acrylic cuvette. Fluorescence measurements to determine [Ca2+]iwere made using a Photon Technologies fluorometer (PTI, South Brunswick, NJ) with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (4 nm bandwidth) and dual simultaneous monitoring of emission at 450 and 485 nm (10 nm bandwidth). Results are represented as a ratio of emission at 405/485 nm. Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and stimulated with an αCD3 mAb or αCD3/αCD28 mAbs (10 μg/ml) followed by cross-linking with an α-mouse F(ab′)2 fragment (40 μg/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed in a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with the indicated Ab followed by collection on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18.Taylor N. Uribe L. Smith S. Jahn T. Kohn D.B. Weinberg K. Blood. 1996; 87: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates or whole-cell lysates were boiled, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and transferred electrophoretically to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked for 30 min in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the indicated primary Ab for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit or α-mouse secondary Abs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reblotting, filters were stripped as reported (18.Taylor N. Uribe L. Smith S. Jahn T. Kohn D.B. Weinberg K. Blood. 1996; 87: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiment, bands intensities were quantified using Intelligent Quantifier. An immune complex kinase assay was performed using myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as a substrate following immunoprecipitation with agarose-conjugated αErk1 and αErk2 polyclonal Abs. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once in MAPK wash buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm MgCl2, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Enzyme activity was assessed in a final volume of 20 μl in a buffer containing 42.5 mm HEPES, 425 mmMgCl2, 0.21 mm ATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 50 mm MBP for 30 min at 30 °C. Following separation on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, phosphorylated MBP (molecular mass, 18.4 kDa) was visualized by autoradiography. T cells were isolated from two siblings who presented with clinical symptoms characteristic of severe combined immunodeficiency. Further analysis revealed a phenotype consistent with a deficiency of the ZAP-70 protein-tyrosine kinase (2.Arpaia E. Shahar M. Dadi H. Cohen A. Roifman C.M.

Similar to observations in other ZAP-70-deficient patients, the patients described here demonstrated a profound defect in T cell proliferation upon TCR and mitogen stimulation (data not shown). We therefore assessed ZAP-70 protein levels and found that it was not expressed in T cells from these two patients (Fig.1 A). DNA sequencing revealed that both patients' ZAP-70 DNA contained a homozygous C to T nucleotide transition at position 1729, resulting in an alanine to valine substitution at amino acid 507 of the kinase domain (Fig.1 B). This newly identified mutation lies within a 13-base pair region that is deleted in another ZAP-70-deficient patient (4.Elder M.E. Lin D. Clever J. Chan A.C. Hope T.J. Weiss A. Parslow T.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Interestingly, with the exception of a temperature sensitive mutation recently described in the SH2 domain, all other ZAP-70 mutations reported to date are localized in the kinase domain (2.Arpaia E.

In order to determine whether ZAP-70-deficient T cells could be induced to proliferate, cells from the patients were stimulated under conditions previously described to be optimal for T cell growth (17.Spits H. Yssel H. Terhorst C. de Vries J.E. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 95-99PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were activated with irradiated allogeneic accessory cells, PHA and exogenous IL-2 in the presence of human serum. Indeed, a subset of ZAP-70–/– αβ CD4+ T cells proliferated and the response of these cells to allogeneic restimulation was significantly augmented as compared with fresh T cells isolated from the same patients (not shown). Due to the similarities between Syk and ZAP-70 and the ability of Syk to activate some TCR-induced responses in a transformed Syk−/ZAP-70− T cell line (15.Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we compared Syk levels in fresh and proliferating ZAP-70-deficient and control T cells. The low levels of Syk detected in freshly isolated T cells from these patients, as well as in an unrelated ZAP-70-deficient patient, were associated with a complete block in TCR-induced proliferation (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). 2C. Hivroz, personal communication. Importantly, proliferating ZAP-70-deficient T cells, but not equivalently treated control T cells, expressed significantly higher levels of Syk (Fig.2 B). The subsets of proliferating T cells were polyclonal as determined by TCR Vβ usage (not shown). The augmented Syk expression observed in ZAP-70–/– T cells was not the result of a selection bias in a single pool of expanded cells, as it was observed in multiple pools from both of the ZAP-70-deficient patients assessed here (Fig.2 C) as well as in mature T cells derived from three additional unrelated ZAP-70-deficient patients. 2C. Hivroz, personal communication., 3N. Taylor, unpublished observations. It should be noted that the level of Syk observed in T cells obtained from these five ZAP-70-deficient patients was approximately equivalent to that expressed in Syk+ Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Thus, high Syk expression is a consistent phenotype of proliferating ZAP-70–/– T cells (designated hereafter as Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells). Next, we assessed whether these proliferating Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells could respond to TCR stimulation alone. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was observed upon CD3 engagement of Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells but not in equivalently treated control T cells, which expressed Syk at the limits of detection (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells, Syk is likely to be involved in transducing TCR-induced signals from the cell surface. Significant attention has focused on the mechanisms by which TCR-mediated activation of ZAP-70/Syk kinases are coupled to downstream signaling pathways. LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is a 36/38-kDa membrane-associated adapter protein that has been proposed to link the TCR with some of these downstream events (20.Zhang W. Sloan L.J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Indeed, LAT associatesin vivo, either directly or indirectly, with important signaling intermediates, such as PLC-γ1, Cbl, Vav, SLP76, Grb2, and Grap (20.Zhang W. Sloan L.J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and its association with other signaling molecules in control and Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells. Cells were stimulated with an αCD3 mAb, and lysates were subjected to an αLAT immunoprecipitation. In Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells, the level of CD3-induced LAT phosphorylation was equivalent or greater than that observed in control T cells (Fig.3 A). In additional experiments, PLC-γ1 and SLP76 were immunoprecipitated from control and Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cell lysates. Upon CD3 stimulation, PLC-γ1 and SLP76 were found to be highly phosphorylated in both cell types. Interestingly, PLC-γ1 appears to be phosphorylated to slightly higher levels in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells as compared with control T cells. Moreover, a 36/38-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated doublet that migrates with the same mobility as LAT was immunoprecipitated by both PLC-γ1- and SLP76-specific antibodies (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Thus, in the presence of Syk and absence of ZAP-70, the activation of several important signaling intermediates is not adversely affected. Next, we monitored the mobilization of intracellular calcium, another proximal signaling event. As illustrated in Fig. 4, CD3 cross-linking resulted in an increase in Ca2+ flux in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells, as well as in T cells from 2 normal donors. Notably, Ca2+ mobilization was more rapid and higher in magnitude in Sykhi/ZAP-70−T cells than in control T cells, despite equivalent levels of CD3 on the cell surface (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). This difference in Ca2+ flux was also detected at lower concentrations of αCD3 mAb (1–5 μg/ml) (Fig. 4 B). These observations indicate that early TCR-mediated signaling events are induced in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells, albeit with some differences compared with control T cells expressing ZAP-70. A growing body of evidence indicates that the Ras-Erk pathway is critical for the proliferation of distinct cell types (21.Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To assess whether activation of the MAPKs Erk1 and Erk2 was affected in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells, their phosphorylation on residues Thr183 and Tyr185 and their kinase activity were analyzed. Sykhi/ZAP-70− and control T cells were activated for 3 min with cross-linked αCD3 mAb, and the level of phosphorylated Erk proteins was assessed on immunoblots using a polyclonal Ab that specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated form of Erk1 and Erk2. Although Erk1 and Erk2 proteins were phosphorylated in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells in response to CD3 engagement, the level of phosphorylation was significantly lower than that detected in control T cells (Fig.5 A). Control blots showed that equivalent amounts of Erk2 were present in each lane (Fig.5 B). To further extend this observation, the ability of immunoprecipitated Erk1/Erk2 to phosphorylate an Erk substrate, MBP was assessed (Fig. 5 C). Again, Erk-dependent kinase activity was clearly observed in CD3-activated Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells but at significantly lower levels than in control T cells. Thus, activation of Syk is associated with a decreased recruitment of the Ras-Erk cascade in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells following CD3 engagement. The MAPKs JNK and p38 are both stimulated by stress and have been implicated in apoptosis in certain cell systems (22.Wilson D.J. Fortner K.A. Lynch D.H. Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Posada J.A.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). However, JNK activation has also been observed following stimulation with various growth factors (24.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange C.C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 25.Nagata K. Nakamura T. Kitamura F. Kuramochi S. Taki S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Additionally, JNK is synergistically activated by costimulation of the CD3 and CD28 receptors (27.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining whether JNK and p38 were differentially activated in Sykhi/ZAP-70− and control T cells. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of either an αCD3 mAb or αCD3/αCD28 mAbs for 5, 15, or 30 min, and the activation status of both JNK and p38 was monitored. In control T cells, the level of phosphorylated p54/p46 JNK proteins increased by 2.5–3.0-fold by 5 min after TCR engagement and returned to baseline levels by 30 min (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the phosphorylation of these proteins in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells was lower, increasing by only 1.5-fold, and the kinetics of phosphorylation were longer, with a maximal response observed at 15 min (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, 5 min following TCR costimulation, the level of phosphorylated p38 increased by 6.2-fold in control T cells and only 3.5-fold in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells (Fig. 6 B). It is important to note that anisomycin treatment (200 ng/ml) resulted in equivalent phosphorylation of JNK and p38 in control and Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells (data not shown), indicating that the latter cells had no intrinsic defect in JNK or p38 activities. Collectively, these results demonstrate that although CD3 ligation results in the activation of several signaling intermediates and calcium mobilization in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells, TCR-mediated recruitment of all three MAPK cascades is defective. We next determined how the distinct TCR signaling cascade induced in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells would affect the fate of these cells. As Erks, JNKs, and p38 play a role in the induction of IL-2 transcription (27.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), it was of interest to ascertain whether IL-2 secretion is compromised in these proliferating T cells derived from ZAP-70-deficient patients. IL-2 production was assessed 24 h following activation with immobilized αCD3 mAbs. IL-2 secretion was not detected in nonactivated Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells (<5 pg/ml), whereas a modest level was induced by αCD3-activation (167 pg/ml). Nevertheless, these levels were significantly lower than those detected in equivalently treated control T cells (909–2101 pg/ml) (Table I). These results indicate that IL-2 secretion is compromised but not absent in CD3-stimulated T cells that exhibit defective MAPK activation.Table ICD3-induced IL-2 secretionAnti-CD3IL-2−+pg/mlSykhi/ZAP-70−<5167 ± 12CTRL 1<52101 ± 307CTRL 2<5909 ± 259Cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb, and IL-2 secretion was measured 24 h later by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The results represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. CTRL, control. Although Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells clearly proliferated in response to the extensive mixture of mitogenic agents present in the culture media, it was important to determine their proliferative capacity following activation of the TCR alone. Thus, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured 3 days after activation with either immobilized αCD3 mAb, αCD3/CD28 mAbs, a combination of IL-2 and αCD3 mAbs, or exogenous IL-2 alone. Unlike freshly obtained ZAP-70–/– T cells, which did not proliferate following CD3 or CD3/CD28 engagement, the corresponding Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells responded to these stimuli (Fig. 7 and data not shown). However, proliferation of the latter cells was markedly decreased compared with equivalently treated control T cells (p = 0.003). The decreased CD3-induced proliferation in Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells was not solely due to decreased IL-2 secretion as addition of exogenous IL-2 did not alleviate this difference. Nevertheless, Sykhi/ZAP-70− T cells were able to respond to IL-2 alone with a similar level of proliferation as control T cells (not shown). Altogether, these results indicate that in the context of T cells expressing Syk but not ZAP-70, a 2–3-fold decrease in the activation of all three MAPK cascades is associated with a profound defect in CD3-mediated IL-2 secretion and proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that the in vitro proliferation of primary CD4+ αβ T cells from"

The E2F transcription factors are key activators of genes coding for several regulatory proteins and for enzymes involved in nucleotide and DNA synthesis. In this report we have detected the presence of E2F-like DNA binding activities in carrot nuclear extracts, and we have isolated a carrot cDNA (DcE2F) encoding a plant E2F homologue. The DcE2F gene is expressed in proliferating cells and is induced during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. Supershift experiments using anti-DcE2F antiserum have confirmed that the DcE2F protein is a component of the carrot E2F-like nuclear activities. DNA binding assays have demonstrated that the DcE2F protein can recognize a canonical E2Fcis-element in association with a mammalian DP protein.

Meristematic cell division occurs during the entire plant life, and because plant cells cannot migrate, control of cell proliferation is responsible for the formation of plant organs and structures (1.Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, plant cells can readily undergo multiple cycles of endoreduplication, and additionally most of them are totipotent and can reprogram cell division even after completing their differentiation. These unique features suggest a unique flexibility in the control of the cell cycle in plants. In animal cells a pivotal role in the progression of cell cycle is played by the E2F family of transcription factors, which are key components of a critical checkpoint regulating entry of cells into S phase (2.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 3.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Progression through the G1 and S phase of the cell cycle ultimately depends on the activation of genes coding for regulatory proteins and for the enzymes involved in nucleotide and DNA synthesis. The expression of many of these genes is largely under the control of the E2F family of transcription factors, which appear to be activated by multiple mitogenic signaling pathways. The E2F proteins bind to specific DNA sequences through a winged helix motif, forming prevalently heterodimers with distantly related partners of the DP (DRTF1 polypeptide) family (4.Zheng N. Fraenkel E. Pabo C.O. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells six distinct E2F proteins associate with two different DP members and bind to similar DNA elements, which are conserved in the promoters of several genes that are activated in late G1 and near the boundary G1/S. E2F gene targets include cell growth regulators such as cyclin A, Cdc2, c-Myc, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen and enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, and DNA polymerase α (5.Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 6.Lavia P. Jansen-Dürr P. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The importance of the E2F factors for cell cycle progression is further highlighted by the demonstration that transient overexpression of several members of the E2F family is able to induce S phase in quiescent cells in the absence of growth factors (7.Lukas J. Petersen B.O. Holm K. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 8.Müller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5508-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The activity of the E2F factors is in part regulated by members of the pocket protein family, which includes the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (pRB)1and the related proteins p107 and p130. These proteins possess a highly conserved A/B pocket domain that is the target of viral transforming proteins such as adenovirus E1A (2.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). The pocket proteins are also the targets of cyclin-dependent kinase activities, and once hypophosphorylated they can bind the activation domain of the various E2F transcription factors, thereby repressing their transcriptional activity. Furthermore, recent results indicate that the pocket proteins can recruit to the E2F complex a transcriptional repressor such as the HDAC1 histone deacetylase (9.Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 10.Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The recruitment of histone deacetylase to promoters containing E2F DNA binding sites is believed to lead to chromatin condensation and to an efficient silencing of transcription. It is therefore now widely believed that the binding of the E2Fs to promoter elements can lead to both repression and activation of transcription, depending on their association with the pocket proteins. Such a concept also provides an explanation for the observation that the E2Fs can act as oncogenes as well as tumor suppressor genes (11.Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 12.Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The mammalian E2F factors have similar primary structures with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, found near the N terminus, followed by a DP dimerization domain containing a leucine heptad repeat. Next to the dimerization domain is conserved another region, named marked box, which in human E2Fs is the target of the adenovirus E4 protein (13.Jost C.A. Ginsberg D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Virology. 1996; 220: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region contains a transactivation domain that is characterized by the presence of several acidic residues and the presence of a short conserved region involved in the binding to the pocket proteins. E2F-6 lacks the activation domain and the pRB binding region, and it has been shown to function as an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcriptional activity (14.Cartwright P. Müller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3, but not the other mammalian E2Fs, possess a conserved domain at the N terminus that can bind to cyclin A/CDK2 (15.Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The DP-1 and DP-2 partners of E2F contain DNA binding and dimerization regions related to the E2F proteins but lack activation domains and other conserved regions (3.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A plant homologue of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene has been discovered and characterized in maize (16.Grafi G. Burnett R.J. Helentjaris T. Larkins B.A. DeCaprio J.A. Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 93: 8962-8967Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17.Xie Q. Sanz-Burgos A.P. Hannon G.J.

Biol. 1987; 17: 5077-5086Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), suggesting that the transition from G1 to S phase, a key passage during cell cycle, is regulated similarly in animal and plant cells. The existence of pRB proteins that can interact with plant d-type cyclins and viral replication proteins indicated that homologues of the E2F factors might be present in plant cells and could be involved in the regulation of genes responsible for S phase progression. In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of DcE2F, a E2F-like gene from carrot cells that is expressed in proliferating cells. We demonstrate that the carrot E2F protein is a functional transcription factor that can bind a canonical E2F cis-element in association with a mammalian DP protein and can transactivate through this binding site a reporter gene in both plant and mammalian cells. During the preparation of this manuscript, the isolation of wheat and tobacco E2F homologues was also described (19.Ramirez-Parra E. Xie Q. Boniotti M.B. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20.Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Taken together with these results, our data demonstrate that the pRB/E2F pathway is conserved in plants, and the isolation of plant E2F provides a new tool to understand how plant growth and development is controlled. Plants of Daucus carota L. cv. Lunga di Amsterdam were grown under normal greenhouse conditions. Carrot cell suspension cultures were maintained as described previously (21.Nielsen E. Rollo F. Parisi B. Cella R. Sala F. Plant Sci. Lett. 1979; 15: 113-125Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For cellular synchronization, quiescent cells from a carrot culture grown to plateau were washed and incubated for 48 h in fresh Muzashige and Skoog liquid medium lacking hormones and sucrose. The cells were released from starvation by dilution in fresh Muzashige and Skoog medium containing growth regulators and sucrose. At different time points after release, small samples were used for DNA synthesis assay by [3H]thymidine pulse labeling experiments, and the remaining aliquots were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen before isolation of total RNA. For the isolation of carrot nuclei, cells from an actively dividing suspension culture were washed in protoplast isolation buffer (22.Banks M.S. Evans P.K.A. Plant Sci.

After incubation for about 6 h at 25 °C, the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g, and the pelleted protoplasts were washed three times with protoplast isolation buffer. After resuspension in approximately 10 volumes of ice-cold resuspension buffer (0.4 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the protoplasts were disrupted in a Teflon homogenizer (1,000 revolutions/min, 5 strokes for three times). The homogenate was then centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 ×g, and the pellets were resuspended in two volumes of ice-cold wash buffer (0.4 m sucrose, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The nuclei were finally spun down at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml leupeptin) and were lysed by adding 0.1 volume of cold 4 m (NH4)2SO4. After incubation for 30 min with constant movement at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the nuclear proteins of the supernatant were precipitated by slowly adding 0.5 volume of cold 4 m(NH4)2SO4 and incubating 60 min at 4 °C with constant movement. The nuclear proteins were then recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C in microcentrifuge and then resuspended in dialysis buffer (same as lysis buffer but without MgCl2) and dialyzed 3 h at 4 °C against the same buffer. The resulting nuclear extracts were divided in small aliquots and stored in liquid nitrogen. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from carrot cell culture using oligo(dT) cellulose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following a standard batch procedure (23.Bartels D. Thompson R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2961-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method (24.Shirzadegan M. Christie P. Seemann J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, the RNA samples were resolved in formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a DcE2F probe labeled by the random primer method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To verify the level of synchronization, after removal of the DcE2F probe, the filter was subsequently hybridized with a carrot UBI-CEP probe (25.Balestrazzi A. Cella R. Carbonera D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 720Google Scholar). To amplify carrot E2F-like cDNAs, 3′-RACE reactions were performed on carrot poly(A)+ RNA using a degenerate primer of sequenceGCGAATTCMGIMGIATHTAYGA (where I is inosine, M is A/C, H is A/T/C, Y is C/T, and the nucleotides in italics represent the added cloning site) containing all the possible codons for the conserved amino acid sequence RRIYD. Nested PCR reactions were performed with a second primer of sequence GCGAATTCGAYATHACIAAYGT containing all the possible codons for the amino acid sequence DITNV. Reverse transcription and PCR reactions were conducted as described previously (26.Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoretic analysis of the nested reactions, the major PCR fragment, corresponding to a partial DcE2F cDNA, was isolated and subcloned into the plasmid pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene). To isolate full-length DcE2F clones, approximately 500,000 plaque-forming units from a carrot cell suspension cDNA library (27.Bernacchia G. Primo A. Giorgetti L. Pitto L. Cella R. Plant J. 1998; 13: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) constructed in λZAPII (Stratagene) were screened with the partial DcE2F probe. Hybridization and washings were performed as previously reported (26.Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar). Two hybridizing plaques were purified and the plasmids containing the DcE2F cDNAs were excised in vivoaccording to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was performed on both strands of the longest cDNA clone (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech sequencing kit). For the construction of the pRSET-DcE2F expression vector the DcE2F cDNA was digested with the enzymes BamHI and HindIII, and the resulting DNA fragment, containing the entire DcE2F coding region preceded by 35 base pairs of the upstream untranslated region, was inserted into the corresponding sites of the polylinker of pRSET-A (Invitrogen). The pRSET-DcE2F plasmid was then introduced intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) for the production of a recombinant DcE2F protein carrying a histidine-tagged N-terminal extension of 48 amino acids. The HIS-DcE2F protein was purified under nondenaturing condition by metal affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as previously reported (26.Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar). For purification under denaturing conditions, cell lysis and affinity chromatography were performed in phosphate buffer containing 8m urea. Electrophoretic analysis of the eluted proteins revealed a single polypeptide of the expected dimensions indicating a purification to near homogeneity of the recombinant DcE2F protein. The bacterial GST-DP1 expression vector was introduced into E. coli XL-1 blue cells, and the recombinant protein was purified by chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. The His-DcE2F protein eluted under denaturing conditions was dialyzed and used directly for rabbit immunization. For Western analysis, proteins fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). The blots were incubated with the anti-DcE2F polyclonal serum, and immunodetection was performed using ECL chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with carrot nuclear extracts or recombinant DcE2F and DP-1 proteins, the cloned double-stranded oligonucleotides were gel purified and labeled by a fill-in reaction with Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequences of the probes were 5′-aattcTTTTCCCGCGCTTTTgaatt-3′ for the canonical E2F binding site (EC) and 5′-aattcTTTTCCATCGCTTTTgaatt-3′ for the mutated E2F binding site (EM). In both sequences the lowercase letters represent the EcoRI cloning sites. The DNA binding reactions with carrot nuclear extracts were conducted incubating 1.5–6 μg of nuclear proteins with 50,000 cpm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes and 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA in 15 μl of 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA binding of the recombinant proteins was conducted similarly without adding the salmon sperm DNA. For the competition experiments, increasing amounts of annealed unlabeled oligonucleotides were included in the reactions with the EC probe. The supershift experiments were carried out by preincubating the binding reactions with 1 μl of polyclonal anti-DcE2F serum or preimmune serum for 30 min at room temperature before adding the probe. The protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed for 3 h at 4 °C on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE. The EMSAs in mammalian cells were performed essentially as described (28.Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) using a E2F binding probe of sequence 5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA-3′. Extracts were prepared from U2OS cells transfected with each of the indicated expression plasmids (6 μg/100-mm dish). 10 μg of the extracts were used for Western blotting as shown in Fig. 8 A. To determine the protein composition of the complexes in EMSAs, the following antibodies were used: KH95 (anti E2F-1) (29.Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), TFD10 (anti-DP-1) (8.Müller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). To generate an expression plasmid for DcE2F, the full open reading frame of DcE2F was amplified by PCR using primers specific for DcE2F and containing BamHI restriction sites in the ends. The PCR product was subsequently cloned intoBamHI-digested pCMVHA (29.Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) to generate pCMVHADcE2F. pCMVE2F-1 and pCMVDP-1 have been described previously (29.Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 31.Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). For the construction of the DcE2F effector plasmid to be used in plant protoplasts, the cDNA was digested with HindIII, blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase, and then digested with BamHI yielding a DNA fragment, containing the entire DcE2F coding region. This fragment was inserted into the BamHI and blunt-ended SacI sites found upstream of the terminator sequence of the nosgene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens cloned as aSacI/EcoRI fragment into pUC19. The DcE2F/NOS gene fusion was then digested with BamHI andEcoRI, and the resulting DNA fragment was inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) duplicated 35 S promoter in the plasmid pFF19 (32.Timmermans M.C. Maliga P. Vieira J. Messing J. J. Biotechnol. 1990; 14: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to give rise to the p35 S-DcE2F construct. The p35 S-DP1 effector was obtained by cloning into pFF19 aBamHI/SalI-digested DNA fragment from pBSK-DP1 (29.Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For the construction of the chimeric 6XE2F-minimal 35 S promoter-GUS reporter construct, a DNA fragment containing the six E2F binding sites was isolated from the pGL3TATAbasic-6XE2F vector (8.Müller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5508-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) after digestion with AspI, blunt ending with Klenow DNA polymerase and digestion with XhoI. This fragment was then cloned into HindIII (filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase) and SalI sites of pBI221.9 to give rise to the pBI221-E2F reporter construct. The transactivation experiments in plant cells were conducted with protoplasts isolated from carrot somatic embryos at the heart torpedo stages of development. The embryos were incubated with 1% cellulase and 0.2% pectinase in protoplast isolation buffer (27.2 mg/liter KH2PO4, 101 mg/liter KNO3, 1.4 g/liter CaCl2, 246 mg/liter MgSO4, 0.16 mg/liter KI, 0.025 mg/liter CuSO4, 10 mm MES, and 0.7 m sorbitol, pH 5.5). The protoplasts were pelleted and washed twice in the same buffer without enzymes and then resuspended at a density of 7.5 × 106 protoplasts ml−1 in 10 mm Hepes, 130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.2m mannitol, pH 7.2. For electroporation, aliquots of 0.4 ml of the protoplast suspension were placed in the electroporation cuvettes (ECU-104, Equibio) and then mixed with 10 μg of each test plasmid, 5 μg of CaMV 35 S-CAT plasmid (as internal control) and sonicated calf thymus DNA to a total of 50 μg of DNA. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the electrical pulse was delivered by the Electroporator II (Invitrogen) charged to 330 V electric potential, 500 microfarad capacitance, and 500 Ω resistance. After 10 min on ice, the protoplasts were diluted with 2.1 ml of culture medium (Gamborg's B5 medium supplemented with 300 mg/liter CaCl2-H2O, 825 mg/liter NH4NO3, 100 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 200 mg/liter malic acid, 200 mg/liter citric acid, 300 mg/liter casamino acids, 200 mg/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter saccarose, 76 g/liter mannitol, 0.1 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.2 mg/liter 6BAP, 10−6m α-naphtaleneacetic acid, 5 × 10−7m zeatin riboside, pH 5.6) and incubated 40 h in the dark at 25 °C. GUS activity was measured as described by Gallie et al. (33.Gallie D.R. Lucas W.J. Walbot V. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CAT assays was performed using the CAT detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Transactivation assays in mammalian cells were performed as described previously (8.Müller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5508-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using pGL3TATAbasic-6xE2F as reporter construct and pCMVβ-gal (CLONTECH) to normalize for transfection efficiency. For a 60-mm tissue culture dish, 30 ng of the indicated expression plasmid was transfected in combination with 1 μg of pGL3TATAbasic-6xE2F and 500 ng of pCMVβ-gal. Cells were harvested 36 h after addition of the DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitate. Following the discovery of plant homologues of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, a yeast two-hybrid assay has shown that the maize pRB protein can bind to human andDrosophila E2F transcription factors (34.Huntley R. Healy S. Freeman D. Lavender P. de Jager S. Greenwood J. Makker J. Walker E. Jackman M. Xie Q. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Gutierrez C. Doonan J.H. Murray J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A transcription interference assay has further shown that maize pRB can inhibit E2F-dependent transcriptional activation in animal cells (34.Huntley R. Healy S. Freeman D. Lavender P. de Jager S. Greenwood J. Makker J. Walker E. Jackman M. Xie Q. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Gutierrez C. Doonan J.H. Murray J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These remarkable properties of maize pRB strongly indicated that plant homologues of the animal E2F family of transcription factors were likely to exist and to be involved in the regulation of genes responsible for the progression of the cell cycle through the G1/S transition. To investigate the presumed presence of E2F-like factors in plant cells, DNA binding assays using carrot nuclear extracts were performed (Fig. 1). Animal E2F/DP complexes as well as cellular E2F DNA binding activities have been shown to specifically recognize a consensus sequence TTT(C/G)(G/C)CG(C/G), and mutations of the internal invariable CG doublet have been shown to greatly reduce E2F binding efficiency (4.Zheng N. Fraenkel E. Pabo C.O. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Accordingly, EMSAs on carrot nuclear extracts were performed with a canonical E2F binding probe of sequence 5′-TTTTCCCGCGCTTTT-3′ and with a mutated probe of sequence 5′-TTTTCCATCGCTTTT-3′. As shown in Fig. 1, carrot nuclear extracts contain DNA binding activities, which, as expected for E2F complexes, recognize the canonical sequence but are unable to bind to the mutated probe. Furthermore, as also shown in Fig.1, competition experiments with excess of unlabeled probes confirmed the binding specificity for the canonical sequence and demonstrated that E2F-like DNA binding activities exist in carrot cells. Although E2F-like DNA binding activities were detected in carrot nuclear extracts, it remained uncertain whether they could correspond to a real functional homologue of the E2F transcription factors or could simply represent unrelated nuclear factors that are able to discriminate between the two EMSA probes. To verify the molecular nature of these DNA binding activities, we proceeded to the isolation of a carrot homologue of animal E2Fs. The indication that all the E2F binding activities in animal cells are heterodimers, formed by E2F and DP partners, precluded the possibility to isolate E2F homologues by Southwestern screening procedures. All the animal E2F and DP factors, however, possess highly conserved DNA-binding domains that are found near the N termini of the proteins. In view of the perfect identity of a portion of this domain in the mammalian E2Fs and in a E2F homologue of Drosophila melanogaster (35.Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36.Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we proceeded to the isolation of a plant E2F homologue using PCR techniques. A pair of degenerate primers encoding the conserved amino acid sequences RRIYD and DITNV were used in 3′-RACE reactions performed with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from actively dividing carrot cells. Using the same strategy we also attempted the isolation of a DP homologue with a pair of degenerate primers encoding the amino ac"

We observed that TGF-β1 blocked apoptosis resulting from serum withdrawal in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. This was associated with suppression of JNK activation that occurs concomitant with the onset of apoptosis in the absence of TGF-β1, suggesting that JNK plays an active role in the death process and that TGF-β1 exerts its protective influence by altering JNK activity. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant form of SEK1, an upstream activator of JNK, likewise suppressed JNK activation and inhibited apoptosis. Investigation of early events following TGF-β1 treatment revealed an early induction and phosphorylation of c-Jun that was absent in cells subjected to serum withdrawal alone. That TGF-β1-induced expression of c-Jun is important for survival was supported by the finding that overexpression of non-phosphosphorylatable dominant negative mutant c-Jun, c-Jun(S73A), attenuated the protective influence of TGF-β1. Our findings suggest that JNK activation is a late but essential event in serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in A549 cells. TGF-β1 prevents apoptosis, in part, through the early induction and phosphorylation of c-Jun, which in turn results in attenuated JNK activation.

Growth factors play important roles in modulating such processes by transmitting their signals through specific receptor/signaling pathways, thereby affecting the decision of cell survival or death. The removal of growth factors, hormones, or cytokines can trigger cell death depending on the particular cell's growth factor requirements (5.Araki S. Simada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6.Geier A. Haimshon M. Berry R. Hemi R. Lunenfeld B. In Vitro Cell Dev.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),1 platelet-derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor have all been shown to protect cells from death resulting from growth factor removal in certain cell types (8.Parrizas M.

However, the signaling pathways leading to apoptosis after growth factor removal, as well as the mechanism(s) whereby specific growth factors rescue cells from death are poorly understood.The c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins that are activated upon exposure of cells to various cytokines and environmental stresses (12.Hibi M.

Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). JNK is activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr residues by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) that are in turn activated by various MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs) (13.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

It enhances the activities of ATF-2, c-Jun, and Elk-1, but represses activity of NFAT4 (18.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Recent studies have also shown that activated JNK phosphorylates and stabilizes the transcription factor p53 protein under stress conditions (21.Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu S.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) constitute a separate subfamily of MAPK that are regulated in response to extracellular stimuli, most notably, growth factors (23.Davis R.J. Mol.

A role for TGF-β1 in the induction of cell death has also been established in a variety of cell types (43.Lomo J. Blomhoff H.K. Beiske K. Stokke T. Smeland E.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1634-1643PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol.

On the other hand, several recent studies have provided evidence that TGF-β1 can inhibit Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis in T lymphocytes and rheumatoid synovial cells, and serum deprivation-induced cell death in macrophages (46.Cerwenka A. Kovar H. Majdic O. Holter W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 459-464PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Chen J-J. Sun Y. Nabel G.J.

Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39 (11276): 12677Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, as is the case for cell proliferation, TGF-β1 may have dual roles in regulating cell death. TGF-β1 signals are transmitted through a heteromeric complex between two transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and type II receptors (30.Herdegen T. Claret T.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Lawrence D.A. Eur.

Smad-related proteins are thought to be the essential intracellular components of TGF-β1 signaling pathways that serve to transduce the TGF-β1 signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus to regulate downstream genes (33.Massague J. Weis-Garcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Assoian R.K.

Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar).Previously we reported that human lung carcinoma A549 cells undergo apoptosis upon serum removal, an effect associated with elevated JNK activity (50.Huang Y. Chan A.M.-L. Liu Y. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 can prevent this apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. The prevention of cell death by TGF-β1 in these cells is associated with an early induction and sustained phosphorylation of c-Jun protein but diminution of JNK activation which occurs later during the response to serum removal. Through additional experiments utilizing dominant-negative mutant SEK1 and non-phosphorylatable c-Jun mutants, we provide evidence that modulations of c-Jun and JNK activities are essential events in the ability of TGF-β1 to influence cell survival during serum deprivation.DISCUSSIONTGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts in a cell type-dependent manner to regulate growth and differentiation (31.Lawrence D.A.

Smeland E.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1634-1643PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that TGF-β1 suppresses apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in human lung carcinoma A549 cells and have provided further evidence that modulation of the expression/activities of c-Jun and JNK contribute to this effect. Recently it was reported that TGF-β1 also suppresses apoptosis of mouse macrophages induced by serum withdrawal (71.Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 16: 11362-11368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In that study, however, activation of ERK MAPK was implicated as a critical survival factor, as inhibition of TGF-β1-induced ERK expression abrogated TGF-β1's protective effect. Although we too observed an elevation in ERK activity in response to TGF-β1 treatment, it was modest in magnitude, and did not appear to contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of the cytokine, as blocking ERK activation did not reduce the protective influence of TGF-β1. It has also been reported that TGF-β1 can suppress FasL-mediated apoptosis in certain cell types, and one study has suggested that it acts through suppression of p38 MAPK (46.Cerwenka A. Kovar H. Majdic O. Holter W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 459-464PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Chen J-J. Sun Y. Nabel G.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 48.Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Matsuoka N. Tsuboi M. Kawabe Y. Aoyagi T. Nagataki S. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39 (11276): 12677Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In our model system, p38 was found not to be involved, as p38 was not activated in response to serum deprivation, nor did treatment of cells with the pharmacologic inhibitor of p38, SB202190, influence survival.Based on the findings reported here, activation of JNK appears to be a critical event leading to cell death in serum-deprived A549 cells, and TGF-β1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effect, in large part, through inhibition of JNK activation. The observations supporting this conclusion are the following: 1) serum deprivation led to an elevation in JNK activity that preceded the onset of cell death and persisted for the remainder of the treatment period associated with extensive cell death; 2) TGF-β1 treatment, which prevented cell death, attenuated the magnitude and duration of JNK activation seen in the serum-deprived cells; 3) suppression of JNK activation was specific to TGF-β1 and did not occur with other growth factor treatments, such as EGF, that failed to inhibit apoptosis; and 4) inhibition of JNK, through expression of a dominant inhibitory mutant of SEK1, was also effective in preventing serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in A549 cells. In our studies, the inhibition of JNK activation by SEK1(K-R) was only partial. This likely reflects the contribution of other kinases, such as MKK7, in the activation of JNK (72.Tournier C Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Despite this moderate inhibition of JNK activity, apoptosis was almost completely abolished in cells expressing SEK1(K-R). We have noted a similar phenomenon in a previous study in which partial inhibition of JNK activity also greatly inhibited the level of apoptosis seen in hydrogen peroxide-treated cells (73.Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). It is possible that a critical threshold of JNK activity is required to induce cell death, and that the inhibition achieved with SEK1(K-R) brings JNK activity below this level (74.Luo Y. Umegaki H. Wang X. Abe R. Roth G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3756-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Our findings are also consistent with studies in PC12 cells in which an inhibition of JNK was shown to suppress apoptosis initiated by withdrawal of nerve growth factor (7.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Presumably, suppression of JNK activity blocks the activation of one or more downstream targets required for cell death. While the identity of these JNK effectors is presently unknown, c-Jun can be ruled out as discussed below.The inhibition of apoptosis by TGF-β1 in serum-deprived A549 cells is associated with an early induction and phosphorylation of c-Jun protein. c-Jun is an immediate early activator of transcription, and part of the AP-1 complex. This transcription factor serves an important role in regulating genes associated with proliferation and transformation (19.Karin M Liu Z.G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 20.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 28.Smeal T.

Hashimoto Y. Sonobe M.H. Kameda T. Ichinose M. Miki K. Iba H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a number of recent studies have also implicated it in the control of cell death (17.Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 30.Herdegen T. Claret T.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61.Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F-F. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In such situations, JNK activation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and AP-1 activation are tightly coupled. Indeed, prevention of c-Jun activation through use of dominant negative c-Jun mutants that cannot be phosphorylated has been shown to prevent JNK pathway-mediated cell death in certain instances (17.Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 30.Herdegen T. Claret T.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, other recent studies have shown that c-Jun expression and/or activation is not necessary for apoptosis to occur (75.Roffler-Tarlov S. Brown J.J. Tarlov E. Stolarov J. Chapman D.L. Alexiou M. Papaioannou V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a recent study has suggested that c-Jun protects cells against UVC-induced cell death (76.Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The induction of c-Jun protein and its phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 treatment clearly precedes and therefore does not rely on JNK activation. Such discordance between c-Jun expression and JNK activation is also apparent at later times points following serum withdrawal (72 and 96 h), where JNK activation is apparent, but no phosphorylated c-Jun is detectable regardless of TGF-β1 treatment. Although other studies have shown that Jun induction can occur independent of JNK (63.Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of c-Jun protein on Ser63 and Ser73 is believed to be specific to JNK. Therefore, it appears that either basal levels of JNK activity are sufficient to allow this phosphorylation to occur in TGF-β-treated cells, or some other as yet unidentified kinase is responsible for this phosphorylation. That induction of c-Jun by TGF-β1 constitutes a survival signal in serum-deprived A549 cells was strongly supported by the observation that cells expressing c-Jun(S73A), a dominant inhibitory mutant form of c-Jun, sensitized cells to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and greatly diminished the protective influence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 9). Two likely explanations for the inability of mutant c-Jun to totally reverse the protective influence of TGF-β1 are that the mutant c-Jun cannot completely block c-Jun activity, and/or other, as yet undetermined, effects of TGF-β1 contribute to its ability to influence survival. Although the downstream targets of this early induction of c-Jun expression remain to be determined, it is clearly important for preventing serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in these cells and paradoxically is associated with an attenuation of the later JNK activation that ultimately leads to cell death. These findings contribute to our understanding of the pleiotropic effects of TGF-β1 and suggest a novel role of this cytokine in regulating cell death signaling through its ability to differentially modulate the expression and activity of components of the JNK signaling pathway. Cell death is as essential as cell proliferation for the regulation of mammalian development (reviewed in Refs. 1.Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 2.White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 3.Williams G.T. Smith C.A.

Growth factors play important roles in modulating such processes by transmitting their signals through specific receptor/signaling pathways, thereby affecting the decision of cell survival or death. The removal of growth factors, hormones, or cytokines can trigger cell death depending on the particular cell's growth factor requirements (5.Araki S. Simada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6.Geier A. Haimshon M. Berry R. Hemi R. Lunenfeld B. In Vitro Cell Dev.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),1 platelet-derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor have all been shown to protect cells from death resulting from growth factor removal in certain cell types (8.Parrizas M. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9.Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M.K. Garcia I. Lopez-Rivas A. J.

Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways leading to apoptosis after growth factor removal, as well as the mechanism(s) whereby specific growth factors rescue cells from death are poorly understood. The c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins that are activated upon exposure of cells to various cytokines and environmental stresses (12.Hibi M.

In yeast, the two MutL-α homologues (MLH1 and PMS1) are known to form heterodimers and are essential for MMR. In humans, the two MutL-α homologues (hMLH1 and hPMS2) also function as a heterodimer (1.Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hMSH2, hMLH1, and hPMS2 can be co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of DNA and ATP (11.Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Another MutL protein, theSaccharomyces cerevisiae MLH3 was shown to interact with MLH1 in a two-hybrid system (2.Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, using a yeast two-hybrid assay and coexpression of baculoviruses carrying cDNAs encoding hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 in Sf9 cells, hPMS1 was shown to form a heterodimer with hMLH1 (3.Raschle M.

Although a function of hPMS1 in DNA mismatch repair has not been demonstrated, a role for this protein in DNA repair is supported by studies in hPMS1 knockout mice, which showed that, although not developing tumors, these mice display poly(A) tract mutation frequencies above normal levels (13.Prolla T.A.

Defects in human mismatch repair mechanisms have been implicated in the susceptibility to some inherited and sporadic colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancers. Characteristically, these cancers display instability of microsatellite repeats, which is an important trait in the identification of human tumors with MMR gene defects (14.Liu B. Parsons R.

Germline mutations of DNA MMR genes occur in more than 90% of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) cases, and approximately 70% of the cases are due to germline mutations inhMLH1 and hMSH2 (14.Liu B.

Alterations of the MutL complex are also important in subsets of sporadic colorectal and gastric cancers displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) associated with reduced expression ofhMLH1 in the absence of germline mutations and derived colorectal and gastric cancers were shown to have MSI associated with decreased expression of hMLH1 (15.Thibodeau S.N.

In this study, we used established epithelial cancer cell lines to identify the pattern of association of the human MutL proteins (hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1) in cells with and without MSI. We show that epithelial cells from colorectal, cervical, and gastric cancers express the hPMS1 gene and that this protein associates with hMLH1 but not with hPMS2. Furthermore, we examined the RNA expression of MutL proteins to assess if loss of MutL proteins in cells with MSI was associated with absence of mutL transcripts. The gastric cancer cell lines included 1739-CRL (AGS), 5822-CRL (NCI-N87), HTB-103 (KATO-III), 5971-CRL (SNU-1), and 5974-CRL (SNU-16) from ATCC and SNU-638, kindly provided by Dr. Lance Ferrin and previously reported (24.Park J.G.

The cell line SNU-1 has been reported to have a nonsense mutation at codon 226 of hMLH1 (CGA→TGA) resulting in a premature stop codon (25.Shin K. Yang Y. Park J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 124: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116) and the cervical cancer cell line CCL-2 (HeLa) (ATCC) were also used. The hMLH1 gene in HCT-116 cells contains a base substitution that results in a termination signal at codon 252 (TCA→TAA) (26.Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Wei Y.F. Ruben S.M. Carter K.C. Rosen C.A.

Science. 1994; 263: 1625-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). All gastric cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), except KATO-III cells, which were grown in 20% fetal bovine serum. HCT-116 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To characterize the MSI status of gastric cancer cell lines, DNA was extracted from eight or nine different cell clones per marker examined as described previously (27.Reitmair A.H. Risley R. Bristow R.G. Wilson T. Ganesh A. Jang A. Peacock J. Benchimol S. Hill R.P. Mak T.W. Fishel R. Meuth M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3765-3771PubMed Google Scholar). The microsatellite markers included the BAT26 mononucleotide repeat markers and three dinucleotide markers, as described previously (17.Sepulveda A.R. Santos A.C. Yamaoka Y. Wu L. Gutierrez O. Kim J.G. Graham D.Y. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1999; 94: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, one of the primers in each set was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed for 35 cycles, consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with the exception of BAT-40, which required annealing temperatures of 40 °C. The PCR products were separated through 7% polyacrylamide gels containing 5.6 murea and 32% formamide. Whole cell protein extracts from cultured cancer cell lines were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (28.Sepulveda A.R. Finegold M.J. Smith B. Slagle B.L. DeMayo J.L. Shen R.F. Woo S.L. Butel J.S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6108-6117PubMed Google Scholar). The same amounts of protein (15 μg) were resolved through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against hMLH1 (clone G168-15; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), hMSH2 (clone FE11; Oncogene Research, Cambridge, MA), hPMS2 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), and hPMS1 (C-20 and K-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody concentrations were 1:1000 for all antibodies used. After washing, the filters were incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibodies (hMLH1, hMSH2) or peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (hPMS1, hPMS2) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were then detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with anti-human actin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Cultured cell lines were lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH5), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitor. The supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for preclearing of nonspecific protein adsorption. The protein G-agarose pellets were removed by centrifugation, and 2 μg of anti-hMLH1 monoclonal antibody (clone G168-15), anti-hPMS2 polyclonal antibody (C-20), anti-hPMS1 polyclonal antibodies (C-20 and K-20), or goat serum used as negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 50 μl of protein G-agarose for 3 h. The protein-agarose complexes were then collected by repeated centrifugation and washing as described by the manufacturer and were resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). The proteins were resolved through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-hMLH1, anti-hMSH2, or anti-hPMS1 antibodies as described in the previous section. Total RNA was extracted from gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, KATO-III, SNU-1, and SNU-16), HCT-116 cells, and HeLa cells by using a total RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The cDNA probes used for Northern blot analyses were prepared by cloning the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR products into plasmid vectors and were released by restriction enzyme digestion. Primers spanning the coding region of the three DNA mismatch repair genes (hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2) were selected and synthesized by Life Technologies Inc. Primers forhMSH2 were adopted from Liu et al. (29.Liu B. Parsons R.E. Hamilton S.R. Petersen G. Lynch H. Watson P. Markowitz S. Willson J. Green J. de la Chapelle A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4590-4594PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer sequences are listed in TableI. Total RNA (1 μg) was directly amplified by one-step RT-PCR (Titan One-Tube RT-PCR system; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR products of hPMS1 andhPMS2 were cloned into the TA cloning vector (PCR2.1; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the EcoRI-digested fragments were labeled and used as probes for subsequent Northern blotting. ForhMLH1 and hMSH2, PCR products were cloned into the cloning vector pT7Blue (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the restriction fragments obtained after digestion with BamHI andHincII were used as probes. The cDNA probe sequences were verified by sequence analysis.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCRGenePrimers sequencesProduct sizehMLH15′-CACCGGGATCAGGAAAGAAG-3′ (position 216–235)7015′-TGATTTCTAAACTGAGGTACAGG-3′ (position 916–894)hPMS15′-CACTTCGGTGGTCAGTGTTG-3′ (position 134–153)7275′-GATGAAACTTCTTTCTGGTGTTG-3′ (position 860–837)hPMS25′-AAGTTTCAGACAATGGATGTGG-3′ (position 202–223)7705′-AAGAACAACAAATGGATACTGG-3′ (position 971–950) Open table in a new tab Total RNA (20 μg) was separated by electrophoresis through 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random oligonucleotide priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization of membranes was carried out with radiolabeled probes (106 cpm/ml) in hybridization buffer (ULTRAhyb; Ambion) at 45 °C overnight. Autoradiography was performed by exposing the blots at −70 °C. The blots were stripped and rehybridized with α-32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA probe as control. Established cancer cell lines have been productive models to study DNA mismatch repair deficiencies underlying microsatellite instability in gastrointestinal cancers. We therefore used a number of gastric cancer cell lines and a colorectal cancer cell line to investigate alterations of the MutL complex. The MSI-positive cell lines studied included the colorectal cancer line HCT-116 (30.Umar A. Boyer J.C. Thomas D.C. Nguyen D.C. Risinger J.I. Boyd J. Ionov Y. Perucho M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

In addition, we tested additional gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, N-87, and SNU-16) and determined their patterns of microsatellite instability with four microsatellite markers that included three dinucleotide markers and one mononucleotide marker (Table II). Eight or nine different cell clones were examined with each microsatellite marker. SNU-1 cells displayed marked instability in both the dinucleotide and in the BAT marker (Fig.1), whereas N-87 cells only showed one clone with microsatellite instability at the D13S170 dinucleotide repeat (Table II).Table IIMSI in gastric cancer cell lines by multiple cell clone analysisCell linesD13S170D2S123TP53BAT26AGS0 /90 /90 /90 /9N-871 /90 /90 /90 /9SNU-160 /90 /90 /90 /9KATO-III0 /90 /90 /90 /9SNU-14 /84 /84 /83 /7HCT-1164 /94 /97 /93 /8 Open table in a new tab Table IIIProtein and RNA expression of MutL and hMSH2 MMR genes in cultured cancer cell linesCell lineMSIhMSH2hMLH1hPMS1hPMS2HelaNoYesYesYesYesHCT-116YesYesNoNoNoSNU-1YesYesNoNoNoAGSNoYesYesYesYesN-87YesYesYesYesYesKATO-IIINoYesYesYesYes Open table in a new tab The expression of the MutL protein homologues hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1 and of the MutS homologue hMSH2 were examined by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2). Western blot analyses of MSI-positive SNU-1 gastric cancer cells showed that this cell line lacked detectable hMLH1 and hPMS2 and showed markedly reduced levels of hPMS1. HCT-116 cells (Fig. 2) and another gastric cancer line (SNU-638, data not shown) also showed decreased levels of the three MutL proteins. Expression of hMSH2 was similar in all lines tested (Fig. 2). Next, we examined whether the RNA levels of the three MutL proteins were similarly decreased. Northern blot analyses of the MutL genes revealed normal levels of hPMS1and hPMS2 mRNA in both SNU-1 (Fig.3) and HCT-116 cells (data not shown), whereas hMLH1 mRNA was almost undetectable in these two cell lines (Fig. 3).Figure 3RNA levels of hMLH1,hPMS1, hPMS2, and hMSH2in gastric cancer cell lines.

A human MutL-α complex consisting of hPMS2 and hMLH1 has been described in human cells (11.Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32.Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is likely that hPMS1 acts like the yeast homologue MLH3 and binds to hMLH1. To test this hypothesis we performed immunoprecipitation of protein extracts from the mismatch repair competent cell lines (HeLa, AGS, KATO-III, and SNU-16) and from the MSI-positive gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1) using an antibody that specifically recognizes hMLH1. After blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the transferred proteins were identified with antibodies against hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 (Fig.4 A). To further examine the physical association pattern of MutL proteins, we investigated whether hPMS1 binds hPMS2 by performing protein co-immunoprecipitation. Whole cell protein extracts from MSI-negative AGS cells, which express the three MutL proteins, were immunoprecipitated with hPMS2 antibody, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and reacted with either hMLH1, hPMS1, or hPMS2 antibodies (Fig. 4 B). The hMLH1 and hPMS2 antibodies recognized their target proteins after immunoprecipitation by the hPMS2 antibody, but hPMS1 antibodies did not (Fig. 4 B). In addition, proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-hPMS1 reacted with anti-hMLH1 and anti-hPMS1 antibodies but not with anti-hPMS2 antibody, further supporting the notion that hPMS1 binds hMLH1 but not hPMS2. This finding demonstrates that hPMS2 and hPMS1 are present in the cell bound to hMLH1, but that hPMS1 and hPMS2 do not associate with each other. Interestingly, the amount of hPMS1 immunoprecipitated by anti-hPMS1 was similar to the amount of this protein immunoprecipitated by hMLH1 (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, the amount of hPMS2 immunoprecipitated by anti-hPMS2 was similar to the amount of this protein immunoprecipitated by hMLH1 (Fig.4 B). These findings suggest that hPMS1 and hPMS2 proteins exist in the cell predominantly bound to hMLH1, with a minimal free-protein pool (Fig. 4 B). Several theoretical possibilities for the association of hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 are depicted in Fig. 4 C. Our data suggest that the most likely model of MutL complex formation in human cells is depicted asF and G in Fig. 4 C, i.e.mutually exclusive heterodimers of hPMS2-hMLH1 (MutL-α) and hPMS1-hMLH1 (MutL-β). In this study we examined the expression of the three human MutL homologue proteins (hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2) in established gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and determined their association patterns. The colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 has been reported to carry a nonsense mutation in the hMLH1 gene that results in undetectable protein in Western blots and is associated with microsatellite instability (26.Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Wei Y.F. Ruben S.M. Carter K.C. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Adams M.D. Venter J.C. Hamilton S.R. Petersen G.M. Watson P. Lynch H.T. Peltomatli P. Mecklin J.P. Chapelle A.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1994; 263: 1625-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). In addition, we examined the expression of human MutL proteins in gastric cancer cell lines, including the SNU-1 line, which also displays absent hMLH1 protein as a result of a nonsense mutation in the coding region of the gene (25.Shin K. Yang Y. Park J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 124: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We confirmed that HCT-116 and SNU-1 cells have instability at both mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeat microsatellite loci. However, in addition to undetectable hMLH1 protein, a marked reduction in the levels of hPMS1 and hPMS2 proteins was also demonstrated. In this study, we also showed that the level of hMLH1 RNA was markedly reduced in both cell lines but that hPMS1 andhPMS2 RNA levels were normal. The decreased hPMS1 and hPMS2 protein levels with normal RNA levels in cells lacking hMLH1 protein suggest that hMLH1 protein is required to maintain normal levels of hPMS1 and hPMS2, which indicate that protein stability may be an important mechanism to maintain functional levels of DNA mismatch repair proteins. In support of this possibility, Buermeyer et al. (33.Buermeyer A.B. Wilson-Van Patten C. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M.

In addition to decreased hMLH1 protein levels, hMLH1 RNA levels were also low in SNU-1 and HCT-116 cells. This finding might be explained by data from recent studies indicating that hMLH1promoter methylation was associated with low levels of hMLH1RNA and protein in gastric cancers with a high level of MSI (21.Halling K.C.

A complex containing hMLH1 and hPMS1 was only recently described by co-expression of baculoviruses carrying cDNAs encodinghMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 in Sf9 cells, and in a yeast two-hybrid assay (3.Raschle M. Marra G. Nystrom-Lahti M. Schar P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine the patterns of interaction of the three MutL proteins in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation combined with Western blot analysis using cell lines with competent DNA mismatch repair function. Our results showed that a specific antibody against hMLH1 not only precipitated hMLH1, but also hPMS1 and hPMS2 (Fig. 4). Therefore, co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that the MutL proteins form a complex consisting of hMLH1, hPMS1, and/or hPMS2. Several models for the association of the three MutL proteins are possible, as represented in Fig. 4 C. The results of co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that hPMS2 and hPMS1 are present in the cell bound to hMLH1, but that hPMS1 and hPMS2 do not associate in the cell, resulting in two types of MutL heterodimers. The model of MutL protein association can thus be depicted as F (hMLH1-hPMS2 or MutL-α, because it was the first MutL complex described) and G (hMLH1-hPMS1 or MutL-β) (Fig. 4 C). The identification of two different forms of the MutL complex in human cells potentially increases the complexity of DNA MMR deficiencies associated with human disease, namely, in HNPCC and in sporadic cancers. In view of the apparent redundancy of the protein partners of hMHS2 (hMSH3 and hMSH6) and of hMLH1 (hPMS2, hMLH3, and hPMS1), it is logical that the most critical genes in DNA MMR are hMHS2 and hMLH1, matching the most frequent MMR gene deficiencies in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes and MSI-positive sporadic cancers (14.Liu B. Parsons R. Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N. Lynch H. Watson P. Jass J. Dunlop M. Wyllie A. Peltomaki P. de la Chapelle A. Hamilton S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Nat.

In other words, the redundancy of hPMS1 and hPMS2 may explain why these genes are rarely found mutated in cancers with the mutator phenotype. In conclusion, our data provide evidence for the association of hPMS1 with hMLH1 as a heterodimer in human epithelial cancer cells. In addition, normal levels of hMLH1 protein appear to be important in maintaining normal levels of hPMS1 and hPMS2 proteins, suggesting that PMS proteins are unstable in the absence of hMLH1. These findings raise the possibility that the assembly and stability of MutL complex proteins might be regulated by post-translational mechanisms."

We have compared the activities of a variety of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists in breast cancer and osteosarcoma cell lines engineered to stably maintain the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. In both cell types, GR activation by dexamethasone occurs via the disruption of mouse mammary tumor virus chromatin structure and the recruitment of receptor coactivator proteins. However, when challenged with a variety of antagonists the GR displays differential ability to activate transcription within the two cell types. For the breast cancer cells, the antagonists fail to activate the promoter and do not promote the association of the GR with either remodeling or coactivator proteins. In contrast, in osteosarcoma cells, the antiglucocorticoids, RU486 and RU43044, exhibit partial agonist activity. The capacity of these antagonists to stimulate transcription in the osteosarcoma cells is reflected in the ability of the RU486-bound receptor to remodel chromatin and associate with chromatin-remodeling proteins. Similarly, the observation that the RU486-bound receptor does not fully activate transcription is consistent with its inability to recruit receptor coactivator proteins.

Parczyk K. Klotzbucher M. Klocker H. Cato A.C. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Steroids regulate growth and development through binding to a superfamily of high affinity steroid receptors (SR)1 that regulate the transcription of target genes (2.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

Upon binding ligand the SR undergoes a conformational change that allows the receptor to dimerize and bind to the hormone response element within target genes (2.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

This multistep pathway, which ultimately results in changes in gene transcription, can be manipulated pharmacologically by steroid hormone antagonists. In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), antiglucocorticoids have been shown to either block the capacity of the GR to interact with the hormone response element or interfere with the subsequent processes linked to transcriptional activation (3.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1825-1834PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Differences in the activity of hormones and antihormones may reflect the ability with which the cellular transcriptional machinery discriminates between structurally distinct receptor conformations at the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain (5.Brzozowski A.M.

This region of the receptor is thought to form a protein interaction surface for steroid receptor coactivators (8.Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D.

Accordingly, interactions between steroid antagonists and the receptor would block the coactivator recruitment site, and this may then prevent transactivation. Steroid antagonists exhibit a range of activity between “pure” antagonists that efficiently antagonize receptor function and “mixed” antagonists that may selectively stimulate receptor action depending on cell type and/or promoter context (10.Nordeen S.K. Bona B.J. Moyer M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11.Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, with the estrogen receptor, ICI 164 384 is a pure antiestrogen, andtrans-4-hydroxytamoxifen is a mixed antagonist (12.Dhingra K. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 285-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, a class of progesterone receptor (PR) antagonists have been shown to function as mixed agonists (13.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These include compounds such as RU486 that induce a conformational change in the PR that is different from that induced by agonists such as progesterone or antagonists such as ZK98299 (13.Meyer M.E. Pornon A. Ji J.W. Bocquel M.T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 14.Allan G.F. Lombardi E. Haynes-Johnson D. Palmer S. Kiddoe M. Kraft P. Campen C. Rybczynski P. Combs D.W. Phillips A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1206-1213PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that the extreme carboxyl terminus of the PR may bind a corepressor that normally suppresses RU486 agonist activity resulting in partial agonist activity (15.Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12195-12199Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the partial agonist activity of RU486 is enhanced in the presence of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (10.Nordeen S.K. Bona B.J. Moyer M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11.Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus multiple factors including receptor structure, corepressor expression, and activation of protein kinase A signaling may influence the transactivation properties of an antagonist-bound receptor. Transactivation of steroid-responsive genes may also be regulated by the chromatin structure of the promoter (16.Archer T.K. Deroo B.J. Fryer C.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17.Wolffe A.P. Cell Res. 1997; 7: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells the DNA is intimately associated with histone and non-histone proteins, and the architecture of the DNA as chromatin can modulate gene expression (18.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In general, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes prevents the access of transcription factors to their binding sites and has a repressive effect on transcription (18.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Workman J.L. Buchman A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, hormone-induced chromatin remodeling is a hallmark of activated transcription for steroid-regulated genes (17.Wolffe A.P. Cell Res. 1997; 7: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter is a well defined model system to study glucocorticoid receptor activation of transcription (20.Archer T.K. Fryer C.J. Lee H.L. Zaniewski E. Liang T. Mymryk J.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When stably introduced into cells, the MMTV promoter reproducibly acquires a phased array of nucleosomes. Glucocorticoid treatment induces remodeling of the chromatin, the binding of transcription factors, and concomitant transcriptional activation (21.Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 22.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the ability of antiglucocorticoids to induce transcription, chromatin remodeling, and transcription factor binding at the MMTV promoter in breast cancer and osteosarcoma cell lines. The antiglucocorticoids ORG31710 (Org) and ZK98299 (ZK98) displayed no agonist activity in either breast or osteosarcoma cells. In contrast, RU486 and RU43044 (RU43) exhibited partial agonist activity in osteosarcoma cells but not in breast cancer cells. This partial agonist activity of RU486 was consistent with its ability to induce GR-mediated chromatin remodeling and transcription factor loading and reflected the capacity of the RU486-bound receptor to recruit components of the chromatin remodeling complex to the promoter in osteosarcoma cells. To generate a cell line expressing the MMTV-luciferase promoter, human osteosarcoma cell line ectopically expressing wild type GR, U20S-GR, was cotransfected with pLTRLUC and a puromycin resistance plasmid, pGKpuro, in a ratio of 10:1 by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar,23.Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml G418, and 1 μg/ml puromycin. Clonal derivatives were transferred to 6-well plates, grown to confluence, and screened for the presence of MMTV-luciferase by polymerase chain reaction. The clonal derivative UL3 was derived from U2OS-GR. T47D/A1-2 (A1-2) cells are human T47D breast cancer cells that were stably transfected with a GR expression plasmid and an MMTV-luciferase plasmid (24.Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The A1-2 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with dexamethasone (10−7m) or antiglucocorticoids (10−7m) for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated, digested with the indicated restriction endonucleases, or subjected to exonuclease III footprinting analysis as described previously (22.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25.Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For exonuclease footprinting experiments,HaeIII and BamHI were used as in vivoentry site enzymes for the exonuclease in UL3 and A1-2 cells, respectively. After purification of genomic DNA, all samples were digested to completion with HaeIII or BamHI as indicated. This provided an internal standard for assessing the extent of in vivo cleavages and confirmed that equivalent amounts of DNA were used for all reactions. Each sample (10–20 μg) was analyzed using linear Taq polymerase amplification with32P-labeled single-stranded primers specific for the MMTV long terminal repeat (MMTV-22, ′5-TCT GGA AAG TGA AGG ATA AAG TGA CGA-3′). As described previously, purified extended products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue film at room temperature (26.Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). UL3 and A1-2 cells were treated with dexamethasone or antiglucocorticoids for 16 h at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on the plate by addition of 150 μl of Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). The plates were scraped, and the lysates were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 s at 12,000 × g. Twenty μl of each lysate was added to 100 μl of luciferase substrate; light output was monitored for 10 s, and relative light units were normalized for total protein. For immunoprecipitation, UL3 and A1-2 cells were treated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted. The cells were lysed by the addition of Buffer X (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and immunoprecipitated with an anti-GR antibody, BUGR2 (27.Gametchu B. Harrison R.W. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), as described previously (4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The washed immune complexes were resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and released by boiling for 5 min. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were resuspended in loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western blotting. Transcriptional activation from the MMTV promoter has been examined in a variety of mouse and human breast cancer cell lines (20.Archer T.K. Fryer C.J. Lee H.L. Zaniewski E. Liang T. Mymryk J.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine MMTV activation by glucocorticoids and antiglucocorticoids in a second endocrine tissue, bone-derived osteosarcoma cells, stable cell lines were generated from U2OS-GR osteosarcoma cells (23.Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and compared with T47D/A1-2 breast cancer cells. U2OS-GR cells were stably transfected with pLTRLUC, which contains the full-length MMTV promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. From the U20S-GR clones positive for the MMTV plasmid and responsive to hormone, one of the clones (UL3) was selected for a detailed mechanistic characterization of the hormone response. Steroid receptor antagonists have been used extensively to dissect receptor mechanisms of action (28.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1366-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29.Horwitz K.B. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). RU486 is one of the most extensively studied and clinically important hormone antagonist (30.Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar,31.Cadepond F. Ulmann A. Baulieu E.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although it binds both the GR and the progesterone receptor (PR) with high affinity and promotes at least partial transformation of the receptor to active form, RU486 also possesses potent antiglucocorticoid and antiprogestin activities (30.Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Cadepond F. Ulmann A. Baulieu E.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). RU486 and another antiglucocorticoid Org31710 (Org) have been classified as type II antiprogestins (32.Klein-Hitpass L. Cato A.C. Henderson D. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33.Bocquel M.T. Ji J. Ylikomi T. Benhamou B. Vergezac A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast the compound ZK98299 (ZK98), although structurally related to RU486, has been classically defined as a type I antiprogestin that does not promote conversion of the PR to a DNA-binding form in vitro (32.Klein-Hitpass L. Cato A.C. Henderson D. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33.Bocquel M.T. Ji J. Ylikomi T. Benhamou B. Vergezac A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of the mechanism of action of ZK98299 within in vivo systems has led to divergent data (3.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1825-1834PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Fryer C.J. Nordeen S.K. Archer T.K. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1905-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although developed to possess weaker antiglucocorticoid activity than RU486, ZK98299 and Org31710 act as antiglucocorticoids at high concentrations (3.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1825-1834PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Mizutani T. Bhakta A. Kloosterboer H.J. Moudgil V.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37.Neef G. Beier S. Elger W. Henderson D. Wiechert R. Steroids. 1984; 44: 349-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The antiglucocorticoid RU43044 (RU43) has a relative binding affinity for the GR that is comparable to Dex but is essentially devoid of any affinity for the PR or other steroid receptors (38.Teutsch G. Gaillard-Moguilewsky M. Lemoine G. Nique F. Philibert D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because some of these compounds bind more weakly to the GR than Dex, a range of concentrations from 10−8 to 10−6m was used for these studies. UL3 and A1-2 cells were treated with Dex, RU486, Org, ZK98, or RU43. Dex enhanced MMTV-Luc transcription 300–325-fold in UL3 cells (Fig.1 A). Treatment with Org or ZK98 induced at most a 3-fold activation of transcription at the highest concentration. In contrast, RU486 significantly induced transcription 60–75-fold depending on the concentration. RU43 at 10−6m induced MMTV-Luc transcription 30-fold. Consequently, the antiglucocorticoids RU486 and RU43 exhibited significant agonist activity in the UL3 osteosarcoma cells. The partial agonist activities of steroid receptor antagonists such as the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, and RU486 have been shown to depend on tissue and cell type. Thus, we compared the ability of these antiglucocorticoids to activate transcription in A1-2 breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1 B). In A1-2 cells, Dex-induced MMTV-Luc transcription 1500–1750-fold depending on the concentration of hormone. In contrast to what was seen in UL3 cells, none of the antagonists, RU486, RU43, Org, or ZK98, significantly induced transcription (Fig. 1 B). Thus, RU486 and RU43 exhibit significant agonist activity at the MMTV promoter in osteosarcoma cells but not in human breast cancer cells. Activation of target gene transcription in response to steroid treatment is a multistep process that includes remodeling of chromatin structure and assembly of a transcription preinitiation complex (39.Lee H.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter undergoes a structural transition upon glucocorticoid treatment such that the region encompassed by the second nucleosome, Nuc-B, becomes hypersensitive to restriction endonucleases (25.Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Given the differential ability of glucocorticoids and antiglucocorticoids to induce transcription from the MMTV-Luc reporter in UL3 and A1-2 cells, we examined the capacity of the GR to mediate chromatin remodeling at Nuc-B. We monitored the alteration in chromatin structure by examining the changes in cleavage by restriction enzyme SstI that cleaves within Nuc-B (see Fig. 2, schematic). As shown in Fig. 2 A, Dex treatment in UL3 cells resulted in elevated cleavage by SstI compared with untreated cells (cf. lanes C and D). Given that RU486 exhibited agonist activity in the osteosarcoma cell lines, we examined the capability of this antiglucocorticoid to induce GR-mediated restriction enzyme hypersensitivity. Treatment of UL3 cells with RU486 resulted in an elevated level of SstI cleavage (comparable to that induced by Dex) (lanes C, D, and RU). In contrast, treatment with the antagonist ZK98 that fails to activate transcription also failed to elevate cleavage by SstI in UL3 cells. Examination of A1-2 cells demonstrated that only Dex but not RU486 or ZK98 treatment resulted in enhanced cleavage bySstI (Fig. 2 B). These data are consistent with the partial agonist activity of RU486 at the MMTV promoter in UL3 cells but not A1-2 cells. Previous in vivo analysis of the MMTV promoter showed that chromatin remodeling is highly correlated with transcription (22.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 40.Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, chromatin remodeling is concomitant with the loading of transcription factors onto the promoter and the initiation of transcription (22.Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26.Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To ascertain if the differential capacity of RU486 to induce MMTV-Luc transcription in UL3 and A1-2 cells was reflected in differential loading of transcription factors onto the promoter, we investigated nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding by an in vivo exonuclease III footprinting assay (Fig. 3). The addition of Dex resulted in a clear induction of NF1 loading onto the promoter in both UL3 (Fig. 3,cf. lanes 1 and 2) and A1-2 cells (Fig. 3 cf. lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, treatment with RU486 induced NF1 binding to the promoter in UL3 cells but not A1-2 cells (Fig. 3 cf. lanes 1with 3 and 4 with 6). Thus RU486 treatment results in a level of GR-mediated chromatin remodeling and NF1 loading that is comparable to that induced by dexamethasone. These data are consistent with the ability of RU486 to induce partial agonist activity in the osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 1). The isolation of an extensive array of intermediary proteins that interact with steroid receptors to modulate receptor activities has been one of the most significant developments in the field of hormone-induced activated transcription (42.Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 44.Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Steroid receptors have been shown to interact in a ligand-dependent manner with coactivator complexes including proteins such as SRC-1/NCoA1, TIF-1, RIP-140, ERAP-160, p/CIP, and CBP/p300 as well as many others (42.Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 44.Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). MMTV activation by the GR depends on chromatin remodeling of the promoter as an obligatory first step (4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In the next set of experiments we examined GR interaction with the hBRG1 chromatin remodeling complex as well as the coactivators SRC-1/NCoA1, p/CIP, and CBP in both UL3 and A1-2 cells (Fig. 4). We compared GR protein/protein interactions following Dex, RU486, and Org treatment to see if these interactions correlated with the capacity of the hormones to induce activation of transcription. In a coimmunoprecipitation experiment, we detected a hormone-dependent association of the GR with hBRG1 upon treatment of osteosarcoma cells with either Dex or RU486 (Fig. 4 A, cf. lanes 1–3). This is consistent with the capability of both of these compounds to induce chromatin remodeling at Nuc-B and activate transcription. However, Org was unable to induce GR association with hBRG1 (Fig. 4 A, cf. lanes 1 and 4), congruent with its inability to activate MMTV-Luc transcription (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, in A1-2 cells only the agonist Dex was able to induce GR coimmunoprecipitation of hBRG1 (Fig. 4 A, cf. lanes 1 and 2). RU486 or Org treatment did not promote GR interaction with hBRG1 above control levels (Fig.4 A, cf. lanes 1 with 3 and4). The absence of a hormone-dependent GR/hBRG1 interaction upon RU486 treatment correlates with the inability of RU486 to induce chromatin remodeling and transcription factor loading at the MMTV promoter in A1-2 cells (Figs. 2 and 3). The ability of the GR in UL3 cells to associate with the hBRG1 complex in the presence of RU486 could result from differences in the receptor or the relative levels of hBRG1-associated factors (BAFs) (45.Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). One would anticipate that RU486 would induce similar GR conformation in both cell types so we focused on potential differences in the hBRG1-associated factors between the cell types. In the next series of experiments we examined the relative levels of the hBRG1 complex in both A1-2 and UL3 cells by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Both cell types express comparable levels of hBRG1 and BAF60a, although the BAF 60a isoforms differ between the two cell types (Fig. 4 B). However, examination of BAFs 250, 170, and 155 reveal that these proteins are present at significantly higher levels in UL3 cells. In addition BAF 170 appears to have an additional isoform in UL3 cells (Fig. 4 B). The higher levels of these components may permit RU486 association with the GR that is also expressed at higher levels in UL3 cells. We also examined the association of the coactivators NCoA1, CBP, and p/CIP with GR upon Dex, RU486, and Org treatment (Fig. 4, Cand D). Consistent with published data, Dex induces a hormone-dependent association of the GR with NCoA1, CBP, and p/CIP in both UL3 and A1-2 cells (Fig. 4, B andC, cf. lanes 1 and 2) (4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, RU486 and Org were unable to induce this association in either cell line (Fig. 4, B and C, cf. lanes 1, 3, and 4). Therefore, in UL3 cells treatment with RU486 induces association of the GR with only a subset of the modulator proteins compared with what is observed with Dex treatment. The observation that RU486 does not induce GR association with the coactivators NCoA1, CBP, and p/CIP may partially explain why RU486 induces MMTV-Luc transcription at a level only 20% of that induced by Dex. The fact that Org fails to induce GR association with either hBRG1 or this group of coactivators may explain its pure antagonist activity (Fig. 1). Thus, upon RU486 treatment there is differential association of the GR with hBRG1, but not CBP, SRC-1/NCoA1, or p/CIP, in UL3 and A1-2 cells. The specific association of the GR with hBRG1 upon RU486 treatment in osteosarcoma cells may partially explain the mixed agonist/antagonist activity of RU486 in these cells. Steroid receptor antagonists have been invaluable tools in the dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying steroid receptor activation of transcription (16.Archer T.K. Deroo B.J. Fryer C.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The majority of studies examining the mixed antagonist/agonist activity of antihormones have been done with antiestrogens and antiprogestins (12.Dhingra K. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 285-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30.Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Cadepond F. Ulmann A. Baulieu E.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In case of estrogen receptor antagonists, some of the compounds have partial agonist effects on the skeletal system and have been used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of bone loss (46.Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S. Newcomb P.A. Jordan V.C. Carbone P.P. DeMets D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). In contrast to the protective effects of estrogens on bone, long term use of glucocorticoids in vivo induces bone loss (47.Lukert B.P. Raisz L.G. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 112: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). A comparison between the effects of antiglucocorticoids on gene regulation in breast cancer cells and bone-derived osteosarcoma cells would give us an insight on the differences in regulatory mechanisms in the two cell types. In this study the antiglucocorticoids RU486 and RU43044 exerted significant agonist activity and activated MMTV-Luc transcription in osteosarcoma cells but not human breast cancer cells. In mouse breast cancer cells, although the GR/type II antagonist has been shown to bind to DNA, it was unable to activate transcription (3.Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1825-1834PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have been observed with the antiestrogen tamoxifen that exhibits agonist activity in a tissue-dependent manner (48.Curtis R.E. Boice Jr., J.D. Shriner D.A. Hankey B.F. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 49.Rutqvist L.E. Johansson H. Signomklao T. Johansson U. Fornander T. Wilking N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). More directly, we show that the RU486-bound GR can effectively induce the chromatin transition necessary to allow the binding of NF1 to activate the MMTV promoter in osteosarcoma cells. Consistent with the ability to induce chromatin remodeling at Nuc-B, we detected an association of the GR with the hBRG1 complex in the presence of either RU486 or Dex. Although the precise mechanism for this interaction in UL3 cells is unknown, we did detect substantially higher levels of BAF 250, 170, and 155 along with the elevated levels of the GR in the UL3 cells relative to A1-2 cells. Although the chromatin transition observed in the presence of either Dex or RU486 was similar in UL3 cells, the resulting transcriptional activation induced by RU486 was at a reduced level in UL3 compared with that induced by Dex. One explanation for this substantially lower activation was provided by an examination of GR association with the coactivators SRC-1/NCoA1, CBP, and p/CIP. Treatment of osteosarcoma cells with Dex resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of GR and these coactivators. In contrast, RU486 did not promote GR association with any of the coactivators examined. Similarly, in the breast cancer cells none of the antagonists promoted the association with SRC-1/NCoA1, CBP, or p/CIP. The capability of hBRG1, but not coactivators, to associate with the RU486-bound GR provides an explanation for the partial transcriptional activation observed with the antiglucocorticoids in UL3 cells. Previous studies revealed a requirement for the hBRG1 chromatin remodeling complex for glucocorticoid-dependent activation of MMTV (4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Association of the GR with coactivators in the absence of hBRG1 complex failed to activate transcription from chromatin templates (4.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that in osteosarcoma cells RU486 induces GR association with hBRG1 to partially activate MMTV transcription. This is consistent with an important role for chromatin remodeling in the activation of transcription, suggesting that there may be an intrinsic transcriptional activation potential in the remodeling process independent of the coactivators (16.Archer T.K. Deroo B.J. Fryer C.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, this activation by RU486 is only ∼20% that seen with a true agonist, implying that additional coactivators make significant contributions to the fully active GR at genes assembled as chromatin. Given the extensive clinical use of hormone antagonist in the treatment of breast cancer and other endocrine diseases, the capacity to predict if an individual antihormone will block the activity of a specific receptor, in one cell context but not another, may be of significant clinical importance.

Using the recognition properties of an anti-Lewis Y (LeY) antibody, BR55-2, as a model system, we establish a molecular perspective for peptide mimicry by comparing the three-dimensional basis of BR55-2 binding to LeY with the binding of the same antibody to peptides. The peptides compete with LeY, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Biacore analysis. The computer program LUDI was used to epitope map the antibody-combining site, correlating peptide reactivity patterns. This approach identified amino acids interacting with the same BR55-2 functional residue groups that recognize the Fucα(1–3) moiety of LeY. Molecular modeling indicates that the peptides adopt an extended turn conformation within the BR55-2 combining site, serving to overlap the peptides with the LeY spatial position. Peptide binding is associated with only minor changes in BR55-2, relative to the BR55-2-LeY complex. Anti-peptide serum distinguishes the Fucα(1–3) from the Fucα(1–4) linkage, therefore differentiating difucosylated neolactoseries antigens. These results further confirm that peptides and carbohydrates can bind to the same antibody-binding site and that peptides can structurally and functionally mimic salient features of carbohydrate epitopes.

Defining the configuration of native carbohydrate structures recognized by antibodies is important to adequately assess the extent to which peptide mimotopes use the same binding mechanisms that are used by carbohydrate antigens. LeY is found on some human neoplastic cells, including those from breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer (20.Dabelsteen E. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but it is also expressed on diverse pathogens such as on the human immunodeficiency virus envelope proteins (5.Agadjanyan M.

The immune response in mice immunized with synthetic LeY formulations demonstrate various degrees of cross-reactivity with the related neolactoseries antigens Lewis X (LeX), sialyl-LeX (sLeX), Lewis a (Lea), sialyl-Lea, and Lewis b (Leb), which share common topographies (Table I). Paradoxically, this generated humoral response can fail to recognize natively presented LeY (22.Kitamura K. Stockert E. Garin C.P. Welt S. Lloyd K.O. Armour K.L. Wallace T.P. Harris W.J. Carr F.J. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12957-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that LeY vaccines might lack sufficient specificity and may not be able to direct an immune response against LeY constitutively expressed on neoplastic cells, for example (22.Kitamura K.

Steplewski Z. Co M.-S. Kieber-Emmons T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and how LeY binding and peptide binding to the same subset of anti-LeY antibodies are related (9.Murali R. Kieber-Emmons T. J. Mol. Recognition. 1997; 10: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously generated a model for studying the interaction of LeY with the anti-LeY monoclonal antibody BR55-2 (25.Scholz D.

Lubeck M. Loibner H. Scholz D. Koprowski H. Hybridoma. 1990; 9: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The BR55-2 co-complex model therefore provides information necessary to determine the extent to which peptide mimotopes of LeY can be structurally correlated with natively expressed LeY. In this report, we describe the structural basis for the LeY-antigenic mimicry of some peptides in binding to BR55-2.A structure-based computer-screening approach was used to assemble an epitope map of the potential amino acids that could interact with the BR55-2 combining site (9.Murali R.

This mapping confirmed the participation of previously identified YRY and WRY motifs reacting with BR55-2 (28.Luo P. Agadjanyan M. Qiu J.-P. Westerink M.A.J. Steplewski Z. Kieber-Emmons T. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 865-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and suggested a new putative sequence, FSLLW, that adopted an extended turn-like structure within the BR55-2 combining site. The accuracy of this approach was corroborated by the isolation of this putative sequence within a peptide selected from a random peptide display library (29.Qiu J. Luo P. Wasmund K. Steplewski Z. Kieber-Emmons T. Hybridoma. 1999; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, vaccination with the phage-isolated peptide containing the FSLLW sequence induces a highly specific anti-LeY response that distinguished the Fucα1–3GlcNAc from the Fucα1–4GlcNAc linkage that is observed in neolactoseries antigen homologs (Table I). These results provide further evidence, at the molecular level, that surrogate antigens can bind by similar mechanisms as the carbohydrate that they mimic, inducing specific immune responses.DISCUSSIONPeptide mimotopes have been used to better define the fine specificity of anti-carbohydrate antibodies (15.Valadon P.

Nature Bio/Technol. 1999; 17: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An analysis of the details of the mimicry between peptide and carbohydrate ligands is relevant for defining structure/function correlates necessary in vaccine design applications. To increase the level of mimicry between the peptide and carbohydrate antigen, it is important to understand the structural basis of carbohydrate antigenicity. Specificity in protein-carbohydrate recognition is achieved by a combination of multivalency and geometry. General structural features associated with molecular recognition and interaction are the stacking of aromatic side chains against sugar rings, the presence of hydrogen bond networks in which sugar OH groups act as both acceptors and donors, and the coordination of multiple hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The structure of the complex of LeY with BR55-2 provides a molecular basis to understand peptide binding to the antigen-combining site and to explain peptide competition with LeY for BR55-2 binding.BR55-2 can bind to some peptides that contain the sequence tract (W/Y)RY, and such binding is mediated by the Arg residue that mimics the spatial position of Fucα(1–3) by contacting the same atoms within BR55-2 as complexed LeY (Table II). The mimicry for Fucα(1–3) by the guanidinium group of Arg might be a basis for partial mimicry of LeY by (W/Y)RY-containing peptides. We have shown that the Arg containing peptides K61106 and K61107 also bind to the anti-sLeX antibody FH-6 (28.Luo P. Agadjanyan M. Qiu J.-P. Westerink M.A.J. Steplewski Z. Kieber-Emmons T. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 865-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SLeX shares the Fucα(1–3) moiety with the LeY homolog (Table I). The single substitution of Pro for Arg, in the (W/Y)RY tract, reduces BR55-2 binding (Fig. 2), further demonstrating that specificity of binding can be determined by the identity of the peptide side chain constituents of the motif. These data provide strong evidence that peptides and carbohydrates can bind to the same antibody-binding site, whereas changes in peptide presentation lend to fine specificity of anti-carbohydrate antibodies.Conformational studies indicate that the (W/Y)(R/L)Y and (W/Y)PY motifs can adopt extended turn-like structures (3.Westerink M.A.J. Giardina P.C. Apicella M.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9.Murali R. Kieber-Emmons T. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that a particular peptide structure is required for polysaccharide mimicry. The extended turn characteristics of mimicking peptides are implicated as a binding mode conformation, as evidenced in a crystallographic structure of a peptide that mimics a cryptococcus carbohydrate epitope, in complex with an anti-cryptoccocal antibody (7.Young A.C. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using a structure-based design approach, we identified another sequence, FSLLW, which displayed a binding mode structure of the extended turn type in which the FSL residues spatially mimic the Fucα(1–3)GlcNAc moiety of LeY for binding to BR55-2. This sequence tract was identified in a peptide isolated by phage display screening with BR55-2 (29.Qiu J. Luo P. Wasmund K. Steplewski Z. Kieber-Emmons T. Hybridoma. 1999; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results suggest that we can develop putative peptide binding motifs theoretically, which resemble peptides isolated by phage isolation. The peptide K61104 did not display FH-6 binding (data not shown), implying that the FSLLW containing peptide interaction with BR55-2 is specific. K61104 competed with LeY for binding to BR55-2 (Fig. 2), again indicating that the peptide and LeY can bind to the same binding site on BR55-2.It is possible that LeY, expressed on tumor cell surfaces, is displayed as “oligosaccharide patches” or as “clustered” epitopes. Immunization with a multivalent tetrasaccharide form of LeY induces serum that cross-reacts with natively expressed LeY (6.Kieber-Emmons T. Luo P. Qiu J.-P. Chang T.Y., O, I. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Steplewski Z. Nature Bio/Technol. 1999; 17: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas the same tetrasaccharide in monovalent form attached to carrier protein does not induce antibodies cross-reactive with tumor expressed LeY (22.Kitamura K. Stockert E. Garin C.P. Welt S. Lloyd K.O. Armour K.L. Wallace T.P. Harris W.J. Carr F.J. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12957-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations present a viewpoint that multivalent synthetic form of LeY might be representative of the LeY structure naturally found on tumor cells. Consequently, we examined the interaction of multivalent forms of LeY and peptides with full-length anti-LeY monoclonal antibody BR55-2.Because valence plays a key role in protein-carbohydrate interactions, methods that allow monitoring the kinetic parameters that mediate these interactions is essential (42.Van Regenmortel M.H. Biomed. Pept. Proteins Nucleic Acids. 1995; 1: 109-116PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that multivalent probes contain “neo” epitopes that complicate analysis. To validate the use of multivalent forms, multivalent LeY was first examined for binding to BR55-2, where it was found that multivalent LeY can bind to BR55-2 in both a one- and two-site model (data not shown). The one binding site model gives a dissociation constant (KD) of 8 μm, which is similar to that observed for a Fab fragment of the anti-LeY antibody BR96 (9.9 μm) (43.Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004PubMed Google Scholar) and similar to that obtained previously for BR55-2 binding to tumor cells, as estimated by ELISA (44.Co M.S. Baker J. Bednarik K. Janzek E. Neruda W. Mayer P. Plot R. Stumper B. Vasquez M. Queen C. Loibner H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1118-1125PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, this result indicates that the multivalent form of LeY can emulate a single site interaction model.Using surface plasmon resonance methods we assessed the kinetics of binding of K61104 and K61107 peptides to BR55-2 (Fig. 3). These data, along with our ELISA results, show that the peptides are binding to the same binding site as LeY with approximately the same affinity. Based upon the relative ranking of K61104 and K61107 (Fig. 3) for BR55-2 binding, it appears that the K61107 peptide competes with LeY better than K61104 does. This result is consistent with those assessed from ELISA (Fig. 2). There is a trend toward a change in the kinetics of binding of BR55-2, dependent on the concentration of LeY, K61107, or K61104 competitor, particularly toward faster off rates. K61104 showed a clear cut change in the binding to species of BR55-2 (suspected to be with a single free site), where steady state is attained faster because of an increase in the off rate and binding curves that fit to a 1:1 interaction model. The bivalency of BR55-2 of binding in the present analysis may arise from the ability of murine antibodies to bind cooperatively through a Fc-dependent mechanism (45.Cooper L.J. Shikhman A.R. Glass D.D. Kangisser D. Cunningham M.W. Greenspan N.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2231-2242PubMed Google Scholar). Although such interactions are typically attributed to the IgG3 isotype, some IgG2a antibodies may still be affected by such interactions. This aggregation effect would be a measure of the avidity of BR55-2 to the multivalent probes rather than the resolution of the affinity of each binding event on a bivalent antibody with two nonindependent binding sites.The way in which the FSLLW sequence interacts with the BR55-2 heavy and light chain, emulating LeY binding, suggests that this putative sequence can function as a LeY mimic, inducing anti-LeY reactive antibodies. Immunization with the K61104 peptide leads to a LeY specific immune response (Fig. 4) that is mediated by selective interaction with the Fucα(1–3) GlcNAc moiety (Fig. 4 B). The immune response induced by the K61104 peptide is more specific than those induced by synthetic LeY formulations.These studies are suggestive that peptides can bind to isolating antibodies by the same mechanisms as the original carbohydrate antigen. This finding does not negate previous results suggestive that peptides are specific for their isolating monoclonal antibodies (41.Harris S.L. Craig L. Mehroke J.S. Rashed M. Zwick M.B. Kenar K. Toone E.J. Greenspan N. Auzanneau F.I. Marino A.J. Pinto B.M. Scott J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2454-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached by comparing panels of antibodies that recognize essentially the same carbohydrate epitope and consensus peptides isolated by the respective anti-carbohydrate antibodies. Here, we are examining one antibody, and it may be speculated that the K61104 peptide will not cross-react with other anti-LeY antibodies, nor should it. Panels of anti-LeY antibodies with different reactivities clearly suggest that LeY-reactive antibodies recognize different epitopes on the LeY antigen (19.Thurin-Blaszczyk M. Murali R. Westerink M.A.J. Steplewski Z. Co M.-S. Kieber-Emmons T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Vaccination with the K61104 peptide will nevertheless induce subsets of antibodies with the specificity that BR55-2 has for LeY. Furthermore, our findings imply that peptides with low affinity/avidity for isolating antibodies can still induce highly specific anti-carbohydrate immune responses. Previous studies on anti-idiotypic antibodies have shown that immune responses to mimics have little to do with affinity, a property associated mostly with antigenic mimicry (46.Monafo W.J. Greenspan N.S. Cebra T.J. Davie J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2702-2707PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Raychaudhuri S. Kang C.Y. Kaveri S.V. Kieber-Emmons T. Kohler H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 760-767PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a peptide mimic of the polysaccharide cryptoccocal epitope, displaying high affinity for the isolating antibody, did not induce a high titer anti-carbohydrate immune response, suggesting that the peptide was only a partial mimic (7.Young A.C. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Although current procedures for predicting ligand-antibody interactions are limited, mainly because of the conformational flexibility of ligands and antibodies and because of the role of solvents in mediating ligand recognition and binding, the utilization of a crystallographically determined starting position can, nevertheless, lend to discrimination of differences in binding orientations of analogs. Although modeling does not account for multivalent interactions as represented in using MAP forms, multivalency by itself does not lead to BR55-2 binding as we showed in Fig. 2, in which MAP peptide K61111 does not bind to BR55-2. Modeling was used to define how the antibody-binding site might be recognized by peptide or by LeY. It is well known that peptides adopt different conformations under different conditions. There is no a priori way to know that a MAP form will affect the conformational presentation of a peptide (Table III). But if a peptide within the MAP form binds to an antibody, it is argued that it does so because the presented peptide adopts a binding mode conformation conducive to antibody binding. Consequently, strategies that evaluate binding modes of mimics within antibody combining sites provides relevant information as to the construction of an effective mimotope. Most likely this requires an improvement of the fitting between the bound peptide and the antibody, by maximizing particular interactions within the antibody heavy and light chains (7.Young A.C. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,8.Ghiara J.B. Ferguson D.C. Satterthwait A.C. Dyson H.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of antibodies in complex with peptides will facilitate structure-based design of peptide surrogates in vaccine applications. Strategies for improving the complementary association between peptide mimotopes and antibody-combining sites have been suggested (7.Young A.C. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The results presented here support the suggestion by Young et al. (7.Young A.C. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that molecular imprinting can be sufficient to generate a molecular mimetism from an immunological point of view. These studies further demonstrate a rational approach for the identification of peptidomimetics that can be used to direct the diversity of combinatorial libraries or to optimize strategies oriented to elicit a particular subset of antibodies in the context of an immune response. Carbohydrate antigens are important, distinguishing landmarks on many infectious agents and neoplasms and are thus potential targets for preventive or therapeutic vaccination. Unfortunately, carbohydrate vaccines are often poorly immunogenic, inducing weak IgM immune responses without long lasting properties. To augment carbohydrate reactive immune responses, peptides that antigenically and immunologically mimic carbohydrates have been proposed (1.Phalipon A. Folgori A. Arondel J. Sgaramella G.

Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids near the N terminus of I-2 and competition for PP1 binding by a synthetic peptide encompassing an I-2 N-terminal sequence suggested that a PP1 domain composed of amino acids Glu-53, Glu-55, Asp-165, Glu-166, and Lys-167 interacts with the N terminus of I-2.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). I-2 binds PP1 through multiple sequences, and one of these contains a KLHY sequence that could approximate to the KIXF PP1 binding motif (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R. Tsay H.-J.

FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1407Google Scholar). However, this sequence can be eliminated without reducing I-2 activity as a PP1 inhibitor (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R. Tsay H.-J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mechanism for PP1 inhibition by I-2 remains unknown. Disparities in structure-function of I-1 and I-2 has made it difficult to understand their common function as PP1 inhibitors. In recent studies, we turned our attention to analyzing the PP1 catalytic subunit and defining domains recognized by the protein inhibitors to gain further insights into the cellular mechanisms that regulate PP1 activity. Our initial studies (21.Connor J.H. Quan H.Q. Ramaswamay N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Lee E.Y.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) introduced point mutations in the yeast PP1 catalytic subunit and identified residues that abrogated PP1 binding and inhibition by I-1. This work was extended using a truncated as well as a chimeric PP1 catalytic subunit containing C-terminal sequences from the I-1/I-2-insensitive or type 2 serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A (22.Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies defined the β12-β13 loop as a critical structure for PP1 inhibition by toxins and I-1 and I-2. To identify additional interactions between PP1 catalytic subunit and I-1 and I-2, in this study we have analyzed PP1 mutants generated by substituting alanines in place of charged amino acids on the surface of PP1 to disrupt its interactions with protein regulators. This has identified a PP1 domain that uniquely defines the ability of I-2 to inhibit this enzyme. Mutant I-2 proteins then showed that the newly identified domain associates with an N-terminal sequence conserved in I-2 in many species. The protein-protein interactions between I-2 and PP1 that contribute to enzyme inhibition are discussed. Phosphorylase b was purchased from Calzyme, and phosphorylase kinase was from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-GAL4 DNA binding domain antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GLC7 alleles with various charged-to-alanine substitutions (23.Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pNC160 using Taq or Pfupolymerase, the forward primer, 5′CCGCCATGGGAATGGACTCACAACCAGTTGACG3′, and the reverse primer, 5′GGCGGATCCGATTTAGGACGTGAATC3′. This introduced NcoI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the GLC7 coding sequence. The GLC7 mutants were subcloned by blunt-end ligation into a unique SrfI site in pBluescript SK(+) using the pCR-Script SK(+) cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GLC7 alleles were then excised with BamHI/NcoI and ligated into theBamHI/NcoI sites of pAS1-CYH2 (24.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). To ensure that no additional sequences were introduced during polymerase chain reaction amplification, all GLC7 subclones were sequenced at the Iowa State Nucleic Acid Facility (Ames, Iowa). All GLC7 constructs were individually transformed into Y187 yeast strains and mated with Y190 yeast containing either pACTII-hI-1 (21.Connor J.H. Quan H.Q. Ramaswamay N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J.

Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Diploid yeast were grown on plates containing the selection media and transferred to liquid culture for quantitative analysis of PP1-inhibitor interaction. To quantitate the two-hybrid interaction, liquid cultures were grown toA 600 0.6. An aliquot of the culture (1.5 ml) was centrifuged, and the yeast were resuspended in 200 μl of Z buffer (100 mm H3PO4, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). To this, we added 50 μl of 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 25 μl of chloroform to permeabilize the cells, and the lysate was assayed for β-galactosidase activity usingO-nitrophenyl-S-d-galactoside as a substrate (26.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Purification of Glc7p was carried out as described previously (21.Connor J.H. Quan H.Q. Ramaswamay N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Lee E.Y.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast with a mutant GLC7 gene as the sole source of PP1 were grown in 1 liter of yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media to near saturation (A 600 0.6). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 1 mm EDTA and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and lysed using either a bead beater (3 × 1 min) or by three passages through a French press (1,000 psi). The lysate was centrifuged at 3,300 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was applied to heparin-Sepharose. The column was washed with 3 volumes of lysis buffer followed by 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaCl. PP1 was eluted using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. PP1 activity was assayed using phosphorylasea as substrate. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiotheitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol for storage at −80 °C.

Biol. 1998; 93: 41-59PubMed Google Scholar) were produced as described previously. Glc7p was assayed by a modified protein phosphatase assay. The enzyme was incubated with phosphorylasea (2 mg/ml) for 20 min at 30 °C. The assay was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). The protein suspension was centrifuged, and [32P]phosphate released into the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In assays with the inhibitor proteins, I-1 was added immediately before assaying for PP1 activity. I-2, on the other hand, was preincubated with the phosphatase for 20 min at 30 °C before addition of the substrate, phosphorylase a. Equivalent amounts of purified PP1 catalytic subunits (defined by phosphorylase phosphatase activity) in Tris-buffered saline were incubated with human I-2 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. After rocking with the I-2 beads for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were removed by centrifugation and washed twice with equal volumes of Tris-buffered saline. The supernatant and washes were pooled and assayed for remaining phosphorylase phosphatase activity. Yeast cultures expressing Glc7p mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain were grown to log phase, centrifuged, and lysed. The cytoplasmic fraction (10 μg of total protein) was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Glc7p-GAL4 fusion protein was detected with an antibody against the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Santa Cruz). The antibodies were visualized by the ECL reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutagenesis of the type 1 protein phosphatase gene (GLC7) has highlighted the multifunctional role of PP1 in yeast (28.Stark M.J. Yeast. 1994; 12: 1647-1675Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and generated mutant phosphatases that have been used to study PP1 regulation by mammalian proteins. Previously, we analyzed chemically mutagenized Glc7p and identified the β12-β13 loop as an essential determinant of PP1 inhibition by I-1 and other phosphatase inhibitors (21.Connor J.H. Quan H.Q. Ramaswamay N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Lee E.Y.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated 19 additional mutations in Glc7p produced by charged-to-alanine substitutions (23.Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A subset of these mutant enzymes was selected for detailed biochemical studies of PP1 inhibition by I-1 and I-2. This selection was based on three criteria. First, the mutated residues were conserved in all PP1 catalytic subunits from yeast to man but not present in type 2 phosphatases, which are insensitive to I-1 and I-2. Second, the mutated residues were located on the surface of the PP1 catalytic subunit as judged by the crystallography of PP1α (29.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), and third, the mutant alleles complimented a GLC7 deficiency that leads to lethality in yeast (23.Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby indicating that the mutant genes encoded active PP1 catalytic subunits. Nine mutated Glc7p enzymes were extensively purified and analyzed for their activity and regulation by I-1 and I-2 (Table I). Eight mutants were stable and active phosphorylase phosphatases, with specific activities indistinguishable from WT Glc7p. The D137A/E138A mutant lost significant activity during purification. This instability may be consistent with its temperature-sensitive phenotype in yeast (23.Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of seven PP1 mutants by I-1 was similar to that seen with WT PP1 (Table I and Fig.1 A), with IC50values of 2 nm. The only exception was D165A/E166A/K167A, which showed a slightly increased IC50 for I-1 between 8 and 10 nm.Table IBiochemical properties of mutant PP1 enzymesAlleleAmino acid substitutionPhosphorylase phosphatase activityIC50I-1I-2nmGLC7–101E53A/E55AYes225GLC7–127K110A/K112AYes23GLC7–129D137A/E138ANoGLC7–131K149A/D153AYes23GLC7–132D165A/E166A/K167AYes10850GLC7–133R186A/R187A/R190A/Q298KYes21GLC7–106E217A/D219AYes23GLC7–108E255AYes23GLC7–111D285A/E286AYes23GLC7–WTYes23Alleles or mutations in the yeast PP1 catalytic subunits generated by charged-to-alanine substitutions (23.Baker S.H.

The individual alleles, substituted amino acids, measured protein phosphatase activity using phosphorylasea as substrate, and sensitivity to the two mammalian inhibitors, I-1 and I-2, are summarized below. The IC50 values represent an average of at least three independent experiments with a standard error of less than 5%.

Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed for their biochemical properties. The individual alleles, substituted amino acids, measured protein phosphatase activity using phosphorylasea as substrate, and sensitivity to the two mammalian inhibitors, I-1 and I-2, are summarized below. The IC50 values represent an average of at least three independent experiments with a standard error of less than 5%. Several Glc7p mutants showed significant changes in their inhibition by I-2. Although WT Glc7p was inhibited by I-2 with an IC50 of 3 nm (Fig. 1 B), the E53A/E55A mutant was inhibited with an IC50 of 25 nm. D165A/E166A/K167A showed an even greater loss in its sensitivity to I-2, with an IC50 close to 1 μm. Thus, the surface domain defined by these two adjacent sets of charged residues may be particularly important for PP1 regulation by I-2. To address whether the reduced sensitivity to I-2 reflected changes in I-2 binding to the mutant PP1 catalytic subunits, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid assay with human I-2 as bait. All yeast phosphatases, mutant and wild type, effectively bound human I-2 (Fig.2 A). The E53A/E55A mutant showed a slightly increased association with I-2, whereas D165A/E166A/K167A showed a modest reduction in I-2 binding when compared with WT Glc7p. These differences in Glc7p/I-2 interaction were not significant and in large part attributed to variations in expression of the individual GAL4-Glc7p fusion proteins in yeast (Fig.2 B). Association of WT and mutant PP1 enzymes with human I-2 was also assessed using a coprecipitation or pull-down assay in which equivalent amounts of phosphorylase phosphatase activity was incubated with increasing concentrations of human I-2 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Fig. 3). As reported in earlier studies for PP1 binding to a fluorescent rabbit I-2 (30.Picking W.D. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10280-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a biphasic curve was obtained for PP1 binding to the immobilized human I-2. Most relevant for these studies, WT and mutant PP1 catalytic subunits associated with I-2 in an essentially identical manner. This suggested that the 10- and 500-fold reduction in sensitivity of the mutant PP1 enzymes to I-2 was not simply due to a loss in I-2 binding. We then turned our attention to defining regions of I-2 that might be recognized by this newly identified regulatory domain in PP1c. Previous studies had suggested that the N terminus of I-2 was particularly important for PP1 inhibition (20.Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the inhibition of WT and mutant yeast PP1 enzymes by two recombinant rabbit I-2 proteins. Truncation of C-terminal sequences yielded I-2(1–114) that inhibited WT PP1, E53A/E55A, and the D165A/E166A/K167A in a similar manner to full-length I-2. In other words, E53A/E55A and D165A/E166A/K167A were increasingly resistant to inhibition by I-2(1–114) when compared with WT PP1c (Fig.4 A). As seen with mammalian PP1c (20.Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of N-terminal 35 amino acids that produced I-2(36–204) markedly increased its IC50 for inhibition of WT yeast PP1 to nearly 400 nm. I-2(36–204) inhibited the WT and mutant yeast phosphatases with nearly identical IC50values (Fig. 4 B). This suggested that the differences in inhibition of WT and mutant Glc7p enzymes by full-length I-2 most likely arose from their differing interactions with the N-terminal 35 amino acids in I-2. Recent studies identified the tetrapeptide sequence Ile10-Lys-Gly-Ile13 in I-2 as a potential site of interaction with the PP1 catalytic subunit. Mutating two amino acids, Lys11 and Ile13, in human I-2 resulted in a marked right-shift in IC50 for the inhibition of rabbit skeletal muscle PP1c (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R. Tsay H.-J. Li H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We analyzed this double mutation in recombinant human I-2 and found that like I-2(36–204), the Lys11Glu/Ile13Gly mutant was a less effective PP1 inhibitor. More importantly, I-2(Lys11Glu/Ile13Glu) failed to distinguish between WT Glc7p and the two mutants, E53A/E55A and D165A/E166A/K167A, inhibiting all three enzymes in an identical manner (Fig.5 A). Another way to assess the impact of PP1 mutations on its regulation by I-2 was by competition with a synthetic peptide, I-2(6–20), which represents a potential PP1-binding site. Previous studies showed that the synthetic peptide, I-2(6–20) (at concentrations up to 25 μm), was not inhibitory toward mammalian PP1c but increased the IC50 for its inhibition by WT I-2 by more than 20-fold (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R. Tsay H.-J. Li H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, 25 μm I-2(6–20) had no effect on the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of WT and mutant yeast PP1 enzymes. However, at this concentration, I-2(6–20) peptide produced a 20-fold right shift in the inhibition of WT Glc7p by full-length I-2, increasing the IC50 from 2 to 40 nm (Fig. 5 B). In similar assays, I-2(6–20) had a lesser effect on the inhibition of E53A/E55A by I-2, with only a 2–3-fold shift in the IC50 and no effect on the inhibition of D165A/E166A/K167A. This suggested that both PP1 mutants were compromised in their association with the I-2(6–20) peptide. Several mammalian protein inhibitors inhibit the type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatases. I-1 (13.Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), DARPP-32 (15.Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and CPI-17 (31.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), in their dephosphorylated state, weakly associate with the PP1 catalytic subunit and are not effective phosphatase inhibitors. After their phosphorylation, all three proteins are converted to potent PP1 inhibitors. In contrast, nanomolar concentrations of I-2 (20.Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NIPP-1 (32.Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and I-3/HCG V (33.Zhang J. Zhang L. Zhao S. Lee E.Y.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16728-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), even in their dephosphorylated state, inhibit PP1 activity. Moreover, I-2 and NIPP-1 form stable inactive complexes with the PP1 catalytic subunit that are reactivated by phosphorylation of the inhibitor proteins. However, reactivation maintains the association of PP1 with both inhibitors (30.Picking W.D. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10280-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggests that distinct interactions mediate the stable association and inhibition of PP1c by these protein inhibitors. Substituting clusters of charged residues on the surface of the yeast PP1 catalytic subunit with alanines, we have monitored both the binding and inhibition of mutant phosphatases by I-1 and I-2. This has identified two clusters of charged amino acids whose substitution has only minor effects (0–4-fold reduction) on PP1c inhibition by human I-1. These mutant enzymes were, however, 20–500-fold more resistant to inhibition by rabbit and human I-2. This points to a novel regulatory interaction that preferentially defines the inhibition of PP1 by I-2. As the mutated amino acids are unique to type 1 phosphatases, they may also dictate the specificity of I-2 as a PP1 inhibitor. We have also defined the region of I-2 that most likely mediates the regulatory interaction with the newly identified domain in the PP1 catalytic subunit. N- and C-terminal truncations of I-2 focused our attention on the N-terminal 35 amino acids of I-2. Systematic structure-function analysis of I-2 had previously identified residues 9–14 as particularly important for PP1 inhibition by nanomolar concentrations of I-2 (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R. Tsay H.-J. Li H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The combined substitutions, Lys11-Glu and Ile13-Gly, produced a 600-fold right shift in the IC50 for inhibition of WT Glc7p by I-2. Inability of E53A/E55A and D165A/E166A/K167A to discriminate between WT I-2 and I-2(Lys11Glu/Ile13Gly) suggested the charged-to-alanine substitutions modified the recognition site for an I-2 sequence that contains Lys11 and Ile13. This issue was also addressed by competition with a synthetic peptide, I-2(6–20), which reduced the efficacy of I-2 as a PP1 inhibitor (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R. Tsay H.-J. Li H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This peptide was much less effective in modifying the inhibition of mutant PP1 enzymes by I-2, consistent with the idea that the peptide binds to the region modified in the mutant PP1 enzymes. The specificity of this peptide was established by the fact that I-2(6–20) did not compete for PP1 inhibition by I-1 (data not shown) or DARPP-32 (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shihi S.-R.

Based on the preferential effect of the charged-to-alanine mutations on PP1 regulation by I-2 and the possible interaction of this PP1 domain with a sequence unique to I-2, we have called the region defined by amino acids Glu-53, Glu-55, Asp-165, Glu-166, and Lys-167 an I-2-preferring or simply “I-2 domain.” Human, rabbit, rat (35.Osawa Y.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are all weaker PP1 inhibitors, with IC50 values greater than 200 nm. That rat I-2β does not compete with I-2α as a PP1 inhibitor suggests that the site 1 interaction increases the affinity of I-2 for PP1c (35.Osawa Y. Nakagama H. Shima H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, substituting the N-terminal 20 amino acids in Drosophila I-t with 35 residues from the N terminus of human I-2 enhanced its potency as a PP1 inhibitor by more than 20-fold (38.Helps N.R. Vergidou C. Gaskell T. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our data, however, suggest that mutations in PP1c that alter the putative site 1 recognition domain have no apparent effect of I-2 binding. Thus, the site 1 sequence most likely plays a unique role in PP1 inhibition by I-2. The canonical PP1 binding sequence KIXF binds in a hydrophobic pocket (16.Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T.

KIXF peptides modeled on DARPP-32 (15.Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) attenuate PP1 inhibition by I-2. This either suggests that I-2 binds in the hydrophobic pocket, perhaps through a less recognizable sequence, or there is interplay between the hydrophobic pocket and the I-2 domain. One of the amino acids analyzed in this study, Asp-165, lies at the boundary between the hydrophobic pocket and the I-2 domain. Asp-165 cooperates with Arg-64 and Arg-65 in the hydrophobic pocket to create a “favorable electrostatic environment” for the binding of a KIXF peptide (17.Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This could explain the modest change in sensitivity of the D165A/E166A/K167A mutant to I-1, which absolutely requires the KIQF sequence for PP1 inhibition. The charged amino acids that attenuate PP1 inhibition by I-2 are separated in the primary structure of PP1c by more than 100 residues, yet lie within 11 angstroms of each other in the three-dimensional structure of PP1α (Fig. 6 C). Glu-53 and Glu-55 are located at the end of the β1 sheet, and the Asp-165/Glu-166/Lys-167 cluster is in the loop connecting the β5 and β6 sheets. Both of these structures contribute to the architecture of the PP1 active site that dictates metal binding. It is interesting to note that PP1 inhibition by I-2 converts it to an enzyme that requires added divalent cations for activity (34.Brautigan D.L. Picton C. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5787-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting a distortion of the PP1 catalytic center by I-2. In any case, I-2 binds at multiple sites on the PP1 catalytic subunit (19.Yang J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1407Google Scholar), and only some of these interactions mediate PP1 inhibition. Thus far, two domains, the β12-β13 loop and the I-2 domain, have been shown to define the efficacy of I-2 as a PP1 inhibitor. These domains along with the hydrophobic pocket are roughly aligned along the back the PP1 catalytic subunit (Fig. 6 C). At least two models can be proposed to allow I-2(1–114) to associate at one or more of sites and inhibit PP1 activity (Fig. 6, Dand E). In the full-length I-2, Park and DePaoli-Roach (20.Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identify additional interactions of PP1c with sequences C-terminal to I-2(1–114) that mediate the slow inactivation of PP1c. This inactivation is reversed by glycogen synthase kinase-3-mediated phosphorylation of threonine 72 in I-2 and has been proposed to define the function of I-2 as a PP1 “chaperone” that refolds denatured PP1 catalytic subunits in vitro (5.Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 36.Bennett D. Szoor B. Alphey L.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A dual role for I-2, as an inhibitor and an “activator” of PP1c, might explain the paradoxical observation that Glc8 both augments and inhibits PP1 functions in budding yeast (40.Tung H.Y.L. Want W. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In any case, the KIXF peptide from NIPP-1 (41.Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) attenuates both PP1 inhibition and inactivation by I-2, suggesting that a subset of the protein-protein interactions that occur between PP1 and I-2 mediate both events. Clearly, more work is required to define the full extent of the interactions that regulate the PP1/I-2 complex in mammalian tissues. Cellular levels of I-2 (43.Brautigan D.L. Sunwoo J. Labbe J.C. Fernadez A. Lamb N.J. Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Glc8 (44.Cannon J.F. Clemens K.E. Morcos P.A. Nair B.M. Pearson J.L. Khalil M. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 211-232Google Scholar) fluctuate during cell division in mammalian and yeast cells, respectively. I-2 also shuttles in and out of the nucleus during the mammalian cell division cycle (45.Kakinoki Y. Somers J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32308-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this shuttling is modulated by the phosphorylation of I-2 on threonine 72. Consequences of altered subcellular distribution and/or I-2 levels for PP1 regulation are unclear, but further structure-function analyses of I-2 may also resolve this issue. In conclusion, our data provide experimental support for the hypothesis that structurally diverse PP1 regulators recognize distinct structural elements on the PP1 catalytic subunit to modulate enzyme activity. By defining the molecular determinants that mediate PP1c regulation by I-2, we should be better equipped to elucidate the physiological functions of different I-2 proteins and gain an improved understanding of the role of I-2 in cell signaling.

We studied two mutant AT1 receptors, termed M5 and M6, that contain Y to F substitutions for the tyrosine residues naturally found in the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl terminus. After binding ligand, both the M5 and M6 AT1 receptors trigger STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation equivalent to that observed with the wild type receptor, indicating that angiotensin II-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 is independent of these receptor tyrosine residues. In response to angiotensin II, Jak2 autophosphorylates on tyrosine, and Jak2 and STAT1 physically associate, a process that depends on the SH2 domain of STAT1 in vitro. Evaluation of the wild type, M5, and M6 AT1 receptors showed that angiotensin II-dependent AT1 receptor-Jak2-STAT1 complex formation is dependent on catalytically active Jak2, not on the receptor tyrosine residues in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl tail. Immunodepletion of Jak2 virtually eliminated the ligand-dependent binding of STAT1 to the AT1receptor. These data indicate that the association of STAT1 with the AT1 receptor is not strictly bimolecular; it requires Jak2 as both a STAT1 kinase and as a molecular bridge linking STAT1 to the AT1 receptor.

Chinese hamster ovary hemagglutinin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase wild type Angiotensin II is a biologically active peptide that acts as both a hemodynamic regulator and as a growth factor. Growth factor properties of angiotensin II have been demonstrated in a variety of cell types. For example, in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II induces hypertrophy, increases cell matrix formation and, under certain conditions, causes hyperplasia (1.Gibbons G.H. Pratt R. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These mitogenic effects have been linked to pathophysiological conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and restenosis (2.Dzau V.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1987; 10: S9-S16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular response to angiotensin II is directed by specific G protein-coupled receptors. There are two major classes of angiotensin II receptors that are now referred to as the AT1 and AT2 receptor subtypes (3.Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The use of subtype specific inhibitors has demonstrated that the hemodynamic and growth factor effects of angiotensin II are mediated almost exclusively, by the AT1 receptor (4.Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar). AT1 receptors bear the structural features of the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and thus are structurally different from cytokine or growth factor receptors. Despite this, evidence suggests that the AT1 receptor can activate the Jak-STAT signaling pathway transducing cell surface signals into the cell cytoplasm and nucleus (5.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 6.Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Jak family of intracellular tyrosine kinases consists of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, which range in size from 130 to 135 kDa (7.Schindler C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 8.Ihle J.N. Witthuln B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). These proteins have a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain immediately preceded by a pseudokinase domain. The Jaks lack a transmembrane domain and have no SH2, SH3, PTB, or PH domains. With the exception of Jak3, Jaks are ubiquitously expressed. The STAT (signal transducer andactivators of transcription) proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors originally identified as part of cytokine signal transduction pathways. Subsequently, a wide variety of ligands were found to activate STAT family members. STAT proteins are involved in various biological functions like cell transformation, development, differentiation, immunity, and apoptosis (9.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Structurally, STATs possess a single highly conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site, an SH2 domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a transactivation domain. In vascular smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak2 (5.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, and STAT5. In cardiac myocytes, Charlene et al. (10.Charlene D.M. Rachel A.H. Kathleen M.C. David E.D. Baker K.M. J. Mol. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2513-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that angiotensin II, acting through the AT1 receptor, can induce STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, translocation to the nucleus, and initiation of gene transcription. These data show that the AT1 receptor can signal to the nucleus via the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, analogous to that of cytokine receptors. The paradigm of STAT activation by a cytokine receptor is that STATs are transiently recruited to the receptor complex via binding to specific phosphotyrosine residues through their SH2 domain (8.Ihle J.N. Witthuln B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 9.Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). The receptor bound STAT proteins are then tyrosine phosphorylated by Jaks associated with the membrane proximal portion of the receptor. The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins is obligatory for STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation, and subsequent DNA binding. In addition, selective recruitment of STAT proteins to phosphotyrosine residues of the receptor is a mechanism that may impart selectivity of STAT activation to different cytokines (11.Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreibeer R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 12.Novak K. Nice E. Hamilton J.A. Pradisol L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2607-2613PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is established that the AT1 receptor activates the Jak-STAT pathway, the biochemical sequence of events leading to association of the AT1 receptor and STAT proteins has not been defined. The problem in applying the paradigm of cytokine receptors for STAT activation by the AT1 receptor is that phosphotyrosine-dependent protein-protein interaction has never been established for a G protein-coupled receptor. In analyzing this problem, there are two logical possibilities. One mechanism involves a direct interaction of STATs with the AT1receptor. A second potential mechanism is that an ancillary molecule may interact with STATs, which in turn form a complex with the receptor. In this report, we studied the mechanism of AT1receptor-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation in cultured COS-7 and CHO1/AT1 cells. We demonstrate that angiotensin II stimulates STAT1 phosphorylation through the specific activation of Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity. The AT1 receptor contains one tyrosine residue in the third intracellular loop, one tyrosine in the seventh transmembrane domain, and four tyrosines in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. We mutated these residues to phenylalanine and examined the ability of the mutant receptors to induce angiotensin II-dependent STAT1 signaling. Although STAT1 phosphorylation is regulated by the AT1 receptor, it is independent of the phosphorylation of these six AT1 receptor tyrosine residues. Rather, phosphotyrosine residues in Jak2 appear critical for recruiting STAT1 to the AT1 receptor complex. These findings offer important advances in understanding the biochemical mechanism of STAT1 activation by seven transmembrane receptors. The polyclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation of Jak2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal antibody used for Western blotting of Jak2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies directed against STAT1 and the HA tag (clone 12CA5) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Antiphosphotyrosine PY99 and 4G10 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz and Upstate Biotechnology. A full-length cDNA encoding the rat AT1A receptor was cloned into the pZeoSV vector containing an SV-40 promoter and a Zeocin resistance cassette. Mutants of the AT1 receptor were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using dut − ung − Escherichia coli according the protocols in the Bio-Rad mutagene kit. The M5 mutant contains phenylalanine in place of tyrosine at amino acids 292, 302, 312, 319, and 339. The M6 AT1 receptor contains a Y226F mutation in addition to those of the M5 AT1 construct. The GST-STAT1 fusion proteins were generous gifts of Dr. Christian Schindler of Columbia University (13.Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewske J.J. Schindler C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We obtained the HA-tagged AT1 receptor construct from Dr. R. Lefkowitz at Duke University (14.Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we made the HA-tagged pZeoM5/AT1, pZeoM6/AT1, and pZeoFAAA/AT1 receptor constructs. For each, the HA sequence YPYDVPDYA was expressed at the amino terminus of the receptor protein. pBOSWTJak2 (wild type Jak2) and pBODJK2ΔVIII (dominant-negative Jak2) were generous gifts from Dr. D. M. Wojchowski and were previously described (15.Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. CHO-K1 cells expressing pZeoAT1were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 150 μg/ml of Zeocin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells at 80% confluence were serum starved for 16–20 h prior to stimulation with angiotensin II. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies Inc.) as described previously (16.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants of CHO/AT1cells were also generated by Lipofectin using 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA. After an overnight incubation, cells were transferred to medium containing 400 μg/ml Zeocin. The medium was replaced after every 3–4 days. Zeocin resistant clones were isolated after 2–3 weeks. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well using 24-well tissue culture plates and tested for their ability to bind125I-Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II (DuPont). (4.Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar) Cells were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin (w/v)) to remove endogenous ligand. After aspiration, 200 μl of fresh binding buffer was added to each well, and binding was initiated by the addition of125I-Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II. A saturating concentration of125I-Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II was set at 1 nm, and serial dilutions are from this point. All samples were done in duplicate. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, and reactions were terminated by placing the plates on ice. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. Cells were lysed with 250 μl of 2 nNaOH for 30 min at 25 °C, and 150 μl was counted on a Beckman γ counter. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay with the remaining lysates. Nonspecific binding is defined as binding in the presence of 1.0 μmangiotensin II. Subconfluent cells were serum starved for 16–20 h. Following 100 nmangiotensin II stimulation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4. The cells were then lysed either in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 2.5 mm EDTA) or gentle lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 10% glycerol) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and then incubated with appropriate antibodies for 6–18 h. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose. The beads were washed extensively with either lysis buffer or wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl), and proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to specific antiserum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). To measure the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 or STAT1, proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cell lysates using either polyclonal anti-Jak2 antibody or monoclonal anti-STAT1 antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies. For in vitrobinding studies, we used GST (STAT1)-SH2 and a mutant form of GST(STAT1)-SH2 containing an R602K mutation. After expressing these proteins in DH5α, they were purified to homogeneity using glutathione Sepharose affinity chromatography as described by Gupta et al. (13.Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewske J.J. Schindler C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To study angiotensin II-dependent Jak2 interaction with the STAT1 fusion proteins, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the wild type AT1receptor and Jak2. The cells were treated with angiotensin II, and then cell lysates were prepared and incubated with 2 μg of STAT1 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were washed extensively with wash buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Jak2 in the GST-STAT1 fusion protein complexes was visualized by immunoblotting with Jak2 antibody. To assess the in vivo association of Jak2 with STAT1, COS-7 cells were stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for varying time periods, and lysates were prepared. STAT1 was precipitated using monoclonal anti-STAT1 antibody. Western blots were then probed with anti-Jak2 antibody. To determine the association of STAT1 and Jak2 with the AT1 receptor, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-HA antibody (12CA5), followed by Western blotting with STAT1or Jak2 antibodies. In those experiments comparing transfection of wild type Jak2 versus dominant-negative Jak2, cell culture dishes were transfected with somewhat greater quantities of the Jak2 dominant-negative construct to achieve equal protein expression of both the wild type and dominant-negative proteins (see Fig. 3, Aand B). We analyzed the activation of STAT1 in cultured COS-7 cells. These cells express high levels of STAT1, low levels of Jak2, and no endogenous AT1 receptor. Therefore, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with plasmids encoding the wild type AT1 receptor and wild type Jak2. Cell lysates were prepared after stimulation with angiotensin II for 0, 1, 3, 6, and 15 min and were immunoprecipitated with STAT1 monoclonal antibody. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig.1 A, upper panel). The onset of STAT1 phosphorylation is rapid and transient, with peak phosphorylation occurring at about 6 min after stimulation with angiotensin II. Identical results were obtained when we inverted the order of antibody addition (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Further, we confirmed previous published work showing that Jak2 is heavily autophosphorylated on tyrosine in response to angiotensin II (Fig. 1 B, lower panel) (5.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The time course of this phosphorylation is similar to that of STAT1. To verify that the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in our system is dependent on the AT1 receptor, transfected COS-7 cells were treated with losartan, a highly specific AT1 receptor antagonist. Losartan completely blocked angiotensin II-dependent STAT1 phosphorylation irrespective of the order of antibody addition (data not shown). Similarly, when COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type Jak2 and an empty vector in place of the AT1 receptor, no angiotensin II-dependent STAT1 phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). Both genetic and biochemical studies suggest that cytokine-dependent activation of Jak kinases are associated with the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. We therefore wanted to investigate whether a catalytically active Jak2 is a requirement for STAT1 phosphorylation. To address this question, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the wild type AT1 receptor construct and either wild type Jak2 (Jak2 WT) or a dominant-negative Jak2 construct (Fig. 1 C). The dominant-negative Jak2 construct contained two point mutations that rendered the Jak2 protein catalytically inactive (15.Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT1 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. There was a marked angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in cells transfected with wild type Jak2. In contrast, no such phosphorylation was observed in cells transfected with dominant-negative Jak2. To confirm equal immunoprecipitation of STAT1 in each lane, the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT1 antibody (Fig. 1 C, lower panels). Western blot analysis was also used to confirm equal protein expression of both the wild type and dominant-negative protein (data not shown). The AT1 receptor is a member of the seven transmembrane receptor superfamily. A structural feature that distinguishes the AT1 receptor is the long intracellular carboxyl terminus of the protein, a region of about 60 amino acids containing four tyrosine residues. This portion of the receptor is important for angiotensin II-mediated activation of intracellular tyrosine kinases, including Jak2 (16.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of tyrosine residues in STAT1 activation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create two mutant receptors called M5 AT1and M6 AT1. To make the M5 AT1 construct, we mutated the carboxyl-terminal five tyrosine residues to phenylalanine. One of these residues, Tyr292, is within the seventh transmembrane domain (17.Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The other four tyrosines are found within the intracellular carboxyl terminus. To create the M6 AT1receptor, the M5 AT1 construct was further modified by a Y226F mutation to the only tyrosine within the third intracellular loop. Ligand binding affinity was studied in CHO cells stably transfected for either the M5 AT1 or M6 AT1receptors. The measured K d values for M5 AT1 and M6 AT1 were 0.13 ± 0.02 and 0.14 ± 0.03 nm, values not significantly different from that of the wild type AT1 receptor (0.11 ± 0.02 nm). To analyze the ability of the M5 AT1 and M6 AT1receptors to activate STAT1 phosphorylation, two separate protocols were used. In the first protocol, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with each of the mutant receptors, as well as a plasmid encoding Jak2 WT. After the addition of angiotensin II, STAT1 phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-STAT1 antibody (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1–6). In response to angiotensin II, both the M5 AT1 and M6 AT1 receptors induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in a fashion indistinguishable from that of wild type receptor. This is in contrast to another AT1 receptor mutant termed FAAA AT1, in which the carboxyl-terminal motif YIPP (amino acids 319–322) was mutated to FAAA. Previously, we reported that FAAA AT1 was unable to stimulate Jak2 activation (16.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When the FAAA AT1 receptor was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, no ligand-dependent activation of STAT1 was observed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). The ability of the M5 AT1 and M6 AT1 receptors to stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT1 was also measured in CHO cell clones stably transfected with these receptors. Clones were selected with a total ligand binding capacity similar to a CHO cell clone stably transfected with the wild type AT1 receptor. Nontransfected, native CHO cells do not phosphorylate STAT1 in response to angiotensin II (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig.2 B, clones expressing the wild type AT1receptor, the M5 receptor, and the M6 receptor responded to ligand with a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. In the stably transfected CHO cells, STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal 30 min after the addition of ligand. This difference in time course between the transient transfection of COS-7 cells (Fig.2 A) and the stable CHO cell lines (Fig. 2 B) may reflect the much greater quantity of Jak2 expressed in the transient system as compared with the quantity of Jak2 present in CHO cells (data not shown). Also Bhat et al. (18.Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have observed that there is a delayed activation of sis-inducing factor in stably transfected CHO/AT1 cells because of the inhibitory effect of IL-6 in these cells. Thus, although the time course for STAT1 phosphorylation may vary, both the transient and stably transfected cell systems presented in Fig. 2 show that the six tyrosine residues present in the third intracellular loop, seventh transmembrane segment, and carboxyl terminus of the AT1 receptor protein are not essential for STAT1 phosphorylation. We have not yet created an AT1 receptor mutant in which all intracellular tyrosines are eliminated; however, the experiments in Fig. 2 raised the possibility that AT1 receptor activation of STAT1 may involve a third bridge-like protein capable of undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation. As we demonstrate below, this protein appears to be Jak2. For many cytokine receptors, the consensus sequence YDKPH may act as a specific motif for STAT1 recruitment to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (11.Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreibeer R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 12.Novak K. Nice E. Hamilton J.A. Pradisol L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2607-2613PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the AT1 receptor sequence revealed that the receptor lacks the putative binding motif for STAT1. However, the consensus-binding motif for STAT1 is present in Jak2 (19.Harpur A.G. Andrews A.-C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks F.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies, as well as data presented in Fig. 1 B, provide compelling evidence that Jak2 autophosphorylates following angiotensin II stimulation (5.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In addition, published reports have demonstrated a physical association of Jak2 with the AT1 receptor in response to angiotensin II (16.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Jak2 acts as a bridge molecule for STAT1 association with the AT1receptor, we first studied angiotensin II-mediated association of Jak2 and STAT1 by co-immunoprecipitation. For these experiments, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the AT1 wild type receptor and the Jak2 WT constructs. Cells were stimulated with angiotensin II for 0, 3, 6, or 15 min. A cell lysate was then immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT1 antibody followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Jak2 (Fig.3 A, panel a). This experiment showed that, in response to angiotensin II, Jak2 and STAT1 associate in a time-dependent fashion with maximal binding observed at 6 min (lane 3). Substitution of pooled rabbit IgG as the immunoprecipitating antibody led to no detectable Jak2 association (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). When the blot shown in Fig. 3 A was reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and when Jak2 identified by comparison with panel a, we observed that the Jak2 that associated with STAT1 was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 3 A, panel b). The experiments shown in Fig. 3 A were controlled by verifying that individual groups of transfected cells expressed equal amounts of STAT1 and Jak2 (Fig. 3 A, panels c andd). When the protocol used in Fig. 3 A was repeated using COS-7 transfected with the dominant-negative Jak2 construct in place of wild type Jak2, we observed no ligand-dependent association of STAT1 and Jak2 (Fig.3 B, panel a) and no tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (Fig. 3 B, panel b). The observation that STAT1 associates with catalytically active Jak2 but not with the dominant-negative construct, suggesting that autophosphorylation of Jak2 on tyrosine may play an important role in this bimolecular interaction. All STAT family members possess SH2 domains that interact with phosphotyrosine residues. To investigate the role of the STAT1 SH2 domain, we used two GST fusion proteins. The fusion protein termed GST-STAT1-SH2 contains 111 amino acids encoding the SH2 domain of human STAT1. The second fusion protein, GST-STAT1-SH2mut, was similar except that Arg602 was changed to Lys602. Previously, it was reported that the mutation of Arg602 disabled the interaction of this SH2 domain fusion protein with the phosphotyrosine residues of Jak1 (13.Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewske J.J. Schindler C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with wild type Jak2 and the wild type AT1 receptor. After stimulation with angiotensin II for 0, 3, 6, or 15 min, cell lysates were incubated with the GST-STAT1 fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After incubation and extensive washing, bound Jak2 was assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 C). In response to angiotensin II, increasing amounts of Jak2 associated with the GST-STAT1-SH2 fusion protein, with maximal association observed at 6 min (lane 3). In contrast, no such ligand-dependent association was observed with the GST-STAT1-SH2mut fusion protein. To verify that each sample received an equal amount of fusion protein, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-GST antibody (Fig.3 C, lower panel). We also verified that the addition of GST alone did not precipitate any detectable amount of Jak2 (data not shown). The data in Fig. 3 C suggest that the STAT1 SH2 domain probably plays an important role in the angiotensin II-dependent association of Jak2 and STAT1. To examine whether Jak2 acts as an ancillary molecule to bring STAT1 to the AT1 receptor, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with an HA-tagged AT1 receptor (HA-WT AT1) and wild type Jak2. The use of an HA-tagged AT1 receptor permits immunoprecipitation of the receptor and all associated proteins using the monoclonal antibody 12CA5. In the first experiment, transfected cells were stimulated with angiotensin II for 0, 3, 6, or 15 min, and then cell lysates were precipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. This experiment directly investigates whether the AT1 receptor is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to ligand (Fig. 4 A,top panel). Although the HA-AT1 receptor migrates as a band of roughly 72 kDa, no significant tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in a protein of this size. Even when the blot with overexposed, we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the AT1 receptor. This finding differs from the small level of basal AT1 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation previously reported in vascular smooth muscle cells (20.Paxton W.G. Marrero M.B. Klein J.D. Delafontaine P. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Rather, in this system, a marked ligand-dependent increase of tyrosine phosphorylation was present in a band of 130 kDa, the size of Jak2. Stripping and reprobing the blot with anti-Jak2 verified that the 130-kDa band was in fact Jak2 (data not shown). As a control for this experiment, the Western blot was stripped and reprobed with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel). This showed equal immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged AT1 receptor across all lanes. These data point to a difference between the paradigm of Jak-STAT activation by cytokine receptors and by the seven transmembrane AT1 receptor. To directly assess Jak2 and STAT1 association with the AT1receptor, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with an HA-tagged AT1 receptor (HA-WT AT1) and wild type Jak2. After addition of angiotensin II for 0, 3, 6, or 15 min, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with either anti-Jak2 (Fig. 4 B, top panel) or anti-STAT1 (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel). This clearly demonstrated an angiotensin II-dependent association of both Jak2 and STAT1 with the AT1 receptor. To demonstrate the specificity of the anti-HA antibody, immunoprecipitation was performed using pooled rabbit IgG (data not shown). As expected, pooled IgG did not result in the detection of either Jak2 or STAT1. To investigate the role of Jak2 catalytic activity, the experiment was repeated, but we now used the Jak2 dominant-negative construct in place of wild type Jak2. As shown in Fig. 4 C, catalytically inactive Jak2 resulted in substantially decreased levels of Jak2-AT1 receptor association. Further, the catalytically inactive Jak2 resulted in virtually no STAT1 binding to the receptor complex (Fig. 4 C,bottom panel). These results provide direct evidence that the angiotensin II-dependent association of STAT1 with the AT1 receptor requires a catalytically active Jak2. Similarly, the AT1 receptor mutants M6 and FAAA were also epitope-tagged with HA to study the interaction of these receptors with STAT1 and Jak2. In response to angiotensin II, the M6 mutant bound both Jak2 and STAT1 (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the AT1receptor mutant FAAA AT1 demonstrated no association with either Jak2 or STAT1 (Fig. 4 E). If Jak2 acts as an ancillary molecule to bring STAT1 to the AT1 receptor, we would predict that, in response to angiotensin II, there would be a physical co-association of these three proteins. To test this, COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the HA-tagged wild type AT1 receptor and wild type Jak2. Cells were treated with angiotensin II for 0 or 6 min (Fig.5 A, − or +), and cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the precipitated proteins were sequentially probed with anti-HA mAb, anti-STAT1 mAb, and anti-Jak2 antibody (Fig.5 A). This verified that in response to angiotensin II, there is a physical co-association of the Jak2 with both the AT1receptor and STAT1. A second prediction of our model is that if, in response to angiotensin II, Jak2 acts as an ancillary molecule to bring STAT1 to the AT1 receptor, then depletion of Jak2 would prevent AT1-STAT1 association. However, if the ligand-dependent association of the AT1receptor with STAT1 is bimolecular, then the AT1-STAT1 complex should persist in the absence of Jak2. To investigate this, COS-7 cells were again transfected with cDNA encoding the HA-tagged wild type AT1 receptor and wild type Jak2. Cells were treated with angiotensin II for 6 min to permit maximal AT1receptor-STAT1 association (indicated in Fig. 5 (B andC) with +). Cell lysates were prepared and Jak2 was immunodepleted by the addition of polyclonal anti-Jak2 antibody and protein A/G-agarose. Control samples received only protein A/G-agarose. All samples were maintained at 4 °C for 18 h during the immunodepletion protocol. The resulting supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody and blotted to access receptor association of STAT1 (Fig. 5 B) and Jak2 (Fig. 5 C). Immunodepletion of Jak2 removed the vast bulk of both STAT1 and Jak2 binding to the AT1 receptor. These data strongly suggest that the ligand-mediated association of STAT1 with the AT1 receptor is not strictly bimolecular and appears to require Jak2. Angiotensin II is the effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system. It maintains vascular tone and regulates salt and water balance by binding to cell surface AT1 receptors. Signals are transmitted from the cell surface into the cytoplasm and eventually the nucleus by a variety of signaling pathways, including the activation of the STAT family of transcription factors (21.Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Semeniuk D.J. Doan T.N. Bernstein K.E. Reg. Peptides. 1998; 78: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of STAT activation and nuclear translocation has resulted from the study of cytokine receptor signaling (7.Schindler C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 22.Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Typically, STAT proteins are recruited into signaling complexes by the binding of a conserved STAT SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine docking sites within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Once bound to the receptor, the STATs are phosphorylated by associated Janus kinases. The tyrosine phosphorylated STATs then form dimers that translocate into the nucleus, bind specific DNA elements, and initiate gene transcription. Here, we examined whether a similar paradigm exists for the G protein-coupled AT1 receptor. When we studied the M6 AT1 receptor mutant, we were surprised that this receptor induced ligand-dependent STAT1 phosphorylation in a fashion indistinguishable from the wild type AT1receptor. The M6 AT1 receptor lacks tyrosine residues in the third intracellular loop and the intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor. These data raised the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the AT1 receptor itself may not be required for angiotensin II-dependent STAT1 activation. Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that the association of Jak2 with the AT1 receptor was initiated by the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor (5,16). Using an HA-tagged AT1 receptor, this was confirmed in data presented here in Fig. 4 A. Thus, in response to ligand, Jak2 autophosphorylates and forms a high affinity bond with the AT1 receptor, an interaction that is dependent on the AT1 receptor motif YIPP (16.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the hypothesis that, in addition to being a STAT kinase, Jak2 also facilitates STAT1 binding to the AT1 receptor. Murine Jak2 contains 49 tyrosine residues (19.Harpur A.G. Andrews A.-C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks F.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work showed that 15 of these can be autophosphorylated in vivo (23.Feng J.B. Whitthuhn A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, Jak2 contains the protein motif YDKPH, which is thought capable of binding the SH2 domain of STAT1 (24 ,25). Data presented in Fig. 3 showed that association of Jak2 with STAT1 is markedly increased by the ligand angiotensin II. Further, this association was not observed with a dominant-negative, noncatalytic form of Jak2. Evidence presented in Fig. 3 C implicates the SH2 domain of STAT1 as critical for the physical association of STAT1 with Jak2. Additionally, the data in Fig. 4 demonstrated the co-association of Jak2 and STAT1 with the AT1 receptor, an association once again absolutely dependent on a catalytically active Jak2 capable of autophosphorylation. Finally, the immunodepletion study presented in Fig. 5 (B and C) showed the intrinsic dependence of STAT1-AT1 receptor association on the presence of Jak2; even when cells were treated with ligand for 6 min, a period of maximum association of STAT1 with the AT1 receptor and a time period sufficient for any modification of the AT1 receptor, STAT1-AT1 receptor association was critically dependent on Jak2. In summary, these studies give insight into the mechanism of STAT1 activation by a G protein-coupled receptor. Unlike the typical paradigm for cytokine receptors, the binding of Jak2 to the AT1receptor appears to be ligand-dependent. In this system, a catalytically active Jak2 appears critical for ligand-mediated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with the AT1receptor. Once autophosphorylated, we believe that it is the Jak2 phosphotyrosine that binds the SH2 domain of STAT1, thereby recruiting STAT1 to the receptor complex. Our analysis of the AT1receptor is highly reminiscent of previous work showing that receptors for erythropoietin, growth hormone, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and prolactin can interact with STATs independent of receptor phosphotyrosine residues (26.Wakao H.

Similar to our results, these studies suggested that signaling proteins such as SHC, IRS-1, or Jak enzymes were critical for receptor-STAT interaction. Recently Fujitani et al. (31.Fujitani Y.

These experiments, together with our findings, support the concept that STATs associate with tyrosine phosphorylated Jaks through their SH2 domains.

The rate of replication fork progression in vivo is about 1000 nucleotides per second at 37 °C (1.Chandler M. Bird R. Caro L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Replication of the leading strand occurs nearly continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized as a series of RNA-primed Okazaki fragments of about 2000 nucleotides that are subsequently processed and ligated into high molecular weight DNA. The elongation reaction is catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, an enzyme that alone on SSB1-coated templates can replicate DNA at nearly the rate of fork progression (2.Johanson K.O.

DnaX complex containing only the γ DnaX protein (γ complex; γ4δδ′χψ) can efficiently assemble β onto DNA, but lacks the ability to form a stable contact with the polymerase. γ complex, in the absence of τ, can also remove β2 prematurely from a complex with replicating DNA polymerase III core, decreasing its processivity (16.Kim S.

The τ protein is also necessary to reconstitute a holoenzyme that behaves asymmetrically in the presence of ATPγS, a property that has been postulated to arise from distinct leading and lagging-strand polymerases within the holoenzyme (19.Dallmann H.G. Thimmig R.L. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29555-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At reconstituted replication forks on duplex DNA, the τ protein is essential for rapid replication and coupled leading- and lagging-strand synthesis (18.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). τ is also required for efficient retargeting of the lagging-strand polymerase to the next primer during Okazaki fragment synthesis, permitting the same polymerase to synthesize multiple Okazaki fragments in sequence (18.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that this function of τ arose from its ability to bind tightly to α and to dimerize within the natural DnaX complex, linking the two polymerases (8.Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17.McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

An essential contact required for rapid replication fork movement occurs between τ and DnaB, the replication fork helicase. Within replicating DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the τ-DnaB contact triggers the assumption by DnaB of an alternative fast form conformation that accelerates its rate of duplex DNA unwinding an order of magnitude to near the rate of fork progression in vivo. Neither τ alone in the absence of DNA polymerase III nor γ even in the presence of polymerase can accomplish this DnaB acceleration function. Binding studies revealed that τ and DnaB could form a moderately strong complex free in solution by themselves; γ and DnaB could not (20.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The DnaB-τ contact was also essential to restore proper Okazaki fragment length to the products of in vitroreactions (18.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This is presumably a direct consequence of the rate effect. DnaB associates with the primase, leading to the synthesis of RNA primers (22.Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the frequency of DnaG-DnaB encounters is constant, a more slowly moving helicase will mediate formation of primers that are more closely spaced, resulting in shorter Okazaki fragments. The DnaB helicase can be assembled onto DNA by two pathways. The DnaA protein can act at the E. coli replication origin,oriC, on a DnaB-DnaC complex to assemble DnaB onto DNA, establishing two replication forks that progress around the chromosome (24.Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The PriA, B, C, and DnaT proteins act on a DnaB-DnaC complex in an alternative pathway to assemble the DnaB helicase on DNA and to re-establish stalled replication forks (25.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This latter system has also been exploited by φX174 as part of its replication machinery (26.Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27.Weiner J. McMacken R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because τ, but not the shorter γ DnaX protein interacts with DnaB and α, it would be expected that the unique C terminus of τ not found in γ is responsible for these interactions. E. coliOmpT protease cleaves τ between two lysines located at the C terminus of γ to generate γp, a protein only two amino acids shorter than authentic γ and C-τ, the unique C-terminal element of τ (28.Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10291-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We exploited OmpT protease to generate sufficient quantities of C-τ for its purification and physical and functional characterization. This permitted an assessment of the contributions of C-τ independent of the γ portion of τ. Alkaline phosphatase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Single-stranded circular DNAs from bacteriophages f1AY-7/M and f1R229-A/33 were prepared as described previously (29.Model P. Zinder N. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 83: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG were purified as described (30.Marians K.J.

The E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) was purified according to Minden and Marians (34.Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffers were: buffer ompT, 50 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40; Buffer A, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmMg(OAc)2; Buffer HKGM, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmMg(OAc)2, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 150 mmNaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P-20 detergent (Pharmacia Biosensor); Buffer R, 62.5 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 15 mm Mg(OAc)2, 12.5 mm DTT, 125 μg/ml BSA, 105 mm KCl, 6.25 mm ATP, 50 mm dCTP, and 50 mm dGTP. In order to produce large amounts of C-τ the protocol described in the legend to Fig. 1was scaled up. τ (15 mg, 2.2 ml, 6.8 mg/ml) was diluted into pre-warmed Buffer ompT (40 ml) in a screw-top centrifuge bottle. OmpT protease (4.5 μl of a 2 mg/ml stock) was added and the solution mixed by gentle inversion. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, quenched by the addition of 20 ml of an ice-cold solution of ammonium sulfate (0.7 g/ml in water) and placed in an ice-water slurry. An additional 10 g of solid ammonium sulfate was added to the solution in order to completely precipitate the protein. After 30 min on ice, the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (30 min, 22,000 × g). The pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The ammonium sulfate pellets were dissolved in 40 ml of buffer A (conductivity equivalent to 40 mm NaCl) and centrifuged (28,000 × g) to clarify. This solution was applied to an SP-Sepharose column (8 × 2 cm), which had been equilibrated in buffer A, at a flow rate of 48 ml/h. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A + 100 mmNaCl at a flow rate of 33 ml/h and eluted with a 12-column volume linear gradient of 100 → 250 mm NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 25 ml/h; 4-ml fractions were collected. C-τ (4.3 mg) eluted between fractions 42 and 50 (conductivity about 150 mm NaCl). Most of the γp (6.7 mg) produced by the ompT cleavage flowed through the column (fractions 5–10). The remaining γp (3.0 mg) eluted during the wash step (fractions 22–25). Remaining uncleaved τ (1.8 mg) eluted between fractions 54 and 62 (conductivity ∼200 mm NaCl). Fractions 42 to 50 inclusive, containing C-τ, were pooled (32 ml, 2.1 mg) and solid ammonium sulfate (16 g, 0.5 g/ml of solution) was added to precipitate C-τ. The protein was collected by centrifugation (28,000 × g), then dissolved in 0.5 ml of buffer A. This solution was clarified by centrifugation (28,000 ×g), then chromatographed over a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (24 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was developed in buffer A at a flow rate of 12 ml/h: 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Trace quantities of τ and γp contaminating the C-τ fractions from the SP-Sepharose column were removed during Superose 6 gel filtration. C-τ eluted between fractions 33 and 36 (2.0 mg). Each fraction was divided into 25-μl aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to characterize the biophysical properties and native oligomerization states of C-τ, α, and the complex between C-τ and α. The Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (An-Ti60 rotor) was used for all experiments. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments on C-τ were performed in buffer A. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with α and the C-τ·α complex were performed in buffer HKGM + 5% glycerol and 0.5 mm DTT. All experiments were performed at 4 °C. Sedimentation velocity analysis of C-τ was performed using 5, 2.5, and 1.25 μm concentrations of C-τ at 40,000 rpm, using double sector cells. Radial absorbance scans were taken at 20-min intervals at 230 nm. Data were analyzed using the second moment/boundary spreading method (35.Muramatsu N. Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) provided with the Beckman analysis software. The values for s20, w0 and D20,w0 were determined by linear regression of the apparent s and D values at each C-τ concentration to zero protein concentration and adjustment to the standard conditions (water, 20 °C) (36.van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were done using six-sector cells. Radial absorbance scans (280 nm for C-τ and 235 nm for α and α·C-τ) were taken for data analysis only when invariant scans taken 6 h apart indicated that equilibrium had been reached (typically >24 h). C-τ, α, and the C-τ·α complex (prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of α and C-τ) were each centrifuged at three different concentrations and at three different rotor speeds (C-τ: 18,000, 24,000, and 36,000 rpm, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 μm; α: 6000, 8000, and 10,000 rpm, 500, 250, and 125 nm; C-τ·α complex: 6000, 8000, and 10,000 rpm, 500, 250, and 125 nm). The resulting nine data sets for each protein were analyzed simultaneously by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using the program MLAB (Civilized Software Inc., Bethesda, MD). Data for each protein and the complex could be fit to Equation 1. This model describes a single, ideal, sedimenting species,A(r)=Ao exp((1−νρ)(ω2/2RT)M(r2−r02))+EEquation 1 A(r) is absorbance at radial position, r;A o is absorbance at radial position,r 0; ν, protein partial specific volume; ρ, solvent density; ω = rotor angular velocity; r , gas constant; T, temperature (K); M, native molecular weight; and E, baseline offset. Additional models describing self-association were also considered in the analysis of the C-τ sedimentation equilibrium data. The data was fit to models describing monomer-dimer, monomer-trimer, and monomer-tetramer self-association according to Equation 2 (37.McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-Associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton1993Google Scholar),A(r)=Ao exp(BM(r2−r02))+Aon exp(LNKA+nBM(r2−r02))+EEquation 2 B = (1-νρ)(ω2/2RT); LNKA is the natural log of the association constant andn is the oligomeric model under consideration (n = 2, monomer-dimer; n = 3, monomer-trimer; n = 4, monomer-tetramer). All gel filtration studies were performed at 4 °C on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Standards and protein complexes were chromatographed by gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 (24 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) FPLC column. The column was developed in buffer HKGM at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the point of injection. DnaB and C-τ were mixed by gentle vortexing and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min before chromatography as described above. Tailed form II (TFII) DNA was prepared as described by Mok and Marians (38.Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (12 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12 mm MgOAc, 10 mm DTT, 5 μm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1.1 μm SSB, 0.42 nm TFII DNA, 3.2 nm DnaB, 56 nmDnaC, 680 nm DnaG, 28 nm DnaT, 2.5 nm PriA, 2.5 nm PriB, 2.5 nm PriC, and the pol III HE, HE subunits, or subassemblies at 28 nmunless indicated otherwise, were preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min. NTPs were added to final concentrations of 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 200 μm CTP, and 200 μm UTP, and dNTPs to 40 μm and the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. [α-32P]dATP (2000–4000 cpm/pmol) was added to the reaction mixture and the incubation was continued at 30 °C for an additional 10 min. DNA synthesis was quenched by addition of EDTA to 40 mm. Total DNA synthesis was determined by assaying an aliquot of the reaction mixture for acid insoluble radioactivity. DNA products were analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis as described (39.Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reaction mixture (120 μl) containing 0.83 nm TFII DNA, 82 nmβ, 41 nm γ-complex, 1.1 mm SSB, 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mmMg(OAc)2, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 200 mm each of GTP, CTP, and UTP, and 40 mm dCTP and dGTP (all 4 NTPs and the 2 dNTPs are included just so that the pooled material would be in the same reaction buffer as the rolling circle reaction) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and then filtered through a 5-ml Bio-Gel A-150m (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with Buffer R. Fractions (100 μl) containing excluded material were identified by locating the3H-TFII DNA and the peak fraction was used for assay. An aliquot (110 μl) of the peak fraction containing the β·TFII DNA complex was incubated in a total reaction volume of 121 μl with the preprimosomal proteins, SSB, and either core or core plus τ at their standard reaction concentrations for 1 min at 30 °C. NTPs, the two remaining dNTPs, and [α-32P]dATP were then added to their standard reaction concentrations to give a final reaction volume of 132 μl and the incubation continued at 30 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times, the reaction terminated by the addition of EDTA to 40 mm, and the DNA products analyzed by electrophoresis through alkaline-agarose gels. The gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens and x-ray film. The 5′-end of the TFII DNA was labeled with 32P using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotidyl kinase after the original 5′-phosphate was removed using alkaline phosphatase. The labeled TFII DNA was digested with BamHI DNA, which cleaves only once. The distance in the 5′-3′ direction between the 5′-end of the TFII and the BamHI cleavage site is 3993 nucleotides, however, only 3685 nucleotides of the fragment is in duplex form. Linearized 5′-[32P]TFII DNA (0.42 nm) was incubated at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (150 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 12 mm MgOAc, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and SSB and the preprimosomal proteins at their replication reaction concentrations. Aliquots (12 μl) were withdrawn every 30 s and the reaction terminated by the addition of EDTA. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels at 5 V/cm for 4 h using 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 40 mm NaOAc, and 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. The indicated amounts of proteins were spotted onto nitrocellulose paper using an S & S Minifold II dot blotting apparatus and dried. The paper was blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. DnaB (1.6 μg/ml) was incubated with the blot for 15 min in a solution containing 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8), 12 mm MgOAc, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 4% sucrose, and 1 mmATP. Glutaraldehyde was then added to a final concentration of 0.1% and the incubation continued for 45 min. The blot was then washed with PBS + 2% milk and 200 mm glycine and then washed 4 times with PBS + 2% milk. Anti-DnaB antisera (1/2000 dilution) in PBS was incubated with the blot overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed 5 times with PBS + 2% milk and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/6000 dilution) in PBS. The secondary antibody was washed out and conjugates detected using an enhanced chemilumenescence kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (40.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Staining and destaining of polyacrylamide gels was as described in Dallmann and McHenry (9.Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme can be cleaved by the OmpT protease between two exposed adjacent lysines to generate a protein two residues shorter than authentic γ, γp, and the intact C terminus unique to τ, C-τ (28.Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10291-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We exploited this observation to develop a method for generating sufficient quantities of C-τ to study its physical interactions and functional contributions separate from the γ-portion of the τ subunit. A time course of the digestion showed formation of γp and a product corresponding to C-τ. C-τ was susceptible to further time-dependent cleavage to products of 16.4 and 7.2 kDa (Fig.1). To provide adequate quantities of C-τ for purification and further analysis, 15 mg of τ was digested and subjected to chromatography on SP-Sepharose to resolve C-τ from other digestion products and undigested τ (Fig. 2 A). Because it was essential that even trace levels of τ be removed, we subjected the isolated C-τ to gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 (Fig. 2 B). The resulting C-τ was free of detectable γp or τ, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C). Under the chromatographic conditions used, τ4 eluted in fractions 24–25 relative to the profile shown in Fig. 2 Bwith no detectable τ eluting in later fractions. This procedure yielded 2 mg of C-τ. Since both γ and τ exist as tetramers free in solution, it is likely that the oligomerization domain exists somewhere within γ and not C-τ. However, we required experimental confirmation of that because our experimental strategy included a determination of the functional contributions of C-τ separate from the ability of native τ to dimerize DNA polymerase III. The data for equilibrium sedimentation of 2.5 μm C-τ is shown in Fig. 3. The data fit best to a model (shown by the solid line) where only free monomer existed. Self-association models describing monomer-dimer, monomer-trimer, and monomer-tetramer association were also tested for the data shown in Fig. 3. All self-association models showed poor fits and significantly non-random residuals (data not shown) compared with the fit obtained using Equation 1 (ideal monomer). Specifically, the residual plots displayed convex shapes with residuals at least 2-fold greater than with the monomer fit. This indicates that C-τ monomers do not interact under the conditions used for study of its functional contributions reported below. The experimentally determined native molecular weight for C-τ was 20,745 ± 49 g/mol (TableI).Table IPhysical properties of C-τ, α, and C-τ·α complexPropertyMethodC-ταC-τ·α complexSubunit molecular weightCalculated from sequence23,741129,900153,641 g/molQuaternary structureSedimentation equilibriumaPerformed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”MonomerMonomer(C-τ)1-(α)1Native molecular weightSedimentation equilibriumaPerformed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”20,745 ± 49114,886 ± 1036132,687 ± 693bIf the experimentally determined partial specific volumes reported above in Footnote e are used to estimate the partial specific volume of the α·C-τ complex (v = 0.768), a molecular weight of 151,088 ± 789 is obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2091942638,"Class I nucleases are a family of enzymes that specifically hydrolyze single-stranded nucleic acids. Recently, we characterized the gene encoding a new member of this family, the 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (Ld3′NT/NU) of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani. The Ld3′NT/NU is unique as it is the only class I nuclease that is a cell surface membrane-anchored protein. Currently, we used a homologous episomal expression system to dissect the functional domains of theLd3′NT/NU. Our results showed that its N-terminal signal peptide targeted this protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. UsingLd3′NT/NU-green fluorescent protein chimeras, we showed that the C-terminal domain of the Ld3′NT/NU functioned to anchor this protein into the parasite cell surface membrane. Further, removal of the Ld3′NT/NU C-terminal domain resulted in its release/secretion as a fully active enzyme. Moreover, deletion of its single N-linked glycosylation site showed that such glycosylation was not required for the enzymatic functions of theLd3′NT/NU. Thus, using the fidelity of a homologous expression system, we have defined some of the functional domains of this unique member of the class I nuclease family."
https://openalex.org/W2037555897,"Cell type-specific expression of the human α2(V) collagen (COL5A2) gene depends on a cis-acting element that consists of two contiguous protein binding sites (FPA and FPB) located between nucleotides −149 and −95, relative to the transcription start site. The present study focused on the characterization of the FPB-bound complex. DNA binding assays and cell transfection experiments revealed that the bipartite core sequence of FPB (5′-ATCAATCA-3′) binds the PBX1/2, PREP1, and HOXB1 proteins, and this in turn leads to promoter transactivation. In the presence of all three nuclear factors, cooperative interactions between recombinant PBX1 and PREP1 or PBX1 and HOXB1 result in binding of the heterodimers to FPB in vitro. Similarly, overexpression of different combinations of PBX1, PREP1, and HOXB1 transactivates FPB-driven transcription. In contrast to the composition of the FPB complex purified from COL5A2-positive cells, the FPB complex from COL5A2-negative cells contains PBX2 and PREP1 but lacks PBX1. However, PBX1 exogenously introduced into COL5A2-negative cells cannot stimulate FPB-driven transcription unless co-expressed with PREP1. Within the intrinsic limitations of the experimental model, our results indicate that combinatorial interactions among PBX and PREP or HOX proteins are involved in regulating tissue-specific production of collagen V.

In contrast to the composition of the FPB complex purified from COL5A2-positive cells, the FPB complex from COL5A2-negative cells contains PBX2 and PREP1 but lacks PBX1. However, PBX1 exogenously introduced into COL5A2-negative cells cannot stimulate FPB-driven transcription unless co-expressed with PREP1. Within the intrinsic limitations of the experimental model, our results indicate that combinatorial interactions among PBX and PREP or HOX proteins are involved in regulating tissue-specific production of collagen V. electrophoretic mobility shift assay chloramphenicol acetyltransferase α2(V) collagen gene α1(XI) collagen gene base pair thymidine kinase Proper assembly of collagenous networks in the developing connective tissue is critically important for the formation and function of virtually every organ system (1.Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Collagens I and II are the major fibrillar structures that confer strength and resilience to noncartilaginous and cartilaginous tissues, respectively (1.Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Aside from spatiotemporal regulation of the respective genes, formation of collagens I and II fibers is under the control of a variety of cellular and structural elements (2.Sandell L.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among the latter are the so-called minor fibrillar collagens (types V and XI), which regulate fibrillogenesis by co-polymerizing with the major fibrillar collagens (types I and II) (3.Andrikopoulos K. Liu X. Keene D.R. Jaenisch R. Ramirez F. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,4.Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T.

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the production of minor fibrillar collagens is therefore relevant to elucidating the genetic determinants responsible for stage- and tissue-specific diversification of the extracellular matrix. Our previous work has shown that transcription of the human α2(V) collagen (COL5A2) gene is controlled by an evolutionarily conserved sequence located between nucleotides −149 and −95 (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)1 have divided this upstream promoter sequence into two contiguous cis-acting elements, termed FPB (−149 to −115) and FPA (−114 to −95). Deletion of the −149 to −95 region as well as nucleotide substitutions in FPB and FPA were shown to adversely affect COL5A2 promoter activity in cell transfection experiments. Moreover, the core sequence of FPB was subsequently noted to exhibit some homology with FP7, acis-acting element of the α1(XI) collagen (COL11A1) promoter (6.Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, the EMSA documented the ability of FPB, but not its mutant version, to compete with FP7 for binding to nuclear protein(s) (6.Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) class of homeoproteins constitutes a set of transcription factors that bind DNA in heterodimeric form. Members of this class include mammalian MEIS1 and PREP1, as well as Drosophila Exd and Caenorhabditis elegans Ceh-20 (7.Burglin T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These proteins are able to specifically interact with PBX, an homeodomain transcription factor that in turn is able to form high affinity DNA-binding complexes with several HOX gene products (reviewed in Refs. 8.Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and 9.Mann R. Bioessays. 1996; 17: 855-863Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using different interaction surfaces PBX can form a trimeric complex with HOXB1 and PREP1 or MEIS1 (10.Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11.Ferretti E. Marshall H. Pöpperl H. Maconochie M. Krumlauf R. Blasi F.

These ternary complexes have been shown to have important gene regulating properties in mouse and Drosophila embryos (10.Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell.

Dimeric complexes of PBX with PREP1 interact with other homeodomain proteins like PDX1 on the somatostatin promoter, where they display cooperative functional effects on transcription and possibly on the human urokinase enhancer (13.Goudet G.

Three different PBX genes (PBX1, 2, and 3) code for five proteins, two of which (PBX1b and PBX3b) arise by alternative splicing (17.Kamps M.P. Murre C. Sun X. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 60: 547-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 18.Nourse J. Mellentin J.D. Galili N.J. Wilkinson N.J. Stanbridge E. Smith S.D. Cleary M.L.

Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). So far no information is available on the function of the single PBX isoforms. In the present study, we identified the nuclear factors binding to the FPB element of COL5A2 and demonstrated that they differ from those that interact with the FP7 element of COL11A1. The results implicate members of the homeotic complex (HOX) and the TALE class of homeoproteins in COL5A2 regulation, specifically PBX1/2, PREP1, and HOXB1. We demonstrate that cooperative interactions between PBX1 and PREP1 or between PBX1 and HOXB1 lead to binding to FPB of the resulting heterodimers and to transactivation of the COL5A2 promoter. Having in mind the intrinsic limitations of the experimental design employed in this study, we suggest that different combinations of PBX, PREP, and HOX proteins may correlate with tissue-specific expression of the COL5A2 gene. The human cells used in this study were the COL5A2-positive rhabdomyosarcoma line A-204 and the COL5A2-negative fibrosarcoma line HT-1080 (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A-204 were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and HT-1080 in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Purification and transfection of plasmid DNA into cells using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and assessment of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene activity were performed according to standard protocols (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 545Google Scholar). Chimeric constructs included the plasmid containing the −150-bp promoter of COL5A2 (−150COL5A2/CAT) and three copies of FPB subcloned 5′ to the basal promoter of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene (FPB3TK/CAT) (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 10: 5490Crossref Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Mutations in the core sequence of FPB contained two (m1) or one (m2) nucleotide substitutions or the combination of both (m3) (see Fig. 1). Mutations were introduced either in the COL5A2 (m1COL5A2/CAT and m2COL5A2/CAT) or TK (m3FB3TK/CAT) promoter. Wild type and mutant constructs were engineered using standard methodologies of DNA manipulation (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 545Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized against the activity of a co-transfected vector that expresses β-galactosidase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Expression vectors for PBX1, PREP, PREP1·HD, and HOX proteins have been described before (22.Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavillio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed multiple times in duplicate, and the statistical value of the resulting data was evaluated by the Student'st test. Crude nuclear extracts were purified according to our published protocol (6.Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Production of recombinant proteins was carried out using 4 μg of plasmid DNA and a commercial in vitro transcription/translation kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). Approximately 5 μg of crude nuclear extracts and between 2 and 8 μl of the reticulocyte lysate were used in the EMSA together with ∼20,000 dpm of labeled oligonucleotides. Unlabeled competitors were added in 100-fold molar excess. Synthetic peptides QPQIYPWMRKLH and QPQIYPFMRKLH were added at the concentrations detailed in the figure legends. When appropriate, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies before addition of the labeled probe. Antibodies against PBX proteins and PREP1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and those against HOXB1 from Babco (Berkley, CA). Anti-MEIS1 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. M. Cleary (University of California, San Francisco). The sequences of the oligonucleotide probes used in this study are listed in Fig. 1. A combination of cell transfections and DNase I footprinting experiments originally identified FPB (−149 to −115) as a major contributor to cell type-specific transcription of the minimal COL5A2 promoter (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation interference analysis narrowed the region of contact with nuclear proteins to around the bipartite sequence 5′-ATCAATCA-3′ located within the −130 to −115 region (Fig.1). Inspection of the complementary sequence of the FPB motif revealed that it corresponds to the recognition sequence (5′-TGATTGATT-3′) of the PBX homeodomain (24.Lu Q. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3938-3948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Van Dijk M.A. Voorhoeve P.M. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6061-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26.LeBrun D.P. Cleary M.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1641-1647PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we assessed the possible involvement of PBX proteins in COL5A2 regulation. Nuclear extracts purified from COL5A2-positive cells were incubated with antibodies against members of the PBX family and then employed in the EMSA using the FPB oligonucleotide as a probe. FPB has been previously shown to yield a pattern that consists of two closely migrating complexes (Fig. 2 A) (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The faster migrating complex (F in Fig. 2 A) was supershifted by the anti-PBX1 antibody, whereas the intensity of the slower migrating complex (S in Fig. 2 A) decreased after preincubation with the anti-PBX2 antibody. By contrast, there was no effect when the nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-PBX3 antibody (Fig. 2 A). PBX proteins heterodimerize with MEIS1 or PREP1, and these cooperative interactions stabilize PBX binding to target DNA sites (13.Goudet G. Delhalle S. Biemar F. Martial J.A. Peers B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4067-4073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Berthelsen J. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Blasi F. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V.

Specific antibodies were therefore employed to characterize the PBX1 partner(s) in the FPB complex. Preincubation of the A-204 nuclear extracts with anti-PREP1 antibody, but not with anti-MEIS1 antibody eliminated formation of both F and S complexes (Fig. 2 B). Binding specificity was documented by the lack of competition by the oligonucleotides with single (5′-ATCAAgCA-3′) or double (5′-cgCAATCA-3′) substitutions at FPB sites known to interact with PBX-containing complexes (Fig.2 C) (8.Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that different combinations of PBX, PREP1, and MEIS1 proteins synergize on a particular promoter element by binding to closely adjacent sequences (10.Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12.Ryoo H.-D. Marty T. Cesares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S. Development. 1999; 126: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar situation may exist in the COL5A2 promoter given that FPA and FPB are in close proximity to each other and are both required for optimal promoter activity (Fig. 1) (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the antibody interference test was repeated using the longer 73-bp probe that includes FPA and FPB (Fig.1). The 73-bp probe has been shown to yield an additional and slower migrating doublet (complex SS in Fig.3 A), in addition to the FPB doublet (Fig. 2). Unlike the FPB bands, however, the SS doublet was not affected by preincubation with any of the antibodies (Fig.3 A). Altogether, these in vitro results implicated binding of PBX-containing dimers to FPB and excluded binding of MEIS1 to the 73-bp long cis-acting element of COL5A2. Co-expression of the COL5A2 and COL11A1 genes in selected tissues is responsible for the formation of collagens V/XI heterotypic fibrils, whose contribution to matrix assembly and function is yet to be determined (1.Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the FPB sequence effectively competes binding of nuclear proteins to FP7, acis-acting element of COL11A1 (6.Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test whether the two genes share regulatory elements that are bound by the sametrans-acting factors, we analyzed the composition of the FP7 complex using the same set of antibodies employed in the characterization of the FPB complex. Neither the anti-PBX nor anti-PREP1 antibodies supershifted the FP7 complex, thus demonstrating that distinct nuclear proteins recognize closely related DNA motifs in two coordinately expressed collagen genes (Fig. 3 B). In addition to interacting with PREP1, PBX1 dimerizes with HOX proteinsvia the pentapeptide motif YPWMK (31.Chang C.P. Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 32.Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5811-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33.Phelan M.L.

Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, PREP1 and PBX1 can also form ternary complexes with HOX proteins (10.Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12.Ryoo H.-D. Marty T. Cesares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S. Development. 1999; 126: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavillio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In light of these possibilities, we tested whether HOX proteins participate in the formation of the FPB complex and, if so, whether they give rise to an alternative heterodimer of PBX1 or a ternary complex that includes both PBX1 and PREP1. To simplify the analysis, only the longer PBX1a isoform (herein referred to as PBX1) was used in the assays (19.Monica K. Galli N. Nourse T. Saltman D. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 30.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17 (1143): 1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PBX1, PREP1, and HOXB1 proteins were translated in vitro,and the binding patterns of different combinations of them were examined by the EMSA. As expected, no binding was observed with PREP1 alone, and very little was observed with PBX1 alone (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and4). By contrast, addition of PREP1 and PBX1 together yielded an intense band migrating comparably to the S complex in crude nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 6). A faster migrating complex was observed with HOXB1 alone, and a slower complex was observed with the HOXB1-PBX1 combination (Fig.4 A, lanes 4 and 5). We also noted that the migration of the PBX1-HOXB1 complex is slightly different from that of the PBX1-PREP1 combination (Fig. 4, A and B,lanes 6 and 7). Addition of increasing amounts of HOXB1 to the PBX1-PREP1 combination had no noticeable effect on the migration or the intensity of the heterodimer, thus apparently excluding the formation of a ternary complex (Fig. 4 B). Binding specificity was supported by the lack of binding of the recombinant proteins to mutant FPB oligonucleotides (data not shown). Preincubation of each of the samples with the various antibodies further corroborated binding specificity as they supershifted or inhibited formation of the retarded complexes (Fig. 4 C). The sole exception was the much weaker effect observed with the combination of the three nuclear proteins when preincubated with the anti-HOX antiserum (Fig. 4 C, lane 12). This last result was at variance with the strong anti-HOX antibody effect observed in the PBX1-HOXB1 combination (Fig. 4 C, lane 5). Because PBX1-HOXB1 and PBX1-PREP1 co-migrate, the effect of the anti-HOX antibodies may conceivably be minor if PBX1-HOXB1 dimers represent only a minor fraction of the retarded band. Indeed, a faint supershift at the same location as in the sample with the PBX1-HOXB1 combination could be seen after overexposure of the EMSA sample in which the three nuclear proteins had been preincubated with the anti-HOX antibody (data not shown). The above results excluded the formation on the FPB probe of a ternary complex inclusive of HOXB1. This conclusion was further corroborated by two additional lines of evidence. First, formation of retarded complexes by recombinant proteins was challenged with increasing amounts of the peptide QPQIYPWMRKLH, which has been previously shown to mediate the PBX-HOX interaction (31.Chang C.P. Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As a control, the same samples were preincubated with a mutant version of the HOX peptide that contains F in place of the obligatory W residue (31.Chang C.P. Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The EMSA documented the ability of the wild type, but not the mutant peptide, to disrupt the recombinant PBX1-HOXB1 complex (Fig.5 A). Surprisingly, we found that the wild type peptide specifically eliminates the recombinant PBX1-PREP1 heterodimer as well (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with the above findings, increasing amounts of the peptide also interfered with the formation of the S and F complexes in crude nuclear extracts from A-204 cells (Fig. 5 B). Along these lines, the anti-HOXB1 antibodies had no effect on the binding of nuclear proteins to FPB (data not shown). The second set of experiments examined binding of recombinant proteins to FPB in the presence of a PREP1 mutant. The mutant (PREP1·HD) still interacts with PBX1 but is unable to bind to DNA because of the deletion of the homeodomain (23.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavillio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PREP1·HD has been previously shown to eliminate binding of the PBX1-PREP1 heterodimers to the autoregulatory element of the mouse HOXB1 gene while concomitantly favoring formation of the ternary PREP1-PBX-HOX complex (23.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavillio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed under conditions that discriminate between the PBX1-PREP1 and PBX1-HOXB1 heterodimers (complexes I and II in Fig.5 C, respectively) (23.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavillio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). They revealed that PREP1·HD did not form a DNA-binding complex with PBX1, and in the three-protein combination, this led to the selective loss of mostly band I that corresponds to the PBX1-PREP1 dimer (Fig. 5 C). In conclusion, the DNA binding assays excluded formation of a ternary complex with crude nuclear extracts and demonstrated that, in the presence of all three recombinant proteins, FPB is only bound by PBX1-PREP1 and PBX1-HOXB1 heterodimers. To provide a functional correlate to the DNA binding experiments, various combinations of the HOX and TALE proteins were expressed in A-204 cells co-transfected with different reporter plasmids. They included the wild type −150COL5A2 promoter and two mutant versions that harbor the nucleotide substitutions that eliminate protein binding. Furthermore, three copies of the wild type and mutant FPB sequence were linked to the basal TK promoter and tested as well. Transcription from the −150COL5A2/CAT plasmid remained nearly the same when PBX1, PREP1, or HOXB1 were expressed singularly or using the PBX1-PREP1 combination (Fig. 5 A). By contrast, a modest 2-fold increase was observed with the PBX1-HOXB1 combination, and a more robust 5-fold stimulation was observed with all three proteins (Fig. 6 A). Transcriptional stimulation by the latter combination was slightly less when the PBX1b isoform was expressed in place of PBX1a (data not shown). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the basal TK promoter harboring three copies of the FPB sequence (Fig. 6 B). The specificity of the transactivation by the three-protein combination was documented in co-transfection experiments with mutant COL2A5 and TK promoter constructs (Fig. 6 C). These last results are somewhat more consistent with cooperative binding of the three nuclear factors than with the additive contribution of the two PBX1-containing heterodimers. We have previously reported subtle differences in the migration pattern of the retarded bands that are formed between FPB and nuclear proteins from COL5A2-positive or COL5A2-negative cells (5.Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have argued that these differences may reflect the distinct composition of the FPB complexes in these two groups of cells. Antibodies against PBX1, PBX2, and PREP1 were therefore used to identify the binding factors in nuclear extracts purified from HT-1080 and Jurkat cells. This revealed that the nuclear factors that interact with FPB in these COL5A2-negative cells are different from those of the A-204 cell line. Both Jurkat and HT-1080 nuclear proteins yielded a single retarded band that contains PBX2 and PREP1 but no PBX1 or MEIS1 (Fig.7). Taken at face value, the results therefore implicated PBX1 in COL5A2 gene activation. To test the above hypothesis, we co-transfected the COL5A2 promoter together with the PBX1- and PREP1-expressing plasmids in HT-1080 cells. Although only the data of the PBX1a overexpression are shown here, the PBX1b plasmid yielded the same kind of results. Overexpression of PBX1 or PREP1 resulted only in a modest stimulation of the COL5A2 promoter (Fig. 8 A). On the other hand, a robust ∼4-fold stimulation of the −150COL5A2/CAT plasmid was observed with the combination of both PBX1 and PREP1 (Fig.8 A). Thus, COL5A2 promoter activity in HT-1080 cells may be limited by the amount of available PREP1 available to dimerize with PBX1. This conclusion was indirectly supported by the results of antibody interference experiments performed with nuclear extracts purified from HT-1080 cells transfected with PBX1 singularly or with PBX1 and PREP1. Overexpression of PBX1 in HT-1080 cells had no effect on the FPB binding pattern, as judged by the lack of supershift with the anti-PBX1 antibody (Fig. 8 B). A PBX1-specific supershift was instead visible when PBX1 and PREP1 were co-expressed in HT-1080 cells (Fig. 8 B). Furthermore, binding of PBX1-PREP1 heterodimers was not accompanied by the loss of the endogenous PBX2-PREP1 complex (Fig. 8 B). We interpret these results to indicate that exogenously added PBX1 may not bind to FPB because the endogenous pool of PREP1 is already complexed with PBX2. Regardless of the interpretation, the DNA binding and co-transfection data correlate with variations in FPB composition and cell type-specific expression of COL5A2. The fibrillar collagens represent an interesting example of genes that are constitutively expressed with widely disparate patterns in cell lineages of common embryonic origin (1.Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, current evidence indicates that spatiotemporal regulation of the fibrillar collagen genes involves combinatorial interactions of ubiquitous and tissue-restricted transcription factors that bind to modularly organized cis-acting elements (2.Sandell L.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36.Karsenty G. Park R.W. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In most cases, these regulatory sequences are promoter-specific rather than being shared by coordinately expressed collagens. A case in point is the formation of distinct nuclear complexes by the closely related cis-acting elements of the COL5A2 and COL11A1 genes. We have shown that FPB and FP7, although capable of competing with each other for protein binding, interact with different nuclear factors. This observation suggests that binding specificity is probably dependent on the context of the cis-acting element. Indeed, identical PREP1-PBX sites may or may not bind PREP1-PBX1a heterodimers depending on the nature of the surrounding sequences (11.Ferretti E. Marshall H. Pöpperl H. Maconochie M. Krumlauf R. Blasi F. Development. 2000; 127: 155-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have provided in vitro evidence that PBX1/2, PREP1, and HOXB1 bind to FPB cooperatively by forming binary complexes and that selected combinations of them transactivate the COL5A2 promoter. Furthermore, we have shown that variations in the composition of the FPB-bound complex (specifically, the inclusion of different PBX proteins) correlate with cell type-specific expression of the COL5A2 gene. To the best of our knowledge and within the limitations of the experimental design employed, this is the first indication of distinct contributions to transcription by different members of the PBX family of proteins. It is now well established that interactions between HOX and TALE proteins of the PBX/Exd subtype determine specificity and modulate affinity of DNA binding (8.Mann R.S. Chan S.K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1704-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is ample genetic evidence suggesting that formation of these interacting complexes plays a key role in the cell lineage-specific interpretation of regulatory clues by the developing embryo (11.Ferretti E. Marshall H. Pöpperl H. Maconochie M. Krumlauf R. Blasi F. Development. 2000; 127: 155-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Ryoo H.-D. Marty T. Cesares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S.

Development. 1998; 125: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with HOX proteins, PBX/Exd molecules heterodimerize with more distantly related members of the TALE family (MEIS/hth and Pknox1-PREP) to regulate expression of several genes (37.Mann R.S. Affolter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cooperative interactions have also been reported to occur between HOX and MEIS-like proteins and among HOX, MEIS, and PBX and HOX, PBX, and PREP-1 (37.Mann R.S. Affolter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These various combinations of nuclear factors recognize slightly different binding sites with a spectrum of affinities and distinct transcriptional activities. Moreover, different PBX and MEIS protein isoforms with distinct spatiotemporal patterns are produced during mouse embryogenesis (43.Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 48.Ferretti E. Schulz H. Talarico D. Blasi F. Berthelsen J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a result, the range of DNA targets of this group of homeoproteins is very broad and has the potential of regulating a wide variety of genes. Our transient transfection tests and in vitro DNA binding assays strongly indicate that cell type-specific activation of COL5A2 transcription depends on interactions among PBX1/2, PREP1, and HOXB1. However, the two experimental approaches we employed leave unresolved whether or not a ternary complex can also be formed on the FPB element. On the one hand, in vitro DNA binding tests exclude this possibility by documenting the mutually exclusive binding of different PBX-containing heterodimers; on the other hand, the co-transfection experiments are more in line with the idea of cooperativity among the three factors for maximal COL5A2 transactivation. Thus, although solely based on correlative evidence, the notion of a ternary complex has not been rigorously ruled out. As already alluded to, the problem of solving the in vivoidentity of the FPB complex was compounded by the unexpected finding that the QPQIYPWMRKLH peptide can also block formation of recombinant PBX1-PREP1 dimers. Taken at face value, this last result could be interpreted to indicate that the sites of PBX-PREP1 and PBX-HOX interaction may share some sequence homology. According to recent evidence, a possible candidate sequence is the extra long loop between the first and second α-helix of the TALE homeodomain (12.Ryoo H.-D. Marty T. Cesares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S. Development. 1999; 126: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Should this assumption be correct, one could argue that the relative concentrations of PREP1 and HOX proteins may represent an additional level of regulation for the formation of specific combinations of PBX-containing heterodimers. Because PBX-PREP1 dimers interact via the amino-terminal regions, whereas PBX-HOX interactions require the homeodomain and nearby sequences, the postulated sequence homology is not readily apparent (22.Di Rocco G. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3644-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23.Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavillio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Conceivably, it may reside in the tertiary structure arrangement of PREP1 that brings together key amino acid side chains. Although the precise nature of the in vivo complex remains to be determined, the binding specificity and its effect on promoter activity were corroborated by the concordant results of mutating the bipartite sequence of FPB (5′-ATCAATCA-3′) on DNA binding and promoter transactivation. The mutations (5′-cgCAATCA-3′ and 5′-ATCAgCA-3′) involve those nucleotides that are required for recognition by the PBX1 (TGAT) and HOX (TNA(T/C)) proteins (34.Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C. Cell. 1999; 96: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 36.Karsenty G. Park R.W. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The FPB core most closely resembles the recognition sequence for PBX1 dimerized with HOX proteins of the paralog group 1 (29.Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 35.Passner J.M. Ryoo H.D. Shen L. Mann R.S. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we found that HOXA1 is the only other HOX member that binds to DNA after interacting with recombinant PBX1 (data not shown). However, thein vitro interaction is likely not to be physiologically relevant because co-expression of PBX1 and HOXA1 had no effect on the activity of the COL5A2 promoter (data not shown). A final interesting finding pertains to the relationship between the FPB complex and cell type-specific expression of COL5A2. Within the intrinsic limitation of the experimental model used in this study, exclusion of PBX1 from the FPB complex appears to be associated with lack of gene activity. Furthermore, overexpression of PBX1 alone cannot restore COL5A2 expression or lead to inclusion of PBX1 in the FPB-bound complex. Even though there is enough endogenous PREP1 to complex with PBX2, we found that inclusion of PBX1 in the FPB complex and promoter transactivation in COL5A2-negative cells require overexpression of both PBX1 and PREP1. Cell type-specific transcription of COL5A2 may therefore be modulated by changes in the relative amounts of the PBX proteins and/or their affinities for the pool of available PREP1 molecules. Additional levels of regulation may include the amounts and identities of the HOX partners and, consequently, the ability of the resulting PBX-HOX dimers to compete more or less effectively with PBX-PREP1 complexes for FPB binding. The combinatorial alternatives of the FPB complex are compatible with the available data on HOX, TALE, and COL5A2 gene expression during mouse embryogenesis (47.Cecconi F. Protetzel G. Alvarez-Bolado G. Tay D. Gruss P. Dev. Dynamics. 1997; 210: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 48.Ferretti E. Schulz H. Talarico D. Blasi F. Berthelsen J. Mech.

Solursh M. Ramirez F. Dev. Dynamics. 1992; 195: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). COL5A2 transcripts are first detectable, widely and diffusely distributed in the intestinal and craniofacial mesenchyme of the 12.5-day embryo (50.Andrikopoulos K. Suzuki H.R. Solursh M. Ramirez F. Dev. Dynamics. 1992; 195: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HOXB1, PREP1, and PBX family members also display a widespread embryonic expression, which begins earlier in development (48.Ferretti E. Schulz H. Talarico D. Blasi F. Berthelsen J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49.Frohman M.A. Boyle M. Martin G.R. Development. 1990; 110: 589-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the mesenchymal tissues in which COL5A2 is expressed have not been analyzed, the available data are, however, consistent with a co-expression of COL5A2 and PREP1, PBX, and HOXB1 at later stages of development.

Allotrap 1258 was characterized in detail and shown to inhibit cell-mediated immune responses in vitro andin vivo. Immunomodulatory activity was associated with the capability of the peptides to modulate heme oxygenase (HO) activity. In this study we analyzed the effect of Allotrap 1258 on cytokine expression. Allotrap 1258 inhibited concanavalin A- and lipopolysaccharide-induced human and mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in vitro and in vivo but had no effect on interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, or IL-10 expression. Experiments with HO-1/KO and iNOS/KO mice showed that Allotrap 1258-mediated inhibition of TNF was independent of HO-1 and iNOS. Quantitation of TNF protein expression and mRNA steady state levels demonstrated that Allotrap 1258-mediated inhibition occurred at the translational level. Deletion of the AU-rich element in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of TNF mRNA, a region known to be involved in TNF mRNA translation, had minimal effect on Allotrap 1258-mediated inhibition. However, replacement of the TNF 3′-UTR with the human globin 3′-UTR rendered the peptide inactive. This demonstrates that besides AU-rich elements, other sequences in the 3′-UTR of TNF mRNA are involved in translational control of TNF expression.

Based on these HLA-derived peptide sequences, novel immunomodulatory peptides were developed by computer-aided rational design (8.Grassy G. Calas B. Yasri A. Lahana R. Woo J. Iyer S. Kaczorek M. Floc'h R. Buelow R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Initially, the biological activity of a panel of 19 peptides derived from peptide 2702.75–84 (HLA-B2702, amino acids 75–84) as well as other major histocompatibility complex molecules was assessed in a heterotopic mouse allograft model. A rational drug design strategy based on these in vivo data resulted in a series of immunomodulatory peptides. One of these peptides, RDP1258 and its D-isomer, Allotrap 1258, showed enhanced efficacy in comparison with 2702.75–84 both in vivo when tested in rodent allograft models and in vitro in the inhibition of cytotoxicity in human and mouse T lymphocytes. The mechanism of immunomodulation mediated by these peptides is not fully understood. Observations in various in vivo models indicated that the peptides do not interact directly with T cell receptor or NK cell inhibitory receptors (4.Woo J. Gao L. Cornejo M.C. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5.Gao L. Woo J. Buelow R. Heart Lung Transplantation. 1996; 15: 78-85PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Buelow R. Burlingham J.W. Clayberger C. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) The observation that both L- and D-isomers of peptide 2702.75–84 prolong graft survival indicates that the immunomodulatory activity of the peptides is not based on presentation by major histocompatibility complex molecules (5.Gao L. Woo J. Buelow R. Heart Lung Transplantation. 1996; 15: 78-85PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the recent hypothesis that these peptides modulate immune responses by binding to Hsc/Hsp70 can be excluded because the peptides d-enantiomers, while being immunomodulatory, do not bind to these proteins (10.Noessner E. Goldberg J.E. Naftzger C. Lyu S.C. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11.Woo J. Iyer S. Cornejo M.-C. Gao L. Cuturi C. Soulillou J.-P. Buelow R. Transplantation. 1997; 64: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography with one of these immunomodulatory peptides resulted in the identification of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)1 as a potential target for these peptides (12.Iyer S. Woo J. Cornejo M.C. Gao L. McCoubrey W. Maines M. Buelow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2692-2697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All of the biologically active peptides derived from 2702.75–84 were shown to inhibit HO activity in vitro. The original compounds, however, were 100-fold less potent than the rationally designed Allotrap 1258. Similar to what has been observed with other HO inhibitors, in vivo administration of the peptides to animals resulted in a rapid up-regulation of HO-1 protein expression (12.Iyer S. Woo J. Cornejo M.C. Gao L. McCoubrey W. Maines M. Buelow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2692-2697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies with peptides and protoporphyrins specifically affecting HO activity demonstrated that modulation of heme oxygenase activity is associated with the inhibition of several immune effector functions including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production (13.Woo J. Iyer S. Cornejo M.C. Mori N. Gao L. Sipos I. Maines M. Buelow R. Transplant Immunol. 1998; 6: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14.Willis D. Moore A.R. Frederick R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Currently it is unclear how modulation of HO activity may influence immune effector functions, and experiments with knock-out animals will be necessary to clarify this issue. In this study, we continued our studies on the immunomodulatory activity of these peptides. Extensive analysis of ConA-induced cytokine profiles in the presence or absence of peptides demonstrated that Allotrap 1258 effectively inhibited the production of TNF. In addition, peptides partially inhibited the production of IFNγ and IL-12, but not IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, or IL-10. Effect of Allotrap 1258 therapy on TNF in vivo was studied in a galactosamine (GalN)/LPS mouse model that has been characterized as a model for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (15.Lehmann V. Fraudenberg M.A. Galanos C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 16.Tiegs G. Wolter M. Wendel A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of TNF production in the presence of peptide demonstrated that peptide-mediated inhibition of TNF production occurs at the translational level. Experiments with macrophages from transgenic and targeted animals expressing modified TNF genes demonstrated that AU-rich elements (AREs) in the mRNA 3′-UTR sequences appear to play a moderate role in mediating the suppressive effects of the peptides, but other as yet unidentified sequences in the 3′-UTR are more dominant in mediating the inhibition by the peptide of TNF translation. TNF exerts a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease (17.Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar, 18.Pasparakis M. Alexopoulou L. Douni E. Kollias G.

Although originally described as a molecule that could reduce the size of malignant tumors, a massive up-regulation of TNF at a systemic level such as occurs in global infections or severe tissue injury leads to vasodilation, intravascular coagulation, and multiple organ failure (21.Bone R.C. Balk R.A. Cerra F.B. Dellinger R.B. Fein A.M. Knaus W.A. Schein R.M.H. Sibbald W.J. Chest. 1992; 101: 1644-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7568) Google Scholar). A therapeutic benefit of inhibiting TNF in such inflammatory conditions is readily apparent. Clinically, various approaches to reduce TNF levels in patients have been explored, including the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, pentoxifylline, and anti-TNF antibodies. In particular, protein based therapies (i.e. anti-TNF antibody and soluble receptors) have shown considerable clinical success (22.Targan S.R. Hanauer S.B. van Deventer S.J. Mayer L. Present D.H. Braakman T. DeWoody K.L. Schaible T.F. Rutgeerts P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, Allotrap 1258 is the first low molecular weight compound inhibiting TNF production at a translational level. C57BL/6, CBA, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) knock-out mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). HO-1 knock-out mice were kindly provided by Dr. Poss (23.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Mice were housed according to the Animal Welfare Guidelines of the California Department of Health. Tg1278 and Tg197 human TNF transgenic mice (24.Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopolous S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar) and homozygous TNFΔARE targeted animals in a TNFRI-deficient background (25.Kontoyiannis D.

Peptides (Allotrap 1258: rnlnlnlrnlnlnlgy-CONH2, D2RP: rvnlpialry-COOH) were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by HPLC, and shown to be >90% homogenous by analytical reverse phase HPLC (SynPep, Dublin, CA). Peptides were stored lyophilized at 4 °C and were dissolved fresh before use in a 5% mannitol in water solution. In initial experiments, the kinetics of cytokine production following intravenous injection of ConA (20 mg/kg) were analyzed. Groups of mice (n = 3/group) were sacrificed 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 h post-injection. Plasma was collected and analyzed for IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF, and IFNγ levels. Based on this kinetic analysis, the time point with maximum plasma cytokine concentration was chosen to study the effect of peptide. Mice (n = 3/group) were injected intravenously with 20 mg/kg ConA and 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg peptide in 5% mannitol. Animals were sacrificed at the predetermined time point, and serum was collected. Cytokine levels were determined by sandwich ELISA. Male 4–6-week-old C57BL/6, CBA, iNOS/KO, and HO-1/KO mice were used to study the effects of Allotrap 1258 treatment on GalN/LPS-induced TNF production in vivo. Animals were given a single injection of GalN at 800 mg/kg, followed by LPS at 0.1 mg/kg. Allotrap 1258 or negative control peptide was administered at 10 mg/kg simultaneously with GalN and LPS. All injections were given intraperitoneally. At 60 min, animals were sacrificed, and blood was collected. TNF concentrations in plasma were measured by sandwich ELISA. Concentration of TNF in plasma and cell culture medium was measured by ELISA. Anti-TNF mAb (clone MP6-XT22) was used to capture murine TNF, and anti-TNF mAb (clone mAb1) was used to capture human TNF. Biotinylated polyclonal anti-TNF and biotinylated monoclonal anti-TNF (clone mAb11) were used for detection of captured murine and human TNF, respectively. All antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Capture antibodies were coated onto 96-well Maxisorb flat bottom plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 2 μg/ml in 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 9, overnight. Plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20 solution to remove unbound antibodies and remaining sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. Following the addition of samples, the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Captured TNF was detected with biotinylated anti-TNF antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected usingo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mHCl solution, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Survival studies were performed in the GalN/LPS mouse model using C57BL/6, CBA, and iNOS/KO mice. Animals were given simultaneous injections of GalN at 800 mg/kg and LPS at 0.1 mg/kg (intraperitoneal). One group each was also treated with Allotrap 1258 or negative control peptide at 10 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) at the time of GalN/LPS injection. Animal survival was monitored twice daily. RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line, and THP-1 cells, a human monocyte/macrophage cell line, were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. RAW264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 3.5 × 105/ml and stimulated for TNF production by the addition of LPS (10 μg/ml). THP-1 cells similarly seeded were stimulated in the presence of LPS (5 μg/ml) and IFNγ (100 units/ml). For experiments with transgenic mouse macrophages, total exudate peritoneal macrophages were isolated by peritoneal lavage with phosphate-buffered saline from 10-week-old animals 3 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 ml of 4% thioglycolate broth (Difco Laboratories) as described previously (27.Thorens B. Mermod J.J. Vassalli P. Cell. 1987; 48: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105/ml and stimulated for TNF production by the addition of LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of Allotrap peptides. Peptides were added at various concentrations ranging from 3 to 100 μm. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C for 24 h. At the indicated times, culture medium was collected and stored frozen until use. TNF concentrations were determined by sandwich ELISA using anti-mouse or anti-human TNF mAb (see above) THP-1 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in methionine-deficient RPMI spiked with [35S]Met (3 μCi/well) and were stimulated for TNF production with LPS (5 μg/ml) and IFNγ (100 units/ml). After 24 h, cells were separated from culture medium and were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% sodium azide (immunoprecipitation buffer). Insoluble material was discarded after centrifugation. Monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (clone mAb1) (3 μl/ml) was added to culture medium as well as cell extracts. In identically treated control cells, TP-25 (anti-Class I mAb) or mouse anti-human IgG (3 μl/ml) were added to culture supernatants and cell extracts. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. 10 μl of protein G-agarose was added to each sample, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The agarose beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer and counted in a scintillation counter (TopCount, Packard Instrument, Meridan, CT). Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to extract total RNA from 5 × 106 THP1 cells for each condition and time point used in the LPS stimulation assay. The RNA from each sample was adjusted to an equal concentration according to their A 260values. RNA was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using oligo(dT)15 and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative PCR for TNF and GAPDH was performed using a commercially available kit and according to the instructions of the manufacturer (BIOSOURCE). To allow sample comparisons, results were expressed in number of TNF mRNA copies per GAPDH mRNA copy. The TNF mRNA quantitation shown in this study is the result of two independent quantitative PCRs from the same cDNA. TNF mRNA from transgenic macrophage cultures was extracted using guanidinium isothiocyanate (28.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) and subsequently treated with RQ1 RNase free DNase (1 unit/μg of nucleic acid, Promega). Total cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of cellular RNA at 37 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5 μm oligo(dT) primer, 1 mm of each dNTP (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Primer sequences and PCR conditions were identical to those described recently (25.Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizzaro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Data were normalized relative to β-actin values. For Northern blot of total RNA from targeted mutant macrophages, 15 μg of RNA were resolved in 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes as described (25.Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizzaro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Mice challenged with a single intravenous dose of ConA (20 μg/kg) showed up-regulation of circulating cytokine levels that peaked at various time points. 5 mg/kg Allotrap 1258 caused a 75% reduction of TNF plasma levels measured 60 min after treatment. Higher doses of Allotrap 1258 had a similar effect. Similarly, administration of 5–20 mg/kg Allotrap 1258 caused a 50% reduction of IFNγ plasma levels measured 360 min after treatment. In contrast, administration of Allotrap 1258 at 5 mg/kg had little effect on IL-12 plasma levels (30% reduction), whereas 20 mg/kg Allotrap 1258 resulted in a 70% reduction. Other cytokines studied, namely IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, showed no differences in response to peptide treatment (data not shown). For all cytokines, the effect of Allotrap 1258 was studied at their respective peak time points. Treatment with Allotrap 1258 alone (in the absence of ConA stimulation) did not result in detectable levels of any of the studied cytokines (Fig.1). Allotrap 1258 administration effectively inhibited the production of TNF in mice challenged with GalN and LPS (TableI). Treatment with GalN alone at 800 mg/kg had no effect on serum TNF levels in all strains of mice studied. Challenge with a low dose of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) following GalN, however, resulted in significantly higher TNF levels at 60 min. (Table I). Simultaneous administration of Allotrap 1258 prevented the rise in TNF levels in C57BL/6 and CBA mice, which were undetectable. Similar inhibition was observed in iNOS/KO and HO-1/KO mice as well as in the respective wild type controls (Table I). Inhibition of LPS induced TNF production correlated with increased survival. Mice (C57BL/6 or CBA) challenged with GalN/LPS died because of endotoxic shock 12–24 h post-injection (Table I). Those treated with Allotrap 1258 at 10 mg/kg showed significantly higher survival rates with 80–100% animals surviving at 24 h. Negative control peptide D2RP had no protective effects (Table I). Allotrap 1258 treatment in iNOS/KO animals similarly challenged with GalN/LPS resulted in protection of these animals from death (70% survival at 24 h). Because of the limited number of HO-1/KO animals available and given their extreme sensitivity to endotoxin in general (23.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), survival studies were not done in this group.Table IEffect of Allotrap 1258 on GalN/LPS challenged miceStrainTreatmentDoseTNF (n)aMean ± S.D.Survival (n)mg/kgng/mlCBANone03.6 ± 2.16 (3)0 (5)CBAD2RP102.0 ± 1.1 (3)0 (5)CBAAllotrap 125810<0.3 (3)3 (5)C57B1/6None08.5 ± 11.3 (5)1 (5)C57B1/6D2RP108.8 ± 7.46 (5)4 (25)C57B1/6Allotrap 1258100.12 ± 0.26 (5)24 (25)iNOS K/OD2RP102.5 ± 0.95 (3)2 (10)iNOS K/OAllotrap 1258100.53 ± 0.92 (3)7 (10)HO-1 WTbWT, wild type.None01.8 ± 0.46 (4)NTcNT, not tested.HO-1 WTAllotrap 25810<0.3 (4)NTHO-1 K/ONone05.3 ± 5.02 (3)NTHO-1 K/OAllotrap 1258100.53 ± 0.71 (4)NTMice (specified strains) challenged with GalN (800 mg/kg) and LPS (0.1 mg/kg) were treated with Allotrap 1258 or D2RP (control peptide).

Open table in a new tab Mice (specified strains) challenged with GalN (800 mg/kg) and LPS (0.1 mg/kg) were treated with Allotrap 1258 or D2RP (control peptide). Plasma TNF levels were measured at 60 min, and survival was monitored at 24 h. The mechanism of peptide-mediated inhibition of TNF production was investigated inin vitro experiments. First, the toxicity of the peptide was evaluated in 51Cr release experiments. The human monocyte cell line THP-1 was labeled with 51Cr and incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of Allotrap 1258, or vehicle control for 4 and 24 h. 51Cr released into the medium by labeled cells cultured in the presence of Allotrap 1258 was not different from the spontaneous release of 51Cr by untreated cells either at 4 or 24 h (data not shown). This demonstrated that the peptides were not cytotoxic and did not induce cell lysis. Neither THP-1 cells nor the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 produced detectable amounts of TNF in normal tissue culture. In the presence of LPS (10 μg/ml), TNF levels in the RAW264.7 cell culture medium increased continuously over 24 h to a level of 2.46 ng/ml (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS (5 μg/ml) and IFNγ (100 units/ml) for 24 h produced 3.04 ng/ml TNF. (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of Allotrap 1258 a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF production was seen both in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2 A) as well as in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2 B). The IC50values obtained was 20 μm. Negative control peptide had no effect on LPS-mediated TNF levels in either cell line. To evaluate whether peptide-mediated inhibition of TNF production was on a translational or transcriptional level, we quantitated the amount of TNF protein and mRNA produced in the presence or absence of peptide. Protein production was measured by immunoprecipitation of [35S]Met-labeled TNF. THP-1 cells were cultured in [35S]Met-containing medium and stimulated to produce TNF in the absence or presence of Allotrap 1258 or negative control peptide. Subsequently, TNF and HLA class I was immunoprecipiated from the culture supernatant and the cell lysate separately. A control antibody (goat anti-human) precipitated small amounts of labeled protein (2160 ± 360 cpm) from the culture supernatant (Fig.3 A). Similar amounts of protein (1945 ± 50 cpm) were precipitated from the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells in the absence of LPS. Cells cultured in the presence of LPS produced large amounts of TNF, and 44413 ± 3995 cpm could be immunoprecipitated from the culture supernatant. In the presence of Allotrap 1258 the production of TNF was completely inhibited (3108 ± 1088 cpm), whereas the control peptide D2RP had no effect (43447 ± 1769 cpm). However, Allotrap 1258 had no effect on the incorporation of [35S]Met into other proteins. In particular, peptide did not change production of HLA class I immunoprecipitated with mAb TP25. Equivalent amounts of class I were immunoprecipitated from stimulated cultures independent of the presence of Allotrap 1258 or D2RP (61808 ± 2093 cpm). Similar results were obtained with cell lysates (Fig. 3 B). However, as expected, the amount of TNF in the supernatant was larger than the amount of TNF in the cell lysate, and the opposite was true for HLA class I. The amount of TNF mRNA was quantitated by RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from THP-1 cells at 2, 4, and 24 h after addition of LPS ± Allotrap 1258. Following reverse transcription, both TNF and GAPDH cDNAs were quantitated by PCR and ELISA (Biosource). Irrespective of the addition of Allotrap 1258 at 100 μm, TNF mRNA levels increased in all samples after stimulation (Fig. 4). Relative to GAPDH mRNA copy numbers, the average number of TNF transcripts increased from 0.66 in unstimulated cells to 9.07 and 7.43 in the presence of LPS alone or with Allotrap 1258, respectively. This minor difference was not statistically significant and could not explain the complete inhibition of TNF protein in the presence of Allotrap 1258. Stimulated cells in this set of experiments produced 96.81 pg/ml TNF. Addition of Allotrap 1258 resulted in complete inhibition of TNF production, and TNF was undetectable. In the presence of a control peptide and LPS, cells produced normal amounts of TNF (117 pg/ml) that did not differ from control LPS-stimulated cells. Allotrap 1258-mediated inhibition of TNF translation requires 3′-ARE-dependent and ARE-independent mechanisms The post-transcriptional regulation of TNF mRNA has been reported to rely on mechanisms that utilize elements residing on the 3′-UTR of this message (25.Kontoyiannis D.

It occurs in two distinct stages as follows: first, production of a “pseudomorph,” a puff of ink and mucus supposed to attract the predator by virtue of its deceptive resemblance to the cephalopod shape; and second, the ejection of a large cloud of ink, providing a smokey screen covering the retreat (1.Hanlon R.T. Messenger J.B. Cephalopod Behaviour. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1996: 66-93Google Scholar, 2.MacGinitie G.E. MacGinitie N. Natural History of Marine Animals. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1949: 395-397Google Scholar, 3.Lucero M.T. Farrington H. Gilly W.F. Biol. Bull. 1994; 187: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Biochemically, the production of ink by cephalopods shares many features in common with the process of melanogenesis in epidermal melanocytes (4.Prota G. Ortonne J.P. Voulot C. Khatchadourian C. Nardi G. Palumbo A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 68: 415-419Google Scholar, 5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1).Both processes are triggered by the oxidation of l-tyrosine promoted by tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis, leading to the formation of dopaquinone. This unstableo-quinone suffers rapid intramolecular cyclization to afford an orange aminochrome (λmax = 480 nm) termed dopachrome, which may undergo rearrangement with or without decarboxylation to give 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI)1 or 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA), respectively. In the oxidative environment of the melanosome, the 5,6-dihydroxyindoles can co-polymerize via the corresponding quinones to give eventually the insoluble melanin granules responsible for the typical black appearance of the ink (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar).Despite considerable advances in the elucidation of the origin and structure of Sepia melanin (6.Pezzella A. d'Ischia M. Napolitano A. Palumbo A. Prota G. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 8281-8286Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the biochemical mechanisms involved in regulation of tyrosinase activity and ink production still remain to be elucidated. To keep the animal prepared to face a dangerous situation, the mature ink gland cells regularly produce the melanin that accumulates into the ink sac, the typical effector organ delegated to the storage and ejection of the ink. This entails the existence of a specific, as yet unknown, signaling system that keeps the biochemical machinery for ink production active, so to ensure that sufficient amounts of melanin are available when necessary.Clues to potential candidate mechanisms for regulation of melanogenesis in Sepia have recently derived from the demonstration in the immature ink gland cells of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NO synthase (NOS) as well as of glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) R1 receptor subunits (7.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Gesualdo I. d'Ischia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glutamate and NMDA receptors and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS have also been detected by chemical and immunohistochemical techniques in certain neural pathways of Sepia central nervous system relating to the ink defense system (8.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Poli A. Di Cristo C. d'Ischia M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence hinted at a possible role of the glutamate/NO/cGMP pathway in the rapid transduction of the stimuli derived from alarming inputs to those neural pathways controlling contraction of the ink sac sphincters and wall muscles in the ejection mechanism.In this paper, we report experimental evidence demonstrating for the first time that stimulation of NMDA receptors in the ink gland ofSepia officinalis induces a marked elevation of tyrosinase activity and increases melanin synthesis through the NO/cGMP pathway.DISCUSSIONThe activation of tyrosinase and the appearance of black melanin granules within melanosomes are the culminating and most peculiar events in the maturation of epithelial cells in the ink gland ofS. officinalis (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 12.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Gesualdo I. Hearing V.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24.Ortonne J.P. Voulot C. Khatchadourian C. Palumbo A. Prota G. Seiji M. Pigment Cell. 6. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1981: 49-57Google Scholar). During this process, it is reasonable to envisage the existence of a specific transmitter and/or signaling agent promoting activation of tyrosinase at the appropriate stage of maturation and maintaining the enzyme in an active state. Based on the results of the present study, it is proposed that the excitatory neurotransmitter l-glutamate subserves this role, acting via NMDA receptors to stimulate NOS to produce NO, which in turn activates its downstream target guanylate cyclase to elevate cGMP and to increase the catalytic activity of tyrosinase. The comparable activation of tyrosinase induced by NMDA and NO indicated a fast signal transduction mechanism that is compatible with the involvement of a constitutive, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS (7.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Gesualdo I. d'Ischia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The crucial role of Ca2+ mobilization through ionotropic receptors could also be inferred from the observed inability of NMDA to cause elevation of cGMP levels in Ca2+-free artificial seawater as the incubation medium.The observed selective localization of NOS-like immunopositivity in the immature cells would warrant also speculations about a possible role of NO as the key messenger controlling the process of maturation of ink gland cells. In these cells, NO could act by switching the program from proliferation to melanogenesis, a differentiated function of mature ink gland cells and, more in general, of pigment cells. This is very apparent in human epidermal melanocytes, in which the melanin content is inversely related to the rate of proliferation (25.Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). If confirmed in further studies, these observations would lead support to the currently emerging view of NO as a general regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation during organ development and morphogenesis (26.Kuzin B.

The specific localization of NOS-like and NMDA R1 receptor-like immunopositivity in the non-pigmented region of the gland, coupled with detection of enhanced cGMP immunopositivity in active melanizing cells, suggests moreover that NO contributes to a paracrine regulation of basal melanogenesis in the inner melanized cell layer and that NOS expression is suppressed once the maturation process is complete.The NO-cGMP pathway has recently been shown to mediate the stimulatory effects of UVB radiation on melanogenesis in cultured human melanocytes (28.Roméro-Graillet C.

Elucidation of this signaling pathway, in particular, disclosed the ability of NO to serve as both autocrine and paracrine chemical messenger increasing tyrosinase activity after UV irradiation through elevation of cGMP and activation of protein kinase G. That study, however, was mainly relevant to the specific conditions associated with UV irradiations, where cell homeostasis may be affected or disrupted as a result of more or less severe inflammation, and no relationship has so far been demonstrated between the NO signaling pathway and the basal melanogenic activity under physiologic conditions.With regard to the mechanism(s) of the NO and cGMP-mediated enhancement of tyrosinase activity, the observed lack of effect of the protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide would argue in favor of a specific response occurring at the post-translational level. Although experimental difficulties due to the use of whole intact ink glands hampered a more detailed insight, the reported effects of a protein kinase G inhibitor pointed to protein kinase G as a plausible downstream target of cGMP, possibly causing a direct phosphorylation of tyrosinase (29.El-Husseini A.E.-D.

The possibility remains, however, that protein kinase C activates tyrosinase in Sepia in response to other stimuli.Consistent with the observed activation of tyrosinase, exposure of ink glands to NMDA or NO resulted also in an increased melanin synthesis in the mature cells. The extent of enhanced melanin synthesis, however, was not proportional to the degree of tyrosinase activation. This is an important point since tyrosinase is the main but not the sole enzyme responsible for pigment production in the melanosomes (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis.

Whether the glutamate receptor/NO/cGMP pathway can affect other melanogenic enzymes in Sepia in addition to tyrosinase remains an important focus for future studies.Combined use of the spectrophotometric assay and PTCA quantitation on partially purified melanosomal fractions allowed reliable determination of the extents of melanin synthesis in NMDA- and NO-stimulatedversus unstimulated ink glands. This analytical approach was deemed superior to the direct scintillation counting of the insoluble pigment after incubation with [14C]l-DOPA or other radiolabeled precursors, a method commonly used to measure melanin synthesis (28.Roméro-Graillet C.

In particular, HPLC determination of the PTCA produced by oxidative degradation of carefully separated melanosome-containing fractions provided unambiguous indications forde novo synthesis of authentic melanin within the melanosomes of mature cells via the 5,6-dihydroxyindole route (Scheme FS2).Figure FS2Reaction scheme showing the formation of PTCA by oxidative degradation of DHI - and DHICA-derived melanin units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PTCA may in principle arise from oxidative breakdown of both DHICA-derived units and DHI-derived units substituted on the 2-position of the indole ring (Scheme FS2). However, recent studies indicated that DHICA-derived units contribute to a much greater extent to the total PTCA formed from melanin degradation and account for as much as 75% of the overall monomer units in sepiomelanin (6.Pezzella A. d'Ischia M. Napolitano A. Palumbo A. Prota G. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 8281-8286Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36.Pezzella A. Napolitano A. d'Ischia M. Prota G. Seraglia R. Traldi P. Rapid Commun.

Such a conclusion seems to hold also for the newly synthesized melanin in stimulated ink glands, as judged from the large increases in the PTCA yields compared with the corresponding changes inA 350 values. The slight difference in the relative increases in the A 350 and PTCA values after NMDA and NO stimulation of ink glands conceivably reflects the different specificities of the two analytical methods. It is possible, for instance, that the lower increases in melanin levels determined with the spectrophotometric assay depend at least in part on the greater susceptibility of the less polymeric and newly synthesized pigment to hydrogen peroxide-induced bleaching (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar).In conclusion, the demonstration that glutamate NMDA receptor stimulation substantially elevates tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis in the ink glands of S. officinalis through the NO/cGMP pathway not only reinforces current appreciation of NO as a key modulator of melanogenesis but hints for the first time at a possible role of l-glutamate as the neurotransmitter deputed to stimulate melanin synthesis in Sepia in response to alarming inputs. Inking is a characteristic behavior adopted by nearly all coleoid cephalopods, i.e. Sepia, Loligo, andOctopus, to confuse predators and alert conspecifics to danger while retreating. It occurs in two distinct stages as follows: first, production of a “pseudomorph,” a puff of ink and mucus supposed to attract the predator by virtue of its deceptive resemblance to the cephalopod shape; and second, the ejection of a large cloud of ink, providing a smokey screen covering the retreat (1.Hanlon R.T. Messenger J.B. Cephalopod Behaviour. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1996: 66-93Google Scholar, 2.MacGinitie G.E. MacGinitie N. Natural History of Marine Animals. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1949: 395-397Google Scholar, 3.Lucero M.T. Farrington H. Gilly W.F. Biol. Bull. 1994; 187: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Biochemically, the production of ink by cephalopods shares many features in common with the process of melanogenesis in epidermal melanocytes (4.Prota G. Ortonne J.P. Voulot C. Khatchadourian C. Nardi G. Palumbo A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 68: 415-419Google Scholar, 5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1). Both processes are triggered by the oxidation of l-tyrosine promoted by tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis, leading to the formation of dopaquinone. This unstableo-quinone suffers rapid intramolecular cyclization to afford an orange aminochrome (λmax = 480 nm) termed dopachrome, which may undergo rearrangement with or without decarboxylation to give 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI)1 or 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA), respectively. In the oxidative environment of the melanosome, the 5,6-dihydroxyindoles can co-polymerize via the corresponding quinones to give eventually the insoluble melanin granules responsible for the typical black appearance of the ink (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar). Despite considerable advances in the elucidation of the origin and structure of Sepia melanin (6.Pezzella A. d'Ischia M. Napolitano A. Palumbo A. Prota G. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 8281-8286Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the biochemical mechanisms involved in regulation of tyrosinase activity and ink production still remain to be elucidated. To keep the animal prepared to face a dangerous situation, the mature ink gland cells regularly produce the melanin that accumulates into the ink sac, the typical effector organ delegated to the storage and ejection of the ink. This entails the existence of a specific, as yet unknown, signaling system that keeps the biochemical machinery for ink production active, so to ensure that sufficient amounts of melanin are available when necessary. Clues to potential candidate mechanisms for regulation of melanogenesis in Sepia have recently derived from the demonstration in the immature ink gland cells of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NO synthase (NOS) as well as of glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) R1 receptor subunits (7.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Gesualdo I. d'Ischia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glutamate and NMDA receptors and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS have also been detected by chemical and immunohistochemical techniques in certain neural pathways of Sepia central nervous system relating to the ink defense system (8.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Poli A. Di Cristo C. d'Ischia M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence hinted at a possible role of the glutamate/NO/cGMP pathway in the rapid transduction of the stimuli derived from alarming inputs to those neural pathways controlling contraction of the ink sac sphincters and wall muscles in the ejection mechanism. In this paper, we report experimental evidence demonstrating for the first time that stimulation of NMDA receptors in the ink gland ofSepia officinalis induces a marked elevation of tyrosinase activity and increases melanin synthesis through the NO/cGMP pathway. DISCUSSIONThe activation of tyrosinase and the appearance of black melanin granules within melanosomes are the culminating and most peculiar events in the maturation of epithelial cells in the ink gland ofS. officinalis (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 12.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Gesualdo I. Hearing V.J. Biochem.

University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1981: 49-57Google Scholar). During this process, it is reasonable to envisage the existence of a specific transmitter and/or signaling agent promoting activation of tyrosinase at the appropriate stage of maturation and maintaining the enzyme in an active state. Based on the results of the present study, it is proposed that the excitatory neurotransmitter l-glutamate subserves this role, acting via NMDA receptors to stimulate NOS to produce NO, which in turn activates its downstream target guanylate cyclase to elevate cGMP and to increase the catalytic activity of tyrosinase. The comparable activation of tyrosinase induced by NMDA and NO indicated a fast signal transduction mechanism that is compatible with the involvement of a constitutive, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS (7.Palumbo A. Di Cosmo A. Gesualdo I. d'Ischia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The crucial role of Ca2+ mobilization through ionotropic receptors could also be inferred from the observed inability of NMDA to cause elevation of cGMP levels in Ca2+-free artificial seawater as the incubation medium.The observed selective localization of NOS-like immunopositivity in the immature cells would warrant also speculations about a possible role of NO as the key messenger controlling the process of maturation of ink gland cells. In these cells, NO could act by switching the program from proliferation to melanogenesis, a differentiated function of mature ink gland cells and, more in general, of pigment cells. This is very apparent in human epidermal melanocytes, in which the melanin content is inversely related to the rate of proliferation (25.Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). If confirmed in further studies, these observations would lead support to the currently emerging view of NO as a general regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation during organ development and morphogenesis (26.Kuzin B. Roberts I. Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Cell. 1996; 87: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 27.Peunova N. Enikolopov G.

Whether the glutamate receptor/NO/cGMP pathway can affect other melanogenic enzymes in Sepia in addition to tyrosinase remains an important focus for future studies. Combined use of the spectrophotometric assay and PTCA quantitation on partially purified melanosomal fractions allowed reliable determination of the extents of melanin synthesis in NMDA- and NO-stimulatedversus unstimulated ink glands. This analytical approach was deemed superior to the direct scintillation counting of the insoluble pigment after incubation with [14C]l-DOPA or other radiolabeled precursors, a method commonly used to measure melanin synthesis (28.Roméro-Graillet C.

In particular, HPLC determination of the PTCA produced by oxidative degradation of carefully separated melanosome-containing fractions provided unambiguous indications forde novo synthesis of authentic melanin within the melanosomes of mature cells via the 5,6-dihydroxyindole route (Scheme FS2). PTCA may in principle arise from oxidative breakdown of both DHICA-derived units and DHI-derived units substituted on the 2-position of the indole ring (Scheme FS2). However, recent studies indicated that DHICA-derived units contribute to a much greater extent to the total PTCA formed from melanin degradation and account for as much as 75% of the overall monomer units in sepiomelanin (6.Pezzella A. d'Ischia M. Napolitano A. Palumbo A. Prota G. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 8281-8286Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36.Pezzella A. Napolitano A. d'Ischia M. Prota G. Seraglia R. Traldi P. Rapid Commun.

The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiogy. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 307-332Google Scholar). Such a conclusion seems to hold also for the newly synthesized melanin in stimulated ink glands, as judged from the large increases in the PTCA yields compared with the corresponding changes inA 350 values. The slight difference in the relative increases in the A 350 and PTCA values after NMDA and NO stimulation of ink glands conceivably reflects the different specificities of the two analytical methods. It is possible, for instance, that the lower increases in melanin levels determined with the spectrophotometric assay depend at least in part on the greater susceptibility of the less polymeric and newly synthesized pigment to hydrogen peroxide-induced bleaching (5.Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar). In conclusion, the demonstration that glutamate NMDA receptor stimulation substantially elevates tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis in the ink glands of S. officinalis through the NO/cGMP pathway not only reinforces current appreciation of NO as a key modulator of melanogenesis but hints for the first time at a possible role of l-glutamate as the neurotransmitter deputed to stimulate melanin synthesis in Sepia in response to alarming inputs.

https://openalex.org/W2070499092,"The secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells, which contain large amounts of Ca2+ and chromogranins, have been demonstrated to release Ca2+ in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), indicating the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store role of secretory granules. In our previous study, chromogranin A (CGA) was shown to interact with several secretory granule membrane proteins, including the IP3 receptor (IP3R), at the intravesicular pH 5.5 (Yoo, S. H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12001–12006). To examine the functional aspect of this coupling, we measured the IP3-mediated Ca2+ release property of the IP3R reconstituted into liposomes in the presence and absence of CGA. Presence of CGA in the IP3R-reconstituted liposome significantly enhanced the IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the liposomes. Moreover, the number of IP3 bound to the reconstituted IP3R increased. The fluorescence energy transfer and IP3R Trp fluorescence quenching studies indicated that the structure of reconstituted IP3R becomes more ordered and exposed in the presence of CGA, suggesting that the coupled CGA in the liposome caused structural changes of the IP3R, changing it to a structure that is better suited to IP3 binding and subsequent Ca2+ release. These results appear to underscore the physiological significance of IP3R-CGA coupling in the secretory granules.

Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this observation has also been extended to the secretory granules of zymogen-secreting pancreatic acinar cells (2.Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), further demonstrating the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store role of secretory granules. Recently, direct participation of secretory granule calcium in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration has also been shown in the secretory granules of goblet cells (3.Nguyen T. Chin W.-C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); uptake of Ca2+ by secretory granules was temporally and spatially matched by simultaneous reduction of Ca2+ concentration in the surrounding cytoplasm, whereas IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ by the secretory granules resulted in the simultaneous increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in the immediate vicinity of the secretory granules, clearly indicating the participation of secretory granule calcium in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration. Moreover, the IP3-sensitive Ca2+store role of secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells was attributed to the presence of high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ storage protein CGA, which binds 30–50 mol of Ca2+/mol, inside the secretory granule (1.Yoo S.H.

IP3 mediates release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores by binding to the IP3R, which can also function as a Ca2+ channel (5.Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H.

In our previous study, chromogranin A was shown to interact with several integral membrane proteins of secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, including the IP3R (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was the first time an ion channel protein was shown to be physically linked to a cognate ion storage protein. Chromogranin A, which is the major secretory granule matrix protein of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, interacts with the secretory granule membrane at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 but dissociates from it at the near physiological pH of 7.5 (15.Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8213-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It also undergoes pH- and Ca2+-dependent conformational changes (16.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and forms a homodimer at pH 7.5 and a homotetramer at pH 5.5 (17.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a tetrameric CGA has been shown to bind four molecules of an intraluminal loop peptide of the IP3R (19.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting the interaction of tetrameric CGA with tetrameric IP3R in the cell. In our recent study, it was shown that purified IP3Rs interact directly with CGA at the intravesicular pH 5.5 and dissociate from it at a near physiological pH 7.5 (20.Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kwon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Further, cotransfection of IP3R and CGA into COS-7 cells followed by coimmunoprecipitation also demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of these two proteins (20.Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kwon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating that IP3R and CGA exist in a complexed state in vivo. These results strongly suggested that coupling of Ca2+ storage protein CGA to the IP3R/Ca2+ channel might serve important physiological roles in the secretory vesicles not only during secretory vesicle biogenesis (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also in controlling IP3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in the cell. Therefore, we have investigated in this report the physiological significance of CGA coupling to the IP3R using IP3R-reconstituted liposomes in the presence and absence of CGA, and found that CGA coupling to the IP3R in the proteoliposomes causes structural changes of IP3R so as to facilitate not only the IP3 binding but also the Ca2+ release activity of the channel. Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Albaster, AL) and were used without further purification. Fluorescence probes were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Chloroform solutions of lipids were stored in sealed ampules under argon gas at −20 °C. Cholesterol and IP3 were obtained from Sigma. All radioactive reagents were from NEN Life Science Products. Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Chromogranin A from bovine adrenal medulla was prepared from the secretory vesicle lysates of chromaffin cells as described previously (Fig. 1) (16.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An IP3R peptide (DEEEVWLFWRDSNKEI, in single-letter code) corresponding to residues 692–707 of the type I IP3R (22.Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 23.Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal cysteine. A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against the peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and affinity-purified on the immobilized peptide following the procedure described (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine cerebella were mixed with 3 volumes of buffer I (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and were broken into small pieces in a blender, followed by homogenization in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were recentrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to precipitate the membrane pellet. The pellet was resuspended in buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) containing 1% Triton X-100 to give the membrane protein concentration of approximately 2 mg/ml. The membrane solution was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was mixed with an equal volume of buffer III (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and applied to an IP3R antibody-coupled immunoaffinity column (0.35 × 1 cm) equilibrated with buffer C (see below). The IP3R antibody-coupled column was prepared by coupling 0.6 mg of affinity purified anti-peptide IP3R antibody (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) either to 1.2 ml of the immobilized protein A resin from the ImmunoPure protein A IgG orientation kit (Pierce) or to 0.2 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the method described previously (8.Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Snyder S.H. Science. 1992; 257: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and stored in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% sodium azide until use. The protein-loaded column was washed with 20 bed volumes of buffer C to remove unbound proteins, and the IP3R was eluted by 10 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin). The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and mixed with an equal volume of buffer IV (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and then applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer D to remove any residual proteases from the IP3R sample. The IP3R containing flow-through was collected and stored at −70 °C until use (Fig. 1). The purified bovine cerebellum IP3R bound approximately 320 pmol of IP3/mg of protein, which is comparable to other purified IP3Rs (9.Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10.Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), as determined according to the published method (10.Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (from bovine brain), phosphatidylserine (from bovine brain), and cholesterol dissolved in chloroform were mixed to give a molar ratio of 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively. The final lipid concentration was 5 mm in a total volume of 500 μl. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon gas, and the residual chloroform was removed by speed vacuuming. The dry lipids were hydrated in buffer A or B solution (A: 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1% CHAPS; B: 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, and 1% CHAPS) containing 17 μg/ml IP3R and 60 μg/ml CGA (Fig.1). The mixtures were dialyzed for 72 h against excess volume of buffer C (buffer A or B without CHAPS) at 4 °C. The resulting proteoliposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed with buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 m KCl, and 3 m urea) twice to remove unreconstituted proteins. The pellets were resuspended with buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl) and then were dialyzed against buffer E for 48 h at 4 °C. The resulting proteoliposomes were passed through Chelex 100 to remove Ca2+. The formation of proteoliposomes was monitored using light scattering during dialysis against buffer C and by electron microscopy; some portion of sample was collected as a function of time and, the emission values at 450 nm were measured with the same excitation wavelength (excitation band slit width: 1.5/emission band slit width: 5 nm). The average diameter of the liposomes was 280 ± 50 nm when assayed by light scattering (24.Kolchens S. Ramaswami V. Birgenheier J. Nett L. O'Brien D.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 65: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The proteoliposomes produced were estimated to contain ∼300 μmCa2+ and were stable for at least 3 days as determined by <10% deviation in light scattering values. To test the encapsulation of CGA into liposomes, we used the fluorescence of FITC which is amine-reactive and non-permeable to membranes. 50 μl of proteoliposome was incubated with 5 mm of FITC for 2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 2% Triton X-100, and then 10 μl of 500 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 was added to the mixture to stop the reaction. To remove free FITC, the sample was applied to Sephadex G-25 column (10 × 200 mm) and then was extensively dialyzed against buffer E at 4 °C. After labeling the proteoliposomes with the probe, the emission intensity at 519 nm was measured at the excitation wavelength of 494 nm. In addition, the encapsulation of CGA was also confirmed by lysing the CGA-containing and non-CGA-containing proteoliposomes with Triton X-100 and separating on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by quantitation of the proteins. These procedures not only confirmed the encapsulation of CGA in the proteoliposomes but also indicated that the presence of CGA did not affect the the amount of IP3R inserted into the liposomes (data not shown). Removal of Ca2+ contamination was conducted according to the method described previously (25.Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ca2+ contamination during all experiments was checked using the fluorescence of Ca2+indicator, indo-1, before measurements. Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was observed by measuring the fluorescence changes of indo-1. Fluorometric measurements were performed at 35 °C by using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. The fluorescence intensity was measured at the emission wavelength of 393 nm (excitation of 355 nm) with 1.5 nm of excitation band slit width and 10 nm of emission band slit width. For the kinetic analysis of IP3-induced Ca2+ release, the data were acquired every 20 ms after addition of indicated concentration of IP3 to 1.7 ml of the proteoliposome solution. The fluorescent intensities of indo-1 were calibrated to free Ca2+ concentrations using Ca2+-EGTA buffering system (26.Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In experiments designed to determine the effect of IP3R antibody (Ab) on the Ca2+ release from the IP3R-reconstituted liposomes, the IP3R Ab was mixed with the reaction solution at the ratio of 1 μg of IP3R/10 or 50 μg of IP3R Ab. After preincubating the sample at 35 °C for 30 min, the time course of IP3-induced Ca2+ release was monitored with the same method described above. IP3 dose-dependent release of Ca2+was also measured by the fluorescence intensity of indo-1 after addition of IP3 and compared with the fluorescence intensity after addition of Triton X-100 instead of IP3. To exclude the possibility of Ca2+ regulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release, 10 μmof indo-1 was used in these experiments, which was a high enough concentration to buffer the released Ca2+. Reconstituted proteoliposomes were incubated with various concentrations of IP3 containing 1/1000 as much [3H]IP3. After 10 min of incubation at 35 °C, 0.1 volume of each sample was filtered through a spun concentrator (Microcon from Amicon) with molecular weight cutoff of 100,000 at 5000 × g. The radioactivity of each filtrate was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS6000LL) and compared with the control values without proteoliposomes. For the collisional fluorescence quenching of Trp residues in IP3R by iodide, a varying amount of KI, up to 0.16 m final, was added to the reaction mixtures while maintaining the total concentration of KI plus KCl constant, and the fluorescence intensity at the emission wavelength of 340 nm was measured with the excitation at 295 nm at 35 °C. To label the IP3R with 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) and fluorescein 5-maleimide (F-mal), respectively, CPM or F-mal, both from Molecular Probes, was added dropwise to 2 μg of IP3R, and the labeling was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. Upon completion of the labeling, an excess of glutathione and mercaptoethanol was added to stop the reaction. CPM- or F-mal- labeled IP3R molecules were separated by Sephadex G-25 and dialyzed extensively against buffer E. The labeled receptor molecules were reconstituted into the liposomes along with Ca2+ in the presence and absence of CGA, and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer was determined at 35 °C by measuring the emission spectra of F-mal in the range of 500–580 nm at the excitation wavelength of 384 nm, the excitation wavelength of CPM. The proteoliposomes were produced in the presence of45Ca2+ to include ∼50,000 cpm of45Ca2+ in buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) according to the procedure described. To remove residual Ca2+ bound to the vesicle surface, the sample was applied to Sephadex G25 column (10 × 00 mm) equilibrated with buffer E and, after collection of the vesicle fractions, the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The pellet was then redissolved and dialyzed against excess volume of buffer E for 12 h at 4 °C. The proteoliposomes were mixed with each indicated concentration of CaCl2 and incubated for 10 min at 35 °C. After further incubation of the sample for 10 min in the presence of 0.2 μm of IP3 in the reaction mixtures, the sample was diluted with buffer F (buffer E plus 1.5 m KCl). The liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 35 °C followed by washing in buffer D twice. The pellet was then dissolved with 1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity of each fraction (pellet and supernatant) was determined by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid according to the manufacturer's instruction (Sigma). The concentrations of non-fluorescent phospholipids were determined by phosphorus assay (28.Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. Vasendin I.M. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 114: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The concentrations of fluorescent probes were determined spectrophotometrically using the following values as the molar extinction coefficients: 5700 cm−1m−1 at 336 nm for 1,5-IAEDANS, 77,000 cm−1m−1 at 494 nm and 83,000 cm−1m−1 at 492 nm for F-mal, and 33,000 cm−1m−1 at 384 nm for CPM. To mimic anin vivo physiological pH environment, the inside pH of the liposomes was maintained at 5.5 while that of outside was kept at 7.5. To determine whether the inside pH of the proteoliposome is stably maintained at pH 5.5, oxonol V (Molecular Probes) was encapsulated in the proteoliposome and its fluorescence increase upon exposure to higher pH environment was measured (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2, exposure of the internalized oxonol V to the pH 5.5 environment upon lysis of the proteoliposome by Triton X-100 treatment did not change the fluorescence of oxonol V. However, exposure of the internalized oxonol V to pH 6.5 or 7.5 environment upon lysis of the liposome increased the fluorescence of oxonol V, indicating the maintenance of pH 5.5 inside the proteoliposome. This result indicated that the inside pH of the proteoliposome was well maintained, suggesting the suitability of these proteoliposomes for subsequent experiments. The emission fluorescence was measured at 630 nm with the excitation wavelength of 610 nm in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Fig. 3 A shows the time course of IP3-induced Ca2+ efflux from the IP3R-reconstituted liposomes, as assayed by the fluorescence change of indo-1 (1 μm) at 393 nm. Indo-1 is a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, which is non-permeable to membrane and has a dual emission character on Ca2+ binding; the fluorescence at 390 nm increases, while that at 465 nm decreases. When increasing the IP3 concentrations successively, Ca2+ was released from the proteoliposomes with only the fast rate, and the fluorescence changes virtually reached a plateau after addition of 4 μm IP3 (Fig.3 A). No further increase of the emission fluorescence was observed by adding more IP3 (data not shown). The total amount of Ca2+ released by IP3 was estimated to be approximately 50% of the total encapsulated Ca2+concentration considering the maximal fluorescence signal obtained when the liposomes were lysed by 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3 A). We also tested the specificity of Ca2+ release through the IP3R using the IP3R Ab (Fig. 3, Aand B). Addition of IP3R Ab at the ratio of 1 μg of IP3R/10 μg of IP3R Ab inhibited about 70% of the IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Addition of more IP3R Ab, at the IP3R/IP3R Ab ratio of 1:50 (w/w), inhibited the Ca2+ release only slightly more (Fig. 3, A and B). When CGA was present inside the vesicle, the IP3-induced Ca2+ release was biexponential with the fast and the slow rate (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, 1 μmIP3 released almost a maximumal amount of Ca2+in the presence of CGA (Fig. 3 C), whereas the same amount of IP3 released only a half-maximum in the absence of CGA (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that the Ca2+channel activity of IP3R becomes far more efficient as a result of CGA encapsulation. However, when the pH value of inside the liposome was kept at 7.5 (Fig. 3 C), the kinetic profile of IP3-induced Ca2+ release was very similar to that obtained in the absence of CGA (Fig. 3 A), confirming our previous result, which indicated CGA interaction with the IP3R at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.5 (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a control experiment, IP3R was labeled with FITC or 1,5-IAEDANS after completion of the reconstitution in the presence or absence of CGA, and the fluorescence intensity was measured to determine the effect of CGA on the amount of reconstituted IP3R. In both cases, we could not find any difference in the fluorescence intensities of the reconstituted samples, indicating that the amount of IP3R reconstituted was not affected by the presence of CGA (data not shown). Since it has also been shown that Ca2+release from the IP3R can be regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (29.Iino M. Endo M. Nature. 1992; 360: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), there was a possibility that the IP3-induced Ca2+ release might not represent net IP3-mediated Ca2+ release. To address this possibility, we determined the amount of Ca2+ released after one-time dose of each indicated concentration of IP3in the presence of 10 μm of indo-1, which is a high enough concentration to buffer the released Ca2+ (Fig.4). As shown in Fig. 4, presence of CGA at pH 5.5 significantly increased the amounts of Ca2+released, compared with those in the absence of CGA, although the difference in the amounts of Ca2+ released in both cases diminished as IP3 concentrations increased. However, even the presence of CGA failed to exert this effect when the pH of the liposomes was 7.5. To determine whether the increased release of Ca2+ in the presence of CGA is due to increased binding of IP3 to the proteoliposome, the amount of IP3 bound to the IP3R was determined as a function of increasing IP3 concentrations (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, the presence of CGA enhanced the IP3binding 2-fold over that in the absence of CGA. When the IP3R alone was reconstituted, a maximum of 0.4 mol of IP3 appeared to bind 1 mol of IP3R. However, when CGA was also present inside the liposomes at the intravesicular pH of 5.5, the IP3 binding increased to about double the value shown with the IP3R alone. But when the pH of the liposomes was 7.5, CGA showed no effect on the IP3 binding to the IP3R. Nevertheless, the half-maximal value was almost the same for both cases regardless of the presence of CGA, indicating that the affinity of IP3R for IP3 has not changed. To investigate possible conformational changes of the IP3R by its interaction with CGA, we utilized collisional quenching of the IP3R Trp fluorescence by iodide (Fig.6). As shown in Fig. 6, the IP3R Trp fluorescence was quenched by iodide regardless of the presence of CGA. The emission fluorescence at 340 nm was measured, and the results were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation (30.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar).Fo/F=Ksv[I−]+1Equation 1 Fo is the emission intensity in the absence of iodide, F is the intensity in the presence of iodide,K sv is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [I−] is the molar concentration of iodide. TheK sv value estimated from the slope was 5.20m−1 for the reconstituted IP3R in the absence of CGA. This value decreased to 3.76m−1 when CGA was present. From this experiment, it is clear that at least some Trp residues of the IP3R are less exposed to the solvent when CGA is present and that CGA induced conformational changes of IP3R. In order to further examine the effect of CGA on the molecular property of IP3R in the reconstituted vesicles, we carried out the fluorescence resonance energy transfer study using the CPM- and F-mal-labeled IP3Rs (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7, the reconstituted IP3Rs exhibited efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer as evidenced by the increase of F-mal emission fluorescence under the excitation wavelength for CPM. This result indicated that the IP3R molecules have a strong tendency to exist as oligomers (tetramers) in the membranes. When CGA was present in the liposomes, the emission intensity increased by approximately 30%, suggesting that the organizational order of IP3Rs was enhanced by their interaction with CGA. In view of the potential inhibitory effect of increasing Ca2+concentrations on the IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity of IP3R (31.Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), we examined the Ca2+release activity of the proteoliposome in response to a fixed amount of IP3 in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, 0.2 μm IP3 induced far greater Ca2+ releases in the presence of CGA than in the absence in the Ca2+ concentration range of 0.1–1.0 μm. However, in the higher Ca2+ concentration"

The subcellular location, substrate specificity, and regulation of PP-1 activity are determined by its interaction with targeting subunits. In skeletal and cardiac muscle the major glycogen-associated form of PP-1 (PP-1G) is a heterodimer composed of the phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP-1) and a subunit called GM or RGl. GM directs PP-1 to glycogen-protein particles as well as membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (11.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 12.Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swinderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by directly binding glycogen and by virtue of a putative transmembrane segment near the C terminus. This localization presumably facilitates the dephosphorylation of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes and sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, such as phospholamban (11.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar,13.Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Since the discovery of GM a family of glycogen-targeting subunits have been found, and these are closely related in sequence to the N-terminal domain of GM. All members of this family bind glycogen and PP-1. Overexpression of one of these subunits, called PTG, promotes the activation of glycogen synthase (14.Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Curiously, although the structure and function seems to be conserved among this family of proteins, only GM is phosphorylated. Purified preparations of rabbit skeletal muscle GM were phosphorylated at Ser48 (site 1) and Ser67(site 2) by PKA, which prevented binding of PP-1, as a possible way of reducing PP-1 activity toward glycogen-metabolizing enzymes (11.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 16.MacKintosh C. Campbell D.G. Hiraga A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As expected, phosphorylation of GM at both sites 1 and 2 occurs in intact muscle in response to adrenaline (17.Walker K.S. Watt P.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation of GM in response to insulin, and the possible role of GM phosphorylation in activation of glycogen synthase, has been a subject of controversy for 10 years. Insulin reportedly increased phosphorylation of Ser48 (site 1) in GM by activation of an insulin-stimulated protein kinase (18.Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Site 1 phosphorylation was said to produce a 2-fold increase in the PP-1G-catalyzed dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase (18.Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This offered a pathway for insulin activation of glycogen synthase, through site 1 phosphorylation of GM. With the discovery that insulin-stimulated protein kinase was RSK-2 (19.Lavoinne A. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Price D.J. Avruch J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a downstream substrate for MAP kinase (20.Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), site 1 phosphorylation of GM was linked to insulin activation of the MAP kinase pathway. However, multiple groups provided convincing evidence that MAP kinase was not involved in glycogen synthase activation. Experiments used the selective MEK inhibitor, PD98059, or the potent MAP kinase activator, EGF, and showed that activation of MAP kinase and RSK was neither necessary nor sufficient for the activation of glycogen synthase (21.Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21255-21261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

The role for MAP kinase in activation of glycogen synthase through activation of PP1G was discounted, but there remained the possibility that other insulin-stimulated kinases phosphorylated site 1 in GM. Experiments reported after original submission of this paper contradicted earlier results from the same group, because phospho-specific antibodies against sites in GM did not detect significant increase in phosphorylation of GM from freeze-clamped rat hindlimb, in response to insulin injection (17.Walker K.S. Watt P.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, two key questions remain: does insulin stimulate phosphorylation of GM, and is phosphorylation of GM required for insulin activation of glycogen synthase? In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation of GMin response to insulin using: 1) extracts of insulin-stimulated cells plus recombinant GST-GM and 2) expression of full-length tagged GM in CHO-IR and C2C12 muscle cells. Our data shows that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GM at both site 1 and site 2, and this is dependent on the activation of MAP kinase pathway. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of site 2 in GMdecreased the association of PP-1 in intact cells. Furthermore, we found the stimulation of glycogen synthase activity by insulin remained unchanged in cells expressing GM. Expression of wild type GM or GM mutated in sites 1 and 2 produced the same activation of glycogen synthase in response to insulin, suggesting that phosphorylation of GM is not required for glycogen synthase activation, parallel to the function of PTG (14.Berman H.K.

GM antisera were generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant GST-GM(1–240) fusion protein. Restriction enzymes were from Promega Life Science (Madison, WI). All the oligonucleotides were synthesized by ITD (Coralville, IA). Rabbit cDNA encoding GM(1–240) was cloned and inserted into pGEX4T2 vector to produce recombinant GST-GM(1–240) fusion protein as described before (26.Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GM(1–240) fragment was then subcloned into pKH3 mammalian expression vector byBamHI/EcoRI double digestion to produce (HA)3-tagged GM(1–240) protein. Mutated forms of GM(1–240) used in the following experiments were made by the polymerase chain reaction method described elsewhere (26.Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mutations were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. The entire coding sequence of rabbit GM was cloned into pGEX-4T2 vector by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subcloning methods as described previously (27.Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). (HA)3-tagged GM was constructed by insertion of GM cDNA into pKH3 mammalian expression vector. Point mutations in full-length GM were made by using Quick-Change Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO-IR cells were maintained in minimal Eagle's medium containing nucleotides and 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum until confluent, at which point differentiation was initiated by conversion to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4% horse serum. Cell fusion was apparent after 48 h. CHO-IR cells were routinely deprived of serum for 3 h prior to analysis using Ham's F-12 medium. C2C12 myotubes were serum starved for 4 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer with 30 mmHepes (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5 mm glucose. CHO-IR cells and C2C12 myoblasts were grown to 50–60% confluency and transfected by FuGene reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasmid DNA (6 μg/60-mm dish) was usually transiently transfected for 36 h in the complete medium. While CHO-IR cells were then used for experiments, the confluent C2C12 myoblasts were induced to form myotubes by switching to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4% horse serum. The cells were serum starved as described above before the treatment with insulin ± PD98059 or EGF. To obtain a higher degree of transfection efficiency for glycogen synthase activity assay, CHO-IR cells were electroporated with 40 μg of plasmid DNA as described previously (28.Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, approximately 25% of the cells remained viable, and over 80% of the surviving cells were transfected as determined by parallel transfection with a green fluorescent protein construct. CHO-IR cells and C2C12 myotubes were serum-starved and incubated with or without PD98059, wortmannin, and rapamycin for 30 min prior to the addition of 100 nm insulin. After 10 min of insulin treatment, cells (150-mm dishes) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis/kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g for 10 min. GST-GM fusion proteins (7.5 μg) were mixed with 22 μl of cell lysate in a final volume of 45 μl containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 10 μg/ml PKI, and 0.5 mm[γ-32P]ATP (2000 dpm/pmol). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before the reaction was stopped by addition of 500 μl of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 μm Microcystin-LR. 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose slurry (1:1) was added and the mixture was shaken constantly for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20–30 s and washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments were performed as described previously (29.West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Dadd C.A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 266-273PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following in vitro phosphorylation and 10% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue-stained GST-GM proteins were excised from the gel and exhaustive trypsin digestion was performed. After repeated lyophilization, phosphopeptides were resolved on a 40% alkaline polyacrylamide gel (pH 9.0) and then analyzed by autoradiography. This assay used 7.5 μg of GST-GM(1–240) protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to pull-down PP-1 from NIH3T3 cell lysates as described previously (26.Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding of PP-1 was analyzed by anti-PP-1 immunoblotting and PP-1 activity assay. To assay activity following in vitro PP-1 pull-down assay, the GST-GM(1–240) on glutathione beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20–30 s. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS and once with PP-1 assay buffer, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of PP-1 assay buffer. PP-1 activity was determined against 60 μg of 32P-labeled phosphorylasea in 20 μl of PP-1 assay buffer for 10 min at 30 °C as described previously (31.Brautigan D.L. Shriner C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by detergent solubilization in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant cell lysates were clarified at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating cell lysate with anti-HA antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the same lysis buffer and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, proteins on the gel were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies and washed as described previously (26.Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. 36 h post-transfection, confluent CHO-IR cells in 100-mm dishes were serum-starved for 3 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with pyruvate. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in the same medium containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. After stimulation with insulin, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Lysate preparation and anti-HA immunoprecipitation were performed as described above. Precipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and resovled by SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie Blue stain, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping was performed essentially as described above. Glycogen synthase activity was measured as described previously (24.Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

After two washes with ice-cold PBS, confluent CHO-IR cells (100-mm dishes) were scraped into 500 μl of lysis/glycogen synthase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as above). Lysates were clarified at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Then 50 μl of the cell lysate was added to an equal volume of glycogen synthase assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μm Microcystin-LR) containing 10 mm UDP-[14C]glucose (0.15 μCi/μmol) and 15 mg/ml glycogen, in the presence or absence of 10 mmglucose 6-phosphate. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, assay tubes were chilled on ice for 15 min. The entire contents of the tubes were spotted on a Whatman filter paper (GF/A; 2.4 cm) which was immediately immersed in 25 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, mixed 1 h, then washed one more time with 25 ml of 70% ethanol for 30 min. Filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was counted with 5 ml of scintillation mixture. The recombinant fusion protein GST-GM(1–240) was used as a substrate for kinases from CHO-IR cells that we treated with insulin. Lysates were prepared and incubated with the fusion protein plus [γ-32P]ATP and PKI, a protein that specifically inhibits PKA activity. As seen in Fig. 1, GST-GM(1–240) was phosphorylated in this assay and insulin stimulation of the CHO-IR cells produced more than a 5-fold increase in the kinase activity in the lysate. Pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 nearly eliminated insulin stimulation of GST-GM(1–240) phosphorylation. However, pretreatment of cells with either wortmannin to block PI 3-kinase or rapamycin to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin did not change insulin stimulation of kinase activity (Fig.1, upper panel). Coomassie staining showed that a comparable amount of the substrate GST-GM(1–240) was present in each reaction (Fig. 1, lower panel) and the same amount of lysate protein was added. These results showed that insulin stimulated the specific activity of a kinase(s) on the MAP kinase pathway that phosphorylated GST-GM(1–240). Phosphopeptide mapping was performed following 32P labeling of GST-GM(1–240) to determine the site(s) of phosphorylation. Wild type and mutated GST fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates in the presence of γ-[32P]ATP and an excess of PKI to block PKA activity. The GST fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, digested exhaustively by trypsin, and phosphopeptides were resolved by alkaline PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The identity of site 1 and site 2 phosphopeptides were deduced by comparing migration of phosphopeptides using the following collection of proteins: GST-GM(1–240), GST-GM(1–240)/S67A, GST-GM(1–240)/S67T, GST-GM(1–240)/S48A, and GST-GM(51–240) (Fig.2 A). Next, GST-GM(1–240) was phosphorylated by lysates from (i) control cells, (ii) cells treated with insulin, and (iii) cells treated with PD98059 plus insulin. Insulin treatment increased phosphorylation of site 1 and 2 in parallel, and pretreatment of cells with PD98059 significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both sites (Fig. 2 B). Site 2 is known as a substrate for PKA, but the kinases here were active in the presence of PKI to block PKA. Similar results were obtained using a skeletal muscle model, C2C12 myotubes differentiated in culture (Fig. 2 C). Lysates of control, insulin-treated, or EGF-treated C2C12 myotubes were used to phosphorylate GST-GM(1–240). Insulin treatment of C2C12 myotubes activated a kinase(s) that equally phosphorylated site 1 and site 2. EGF is a more effective activator of the MAP kinase pathway in muscle cells compared with insulin, and indeed EGF enhanced phosphorylation of site 1 and site 2 in GST-GM(1–240) even more than insulin (Fig. 2 C). These data showed that insulin or EGF-stimulated kinases that phosphorylated site 1 as well as site 2, and activation of MAP kinase was necessary for the stimulation. We found that phosphorylation of GM was catalyzed by RSK-2, a kinase activated by MAP kinase (Fig. 3). A specific RSK-2 antibody was used to immunodeplete endogenous RSK-2 from lysates prepared from insulin-stimulated CHO-IR cells (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting of the control and RSK-2-depleted lysates with the same antibody showed almost complete removal of RSK-2 from the lysate. RSK-2 depletion caused about 50% decrease in the phosphorylation of GST-GM(1–240). Moreover, we immunoprecipitated RSK-2 from lysates of control and insulin-treated CHO-IR cells. The specific activity toward GST-GM(1–240) in this assay was 8-fold higher in immunoprecipitates from insulin-treated cells (Fig.3 B). Phosphopeptide mapping showed that the RSK-2 recovered from either control cells or insulin-treated cells phosphorylated both sites in GM, but had preferential activity toward site 1, compared with site 2 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, using GST-GM(1–240) as substrate, RSK-2 was a prominent insulin-stimulated kinase in cell lysates. But, for insulin and EGF to stimulate phosphorylation of site 1 and site 2 to the same extent, there must have been another kinase(s) activated in concert with RSK-2. We phosphorylated GST-GM(1–240) with lysates from control or insulin-treated CHO-IR cells and recovered the GST fusion protein with glutathione-Sepharose to carry out a pull-down assay for binding of native PP-1(Fig. 4 A). Samples were split, and one-half was subjected to Western blotting for PP-1 and the other half used for assay of phosphatase activity. Immunoblotting showed that phosphorylation of GST-GM(1–240) by kinases from insulin-stimulated cells completely prevented the binding of PP-1 (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). Binding of PP-1 to GST-GM(1–240) was evident after incubation with MgATP plus lysates from unstimulated cells (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). The same amount of GST fusion protein was present in all the samples, based on Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4 A, lower panel) and the same amount of lysate protein was added. Consistent with this loss of PP-1 binding, as seen by immunoblotting, there was nearly a 10-fold decrease in PP-1 activity associated with GST-GM(1–240), measured with 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate (Fig. 4 B). We concluded that phosphorylation of GST-GM(1–240) by a kinase(s) from insulin-stimulated cells caused loss of PP-1 binding, probably due to phosphorylation of site 2 (Ser67). Our biochemical experiments suggested that insulin-activated kinases that phosphorylate sites 1 and 2 in the N-terminal domain of GM. To test this we expressed the full-length GM protein in CHO-IR cells. The cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi and stimulated with insulin, then the GM protein was recovered by immunoprecipitation. The same amount of GM protein was recovered (Fig. 5) and insulin increased its 32P labeling in two independent experiments by 67 and 89% (average 78%) (Fig. 5). Phosphopeptide mapping of the GM from unstimulated, control and from insulin-stimulated cells showed that sites 1 and 2 were phosphorylated in control cells and insulin increased the phosphorylation of both sites (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation of site 2 in GM in living cells should cause a loss of PP-1 association. To test this prediction, epitope-tagged full-length GM was transiently expressed in CHO-IR cells. The cells were treated with or without insulin and immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). Immunoblotting showed insulin tr"

The retinoid signal is transduced by two families of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid (RA)1receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ and their isoforms) and the retinoid x receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ) (10.Leid M.

RARs function as ligand-inducible transcription regulators by binding, together with an RXR partner, to specific cis-acting response elements (RAREs). RARs can be activated by both RA and its stereoisomer, 9-cis RA, whereas RXRs are activated only by 9-cis RA (14.Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). RXRs are also essential heterodimeric partners for a number of other nuclear receptor signaling pathways, including thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and certain orphan receptors (15.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 446-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar,16.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1996; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). Although 9-cis RA is not obligatory for transcriptional regulation via these pathways, some results suggest that RXR-specific ligands can elicit transcriptional activation in certain settings (e.g. Refs. 17.Shiohara M.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). RARs, like several other nuclear receptors, can function in a ligand-dependent manner to inhibit AP-1 activity, and it has been suggested that the affect of retinoids on the growth of transformed cells may occur through this trans-repression mechanism (21.Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 22.Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This inhibition is believed to be due, at least in part, to competition for limiting amounts of transcriptional co-factors, such as CBP and/or its homologue p300, common to both pathways (24.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Other mechanisms, such as inhibition of the expression of AP-1 family members or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), may also contribute to this cross-talk (26.Kaiser A. Brembeck F.H. von Marschall Z.

Cell. 1996; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 30.Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Decimo D. LeMeur M. Dierich A. Gorry P. Chambon P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

However, because of perinatal or embryonic lethality inherent to many of these RAR null backgrounds, there is a void in our knowledge of RAR function in a number of contexts, such as tumorigenesis. Exogenous retinoids can attenuate the effects of tumor promoters in the two stage skin carcinogenesis protocol (9.Lotan R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1991; 2: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar, 32.De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Among the retinoid receptors, normal epidermis expresses RARγ and RARαγ as well as RXRα and RXRβ, with RARγ and RXRα as the predominant heterodimer (33.Darwiche N. Celli G. Tennenbaum T. Glick A.B. Yuspa S.H. Deluca L.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2774-2782PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression prompted us to investigate the roles of RARα and RARγ in mediating the antitumorigenic effects of retinoids in epithelial keratinocytes. To this end, we established RARα, RARγ, and RARαγ null keratinocyte lines by transformation with a dominant-negative p53 expression vector and compared the properties of these various lines. Our results demonstrate that RARα and RARγ affect different aspects of retinoid response in these transformed cells, with RARγ being the primary mediator of RA-induced growth inhibition. However, other synthetic ligands affected proliferation independent of the RARs. RAR-dependent, but not -independent, growth inhibitory effects generally correlated with the attenuation of AP-1 transcriptional activity. Finally, the effects of RARα and RARγ on expression of certain keratinocyte markers suggests that each RAR may perform a subset of specific functions, which cannot be entirely fulfilled by other RARs in this cell type. The RAR null mice used in these studies have been described previously (35.Lufkin T. Lohnes D. Mark M. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gaub M.P. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7225-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar,36.Lohnes D. Kastner P. Dierich A. Mark M. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). RARα, RARγ, and RARαγ mutants were generated from the appropriate matings, whereas wild-type offspring were obtained from RARγ+/− intercrosses. Fetuses were procured by caesarean section at 18.5 days post coitus, and genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction as described (37.Iulianella A. Folberg A. Petkovich M. Lohnes D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocyte cultures were established from the epidermis by standard means (38.Greenhalgh D.A. Welty D.J. Strickland J.E. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1989; 2: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cultured in S-minimal essential medium with 10% chelex-treated fetal calf serum (calcium concentration of 0.5 mm), insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μm), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), cholera toxin (1.2 × 10−11m), adenine (24 μg/ml), and gentimycin (10 μg/ml). The next day, the cells were fed with medium further supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) and expanded for several days. Cultures were treated at 3–5 days post-plating with versene (0.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) to remove contaminating fibroblasts. The cells were subcultured at a 1:3 ratio at most 2 times prior to transformation. A single 10-cm plate of cells (∼2 × 106) of each genotype was harvested, and cells were resuspended in 800 μl of medium. The cells were then electroporated (250 mV, 960 microfarads in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette) with 25 μg of a linearized expression vector harboring a mutated p53 from the Friend erythroleukemia cell line CB7 (39.Johnson P. Chung S. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells were plated and routinely subcultured until past crisis. All experiments were performed using cultures between passage 16 and 26. Transformed keratinocytes were seeded into 96-well plates at a cell density of 500 cells/well and were treated the following day with vehicle (Me2SO) or the appropriate retinoid (RA, 9-cis RA, 4-HPR, or TTNPB). Medium was replenished every second day. Growth was assessed either in response to varying concentrations of retinoid at eight days post-plating or over time in response to 10−6m ligand. DNA content was assessed as a measure of cell growth using crystal violet staining as described previously (40.Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Relative dye binding was assessed by OD at 590 nm using a microplate reader. Results were expressed either asA 590 values or as growth relative to untreated controls and were derived from the mean (± S.D.) of four replicate wells. Transfections were performed using Lipofect ACE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well cluster plates at 4 × 104 cells/well. Transfections consisted of 0.5 μg of AP-1 reporter or appropriate control (41.Angel P. Karin M. Matrix. 1992; 1 (suppl.): 156-164Google Scholar), either alone or with expression vectors encoding c-Fos, c-Jun, CBP, p300, or RARs. Total DNA (5 μg; normalized with KS+) was mixed with 10 μl of lipid and added to 100 μl of serum-free S-minimal essential medium. The lipid/DNA mixture was then added to the cells in 1 ml of complete medium and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Medium was changed daily, and luciferase activity was assessed 48 h post-transfection. Results were corrected for protein concentration and are expressed as the mean (± S.D.) from three independent transfections. All experiments were repeated at least three times with comparable results. Cells were cultured in 10-cm plates in the presence of RA (10−6m) or vehicle for 48 h prior to harvest. Nuclear proteins were isolated from each cell line, and protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as before (42.Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chen J.Y. Chen Z.P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions containing ∼2 ng of probe (50,000 cpm) and 5 μg of nuclear protein were separated by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25 × Tris borate and EDTA. Specificity of binding was assessed by competition with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled RARE (5′-GGGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCGCA) or AP-1 (5′-GATCCGATGAGTCAGCCA) double-stranded oligonucleotides. For Western blot analysis, 40 μg of nuclear protein from the various cell lines were size fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as recommended by the supplier (Millipore). Proteins of interest were detected by incubation with the desired antibodies and detection with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA, isolated by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), were size fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel in MOPS buffer and transferred to a MAGNA nylon membrane (MSI). Fragments were isolated by restriction digestion of cDNAs followed by purification by Geneclean and used to generate probes by labeling with [α-32P]CTP by random priming with an oligo labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized according to the manufacturer's directions. Primary cultures of wild-type and RAR null keratinocytes showed no major differences in morphology, growth, or immortalization with dominant-negative p53. All lines grew well for at least 40 passages, suggesting that they were immortalized. None of the lines formed colonies in soft agar or were tumorigenic in nude mice. 2P. Goyette, C. F. Chen, W. Wang, F. Seguin, and D. Lohnes, unpublished observation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that, relative to wild-type extracts, disruption of RARα, and to a greater extent RARγ, decreased specific binding to an RARE, and association was completely abolished in extracts from RARαγ double null cultures (Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis confirmed the disruption of RARα and/or RARγ message in the appropriate cell line (data not shown). RARβ transcripts were undetectable in all lines by Northern blot or polymerase chain reaction approaches, consistent with previous studies indicating that this receptor type is not expressed in epidermal keratinocytes (33.Darwiche N. Celli G. Tennenbaum T. Glick A.B. Yuspa S.H. Deluca L.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2774-2782PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Chen L.C. Sly L. Deluca L.M. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These data suggest that there is no compensatory up-regulation of the remaining receptors in response to disruption of a given RAR. All transformed cell lines exhibited similar morphology and growth characteristics in the absence of retinoid treatment (Fig. 2). However, wild-type and RARα−/− cultures were growth inhibited by 10−6m RA (Fig. 2). In marked contrast, RARγ−/− cells were highly resistant and RARαγ−/− cultures were completely resistant to these effects. The growth arrest observed in wild-type and RARα null cultures was likely because of the inhibition of proliferation as opposed to apoptosis, as judged by thymidine incorporation and programmed cell death assays (data not shown). Dose-response experiments were performed to determine the relative sensitivity of the various cell lines to growth arrest by RA, 9-cis RA, or the synthetic retinoids TTNPB or 4-HPR. As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type keratinocytes exhibited a significant reduction in proliferation at 10−9m RA, with the maximal affect at 10−7-10−6m RA. RARα−/− keratinocytes exhibited a similar profile, although their response to RA was slightly more pronounced than wild-type cultures. Consistent with time-course analysis, RARγ−/− keratinocytes were only marginally inhibited by the highest dose of RA examined (10−6m), and RARαγ−/− keratinocytes were not significantly affected by RA at any dose tested. 9-cis RA is a ligand for both RARs and RXRs, and RXR agonists have been shown to induce effects on growth or differentiation in several model systems. Proliferation of both wild-type and RARα−/− cultures was inhibited by 9-cis RA, although higher concentrations were required compared with RA (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 9-cis RA had no significant outcome on the growth of either RARγ−/− or RARαγ−/−cultures. This finding suggests that RXR activation does not lead to growth arrest in this model system, at least in the absence of RARs. Whether RXR-specific signaling has other biological consequences remains to be investigated. The RAR agonist TTNPB was a very potent inhibitor of growth in wild-type or RARα−/− cultures with an effect evident at 10−11-10−10m (Fig. 3). However, TTNPB affected RARγ−/− and RARαγ−/−cultures only at the highest dose tested (10−6m). Whether this is indicative of effects on other pathways or is because of nonspecific cytotoxicity is unknown. The synthetic retinoid 4-HPR has been shown to be a potent inducer of growth arrest and/or apoptosis in several model systems (44.Decensi A. Formelli F. Torrisi R. Depalo G. Costa A. Oncol. Rep. 1994; 1: 817-824PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Oridate N. Lotan D. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 23 (suppl.): 80-86Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46.Wang T.T.Y. Phang J.M. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This compound was the least efficient of all those tested in inhibiting proliferation of wild-type and RARα−/− cultures (Fig.3). However, in marked contrast to the other retinoids, 4-HPR affected the growth of RARγ and RARαγ cultures at high doses, consistent with receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms of action for this compound (47.Clifford J.L. Menter D.G. Wang M. Lotan R. Lippman S.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 14-18PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Giandomenico V. Andreola F. de la Concepcion M.L.R. Collins S.J. De Luca L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22441-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). RARs can repress AP-1 transcriptional activity, and this mechanism of action has been proposed to underlie at least some of the antitumorigenic effects of retinoids (8.Hong W.K. Lippman S.M. Itri L.M. Karp D.D. Lee J.S. Byers R.M. Schantz S.P. Kramer A.M. Lotan R. Peters L.J. Dimery I.W. Brown B.W. Goepfert H. N. Eng. J.

In transient transfection assays, we found that RA (10−6m) inhibited AP-1 activity 8–10-fold in wild-type and RARα−/− cultures (Fig.4 A). AP-1 activity in RARγ−/− cultures was more modestly affected, typically exhibiting 10–30% reduction, whereas activity in RARαγ−/− cultures was not affected. The latter line was capable of response following re-introduction of either RARα or RARγ by transient transfection (Fig. 4 B). Thus, attenuation of AP-1 activity requires the presence of at least one functional RAR, although there does not appear to be discrimination between receptor types for this outcome. Dose-response studies revealed a close parallel between AP-1 activity and growth inhibition mediated by all four compounds in wild-type cultures (Fig. 5). However, growth arrest induced by 4-HPR in RARγ and RARαγ mutant lines never correlated with a reduction of AP-1 activity (data not shown). This finding underscores a unique and unknown mechanism of action for this retinoid in affecting proliferation. We next determined the effect of RA on the expression of AP-1 members in wild-type and RAR null lines. Both the basal mRNA levels and RA response of several of the AP-1 members varied across the different RAR null lines. In untreated cells, c-fosexpression was comparable across all four lines, although it was slightly reduced in RARαγ cells (Fig.6). RA strongly inhibited c-fos in both wild-type and RARα−/− lines but had no effect in RARγ or RARαγ cultures. This pattern was also observed at the protein level (Fig.7). In contrast, treatment affected c-jun expression only in RARα null cultures, although basal mRNA levels varied across the lines. However, c-Jun protein did not reflect its cognate mRNA levels and was reduced by RA treatment in wild-type, RARα−/−, and RARγ−/− cultures. Phosphorylated c-Jun (P-Jun) levels paralleled those of c-Jun, suggesting that variations in phosphorylation were because of alterations in total c-Jun levels, rather than affects on JNK activity.Figure 7Effects of RAR ablation and RA treatment on c-Fos, c-Jun, and P-jun protein levels. Nuclear protein extracts (40 μg) from cells treated for 48 h with carrier (−) or 10−6m RA (+) were used to prepare a Western blot. Specific antibodies used to probe the blots are denoted to the right, and the various cell lines are noted at thetop. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fra-1 expression was barely detectable in wild-type, RARα−/−, and RARαγ−/− lines but was elevated in RARγ−/− cultures; Western blot analysis was inconclusive, as the signal was too weak to be distinguished (data not shown). junB and junD expression did not vary significantly with the exception that junB levels were slightly reduced in the RARαγ−/− line (Fig. 6 and data not shown). A number of mechanisms have been suggested to underlie retinoid repression of AP-1 activity. These include inhibition of JNK activity, which is unlikely given the observation that P-Jun levels appear to change as a function of c-Jun levels. Alternatively, the observed down-regulation of c-Fos and/or c-Jun proteins might play a role, especially if either of them are limiting. A third mechanism involves competition for limiting ancillary factors common to both RAR and AP-1 transcriptional complexes, such as p300/CBP (24.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). We addressed the latter two possibilities by assessing the ability of exogenous CBP, p300, c-Fos, or c-Jun to negate the effects of RA treatment on AP-1 activity. CBP or p300 transfection in wild-type cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in AP-1 activity in the absence of RA (Fig. 8 A). Interestingly, p300 appeared to be more potent in affecting AP-1 activity, suggesting that it may be preferred over CBP in this context. Despite this increase in activity, expressing the data as fold inhibition indicated that both factors resulted in only a modest reversal of inhibition (Fig. 8 B). Overexpression of either c-Fos or c-Jun also resulted in an increase in basal AP-1 activity, again with only a marginal reduction in fold repression mediated by RA (Fig. 8). Although this rescue effect was more pronounced when both c-Jun and c-Fos were co-transfected, repression was not completely abolished (Fig. 8 B). These observations suggest that several mechanisms, including titration of limiting co-factors and inhibition of expression of AP-1 family members, act in concert in an RAR-dependent manner to attenuate AP-1 activity in these transformants. Northern blot analysis was performed to study the effect of receptor disruption on the expression levels of several genes implicated in keratinocyte growth and differentiation. The major integrin isoforms found in epidermis are integrin α2, α3, α6, β1, and β4. These are expressed in basal keratinocytes, and a decrease in integrin expression is generally correlated with differentiation and loss of proliferative potential (52.Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 53.Jones P.H. Harper S. Watt F. Cell. 1995; 80: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that, with the exception of the α3 isoform, all integrins were down-regulated by RA treatment in wild-type, RARα−/−, and RARγ−/− cultures in a manner that correlated with the effects of treatment on proliferation (Fig.9). Moreover, although integrin expression was not affected by RA treatment in RARαγ cultures, basal expression of integrins α2, α3, and β4 was substantially reduced. The seemingly contradictory observation that both RA excess and RAR loss can reduce expression of several integrins is perhaps indicative of an altered differentiation state in the double mutant line. Interestingly, integrin β1 expression decreased in untreated RARα−/− cells and was up-regulated in untreated RARγ mutant cultures. Keratin expression patterns reflect the differentiation states of the various epithelial strata (52.Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 53.Jones P.H. Harper S. Watt F. Cell. 1995; 80: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). K5/K14 are expressed in basal epidermal cells, whereas K1/K10 are associated with early differentiation steps and predominate in suprabasal cells. K6 and K19 are not expressed in normal epidermal keratinocytes but are often observed in situations of aberrant proliferation, such as psoriasis, wound healing, and propagation in tissue culture. With the exception of RARαγ null cultures, RA treatment repressed expression of K10 (Fig.9). This observation may be related to the fact that RA excess can inhibit keratinocyte differentiation (54.Stellmach V. Leask A. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4582-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 55.Kopan R. Traska G. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).

Hydroxylation is catalyzed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a specific enzyme, lysyl hydroxylase (LH). The absence of the known ER-specific retrieval motifs in its primary structure and its association with the ER membranes in vivo have suggested that the enzyme is localized in the ER via a novel retention/retrieval mechanism. We have identified here a 40-amino acid C-terminal peptide segment of LH that is able to convert cathepsin D, normally a soluble lysosomal protease, into a membrane-associated protein. The same segment also markedly slows down the transport of the reporter protein from the ER into post-ER compartments, as assessed by our pulse-chase experiments. The retardation efficiency mediated by this C-terminal peptide segment is comparable with that of the intact LH but lower than that of the KDEL receptor-based retrieval mechanism. Within this 40-amino acid segment, the first 25 amino acids appear to be the most crucial ones in terms of membrane association and ER localization, because the last 15 C-terminal amino acids did not possess substantial retardation activity alone. Our findings thus define a short peptide segment very close to the extreme C terminus of LH as the only necessary determinant both for its membrane association and localization in the ER.

Because of their abundance, ER-resident proteins must be efficiently segregated from their substrates by specific retention and/or retrieval signals in their primary structure. To date, only two systems, both based on a retrieval mechanism, have been characterized (for reviews see Refs. 1.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar and 2.Pelham H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 4: 585-591Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The KDEL tetrapeptide at the extreme C terminus is a common signal for a number of luminal chaperones (3.Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). The mechanism is based on the KDEL receptor (erd2), which binds the escaped proteins in the Golgi complex and returns them back to the ER (4.Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 162-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 5.Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Double lysine and presumably double arginine motifs located in the cytoplasmic domains of several ER membrane proteins also function as retrieval motifs (6.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7.Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. De-Molliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). It is known that dilysine motif-containing proteins bind the complex of cytosolic coat proteins (coatomer), COP I, and that this interaction mediates the retrieval of these proteins from the Golgi back to the ER (8.Schutze M.P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Sequences flanking the dilysine motif also contribute to the steady-state distribution of the proteins between the ER and the Golgi complex (6.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9.Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4, procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase) is an enzyme in the lumen of the ER that catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagenous sequences (for reviews see Refs. 10.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar and 11.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Unlike most other luminal proteins in the ER, lysyl hydroxylase (LH) does not contain either the KDEL sequence or any of its close homologues in its primary structure (12.Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that LH is associated with the ER membranesin vivo and that this interaction involves mainly electrostatic interactions (13.Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that membrane association is responsible for the localization of LH in the ER. If this were indeed the case, membrane association would represent a potentially novel mechanism by which luminal proteins may be localized in the ER. As a first step to define the mechanism that is responsible for the localization of LH in the ER, we have identified here a C-terminal peptide segment in LH that, when tagged into a reporter protein, is able to mediate both its membrane association and localization in the ER. Thus this peptide segment by itself appears to be sufficient for the correct localization of LH in the ER. Plasmids CDM and CDMK encoding human cathepsin D tagged either with a c-Myc-derived epitope (CDM) or c-Myc-SEKDEL (CDMK) were kindly provided by Dr. Hugh Pelham (Medical Research Council, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The CDMK plasmid was used for preparing reporter protein constructs that contained short sequences from LH. First, the SEKDEL sequence of the CDMK was replaced with the sequence encoding the last 40 C-terminal amino acids (CDLH40) of human lysyl hydroxylase isoform 1 (12.Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The region encoding the 40 C-terminal amino acids was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCGGAATTCGATCCGAGCCCCAAGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCTAGATTAGGGATCGACGAAGGAGA-3′. The amplified product was then cloned into the CDMK plasmid using EcoRI andXbaI restriction sites. The whole coding region of cathepsin D including the 40 amino acids from LH was further subcloned into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. CDLH15 construct containing only the last 15 C-terminal amino acids of LH was prepared accordingly, with the exception that the corresponding amino acid region was prepared by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCGACCACCAGGGGCACCCGCTA-CATCGAGTCTCCTTCGTCGATCC-3′ and 5′-CTAGGGATCGACGAAGGAGACTGCGATGTAGCGGGTGCCCCTGGTGGTCG-3′. The annealed fragment was cloned into the CDMK plasmid using EcoRI andXbaI restriction sites. For generating the plasmid that encodes the full-length lysyl hydroxylase tagged with a c-Myc epitope (LHMyc), the coding region of LH was first amplified, using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGCGGATCCATGCGGCCCCTGCTGCTA-3′ and 5′-AGGCCTGGCCAAGAATTCGGGATCGACGAA-3′, and then cloned into the PCDNA3 vector using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The c-Myc epitope was inserted by annealing complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-AATTCGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGTGAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATCACAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCG-3′, followed by cloning of the annealed fragment into the C terminus usingEcoRI and XbaI restriction sites to allow visualization with a monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Santa Cruz). All amplified sequences were confirmed by automatic sequencing using the ABI PRISM™ AmpliTaq FS dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were routinely plated on 35-mm Petri dishes 1 day before transfections. Transfections were made using FUGENE6™ transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 2 μg of plasmid DNA were used with 5 μl of transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein expression was routinely analyzed 40 h after transfection unless otherwise indicated. Cells were fixed with 4%para-formaldehyde. All subsequent incubations were carried out in the presence of saponin, as described earlier (14.Kellokumpu S. Neff L. Jämsä-Kellokumpu S. Kopito R. Baron R. Science. 1988; 242: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Expressed proteins were visualized using a monoclonal antibody, 9E10, followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stained specimens were examined using a Leitz CLSM confocal microscope (Leica Laser Technics, Heidelberg, Germany). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were first starved for 15 min in methionine/cysteine-free medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and then cultivated for 2 h in the presence of 200 μCi/ml of Pro-mix™ cell labeling reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled cells were washed briefly and then chased for 3 h in culture medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine, 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 10 mm NH4Cl. Pulse-chase experiments performed with the cells expressing LHMyc protein were done without NH4Cl in chase medium. The culture medium was collected, and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), containing aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA as protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations from the media and cell lysates were performed with agarose-conjugated 9E10 antibody. Beads were washed with RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli's sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and, after fixation, the gel was treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont) and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji RS). The cell lysate:medium ratios of the different reporter protein constructs were calculated after quantitation of the protein bands with a computer-assisted image analysis program (MCID-M4, Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Canada). Electron microscopy was performed as described earlier, with slight modifications (14.Kellokumpu S. Neff L. Jämsä-Kellokumpu S. Kopito R. Baron R. Science. 1988; 242: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15.Kellokumpu S. Suokas M. Risteli L. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2770-2777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated for 4 h with the calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) in serum-free medium and then fixed with 2% para-formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline). Fixed cells were processed for immunostaining with the 9E10 antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies using conventional procedures. Stained specimens were examined using a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 60 kV. Transfected cells were washed and scraped into TKM buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Cells were disrupted by brief sonication (four times for 5 s) on ice. Cell membranes and supernatants were separated by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). The membrane fraction was solubilized directly in Laemmli's sample buffer. Soluble proteins were recovered from the supernatant by TCA-precipitation and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of both fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with a monoclonal antibody against protein disulfide isomerase (16.Höyhtyä M. Myllylä R. Piuva J. Kivirikko K.I. Tryggvason K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 477-482Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Biosys, Compiegne, France). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reporter protein constructs used in this work are illustrated in Fig. 1. All constructs are based on the CDM plasmid that we used as a reference plasmid for measuring the normal transport rate of the reporter protein itself. The plasmid encodes human cathepsin D tagged with a 10-amino acid c-Myc epitope that is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (17.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Cathepsin D is a lysosomal aspartic protease that is routed to the lysosomes via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated pathway (18.Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the c-Myc epitope does not alter the intracellular routing of cathepsin D. The epitope appears, however, to be cleaved during the maturation of the cathepsin D in lysosomes (19.Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20.Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The CDMK plasmid differs from the CDM plasmid in that the SEKDEL sequence has been added to the C terminus of cathepsin D. Because the SEKDEL motif induces a well known and efficient retrieval of cathepsin D from the Golgi back to the ER (19.Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), this plasmid serves as a control plasmid for a known ER-specific retrieval mechanism. ER-specific retrieval signals are characteristically found at the C termini of proteins. Therefore, we also focused our first efforts to the C terminus of LH. We constructed two different cathepsin D constructs, one that contains the last 15 C-terminal amino acids (CDLH15) of LH and the other one that contains 25 additional amino acids toward the N terminus of LH (CDLH40), thus consisting altogether of the last 40 C-terminal amino acids of LH (Fig. 1). All protein constructs (CDM, CDMK, CDLH15, and CDLH40) were then transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the chimeric proteins were localized with the antibody 9E10. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that both the CDM (Fig. 2 A) and the CDLH15 (Fig.2 C) protein were localized predominantly in the perinuclear region, suggestive of their transient accumulation in the Golgi complex during their transport into-post Golgi compartments. Staining of the ER was also evident in some cells, as assessed by double staining with an antibody against protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast, CDMK (Fig.2 B) and CDLH40 (Fig. 2 D) protein constructs accumulated mainly in fine reticular structures throughout the cytoplasm. The staining pattern was typical of that of the ER, and this was confirmed by double staining with an anti-PDI antibody (data not shown). In a proportion of cells, the CDLH40 protein was also present in the Golgi region, in addition to the ER. To evaluate the retardation efficiency of the different protein constructs, we next performed pulse-chase analyses on transfected cells. We labeled the cells with radioactive methionine for 2 h and chased them for 3 h in the presence of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloride is known to dissipate endogenous targeting of cathepsin D to lysosomes and leads to its secretion into the medium (20.Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21.Braulke T. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 316-321PubMed Google Scholar). However, when cathepsin D is expressed as a recombinant protein, a nearly equal amount of the protein is secreted into the medium without the drug treatment. To quantitate the retardation efficiency of the different cathepsin D protein constructs, we measured their relative amounts in the medium and inside the cells by immunoprecipitation. When the cells were transfected with either CDM or CDLH15 plasmids (Fig. 3), about 80% of the immunoprecipitated proteins were found in the medium. These results indicated that both of these two chimeric proteins were efficiently secreted from the cells, as was also suggested by our immunofluorescence data (Fig. 2). In contrast, the KDEL-tagged cathepsin D (CDMK plasmid) was efficiently retained inside the cells, and only negligible amounts of the protein were found in the medium (Fig. 3). Similarly, the CDLH40 protein (Fig.3) was also mostly retained inside the transfected cells (in the ER; Fig. 2), and about 75% of the protein was generally recovered from the cells, the rest being found in the medium. Similar results were also obtained in the absence of ammonium chloride. Both of these protein constructs (CDMK and CDLH40) were also found to undergo autocatalysis under low pH conditions (22.Zhu Y. Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3846-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to bind to immobilized pepstatin A (an active site inhibitor for cathepsin D), indicating that their retardation was not due to their incorrect folding and association with the quality control machinery. Collectively, the above results show that the C terminus of LH indeed contains substantial retardation activity. This activity, however, does not seem to reside in the very extreme C terminus of LH, because the CDLH15 construct was efficiently secreted from the transfected cells. For comparative reasons, we next transfected cells with the LHMyc plasmid that encodes the full-length LH tagged with the C-terminal c-Myc epitope. Staining of transfected cells with the monoclonal 9E10 antibody revealed that the protein accumulated in the ER, as expected (Fig. 4 A). Western blotting of total cell lysates from transfected cells with the 9E10 antibody confirmed the expression of a double band with the expected size of both the nonglycosylated (80 kDa) and glycosylated (87 kDa) forms of LH (Fig. 4 B). The expressed full-length LH protein was also found to be enzymatically active, as judged by the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (23.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 4 C) performed as above (at 40 h after the transfection) showed that most (85–90%) of the expressed c-Myc-tagged LH protein was recovered from the cells. Nevertheless, 10–15% of the full-length LH was also secreted into the medium during the 3-h chase. Thus, the retardation efficiencies of the full-length LH protein and the CDLH40 protein constructs were rather comparable with each other. The CDLH40 construct thus appears to contain most of the information needed for the correct localization of the full-length LH in the ER. The retardation efficiency of the KDEL-tagged cathepsin D was clearly highest of the protein constructs tested. Previously, we have shown that the full-length LH is associated in vivowith the ER membranes (13.Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the 40-amino acid segment of the LH can also convert cathepsin D into a membrane-associated protein, we fractionated transfected cells into membrane and soluble fractions and followed the distribution of the chimeric proteins in the two fractions by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Both the full-length LH (LHMyc) and CDLH40 protein construct were found to co-sediment almost exclusively with the cellular membranes (Fig.5 A). Only negligible amounts of either protein were recovered from the membrane-depleted fractions. Thus, the 40-amino acid peptide segment of LH is, indeed, able to mediate the association of cathepsin D with the ER membranes. In contrast, endogenous PDI (a KDEL-containing protein) was recovered mainly in the soluble fractions (≈70%). The CDMK protein, which we used as an additional control protein, was equally distributed between the two fractions (Fig. 5 A). The reason for the membrane association of the CDMK protein is not known, but it may be due to its interaction with the KDEL receptor, which has been shown to redistribute into the ER when KDEL-containing proteins are overexpressed (5.Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We next processed transfected cells for immunoelectron microscopy after staining the chimeric protein with the 9E10 antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. To allow better visualization of the expressed protein within the ER lumen, a calcium ionophore, A23187, was used to induce the dilatation of the ER cisternae before fixation of the cells (15.Kellokumpu S. Suokas M. Risteli L. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2770-2777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (Fig. 5 B) confirmed the expected association of the CDLH40 protein with the ER membranes. Thus, both our biochemical and immunohistochemical data indicate that the 40-amino acid C-terminal segment alone is able to mediate the association of the reporter protein with the ER membranes. Among a vast number of the luminal proteins of the ER, LH protein has two unique features, namely the absence of known ER-specific retention/retrieval signals and its association in vivo with the ER membranes. In this report, we have localized a short peptide segment in the C terminus of LH that alone was sufficient both for the localization of cathepsin D in the ER and for its association with the ER membranes. The 40-amino acid C-terminal peptide segment of LH therefore appears to possess all the necessary information needed to localize endogenous LH in the ER membranes. The retardation did not result from aberrant folding of the reporter protein and its putative association with the ER quality control machinery, because the enzyme retained its autocatalytic properties in vitro and also bound to its active site inhibitor, pepstatin A. By using two overlapping constructs (CDLH40 and CDLH15) in which the last 15 C-terminal amino acids are common, we were able to show that only the CDLH40 protein was efficiently retained in the ER in the transfected cells, whereas the CDLH15 construct (cathepsin D tagged with the last 15 C-terminal amino acids) was readily transported out of the ER and could be recovered from the medium in pulse-chase experiments. The most crucial portion of this 40-amino acid segment both for the membrane association and ER localization appears therefore to be buried within the first 25 amino acids (amino acids 688–712 of LH1 isoform) of this 40-amino acid segment. This portion contains few positively charged amino acids, which may directly mediate the association of LH with the membranes (14.Kellokumpu S. Neff L. Jämsä-Kellokumpu S. Kopito R. Baron R. Science. 1988; 242: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). According to the sequence data, this region and the whole 40-amino acid segment are also nearly identical between different species and also very homologous (≈90%) to recently cloned other two human and mouse LH isoforms (24.Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.-M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25.Valtavaara M. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12881-12886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26.Passoja K. Rautavuoma K. Ala-Kokko L. Kosonen T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27.Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Kerkelä E. Pospiech H. Myllylä R. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conservation of this C-terminal segment suggests that other LH isoforms may use the same region for their localization in the ER. Our data, however, do not exclude the possibility that the last 15 amino acids may also contribute to the retardation efficiency of the CDLH40 construct, although alone (CDLH15) they did not have substantial retardation activity. Our findings, showing that membrane association and ER localization are strictly coupled phenomena, provide the first direct evidence for the view (13.Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the membrane association is responsible for the localization of the enzyme in the ER. Membrane association therefore raises important questions about the identity of the membrane counterpart(s) with which LH and the identified peptide segment associates in vivo. One possibility is that LH could associate with the ER membranes by interacting directly with membrane phospholipids. For example, a number of cytoplasmic proteins that possess plekstrin homology domains associate with the membranes by binding to phospatidylinositol phosphates (28.Shaw G. BioEssays. 1996; 1: 35-46Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, according to sequence analyses (SMART version 3.0 or E-MOTIF), no such a motif is present in the full-length LH protein sequence or in the 40-amino acid C-terminal segment. Another possibility for the membrane association of LH is a carbohydrate-mediated retention of incompletely folded proteins with the quality control machinery (29.Parodi A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the full-length LH isN-glycosylated, the C-terminal peptide segment does not contain any potential N-linked glycosylation sites, suggesting that its membrane association does not involve asparagine-linked carbohydrate structures. The most likely possibility, therefore, is that LH associates with the ER membranes via specific protein-protein interactions. This is also supported by our preliminary molecular sizing experiments, in which we have found that about half of the full-length, c-Myc-tagged LH is solubilized from the cells as a high molecular weight complex. The large size of the complex excludes putative interactions with the ER membrane phospholipids. In this respect, it is interesting to note that prolyl-4-hydroxylase, a heterotetrameric (α2β2) collagen processing enzyme, is localized in the ER via its β-subunit, protein disulfide isomerase (30.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which is a well known KDEL-containing protein. However, because this protein complex is not membrane-associated (Fig. 5 and Ref. 13.Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a different kind of interaction appears to be responsible for the membrane association and localization of LH in the ER. Other known proteins, which associate with the ER membranes, includee.g. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (31.Soriano S. Thomas S. High S. Griffiths G. D'Santos C. Cullen P. Banting G.

Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The association of the former also likely involves specific protein-protein interactions (31.Soriano S. Thomas S. High S. Griffiths G. D'Santos C. Cullen P. Banting G. Biochem J. 1997; 324: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas the association type of the latter is not known. Both proteins, however, are found on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membranes. The retardation efficiency mediated by the C-terminal peptide segment (CDLH40) and of the full-length LH itself (LHMyc) were shown to be lower than that of the KDEL-containing CDMK construct under similar experimental conditions. Because both the LHMyc and the CDLH40 protein constructs were secreted from the cells to some extent (10–15% and 20–25%, respectively), the retention machinery responsible for the localization of the LH protein constructs seems to be more easily saturable than that of the KDEL-receptor mediated retrieval mechanism. This suggestion is consistent with the known expression levels of the endogenous proteins in vivo. The KDEL-containing chaperones and folding enzymes are generally known as the most abundant proteins in the ER lumen, whereas LH is expressed at a much lower level in tissues and cells studied thus far (33.Heikkinen J. Hautala T. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1994; 24: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no need for a highly efficient retention/retrieval system for LH in the ER lumen. The suggestion is also supported by the observed differences in the amount of the secreted, but not intracellular, CDLH40 protein with transfection time, being 15, 25, and 50% at 24, 40, and 48 h after the transfection, respectively. 2M. Suokas, R. Myllylä, and S. Kellokumpu, unpublished observations. The difference in the rate of secretion between the two LH constructs (LHMyc and CDLH40) may also result from their differential expression levels in the transfected cells. For some unknown reason, the LHMyc construct appears to be expressed consistently at lower levels in COS-7 cells during transient transfections. The difference in the secretion could also be due to small conformational differences that may exist within the C-terminal peptide segment between the Myc-tagged full-length LH and the CDLH40 construct. We did not attempt to increase the retardation efficiency of the CDLH40 protein, e.g. by extending the length of the C-terminal segment toward the N terminus of LH because of the presence of nearby cysteine residues, which have been shown to act as signals for the quality control machinery (20.Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34.Isidoro C. Maggioni C. Demoz M. Pizzagalli A. Fra A.M. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26138-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a conclusion, we report here the identification of a 40-amino acid peptide segment in the C terminus of LH that alone is sufficient to convert otherwise a soluble lysosomal protein, cathepsin D, into an ER membrane-associated protein. Within this peptide segment, the first 25 amino acids appeared to be the most crucial ones in terms of ER localization. The retardation efficiency mediated by this 40-amino acid segment was comparable with that of the c-Myc-tagged full-length LH, especially if their expression levels in the transfected cells are taken into account. The 40-amino acid segment appears therefore to contain all the necessary information for the correct localization of the endogenous LH in the ER as well. The maximal retardation efficiencies of the LH protein constructs were, however, lower than that of the KDEL-receptor mediated retrieval mechanism. Thus, both the steady-state membrane association and low capacity/saturability appear to be the hallmarks of this novel type of retention/retrieval mechanism. We thank Dr. Hugh R. Pelham for providing the basic cathepsin D constructs and Dr. Raija Sormunen for help with the electron microscopy.

Spector L. Lipmann F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 819-820Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). There are four major classes or forms of quaternary structures known for aspartate transcarbamoylases. In prokaryotes, aspartate transcarbamoylase is known to exist in three classes. The simplest is class C, a homotrimer of catalytic chains each with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa. The aspartate transcarbamoylase fromBacillus subtilis, which lacks both homotropic and heterotropic properties, is an example of this class (2.Brabson J.S. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8664-8669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second form of aspartate transcarbamoylase, class A, is a dodecamer of six 34-kDa and six 45-kDa polypeptides. Catalytic and regulatory functions of this enzyme are both located on the 34-kDa polypeptides, whereas the function of the 45-kDa polypeptides is unknown. There are several species of Pseudomonas that produce this type of aspartate transcarbamoylase, including Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.Adair L.B. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2308-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The third and best characterized class of aspartate transcarbamoylase is class B, comprised of two trimeric catalytic subunits of 34-kDa polypeptides and three dimeric regulatory subunits of 17-kDa polypeptides. The class B form is an allosteric enzyme, exhibiting both homotropic and heterotropic interactions. Escherichia coli,Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia herbicola, Serratia marcescens, and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae produce class B aspartate transcarbamoylase (5.Wild J.R. Wales M.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 93-118Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, aspartate transcarbamoylase often is part of a multienzyme complex, such as those found in yeast (6.Hervé G. Nagy M. Le Gouar M. Penverne B. Ladjimi M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and hamster (7.Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Scully J.L. Grayson D.R. Ringer A.G. Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The DNA sequence of the unicellular thermophilic archaeabacteriumMethanococcus jannaschii revealed genes (pyrB andpyrI) 1The names of the two genes are those fromE. coli. that are homologous to a class B aspartate transcarbamoylase (8.Bult C.J.

In theE. coli genome, the pyrB and pyrIgenes are separated by only 12 base pairs, whereas in the M. jannaschii genome the two homologous genes are separated by over 200,000 base pairs. Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment of the E. coli and M. jannaschii pyrB and pyrI genes. The PyrB gene product exhibits 47% identity and 67% similarity, and the PyrI gene product exhibits 35% identity and 52% similarity, suggesting that the PyrB and PyrI gene products of the two species have similar tertiary structures. TheM. jannaschii differs from other recently characterized archaeabacteria such as Pyrococcus abyssi (9.Purcarea C. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andSulfolobus acidocaldarius (10.Durbecq V. Thia-Toong T.L. Charliet D. Villeret V. Roovers M. Wattiez R. Legrain C. Gransdorff N. Eur.

In order to study the M. jannaschii aspartate transcarbamoylase, the M. jannaschii pyrB(Mj-pyrB)2 andM. jannaschii pyrI (Mj-pyrI) genes were inserted into an expression system that yielded substantial amounts of both gene products. A protein purification scheme was developed for the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products, and the quaternary structure of the M. jannaschii aspartate transcarbamoylase found in vivowas analyzed and kinetically characterized. Agarose, ATP, CTP, l-aspartate,N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate, 2-mercaptoethanol, isopropyl-β-thiogalactosidase, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sucrose, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I, and uracil were obtained from Sigma.

Pefabloc SC, pepstatin, and leupeptin were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Carbamoyl phosphate dilithium salt, obtained from Sigma, was purified before use by precipitation from 50% (v/v) ethanol and was stored desiccated at −20 °C (11.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol.

The E. coli strains 627239 and 623859 harboring plasmids AMJPK84 and AMJAE67, respectively, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The plasmid pET23a was obtained from Novagen, Inc., and the plasmid pSJS1240 was provided by S. Sandler. DNA encoding the Mj-pyrB andMj-pyrI genes were derived from plasmids AMJPK84 and AMJAE67, respectively (8.Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. Fitzgerald L.M.

Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Each plasmid was incubated withEcoRI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, and the corresponding EcoRI-BamHI DNA fragments containing the Mj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by isolation from the gel with glass beads. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the Mj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI gene fragments by PCR (12.Saiki R.H. Gelgand D. Stoffel S. Scharf S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 230: 487-491Crossref Scopus (13496) Google Scholar). One set of primers introduced a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5′ initiation codon and the other a unique SacI restriction site proximal to the 3′ end of the termination codon. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by isolation of the appropriate fragment from the gel with glass beads. Each fragment was separately mixed with linear p-GEM-T and treated with T4 DNA ligase for 16 h at 4 °C. After selection, plasmids pGEM*pyrB and pGEM*pyrI harboring theMj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes, respectively, were obtained. In order to express the recombinant genes under the control of theE. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase pyrBIpromoter (13.Baker D.P. Aucoin J.M. Williams M.K. DeMello L.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the Mj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes were transferred into plasmid pEK164 (14.Dembowski N.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In order to construct these plasmids, pGEM*pyrB, pGEM*pyrI, and pEK164 were digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI and SacI. The DNA fragments containing the Mj-pyrB gene, Mj-pyrIgene, and pEK164 vector were isolated after agarose gel electrophoresis using glass beads. The isolated Mj-pyrB andMj-pyrI gene fragments were individually mixed with the isolated vector fragment and treated with DNA ligase for 16 h at 4 °C. The resulting plasmids, pEK400 and pEK401, were confirmed by restriction analysis. DNA sequence analysis was then used to confirm that the PCR-amplified M. jannaschii pyrB andpyrI genes had exactly the same sequence as reported (8.Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. Fitzgerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M.

Klenk H.-P. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Woese C.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The Mj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes were also inserted into the expression vector pET23a, so an alternate expression system, employing the T7 promoter (15.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Duberndorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), could be tested. Plasmids pEK400, pEK401, and pET23a were digested with NdeI andSacI endonucleases to remove the Mj-pyrB andMj-pyrI genes. These DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, isolated using glass beads, and then were individually mixed with NdeI- and SacI-digested pET23a. The mixtures were then treated with T4 DNA ligase for 16 h at 4 °C. The resulting plasmids, pEK406 and pEK407, contained theM. jannaschii pyrB and pyrI genes respectively, under control of the T7 promoter. Protein expression was performed with the plasmid/strain combination pEK406/EK1594 and pEK407/EK1594 for the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products, respectively. EK1594 is a version of the E. coliaspartate transcarbamoylase expression strain EK1104 (16.Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has an inducible gene for T7 polymerase on the chromosome along with a deletion in the pyrBI region of the chromosome (17.Sakash J.B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the plasmid pSJS1240 was co-transformed into these plasmid/strain combinations to test the importance of low copy number tRNAs for high level expression of these proteins (18.Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S.-H. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Typically, a 50-ml overnight culture of M9 media (19.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 68Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 μg/ml spectinomycin (when the pSJS1240 plasmid was used) was inoculated with the appropriate plasmid/strain combination and grown overnight at 37 °C. A 2% inoculum was used to seed each of the four 4-liter flasks containing 2 liters of M9 media supplemented as indicated above (8 liters total). The cells were grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm to anA 560 of 0.6 (normally 2.5 h after inoculation). Protein expression was then induced by the addition of solid isopropyl-β-thiogalactosidase to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The cell culture was grown for 4 additional h before harvesting. The cell culture was centrifuged at 4500 × g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 64 ml of ice-cold 0.1m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.2. After sonication to lyse the cells, the mixture was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 20 min. In order to increase protein yield, the cell pellet was resuspended in 32 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.2, and again centrifuged as described above. The cell-free supernatant and the supernatant from the pellet wash were combined and brought to 30% saturation of ammonium sulfate. Aliquots of 5 ml were transferred into 18 × 150-mm test tubes and placed in a metal rack. This rack was then immersed in a 90 °C water bath and heated for 15 min after the mixture reached 90 °C (about 3 min). During the incubation at 90 °C, the tubes were gently shaken at 5-min intervals. This procedure was used to ensure that each aliquot reached 90 °C rapidly. After heating, the aliquots were recombined and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was retained and dialyzed 2 times in 4 liters of 0.05m Tris acetate buffer, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3. The dialyzed supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange column (1.8 × 18 cm) pre-equilibrated with 300 ml of column buffer, 0.05 m Tris acetate, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3. The protein was eluted from the column using 300 ml of column buffer followed by a 600-ml linear gradient of column buffer to column buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The column fractions containing the Mj-PyrB gene product, as determined byA 280 measurements and by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed into a buffer solution of 40 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.3 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0. The final purification step involved the use of hydrophobic interaction chromatography employing a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 28 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with a buffer solution of 40 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.3 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0. The protein was loaded onto the column and washed with the same buffer solution to remove any unbound proteins. The protein was then eluted using a 110-ml linear gradient of 40 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.3 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, to 40 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0. Fractions containing greater than 98% pure protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated. A 2-liter cell culture was centrifuged at 4,500 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 16 ml of ice-cold 0.1m Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm zinc acetate buffer, pH 9.2. After sonication to lyse the cells, the mixture was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was brought to 65% saturation of ammonium sulfate, after which it was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was dissolved and dialyzed 2 times in 4 liters of 40 mmKH2PO4, 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmzinc acetate buffer, pH 7.0. The dialyzed supernatant was again brought to 65% saturation of ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was dissolved and dialyzed 2 times in 4 liters of 0.05 m Tris acetate, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3. The dialyzed supernatant was then loaded onto a Source-Q anion exchange column (1 × 6.5 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with a buffer solution of 0.05 m Tris acetate, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3. The column was then eluted with the same buffer solution to remove any unbound proteins. The Mj-PyrI gene product was then eluted using a 32.5-ml linear gradient of 0.05m Tris acetate, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3, to 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05m Tris acetate, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3. Fractions containing greater than 98% pure protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled. The molecular weights of the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products were determined by gel filtration using a set of molecular weight standards. A Bio-Prep SE-1000/17 column (0.8 × 30 cm) was used for the Mj-PyrB gene product and a Bio-Prep SE-100/17 column (0.8 × 30 cm) was used for the Mj-PyrI gene product. The SE-1000/17 column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3 buffer, and the same buffer plus 0.1 mm zinc acetate was used for the Mj-PyrI gene product. Gel filtration molecular weight standards were injected, and the proteins were eluted using the appropriate buffer. Once the column was re-equilibrated with the appropriate column buffer, either 200 μl of a 8 mg/ml solution containing pure Mj-PyrB gene product or 200 μl of a 4 mg/ml solution containing partially purified Mj-PyrI gene product was injected onto the column and eluted with the appropriate column buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution of the proteins was monitored by A 280, by SDS-PAGE (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and by nondenaturing PAGE (21.Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar, 22.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar). The molecular weight of M. jannaschii aspartate transcarbamoylase was determined using sucrose density gradient sedimentation of a M. jannaschii cell-free extract. Approximately 1–2 g of M. jannaschii cells, kindly provided by Prof. Mary Roberts, Boston College, were resuspended in 2 ml of 0.1m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm EDTA containing 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Pefabloc SC, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and then sonicated to lyse the cells. The resulting highly viscous solution was treated by slowly adding bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I (10 μg/ml in 10 mm MgCl2) while stirring for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 40 min, the supernatant was concentrated in an Amicon Centricon YM-10. This crude cell extract was layered on top of a 4-ml 6–30% preformed sucrose gradient in 0.05m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. A standard was also prepared by layering 10 μl of 1 mg/ml purified E. coli catalytic subunit and 10 μl of 1 mg/ml purified E. coli holoenzyme on top of another identical sucrose gradient. By using a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor, these two tubes were spun at 80,000 × g for 14 h in a Beckman L-70 ultracentrifuge. Immediately after centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated using a Brandel model BR-184-1 fractionator. Fractions of 100 μl were collected and were assayed for aspartate transcarbamoylase activity using the colorimetric assay at 37 °C. The thermal stability of the M. jannaschii and E. coli PyrB gene products were compared. Samples of the M. jannaschii and E. coli PyrB gene products at 0.5 mg/ml were heated at 75 °C as a function of time. At each time point an aliquot was rapidly chilled and stored at 4 °C followed by determination of enzymatic activity. The concentrations of the E. coli wild-type holoenzyme, catalytic subunit, and regulatory subunit were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 0.59, 0.72, and 0.32 cm2 mg−1, respectively (23.Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products were determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye-binding assay (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was measured by the colorimetric method (25.Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or by the pH-stat method (26.Wu C.W. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using a Radiometer-Copenhagen PHM290 titrator and an ABU901 autoburette. Aspartate saturation curves were performed in duplicate at a highly saturating concentration of carbamoyl phosphate, and data points shown in the figures are the average values. Colorimetric assays as a function of temperature were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, taking into account the large ΔpH/°C dependence of Tris buffer. At temperatures of 45 °C and higher, assays were carried out for short times (3–5 min) due to the thermal instability of carbamoyl phosphate as well as the accelerated rate of the uncatalyzed reaction. Because of the high rate of the uncatalyzed reaction and the thermal instability of carbamoyl phosphate (t 12 = 3.5 min at 55 °C), accurate kinetic data could not be obtained at temperatures greater than 55 °C. Data analysis of the steady-state kinetics was carried out as described previously (27.Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The program Swiss-Model (28.Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar) was used to generate the homology models of the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products using the catalytic and regulatory chains of the E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase as the initial model. The program employs ProModII (30.Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) to generate the models and Gromos96 to perform the energy minimization. The amino acid sequences of the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products were obtained from GenBankTM, accession numbers Q58976 andQ58801, respectively. The homology modeling template was the Protein Data Bank code 1D09, which is the recent 2.1-Å structure of aspartate transcarbamoylase in the presence of the bisubstrate analogN-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate (31.Jin L. Stec B. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The A and B chains of code 1D09 were used to model the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products, respectively. The initial model created using the “First Approach” mode was examined using the Swiss-Protein Data Bank Viewer, and adjustments were made to the sequence alignment to improve the alignment of residues known to be functionally important in the corresponding E. coli protein. The model was then resubmitted to Swiss-Model using the “Optimize” mode. Final analysis of the models was performed in QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Two separate approaches were taken in order to express the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products. The first was to place the M. jannaschii genes under the control of the E. coli pyrBI promoter in an approach similar to that used to express the B. subtilis aspartate transcarbamoylase in E. coli (13.Baker D.P. Aucoin J.M. Williams M.K. DeMello L.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The second was to place the M. jannaschiigenes under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter using the pET plasmid system of Studier et al. (15.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Duberndorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding the Mj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes were isolated from plasmids AMJPK84 and AMJAE67, respectively (8.Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A.

Woese C.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Since both of the expression systems require an NdeI site at the initiation fMet codon, the required NdeI site as well as an additional restriction site (SacI) after the 3′ end of the coding region were introduced using PCR (12.Saiki R.H. Gelgand D. Stoffel S. Scharf S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 230: 487-491Crossref Scopus (13496) Google Scholar). The NdeI and SacI sites allowed easy cloning of theMj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes into both thepyrBI and pET expression systems (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In order to test the levels of protein expression of the Mj-PyrB and Mj-PyrI gene products under the control of the pyrBI promoter, the appropriate plasmids (pEK400 and pEK401) were transformed into the E. coli overproduction strain EK1104 (16.Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system, which depends upon the derepression of the genes of the pyrimidine pathway, did not produce satisfactory levels of the Mj-PyrI and Mj-PyrB gene products. The plasmids pEK406 and pEK407 containing theMj-pyrB and Mj-pyrI genes inserted into pET23a were transformed into EK1594 (17.Sakash J.B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This E. coli strain has a chromosomal deletion of the pyrB and pyrI genes and a copy of the T7 DNA polymerase gene inserted into the chromosome under the control of the inducible lac promoter. As seen in Fig. 2, the expression of the Mj-PyrB gene product was poor in this system, whereas substantial amounts of the Mj-PyrI gene product were produced, amounting to approximately 15% of the total cellular protein. Kim et al. (18.Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S.-H. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of archaeal proteins in E. coliis often poor due to differences in codon usage between archaea andE. coli. For example, the codons ATA, AGA, and AGG are found in high abundance in archaeal genes but are rare in E. coligenes. By enhancing the levels of certain low abundance tRNAs (argU, which codes for ATA, and ileX, which codes for AGA and AGG) in E. coli, the level of archaeal protein expression can be enhanced (18.Kim R.

The results are consistent with the domain organization of the Flp protein and with the general features of the protein-DNA interactions revealed by the crystal structures of the recombination intermediates formed by Cre, the Flp-related recombinase. The similarity in the organization of the Flp and Cre target sites and in their recognition by the respective recombinases implies that the overall DNA-protein geometry during strand cleavage in the two systems must also be similar. Within the functional recombinase dimer, it is the interaction between two recombinase monomers bound on either side of the strand exchange region (or spacer) that provides the allosteric activation of a single active site. Whereas Cre utilizes the cleavage nucleophile (the active site tyrosine) in cis, Flp utilizes it in trans (one monomer donating the tyrosine to its partner). By using synthetic Cre and Flp DNA substrates that are geometrically restricted in similar ways, we have mapped the positioning of the active and inactive tyrosine residues during cis and trans cleavage events. We find that, for a fixed substrate geometry, Flp and Cre cleave the labile phosphodiester bond at the same spacer end, not at opposite ends. Our results provide a model that accommodates local heterogeneities in peptide orientations in the two systems while preserving the global functional architecture of the reaction complex.

Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,2.Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Members of this family carry out a wide range of biological functions but utilize a common biochemical mechanism to accomplish them (3.Nash H.A. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2363-2376Google Scholar). They mediate the breakage and joining between two double helical DNA partners harboring their respective target sequences (4.Sadowski P.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5.Landy A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1993; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6.Lilley D.M. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Four recombinase monomers participate in the reaction to complete two sequential pairs of strand cleavage and joining steps. A Holliday junction is therefore a central intermediate in recombination.The Integrase family members follow the type IB topoisomerase chemistry to break the DNA strands, forming a 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage and a 5′-hydroxyl group at the site of the strand nick. A number of biochemical observations and recent structural data strongly suggest that the active site tyrosine nucleophile effects strand cleavage with catalytic assistance from a conserved triad consisting of two arginines and one histidine (the RHR triad) (7.Chen J.-W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5178-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two other conserved family residues also contribute to catalysis as follows: a lysine (or arginine) and a histidine (or tryptophan). As demonstrated for the Flp recombinase and as suggested by the Cre-DNA crystal structure (10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar,16.Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 256: 720-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the catalytically relevant interactions for one strand cleavage event are mediated by two monomers of the recombinase, bound across from each other on either side of the strand exchange region (or spacer). However, the utilization of the cleavage nucleophile is not uniform within the family (1.Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2.Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A.

Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 121-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For example, the Flp dimer establishes a shared active site, the RHR triad from one monomer and the tyrosine from the second monomer contributing to its functionality (Fig. 1 A, left). As a result, Flp cleaves DNA in the trans mode, the tyrosine from the monomer bound on the left arm reaching across the spacer to attack the scissile phosphodiester at the right or vice versa (7.Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16.Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23203-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By contrast, within the Cre dimer, the triad and the tyrosine contributions to an active site are made by only one monomer (Fig.1 A, right; 10). Hence, Cre cleaves DNA in the cismode, the tyrosine of the left or the right bound monomer attacking the adjacent labile phosphodiester at the left or the right spacer end, respectively. Regardless of the cleavage mode, however, neither the Flp nor the Cre dimer can assemble two active sites at the same time. This was revealed by solution experiments with Flp (22.Lee J. Tonozuka T. Jayaram M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and is suggested by the crystal structure of the cleaved Cre-DNA complex (10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This active site exclusion is consistent with the two-step strand exchange mechanism that both proteins follow.In the present study, we first probed the changes in protease susceptibility of Flp upon binding to its DNA substrate. The derived Flp footprints are consistent with the features of DNA-protein interactions observed in the Cre-DNA crystal structures (9.Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Given that the DNA-protein associations are similar for the transcleaving Flp and the cis cleaving Cre systems, we wished to decipher which of the two monomers that constitute an active dimer serves as the source of the catalytic tyrosine during the two cleavage modes. The two possible alternatives are diagrammed in Fig.1 B. The cis versus transdistinction may be represented by I and II or by I and III. In the former case, equivalent recombinase monomers (shown ingreen) provide the tyrosine, yielding cleavage at opposite ends of the spacer. In the latter case, non-equivalent monomers (green during cis cleavage and purpleduring trans cleavage) provide the tyrosine, causing cleavage to occur at the same end of the spacer. In order to maintain the same geometry of the DNA-protein complex for the cis and the trans cleavage modes (as is the case in Fig.1 B), our assays utilized synthetic DNA substrates that were constrained in their configuration by strand-specific nucleotide bulges. Our results demonstrate that it is the I/III pair in Fig.1 B (and not the I/II pair) that fits the cleavage modes of Cre and Flp. The peptide orientations that would accommodate this mechanism support the intersubunit interactions proposed by Gopaul and Van Duyne (23.Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for a trans cleaving recombinase tetramer.DISCUSSIONFootprinting methods (36.Baichoo N. Heyduk T.

A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), despite their relatively low resolution compared with x-ray crystallography or NMR analysis, provide useful information on structure-function relationships in proteins. Footprint analysis of the DNA-bound Flp has revealed several protected peptide regions and one hypersensitive region. The deduced footprints shed light on peptide segments that contact DNA (or are in proximity to DNA) or undergo conformational changes as a result of DNA binding. Some contributions to the footprints are likely from interactions between Flp monomers that are bound to DNA. Our interpretations assume that the absence or reduction of a proteolytic band is the result of protection from protease and not due to rapid degradation of the primary cleavage product. The latter possibility is extremely unlikely under the limiting protease amounts used in our assays. Furthermore, in a time course assay from 5 to 30 min, no evidence for such degradation was seen. 3G. Tribble, Y.-T. Ahn, J. Lee, T. Dandekar, and M. Jayaram, unpublished data. The potential significance of the observed footprints (Fig.9) may be assessed in the context of the known DNA-binding properties of Flp (28.Chen J.W. Evans B.R. Yang S.H. Teplow D.B. Jayaram M. Proc.

Sakamoto S. Imura T. Toh-e A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5537-5545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hallmark catalytic triad of the Int family (Arg-191, His-305, and Arg-308 in Flp; Refs. 42.Abremski K.E. Hoess R.H.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) are located within the following boxes: Arg-191 in Box I (spanning positions 185–203; Fig. 9 A) and His-305 and Arg-308 in Box II (spanning positions 295–313; Fig. 9 A). The Box I (also called Box A) and Box II homologies extend to the prokaryotic members of the Int family as well (1.Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2.Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, Box II has been expanded in these protein alignments and includes the invariant active site tyrosine as well. Note that Box II is a composite of the B and C boxes in the classification of Esposito and Scocca (1.Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The PIV Flp footprint includes Tyr-343, the active site nucleophile for the strand cleavage reaction.The rather extended series of footprints covering the carboxyl-terminal domain of Flp is consistent with the observation that, in the crystal structure (10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) of Cre, DNA contacts essentially span the entire carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. Furthermore, the predicted secondary structural features of the Flp carboxyl-terminal domain align reasonably well with the corresponding domain of Cre (Fig.9 A). The similarity breaks down toward the extreme carboxyl terminus, where Flp has a relatively long peptide tail compared with Cre.The PI and PII protections and the cleavage enhancement adjacent to PIII (see Fig. 4 C) showed subtle differences depending on the type of DNA substrate to which Flp was bound. The protections were more prominent in the S2 substrate (full-site) compared with S1 (half-site) or HS4 (Holliday junction). The cleavage enhancement, on the other hand, was less conspicuous in HS4 compared with S1 or S2. These variations in the footprint profiles likely reflect differences in DNA-protein or protein-protein interactions and conformational dynamics within the recombination complexes at individual stages of the reaction.Amino-terminal Footprints of FlpThe amino-terminal domain of Flp contains two footprints, p′0 and PI, located near the opposite ends of this domain (Fig. 4 C and Fig. 9 B). The PI footprint would correspond to the DNA contact points observed in the D and E helices and the interhelical segment between E and F helices of the Cre protein (10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In the Cre structure, the amino-terminal helices B and D are seen to contact the DNA major groove. The Flp results do not reveal an obvious footprint that can be interpreted as equivalent to the B helix-DNA interaction of Cre. The p′0 protection in Flp (proximal to the carboxyl-terminal side of helix A; Fig. 9 B) may represent the corresponding, if somewhat altered, DNA contact by Flp. The secondary structural correspondence between the amino-terminal domains of Flp and Cre are quite poor and are therefore not aligned in Fig. 9. We suspect that DNA recognition by the amino-terminal domains of Flp and Cre may be less well conserved than that of their carboxyl-terminal domains.Substrate Recognition by the Int Family Recombinases, DNA Binding by C-shaped Protein ClampsThe protease footprinting results obtained for Flp, together with the available structural and biochemical information for the Int family members, suggest a reasonable global conformation for the Flp-DNA complex. In Fig.9 B, the Flp protein is shown to form a C-clamp around the DNA in a manner analogous to Cre (10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). A similar mode of DNA binding is accommodated by the Flp model structure of Saxena et al. (30.Saxena P. Whang I. Voziyanov Y. Harkey C. Argos P. Jayaram M. Dandekar T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), provided the amino-terminal domain is swung into position to contact DNA. The picture of DNA being cradled within a protein crescent agrees well with the bidomain architecture of Flp deduced from partial proteolysis of the free protein or the protein bound to DNA (8.Evans B.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11347-11354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mode of DNA interaction is also supported by UV cross-linking studies demonstrating that the amino-terminal domain of Flp contacts the spacer-proximal 4 bp of the binding element, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain contacts the spacer-distal 9 bp (39.Panigrahi G.B. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10940-10945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The general view of the Flp-DNA complex presented here will be refined by crystal structures of Flp-DNA complexes that are currently being solved. 4P. Rice and M. M. Cox, personal communication. However, the inferred similarity between Flp and Cre in their DNA association validates the rationale for inquiring how two similar protein-DNA assemblies yield different modes of strand cleavage.Directed DNA Bends as the Agent of Strand Cleavage SelectivityThe results from the present study, together with those of Lee et al. (22.Lee J. Tonozuka T. Jayaram M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), have shown that nucleotide bulges located centrally within the spacer induce the same directionality of cleavage bias in synthetic Cre and Flp substrates. It is the strand that contains the bulge that is the preferred target for cleavage in both cases. Based on the geometric effects of nucleotide bulges in double-stranded nucleic acids (25.Gohlke C. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11660-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26.Rosen M.A. Shapiro L. Patel D.J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4004-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 44.Bhattacharyya A. Lilley D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 45.Bhattacharyya A. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. Nature. 1990; 343: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the biased cleavages can be accounted for by two distinct DNA bends, equivalent in magnitude but opposite in orientation. In the absence of the bulge, a substrate bound by a Flp or Cre dimer has a finite probability of establishing either of these two DNA bends. The bulge, depending on the strand that contains it and its relative location within that strand, can enrich one type of DNA bend by selectively blocking the other. The bulge-mediated cleavage exclusion on one of the two strands in Flp substrates is consistent with the overall features of the Flp-induced DNA bend described extensively by Sadowski and colleagues (46.Luetke K.H. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47.Luetke K.H. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 48.Luetke K.H. Sadowski P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the most recently solved structure of the pre-cleavage synaptic complex formed by Cre (40.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) also suggests that it is the DNA bend direction that specifies the strands to be cleaved and exchanged in the initial step of recombination.The positional effects of the bulge on the magnitude and direction of the bias indicate similar trends for both Flp and Cre. The implication is that both recombinases induce identical or similar DNA configurations when bound to the two substrate arms flanking the spacer. By extrapolation, a similar geometry also exists in the recombination complexes, in which all four arms of the DNA partners are protein-bound.Global Change in Strand Cleavage Mode by Local Change in Peptide GeometryThe Cre crystal structure reveals that it is the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of Cre consisting of the K, L, M, and N helices and the tail end of the protein that partake in the interactions responsible for the allosteric activation of one monomer within a dimer to cleavage competence (Fig.10, top; see Refs. 9.Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The perspective in Fig. 10 brings into view the relevant portions of the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cre. The outline of the DNA backbone is included to indicate the direction of the bend (corresponding to bottom strand bulge and cleavage at the right spacer end by thegreen monomer). A two-dimensional projection of the K-N helices and their connectivities is shown in the bottom left panel of Fig. 10. Gopaul and Van Duyne (23.Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have pointed out that, for a given recombinase subunit, an extensible tether between the L and M helices could, in principle, confer the transconfiguration on M (which harbors the catalytic tyrosine), whereas the rest of the carboxyl-terminal peptide folds back to retain thecis configuration of N. The strand cleavage patterns imposed by the spacer bulges in Cre and Flp reactions are consistent with this model. In the representation of the Flp dimer in Fig. 10 (bottom right), the purple L helix is connected to M′–N′, defining the peptide connectivity within a monomer of thetrans cleaving recombinase. The M–N helices (now linked to the green L′ helix) are swung away to designate their plausible location within a recombination complex containing a recombinase tetramer (23.Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the cyclic contact between adjacent recombinase monomers is counterclockwise for the Cre tetramer (Fig. 10,bottom left), it becomes clockwise for Flp (Fig. 10,bottom right) in order to retain identity in strand cleavage. It seems plausible that a trans cleaving recombinase could have evolved differently, by maintaining the counterclockwise interaction seen in Cre, but adopting strand selectivity in cleavage opposite to that of Cre.Figure 10Peptide connectivities that determinecis or trans cleavage by a recombinase dimer. Top, perspective of the cleaved Cre-DNA complex (10.Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) as viewed from a vantage point on the carboxyl-terminal side of the protein is shown. The DNA bend corresponds to a bottom strand bulge near the center of the spacer. Cleavage has occurred at the right-hand side, executed in the cis mode by the Cre monomer in green. Bottom, the same perspective as in the top panel is redrawn at theleft to represent the helices K–N and their linkages. At the right, the change in connectivity between thepurple and green monomers to mediatetrans cleavage is shown. Effectively, the purpleL helix is linked to the green M′–N′ helices. Conversely, the green L′ helix is linked to the purple M–N helices. The new location of the M–N helices approximates the situation for the recombinase tetramer seen in DNA-protein co-crystal structures (23.Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Evolution of Divergent Protein Folds for a Conserved FunctionThe evolution of two distinct DNA cleavage modes within the Int family recombinases by localized amino acid changes among its members does not contradict the rules of protein structure and folding. A relevant example is the conversion of staphylococcal nuclease from the native monomer form into a stable dimer by a short peptide deletion in a surface loop (49.Green S.M. Gittis A.G. Meeker A.K. Lattman E.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The resultant stripping of the carboxyl-terminal α helix from its normal position (cis) and its incorporation into an equivalent position on the adjoining monomer (trans) is analogous to the switching of peptide connectivities diagrammed in Fig. 10. More recently, it has been shown that interchanging two amino acid neighbors in the Arc repressor transforms the local peptide fold from a β strand into a right-handed helix (50.Cordes M.H.J. Walh N.P. McKnight C.J. Sauer R.T. Science. 1999; 284: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This structural alteration has little effect on the global protein stability or folding cooperativity. The Flp protein encoded by the 2-μm plasmid ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae and the Cre protein encoded by the bacteriophage P1 are members of the Integrase family (also called the tyrosine family) of “conservative” site-specific recombinases (1.Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,2.Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Members of this family carry out a wide range of biological functions but utilize a common biochemical mechanism to accomplish them (3.Nash H.A. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2363-2376Google Scholar). They mediate the breakage and joining between two double helical DNA partners harboring their respective target sequences (4.Sadowski P.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5.Landy A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1993; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6.Lilley D.M. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Four recombinase monomers participate in the reaction to complete two sequential pairs of strand cleavage and joining steps. A Holliday junction is therefore a central intermediate in recombination. The Integrase family members follow the type IB topoisomerase chemistry to break the DNA strands, forming a 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage and a 5′-hydro"
https://openalex.org/W1970417431,"A novel variant of the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 (FGFR-1) was identified in human placental RNA. In this receptor (FGFR-1L) portions of the second and third immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains are deleted. To determine whether FGFR-1L was functional, full-length variant (pSV/FGFR-1L) and wild-type (pSV/FGFR-1) receptors were stably transfected into rat L6 myoblasts cells. Transfected L6 clones expressed respective proteins and bound (125)I-labeled FGF-2 with K(d) values of 99 pm (FGFR-1) and 26 pm (FGFR-1L). FGF-1 and FGF-2 competed efficiently with (125)I-FGF-2 for binding to FGFR-1 and FGFR-1L, whereas FGF-4 was less efficient. FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-4 enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, increased steady-state c-fos mRNA levels, and stimulated proliferation through either receptor, whereas KGF was without effect. FGFR-1 expressing clones exhibited ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), a 90-kDa adaptor protein that links FGFR-1 activation to the MAPK cascade. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 was not evident with FGFR-1L. In addition, phospholipase C-gamma was not tyrosine phosphorylated via activated FGFR-1L. These findings indicate that FGFR-1L binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 with high affinity and is capable of mitogenic signaling, but may activate MAPK to occur via non-classical signaling intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2153306660,"Two isozymes of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) of the apicomplexan protozoan Toxoplasma gondii are encoded by the single HGPRT gene as a result of differential splicing. Western blotting of total T. gondii protein shows that both isozymes I and II, which differ by 49 amino acids, are expressed. Both form enzymatically active homotetramers when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of HGPRT-I is five times that of HGPRT-II. When both isozymes are co-expressed in E. coli, HGPRT-I.HGPRT-II heterotetramers form. The predominant heterotetramer has enzymatic activity similar to HGPRT-II, and gel filtration chromatography demonstrates that its size is intermediate between the sizes of HGPRT-I and HGPRT-II. Mass spectrometric analysis of cross-linked homo- and heterotetramers reveals species of distinct molecular mass for HGPRT-I, HGPRT-II, and HGPRT-I.HGPRT-II and suggests that the predominant heterotetramer consists of one HGPRT-I subunit and three HGPRT-II subunits. The implications of this finding are discussed."

In this report, we introduce (2R,4R)- 4-phenyl-1-[N α-(7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl)-l-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid as a potent and selective trypsin inhibitor. The agent inhibited trypsin competitively with the K i value of 0.1 μm. It inhibited thrombin weakly (K i = 2 μm) and did not inhibit plasmin, plasma kallikrein, urokinase, and mast cell tryptase (K i values for these enzymes are >60 μm). Comparative studies with several established proteinase inhibitors revealed that the compound was the first small molecular weight trypsin inhibitor without tryptase inhibitory activity. A docking study has provided a plausible explanation for the molecular mechanism of the selective inhibition showing that the agent fits into the active site of trypsin without any severe collision but that it comes into clash at the 4-phenyl group of piperidine ring against the “60-insertion loop” of thrombin and at the 7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl group against Gln98 of tryptase.

Starting from l-arginine, we obtained number 205 (DAPA)1as one of the representatives of our series of thrombin inhibitors (1.Okamoto S. Hijikata A. Kinjo K. Kikumoto R. Ohkubo K. Tonomura S.

The structure-activity relationship studies on the substitution at the 2- and 4-positions in the piperidine ring provided us crucial information for designing inhibitors selective to thrombin and trypsin. The introduction of 2-COOH into the piperidine ring caused a marked decrease in acute toxicity, whereas the thrombin inhibitory activity remained unchanged (3.Kikumoto R. Tamao Y. Ohkubo K. Tezuka T.

In addition, the 4-phenyl introduction into the piperidine ring decreased the thrombin inhibitory activity dramatically, whereas such modification did not reduce or even increased the inhibitory activity for trypsin (4.Hijikata-Okunomiya A.

Based on the different effects of 4-phenyl introduction into the piperidine ring on the inhibitory activity for thrombin and trypsin, we searched for selective trypsin inhibitor. Although many synthetic inhibitors have been reported to exhibit trypsin inhibitory activity, few of them can discriminate trypsin from other trypsin-like enzymes, especially from tryptase. This report introduces a new synthetic trypsin inhibitor, MNAPPA, which to our knowledge is the first small molecular weight inhibitor that discriminates trypsin from tryptase. In addition, a computer-aided modeling study was attempted, and it provided new insight into the molecular mechanism to explain the selective inhibition of MNAPPA for trypsin. MQPA was synthesized as reported previously (5.Okamoto S. Hijikata A. Kikumoto R. Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Maruyama A. Sugano M. Tamao Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(Tokyo, Japan). Soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), leupeptin, and antipain were from Sigma. Enzymes used were as follows: trypsin (bovine pancreas, Sigma), thrombin (α-thrombin, human, American Diagnostica Co., Greenwich, CT) for the determination of K i, thrombin (bovine, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) for the determination of IC50, plasmin (human, Kabi Diagnostica, Stockholm, Sweden), plasma kallikrein (human, Kabi Diagnostica), urokinase (human, Mochida Pharmaceutical), and tryptase (human lung mast cell, Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA). N α-(tert-Butyloxycarbonyl)-N G-nitro-l-arginine (2.85 g) and Et3N (0.90 g) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) was cooled to −25 to −20 °C, and isobutylchloroformate (1.22 g) was added. After 30 min, a solution of optically active methyl 4-phenyl-2-piperidinecarboxylate ([α]27D−61.0° (c 0.66, MeOH)) (1.96 g) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 ml) was added dropwise and stirred at −25 to −20 °C for 30 min and at room temperature for additional 1 h. Tetrahydrofuran was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate, the solution was washed successively with water, 10% aqueous solution of citric acid, saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 and water, and dried over Na2SO4. After purification by column chromatography on silica gel using CHCl3-MeOH (97:3) as eluent, optically active methyl 1-[N α-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-NG-nitro-l-arginyl]-4-phenyl-2-piperidinecarboxylate was obtained in the form of amorphous solid. To the solution of optically active methyl 1-[N α-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-N G-nitro-l-arginyl]-4-phenyl-2-piperidinecarboxylate (1.7 g) in ethyl acetate (7 ml) was added ethyl acetate (7 ml) containing 20% HCl at 0–5 °C. After stirring at 0–5 °C for 10 min and at room temperature for additional 3 h, Et2O was added, and the precipitated material was washed with Et2O several times, and the solvent was evaporated. Optically active methyl 1-(N G-nitro-l-arginyl)-4-phenyl-2-piperidinecarboxylate (1.59 g) obtained was mixed with Et3N (0.99 g) in CHCl3 (50 ml) and 7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl chloride (1.0 g) was added at 0–5 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0–5 °C for 10 min and at room temperature for additional 2 h, washed successively with 1 n HCl, water, and saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3, and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using CHCl3-MeOH (97:3) as eluent. Optically active methyl 1-[N α-(7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl)-N G-nitro-l-arginyl]-4-phenyl-2-piperidinecarboxylate was obtained in the form of amorphous solid. To the solution of optically active methyl 1-[N α-(7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl)-N G-nitro-l-arginyl]-4-phenyl-2-piperidinecarboxylate (1.69 g) in tetrahydrofuran (30 ml) and water (10 ml) was added 2n NaOH (40 ml) and stirred for 4 h. The reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 5–6 with 2 n HCl, and tetrahydrofuran was evaporated. Then the resulting solution was adjusted to pH 1–2 with 2 n HCl, and oily material was precipitated that changed to crystalline material after standing. The crystalline material was collected by filtration and dried to yield optically active 4-phenyl-1-[N α-(7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl)-N G-nitro-l-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid. To the solution of optically active 4-phenyl-1-[N α-(7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl)-N G-nitro-l-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid (1.40 g) dissolved in the mixture of EtOH (10 ml), water (5 ml), and AcOH (1 ml) was added palladium black (0.2 g), and H2was bubbled for 30 h. After the catalyst was filtered off, the solvent was evaporated, and water (20 ml) was added to the residue. Adjustment of the pH to 10 with 2 n NaOH resulted in the precipitation of crystalline material which was collected by filtration, dried to yield crude crystalline, and recrystallized from EtOH-H2O to give purified crystal of (2R,4R)-4-phenyl-1-[N α-(7-methoxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl)-l-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid ([α]25D +41.2° (c 0.97, MeOH), IR(KBr): 3420, 1630, 1600 cm−1. Amidolytic assay was carried out in 96-well plate at 37 °C by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm ofp-nitroaniline released using the plate reader (SJ Autoreader II, Sanko Junyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). Substrates and buffer systems used were as follows: H-d-Phe-pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2238, Kabi) in Tris-imidazole, pH 8.1, for trypsin, H-d-Phe-pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide or H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2302, Kabi) in Tris-imidazole, pH 8.1, for thrombin, H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251, Kabi) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for plasmin, pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2444, Chromogenix AB, Molndal) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, for urokinase, H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for plasma kallikrein, and tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.12 m NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Paesel+Lorel GmbH & Co., Frankfurt) and 100 ng/ml dextran sulfate (Sigma) for tryptase (8.Ren S.

To the mixture of 200 μl of buffer with or without inhibitor to be tested and 25 μl of substrate solution, 25 μl of enzyme solution was added. IC50 values were determined from the hydrolysis rate using 0.1 mmH-d-Phe-pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide for thrombin and trypsin, 0.3 mmH-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide for plasmin, and 0.25 mm tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide for tryptase.

MQPAC36 is a hypothetical compound generated in the coordinate system of 1DWC, which has the C36 carbon atom at the para-position of 4-phenyl group introduced into the piperidine ring of MQPA. 3-Methyl-tetrahydro-8-quinoline group, the N terminus of MQPAC36, was replaced with 7-oxy-2-naphthalene group to make a basic structure of MNAPPA. Two enzymes in different coordinate systems were superposed by the least square fitting of equivalent three α-carbon atoms of His57, Asp102, and Ser195. Superposition of two enzymes by least square fitting, calculation of atomic distances and drawing of molecular structures were made with the program Protein Adviser (version 3.5, Fujitsu Co., Fukuoka, Japan). The chemical structure of MNAPPA is shown in Fig.1 (left panel). Its skeleton is l-arginine, and it bears 2-piperidinecarboxylic acid with 4-phenyl group at the C terminus. It inhibited trypsin competitively with the K i value of 0.1 μm as shown in Fig. 2. MNAPPA inhibited thrombin weakly (K i = 2 μm) and did not inhibit plasmin, plasma kallikrein, and urokinase (K i for these enzymes > 60 μm) (Table I). Noteworthy was that MNAPPA did not inhibit tryptase (K i > 60 μm).Figure 2Competitive inhibition of MNAPPA for trypsin.

Open table in a new tab MNAPPA is a homologue of MQPA, the selective thrombin inhibitor (Fig.1, right panel). The structural change from MQPA to MNAPPA resulted in a marked decrease in the thrombin inhibitory activity (Table I). The K i value of MNAPPA was 100 times larger than that of MQPA. On the other hand, the structural change from MQPA to MNAPPA rather increased the trypsin inhibitory activity. Thus, the potent thrombin inhibitor MQPA was converted to a potent trypsin inhibitor by changing the N and C termini of l-arginine skeleton. In addition to our previous results that MQPA inhibited thrombin potently, inhibited trypsin only weakly and actually did not inhibit other serine proteinases (5.Okamoto S. Hijikata A. Kikumoto R.

Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Hijikata A. Okamoto S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), MQPA was studied to compare its inhibitory activity for human mast cell tryptase with MNAPPA. The result shown in Table I that MQPA as well as MNAPPA did not inhibit tryptase up to the concentration of 60 μm provided additional clear evidence indicating their high selectivity for thrombin and trypsin, respectively. The IC50 values of MNAPPA for trypsin, thrombin, plasmin, and tryptase were compared with several established trypsin inhibitors in Table II. All of the trypsin inhibitors tested except SBTI inhibited both of trypsin and tryptase. Although SBTI discriminated trypsin from tryptase, it inhibited plasmin rather strongly. Consequently, MNAPPA was a highly selective trypsin inhibitor among those inhibitors tested. In particular, MNAPPA was the first small molecular weight inhibitor that discriminated trypsin from tryptase precisely.Table IIEnzyme profiles of proteinase inhibitorsInhibitorIC50ThrombinPlasminTrypsinTryptaseμmMNAPPA60>600.3>60Leupeptin>10020.20.4Antipain>100400.40.3Nafamostat mesilate300.30.030.001SBTI>300.040.00920 Open table in a new tab We attempted to get insight into the molecular mechanism of trypsin-specific inhibition of MNAPPA with a computer-aided modeling technique. Because MQPA has been reported to bind the active site of trypsin and thrombin in nearly identical conformation (18.Matsuzaki T. Sasaki C. Okumura C. Umeyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19.Brandstetter H. Turk D. Hoeffken H.W. Grosse D. Sturzebecher J. Martin P.D. Edwards B.F.P. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we made the following docking study on the supposition that MNAPPA will bind the active sites of enzymes holding the same conformation as MQPA in1DWC. The crystallographic evidence has revealed that MQPA fits well into the active site of thrombin through its arginine side chain, quinolinesulfonyl group, and methylpiperidine group to the S1 specificity pocket, aryl binding pocket, and S2 cavity, respectively (10.Banner D.W. Hadvary P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20085-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Brandstetter H. Turk D. Hoeffken H.W. Grosse D. Sturzebecher J. Martin P.D. Edwards B.F.P. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our experimental results indicated that arginine derivatives lost their thrombin inhibitory activity but reserved trypsin inhibitory activity when a phenyl group was introduced into the 4-position of the piperidine ring (4, 7 and this report). To know the binding geometry of the 4-phenyl group, we visualized the C36 atom at thepara-position of 4-phenyl group attached to the piperidine ring of MQPA in 1DWC. As shown in Fig.3 A, C36 introduced into the MQPA molecule revealed severe steric clash against Tyr60Aof the “60-insertion loop” of thrombin. When MQPAC36 was superposed on other thrombin coordinates such as 1DWB, 1AHT, and 1FPC, every docking experiment resulted in similar steric collisions between C36 and Tyr60A. Fig. 3 A also shows trypsin superposed on MQPAC36-thrombin. In the case of trypsin, the 60-insertion loop is not present (Fig.4), and, therefore, there is no projecting obstacle but a sufficient space at the site. Consequently, C36 did not cause any clash against trypsin. Neither tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl group nor 7-oxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl group collided with the enzyme. When we used other trypsin coordinates such as 2TBS, 1TPP, and 1PPC, similar results were obtainable showing no collision between ligand and enzyme. Fig. 3 B shows the MQPAC36-thrombin complex superposed on tryptase monomer A. Although tryptase has a 60-insertion loop, it does not protrude heavily as in thrombin, and, therefore, C36 did not collide with tryptase. However, the tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl group or 7-oxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl group at the N terminus of the ligands collided with Gln98of tryptase. Similar results were obtained when the ligands were docked into the other monomers of tryptase (monomer B, C, and D). Our docking study suggests the following plausible explanation; the inhibitory effect of MNAPPA on thrombin is weak because the 4-phenyl group of MNAPPA collides with the 60- insertion loop of thrombin, and MNAPPA and MQPA do not inhibit tryptase because the 7-oxy-2-naphthalenesulfonyl and tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl group collide with tryptase. Consequently, MNAPPA has acquired the trypsin-selective inhibitory activity. In our previous reports, we described the strategies to obtain inhibitors selective to thrombin and those selective to trypsin respectively, among the derivatives of l-arginine (7.Hijikata-Okunomiya A.

Okamoto S. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1992; 18: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The selective thrombin inhibitor MQPA is the representative of the former. In this report, we introduced MNAPPA as one of the representatives of the latter. The enzymes tested were trypsin, thrombin, plasmin, plasma kallikrein, urokinase, and tryptase, all of which are the key enzymes in the field of digestion, coagulation, fibrinolysis, kinin formation, and mast cell diseases. The enzyme inhibitory activities of MNAPPA as shown in Table I revealed that MNAPPA was a potent and selective trypsin inhibitor. Tryptase is a trypsin-like serine proteinase from mast cells. It hydrolyzes peptide bonds next to arginine and lysine residue (21.Tanaka T. McRae B.J. Cho K. Cook R. Fraki J.E. Johnson D.A. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13552-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Pereira et al. (17.Pereira P.J Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) revealed the x-ray crystallography of the complex of APA and tetrameric human tryptase; the specificity pocket of tryptase is virtually identical to that of trypsin to accommodate arginine and lysine side chain, the tryptase monomers are positioned at each corner of the tetramer, the active sites are directed to the center of the tetramer, and macromolecule substrates or inhibitors are restricted to access to the active site by the neighboring monomers. Therefore, the S1 site occupying compounds of small molecular weight such as benzamidine, APA, andN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone inhibit tryptase and trypsin as well (22.Sturzebecher J. Prasa D. Sommerhoff C.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Smith T.J. Hougland D.A. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11046-11051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies on benzamidine and bis-benzamidine derivatives revealed that the affinities of these compounds to trypsin and tryptase are closely correlated (22.Sturzebecher J. Prasa D. Sommerhoff C.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). None of the small molecular weight compounds had been reported to discriminate trypsin from tryptase precisely. Because the molecular weight of MNAPPA is small and comparable with those of antipain (M r = 605) and leupeptin (M r = 427), both of which inhibit trypsin and tryptase (Refs. 23.Smith T.J. Hougland D.A. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11046-11051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24.Aoyagi T. Umezawa H. Reich E. Rifkin D. Shaw E. Proteases and Biological Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1975: 429-454Google Scholar and this report), and because the arginine side chain of MNAPPA is assumed to be accommodated in the specificity pocket of tryptase, we expected that MNAPPA could access to the active site of tryptase to inhibit it. But it did not inhibit tryptase as shown in Table I. After we compared the enzyme inhibitory spectrum of MNAPPA with those of the established trypsin inhibitors such as leupeptin, antipain, and nafamostat mesilate as shown in Table II, we came to a conclusion that MNAPPA was the most selective trypsin inhibitor of small molecular weight ever reported. Rapidly advanced protein chemistry in recent years has provided much knowledge of three-dimensional structures of enzymes, allowing our understanding of enzyme functions at the molecular level. Selective proteinase inhibitors have been useful in the experimental procedures of crystallographic analysis of enzymes, and moreover, it is very helpful for visualizing the active sites of enzymes. Considering the steric hindrance between ligand and enzyme, we obtained visual models that agree with the experimental results of inhibition studies (Fig.3). The steric collision of 4-phenylpiperidine with 60-insertion loop especially seems to be a satisfactory explanation for the loss of thrombin inhibitory activity of MNAPPA, because the conformation of 60-insertion loop appeared rigid, and the same severe clash was also observed in other docking experiments using the coordinates of thrombin complexed with benzamidine, APA, and DAPA. Furthermore, steric hindrance between N terminus of the ligands and tryptase seemed probable, because the tilting of Gln98 might be restricted in tetrameric tryptase, because the active sites of monomer A and D (and those of B and C) are spacially close to each other, and Gln98 of monomer A and Tyr95 of monomer D are neighboring (17.Pereira P.J Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It has been reported that certain enzymes of trypsin families such as trypsin, thrombin, and tryptase cleave proteinase-activated receptors on the cell surface and trigger signals that regulate multiple cellular reactions (see review in Ref. 25.Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteinase-activated receptor 2, the receptor for trypsin, is widely distributed in the body tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, kidney, liver, airway, and prostate and in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and certain tumor cell lines. In addition, endothelial cells and some cancer cells express trypsinogen, and gene expression of trypsinogen was increased in vascular endothelial cells around gastric tumors and in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (26.Koshikawa N. Nagashima Y. Miyagi Y. Mizushima H. Yanoma S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, trypsin may escape into the circulation during pancreatitis. The selective trypsin inhibitor MNAPPA may be a useful tool to elucidate the roles of trypsin in the pathogenesis of various diseases."
