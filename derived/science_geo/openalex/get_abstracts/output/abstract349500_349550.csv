https://openalex.org/W2062022770,"IN the course of investigations into the application of paper chromatography to the identification of reducing substances in urine it was found that, when ammoniacal silver nitrate was used as a developing reagent, urates, normally present in urine, produced a dark brown spot with an RF value of approximately 0·20. This spot, which generally ‘tails', tends to mask the spots produced by other reducing substances with RF values in the region of 0·20, namely, those of glucose, sorbose, arabinose and fructose."
https://openalex.org/W2023868925,"WE have reported in earlier communications1,2 that the extract of fresh pancreas as well as that of acetone-dried pancreas powder contains a specific enzyme which we called 'elastase'. This enzyme had not been found before in the human or animal organism ; but it was studied first by Eijkman3 so early as 1904 as a product of bacteria. The elastase of the pancreas dissolves the elastic fibres of the arteries. We found that in the wall of the arteries only the elastic fibres are attacked by this ferment, and the collagen remains unaltered. We have been able to show that our pure elastase differs from other proteolytic ferments of the pancreas such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. Through the kindness of Dr. J. H. Northrop, of Princeton, N.J., we obtained crystalline trypsin and chymotrypsin, and we tested the elastolytic power of these enzymes parallel with our elastase. Neither trypsin nor chymostrypsin exercises any dissolving effect upon the elastic fibres of the arteries ; therefore, we can conclude that the elastase is not identical with the known proteolytic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2011327373,"THE method of paper partition chromatography has in recent years been widely used for the separation, detection and estimation of closely related compounds. We thought it of interest to determine to what extent it could be used to differentiate l-ascorbic acid from some of its isomers and from other nosely related dienols. Simple titration methods using 2 : 6 dichlorophenolindophenol give a reliable estimate of the vitamin content of most of the common foodstuffs, as shown by the close correspondence between chemical and biological results1-3. A method proposed by Roe and Kuether4, which is based on the formation of a coloured condensation product of 2: 3 diketogulonic acid with 2: 4 dinitro-phenylhydrazone, also gives results which are generally in agreement with those of the indophenol method."
https://openalex.org/W1978968409,"FROM a study of a number of crystalline insulins from different animal species, Scott and Fisher1 found that they all had the same microscopic appearance, sulphur content and physiological activity ; and Wasserman and Mirsky2 could find no immunological differences using sensitization and complement fixation experiments. It has thus often been concluded that different insulins are chemically identical, although almost all other proteins have been found to show species differences. The following experiment shows, however, that there are certain definite differences in the detailed chemical structure of insulins from different animal species."

https://openalex.org/W2080776024,"ULTRA-VIOLET light has been used in microscopy mainly because it makes possible the study of the distribution in cells of absorbing substances, such as nucleic acids, proteins and organic iodine compounds. There has, however, been controversy about the ultra-violet absorption of living cells since Brumberg and Larionow1 questioned the findings of earlier workers2 and suggested that living cells have only a very low absorption around 2600 A., which increases markedly after a few minutes irradiation. The elegant photographs of Ludford, Smiles and Welch3, on the other hand, indicate that fresh cells of the Rb tumour show marked nuclear and cytoplasmic absorption when first observed at 2570 A. and 2750 A."

https://openalex.org/W2085399577,"IT has been reported by Schrader1,2 and other German workens that certain organo-phosphorous compounds have trong insecticidal properties. They act as contact insecticides, but also, in a less familiar manner, as ‘systemic’ insecticides, that is, they are absorbed by the roots or the leaves of a plant and render it to ic. The effect may be very persistent and this Wode of action would be of considerable economic.interest were it not for the fact that, with compunds tested to date, the treated plants are also toxic to mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2070455709,"THE crystalline material described above has been tested against several organisms used chiefly for microbiological assay. These tests have shown that the crystals are markedly toxic to the organism Leuconostoc mesenteroides P-60 at a concentration as low as 5 pgm. per ml. of liquid medium, the cells being agglutinated and acid production substantially reduced. With higher concentrations, of 50 μgm. per ml. or more, growth and acid-production are almost entirely suppressed. For this organism the limit for detecting a toxic effect is about 1–2 μgm. per ml. of medium. The following figures, observed after 16 hr. incubation on a full-growth medium at 37°, serve to illustrate the sensitivity of Leuconostoc mesenteroides P-60."

A photographic film was enclosed between two disks of dielectric carrying silver film electrodes, one disk having a small cylindrical cavity adjacent to the photosensitive surface (Fig. 1). The sample was tested in conjunction with a discharge recorder2. Alternating voltage was applied for 1/25–1/10 sec."
https://openalex.org/W1993641447,"Hooker and Pfeiffer1 observed an atrophy of the uropygial gland in rats after œstrogen treatment. This atrophy was prevented by androgen therapy. Bullough2 reported stimulation of this gland in the mouse due to the administration of œstrogen, and further noted that prolonged œstrogenic treatment caused a depression of this gland. However, Kar3 observed that the αstrogen failed to elicit any response in the uropygial gland of White Leghorn cockerels. This hormonal ineffectiveness was explained by the assumption that the female sex hormone failed to influence this sebaceous type of gland in the cockerels with functioning testes. The present report has been concerned with an attempt to test the validity of this assumption with female birds as the experimental material."

https://openalex.org/W1983014616,"ONE of the commonest demonstrations of interference is that between two loud-speakers actuated by separate audio-frequency oscillators. When the two oscillators differ slightly in pitch, the audience perceives beats which form a complicated pattern of interferences in the room. At any point in the room there is a probability of ½ that the phase difference of waves coming from the two sources lies between π and 2π, consequently that the sound-level may be less than that due to one source alone, a fact that is readily demonstrated with a microphone."
https://openalex.org/W2004654954,"STUDIES on tunicates, insects, annelids and the cœlenterate Tubularia1,2 have revealed the presence of two main types of leucocytes in them: (a) agranular, amœboid phagocytes, and (b) granular, poorly or non-amœboid and non-phagocytic elements, for which I have proposed the term ‘trephocytes'. In the organisms mentioned above, trephocytes frequently constitute 50–75 per cent of all leucocytes. Their inclusions are of a nutritive nature and are released into the blood, the tissues, or directly into other cells, a function referred to as ‘trephocytosis'. Trephocytes are highly active in growth, and the study of trephocytosis proved instrumental in elucidating some of its manifestations and correlations."

https://openalex.org/W2073015471,"IN developing the isotope dilution method of amino-acid analysis, we have been concerned with the difficulty of proving the purity of the isolated sample of ammo-acid, upon which the accuracy of the determination depends. Elementary analysis and the estimation of reactive groups are not always entirely satisfactory, because the contaminants most likely to be present in such purified material are those which have a very similar composition. Shemin1 has reported the contamination of glutamic acid hydrochloride by cystine dihydrochloride even after repeated crystallization, and Keston, Udenfriend and Cannan2 have emphasized the danger of co-precipitation of nearly related amino-acids and their derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2025850592,"As forecast in the preceding communication, we have now succeeded in synthesizing natural racemic cinerolone and thence of cinerin-I. The sodium salt, obtained by hydrolysis with 3 per cent sodium hydroxide at 20° of methyl cis-hept-5-en-2-one-1-carboxylate, an intermediate in the previous synthesis, was condensed with pyruvaldehyde in aqueous solution at 35° and pH 8·5 to give cis-dec-8-en-3-ol-2: 5-dione. This hydroxydiketone was cyclized by 2 per cent sodium hydroxide at 20° to (±)-cis-cinerolone (II). The semicarbazones of this hydroxyketone and of its acetate (see the table) were shown by mixestrictly cinerond melting point determinations to be identical with naturally derived racemic cinerolone and cinerolone (strictly cineronyl) acetate semicarbazones respectively. Specimens of the corresponding (±)-trans-cinerolone derivatives (prepared in collaboration with A. J. B. Edgar) markedly depressed the melting points of both the natural and synthetic (±)-cis-cinerolone derivatives."

They were used coast-dwellers from very early times for a variety of purposes ; but the quantitative curve of utilization has altered periodically and must be viewed against a background of economic history if its changing form is to be fully appreciated. In 1949 a rise in the curve has occurred and seaweed products are available even to inland populations. Prof. Lily Newton, in her presidential address to Section K (Botany), therefore, reviews the earlier history of algal utilization and suggests some lines along which future work can best be directed."

Although, perhaps, a little apologetic in advancing this idea, Prof. Hardy did not conceal his belief that few could reject the evidence for telepathy were they to examine it with unbiased minds and without undue prejudice."
