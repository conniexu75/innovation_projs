https://openalex.org/W1550281689,"The alternative splicing options and the quantitative tissue distribution of the transcripts of the four currently known human plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) genes have been analyzed in seven tissues (cerebral cortex, skeletal and heart muscle, stomach, liver, lung, and kidney) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed mRNA with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal standard. The mRNAs of genes 1 and 4 were found to be present in similar amounts in all tissues, whereas the transcripts of genes 2 and 3 were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, i.e. their amounts were highest in fetal skeletal muscle and brain. Alternative splicing was found to occur in the PMCA transcripts at two major regulatory sites (sites A and C), adjacent to the amino-terminal phospholipid-responsive region and within the carboxyl-terminal calmodulin binding domain, respectively. Novel splicing variants not described previously for human genes were detected for hPMCA3 and 4 at site A and for hPMCA1, 2, and 3 at site C. For all genes a common splice variant was found at both splice sites. The common splice variant at site A was characterized by the inclusion of a small exon (hPMCA1, 39 base pairs (bp); hPMCA2, 42 bp; hPMCA3, 42 bp; hPMCA4, 36 bp). In the common splice variant at site C, an exon (hPMCA1, 154 bp; hPMCA2, 227 bp; hPMCA3, 154 bp; hPMCA4, 178 bp) was excluded in the mRNA. All genes normally express these main splice variants in all tissues in which the corresponding isoform is present. The splicing complexity at site C was found to be augmented in the transcripts of PMCA2 and PMCA3 through the use of additional exons, and in PMCA1 and 3 through the use of additional internal splice sites in the single alternatively spliced 154-base pair exon."

https://openalex.org/W1497665885,"The beta- but not the gamma- and delta-type isozymes of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) are activated by G protein alpha q and beta gamma subunits. The beta-type PLC isozymes differ from other isozymes in that they contain a long carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the Y catalytic domain and a region rich in acidic amino acids between the two separated X and Y catalytic domains. To determine the sites on PLC-beta 2 that participate in the interaction of the enzyme with alpha q and beta gamma subunits, we introduced specific truncations and substitutions in the PLC-beta 2 cDNA at positions corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal and acidic amino acid-rich regions, respectively. After transient expression of these cDNA clones in CV-1 cells, the mutant enzymes were partially purified and their capacity to be activated by alpha q and beta gamma subunits determined. Substitution of glutamine residues for three or all seven of a stretch of consecutive glutamic acids in the acidic domain of PLC-beta 2 affected neither alpha q- nor beta gamma-dependent activation significantly. Carboxyl-terminal truncation to residue Gly-934 or to residue Ala-867 resulted in enzymes that were activated by beta gamma but not by alpha q. This result suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region of PLC-beta 2 is required for activation by alpha q, and that beta gamma subunits interact with a different region of the enzyme. Thus, alpha q and beta gamma subunits may independently modulate a single PLC-beta 2 molecule concurrently."
https://openalex.org/W1525822918,"The structure of the hexadecameric ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Synechococcus PCC6301 has been solved to 2.2-A resolution. Crystallization was in the presence of CO2, Mg2+, and 2'-carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate to form a stable enzyme quaternary complex that mimics one of the intermediate states of the carboxylation reaction. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of spinach carboxylase. The deviations in C alpha positions of the L- and S-subunits are only 0.3 and 2.0 A, respectively, and localized at specific regions of the two polypeptides. One region that shows significant divergence of the peptide backbone is loop 6 of the beta barrel in the L-subunit. Two other elements, the C terminus, and a highly conserved loop of the N-terminal domain of a second L-subunit, interact with loop 6 in the quaternary complex. These three regions, plus two other flexible segments, completely enfold the bisphosphate inhibitor. Significant alteration in their spatial relationship must occur to allow substrates or products access to and from the active site. The active site residues, activating cofactors, and inhibitor are well resolved in the electron density map. The disposition of these groups around the essential metal provides some indication of their role at different stages of the catalytic cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1554147742,"Two variants of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin alpha 6 subunit have been identified (alpha 6A and alpha 6B). To determine the role of each variant in mediating cell adhesion to laminin, we have independently expressed the alpha 6A and alpha 6B subunits in K562 cells. Both variants associated with endogenous beta 1 and were present at comparable levels on the surface of transfected K562 cells. After activation with phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMA) or the stimulatory anti-beta 1 antibody TS2/16, alpha 6A beta 1 as well as alpha 6B beta 1 mediated cell adhesion to laminin and more specifically to its fragment E8. Furthermore, both integrin variants interacted with the laminin isoforms kalinin and merosin. Cell adhesion to laminin isoforms was inhibited by the alpha 6-specific monoclonal antibody GoH3. PMA was less efficient in stimulating adhesion than TS2/16 and stimulated adhesion of alpha 6B transfectants better than of alpha 6A transfectants. In contrast, TS2/16 stimulated the adhesion of the alpha 6A and alpha 6B transfectants to laminin to a similar extent. These findings indicate that the cells may regulate the activation of the two alpha 6 variants independently. Activation by PMA was associated with the phosphorylation of both alpha 6A and alpha 6B subunits, but there was no relationship between the degree of phosphorylation and the ability of the transfectants to adhere to laminin since alpha 6A became phosphorylated much more strongly by PMA than alpha 6B. Thus, both alpha 6A beta 1 and alpha 6B beta 1 on K562 cells are activation-dependent receptors for different isoforms of laminin."
https://openalex.org/W1589219672,"Abstract The present study employed ligand affinity and immunoaffinity chromatography to isolate human platelet thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptor-coupled G-proteins. Purification of TXA2/PGH2 receptors by ligand (SQ31,491)-affinity chromatography resulted in the elution of receptor binding and GTPase activity in the same fraction. GTPase activity of this fraction was enriched (6-fold) relative to solubilized platelet membranes, was stimulated (65%) by 500 nM U46619, and was blocked (74%) by 250 nM SQ29,548. Furthermore, GTP (100 microM) increased [3H]SQ29,548 receptor binding by 48%. Immunoblotting of this fraction against QL antiserum identified a 42-kDa protein as a member of the Gq family. In separate experiments, TXA2/PGH2 receptors were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using P1Ab, P2Ab, and TxAb affinity columns. QL-immunoreactive proteins at 42 kDa were found in all three column eluates. Studies using G alpha,common antiserum (GA/1) demonstrated immunoblotting of two proteins of approximately 42 and 85 kDa in both the ligand and P2Ab affinity column fractions. On the other hand, the P1Ab and TxAb affinity column eluates contained GA/1 immunoreactivity only in the 42 kDa region. Collectively, these data identify Gq as a TXA2/PGH2 receptor-coupled G-protein and suggest the association of this receptor with additional G alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1580627284,"The concerted synthesis of phospholipids derived from serine involving two microsomal enzymes (phosphatidylserine synthase and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and a mitochondrial one (phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) occurs in reconstituted cell-free systems. Subfractionation of crude mitochondria after swelling and separating on a sucrose density gradient resulted in the isolation of two contact site-enriched fractions from total outer membranes and inner membranes, respectively. Estimation of marker enzyme activities shows a high recovery of glucose-6-phosphate phosphatase (a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum) associated with contact site-enriched fractions. Accordingly, the linked synthesis of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and at a lesser extent phosphatidylcholine can occur. This biosynthetic pathway was absent from purified contact site-enriched fractions correlative with the absence of glucose-6-phosphate phosphatase activity. Reconstitution experiments, including contact site-enriched fractions incubated with endoplasmic reticulum-rich fraction, led to the restoration of the linked synthesis of phospholipids, thereby demonstrating that a reversible association between these two fractions can occur. These functional interactions between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria are confirmed at the ultrastructural level using either chemical or physical fixation before resin embedding. These results show that the interorganelle trafficking of lipids may involve only highly specialized microdomains of both membranes, thereby allowing the maintenance of a specific lipid composition and distribution within membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1512165073,"The distribution and operation of Ca2+ pools within cells has been directly studied in situ by monitoring the Ca2+ inside Ca2+ dye-loaded organelles using high resolution imaging procedures. Using DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells, loaded with fura-2 under conditions favoring dye entry into organelles and subjected to carefully controlled permeabilization still attached to coverslips, the Ca2+ within organelles was analyzed by high resolution, z axis-controlled imaging, and deblurring methods. Saturation analysis of entrapped fura-2 indicated that the dye reported Ca2+ identically to fura-2 in solution. Areas containing high Ca(2+)-sequestering organelles (> 5 microM free Ca2+) were observed to predominate around the nucleus and close to the periphery of the cell. Analysis of the actions of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) within small (3 microns 2) selected intracellular areas, revealed a release phenomenon, with rapid attainment of limited stable release at submaximal InsP3 levels. The apparent EC50 for InsP3 was approximately 3 microns, higher than within suspensions of permeabilized cells. The action of InsP3 was competitively blocked by 10 micrograms/ml of the InsP3 antagonist, heparin. Applied after maximal InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release, heparin reversed InsP3-induced Ca2+ release resulting in reuptake of Ca2+ into Ca(2+)-pumping organelles with identical spatial distribution as before Ca2+ release. InsP3 released Ca2+ from all areas of high Ca(2+)-pumping organelles; extensive areas of high fura-2-loading, but low intraorganelle Ca2+, were unchanged by InsP3. GTP induced no alteration in Ca2+ release (in contrast to suspensions of permeabilized cells), suggesting that the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool was functioning as a single homogeneous pool. Opening of InsP3-sensitive channels was also monitored by assessing InsP3-activated channel-mediated Mn2+ quenching of organelle-loaded fura-2; the results revealed a similar pattern of quantal release, with slightly increased apparent InsP3 sensitivity. The results provide the first high resolution in situ localization of Ca2+ signaling organelles and demonstrate the quantal operation of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools within highly discrete subcellular loci."
https://openalex.org/W1581910437,"The [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (AvFdI) has an unusually low and strongly pH-dependent reduction potential (E'0). The reduced cluster exists in two forms, depending upon pH, that exhibit substantially different magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra. Recent studies have established that the MCD changes observed on decreasing the pH from 8.3 (alkaline form) to 6.0 (acid form) cannot be explained either by a change in spin state of the cluster (Stephens, P.J., Jensen, G.M., Devlin, F.J., Morgan, T.V., Stout, C. D., Martin, A.E., and Burgess, B.K. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3200-3209) or by a major structural change (e.g. ligand exchange) (Stout, C.D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 25920-25927). Here, we have examined the influence of aspartate 15 on the pH dependence of the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of AvFdI by construction of a D15N mutant. Aspartate 15, which is salt-bridged to lysine 84 at the protein surface, is the closest ionizable residue to the [3Fe-4S] cluster. The results show that replacement of aspartate by asparagine results in an approximately 20-mV increase in E'0 for the [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster at high pH concomitant with an approximately 0.8-pH unit decrease in the pK of the reduced form. The major pH dependence of E'0 is preserved as is the effect observed by MCD. These data eliminate the possibility that the MCD change is due to the presence of Asp-15 and support the conclusion that it originates in direct protonation of the [3Fe-4S]0 cluster, probably on a sulfide ion. Voltammetric studies show that interconversion between [3Fe-4S]+ and [3Fe-4S]0 at acidic pH involves rapid electron transfer followed by proton transfer (for reduction) and then proton transfer followed by electron transfer (for oxidation). Ionized aspartate 15 facilitates proton transfer. Thus, protonation and deprotonation are much slower for D15N relative to the native protein at pH > 5.5. Proton transfer reactions necessary for further reduction of the [3Fe-4S]0 cluster to the [3Fe-4S]- and [3Fe-4S]2- states are also retarded in D15N. The results suggest that the carboxylate-ammonium salt bridge afforded by Asp-15-Lys-84 conducts protons between the cluster and solvent H2O molecules. Overproduction of D15N FdI, but not native FdI, in A. vinelandii has a negative effect on the growth rate of the organism, suggesting that the rate of protonation or deprotonation of the [3Fe-4S]0 cluster may be important in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1560712586,"The immunoglobulin kappa light chain produced by the CH12 lymphoma is unusual because it is not secreted when expressed in the absence of a heavy chain. Instead, it undergoes rapid intracellular degradation. This degradation is selective, as another light chain expressed in the same cell is not degraded. It is also a property of the CH12 kappa chain itself, since it is degraded rapidly when expressed either in another myeloma cell or in COS-1 fibroblasts. When provided a heavy chain, this kappa chain assembles into IgM and is then protected from proteolysis. The degradation of kappa requires ATP, is sensitive to reduced temperature and to the thiol reagent diamide. Of all the proteolytic inhibitors tested, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and to a lesser extent 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, inhibit kappa degradation, suggesting the involvement of a serine protease. The degradation of kappa does not require transport to the Golgi complex, nor is it sensitive to a variety of lysosomotropic agents. Both immunofluorescence and the observed association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins GRP78/BiP and GRP94 indicate that the kappa chain is localized mostly in the ER. When a point mutation which blocks transport to the Golgi complex is introduced into this kappa chain, the association with the stress proteins is enhanced but the rate of degradation is not significantly decreased. We conclude that the CH12 kappa chain is a particularly good substrate for an ER degradation machinery, and that its sensitivity to the protease(s) is governed by its state of assembly. This ER degradation provides a possible quality control mechanism during the differentiation of B lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1612522292,"Goniodomin A, one of the polyether macrolides, isolated from the dinoflagellate Goniodoma pseudogoniaulax stimulated skeletal actomyosin ATPase activity 2-3 times, with a peak at 3 × 10(-8) to 3 × 10(-7) M. The effect of goniodomin A was dependent on the concentration of actin, but not of myosin. The actomyosin ATPase activity was increased by pretreatment of actin (but not of myosin) with goniodomin A. Goniodomin A induced a sustained and concentration-dependent increase in the fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength, 277 nm; emission wavelength, 329 nm) of actin. The maximum response was obtained with concentrations of goniodomin A in the 10(-5) to 10(-4) M range in the presence of 5 microM F-actin. However, the ATPase activity and fluorescence intensity of myosin were not changed by goniodomin A at concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-5) M. Interestingly, goniodomin A induced a remarkable but transient increase in the fluorescence intensity of actomyosin in a concentration-dependent manner, with a peak at 3 × 10(-7) M. This profile was quite similar to that found in the stimulation of the actomyosin ATPase activity induced by goniodomin A. To investigate further the effect of goniodomin A, actin was labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide. Goniodomin A at 10(-6) M had no effect on the fluorescence intensity of pyrenyl-actin (excitation wavelength, 365 nm; emission wavelength, 407 nm), but increasing concentrations of goniodomin A to 3 × 10(-6) M remarkably decreased its intensity. This effect was potentiated by heavy meromyosin. Actin molecules treated with goniodomin A were completely sedimented by mild centrifugation (for 15 min at 12,000 × g). Electron microscopic observations suggest that actin filaments associate with each other to form a gel in the presence of 3 × 10(-6) M goniodomin A. The conformational change of actin molecules, resulting from stoichiometric binding of goniodomin A to actin monomers in filaments, may modify the interaction between actin and myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1582702814,"We analyzed the submitochondrial location and biogenesis pathway of the phosphate carrier (PiC), also termed p32, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria, PiC/p32 was found to behave as an integral membrane protein that cofractionated with the ADP/ATP carrier of the inner membrane. Import of the precursor of PiC/p32 required a membrane potential across the inner membrane, supporting its localization to the inner membrane. This makes it unlikely that the major function of PiC/p32 is that of an import receptor on the surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, we found that both receptors MOM72 and MOM19 were involved in the import pathway of the precursor of PiC/p32 with MOM72 being responsible for the bulk of import. Yeast PiC/p32 is thus not only structurally homologous to the ADP/ATP carrier, but has a similar targeting mechanism and submitochondrial location, supporting its classification as a member of the inner membrane carrier family."

https://openalex.org/W1522770875,"A hysteresis is observed in the triple helix-coil transition of type III collagen. This hysteresis appears in the thermal transition, where it is not solvent-dependent, and also in the transition induced by guanidinium hydrochloride. The transitions are observed both by optical rotatory dispersion and by trypsin digestion. Experiments with various fragments of type III collagen, which, like the intact protein, contain a set of disulfide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal end, which functions as an effective nucleus for refolding, indicate that the hysteresis depends on the amino acid sequence, rather than being a general property of the triple helix. The carboxyl-terminal one-quarter fragment of type III collagen does not show a hysteresis, whereas a mutant type III collagen missing residues 595-1008 shows a hysteresis of the same magnitude as normal type III collagen. Several fragments were produced that are missing parts of the amino-terminal end, and these fragments show no hysteresis. The amino-terminal part of the triple helix of type III collagen consists of a stable region containing six Gly-Pro-Hyp tripeptide units within the first 16 tripeptide units. This region forms an amino-terminal clamp for the triple helix and, together with the set of disulfide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal end, allows for highly cooperative unfolding of the triple helix. The presence of this amino-terminal region is a prerequisite for the observed hysteresis."
https://openalex.org/W1486661028,"We report the identification in human glycophorin A gene of a novel exon mutation that affects splice site selection. DNA mapping showed that the mutation has abolished a unique MspI site marking the exon III-intron 3 splice junction (ACCG/GT). Genomic sequencing confirmed the occurrence of a single G–>A transition at the terminal nucleotide position of exon III. Analysis of the mRNA composition demonstrated a partial inactivation of the altered 5' splice site as well as skipping of exons involving the alternative use of other constitutive splice sites. The full-length transcript with the cognate A change encodes a variant glycophorin with an arginine replacing a glycine at position 59 and defining the ERIK epitope, whereas the exon III-deleted transcript specifies a shorter glycophorin carrying the Sta antigen. Also identified were the misspliced mRNA species with exon I-IV and exon I-V connections generated by selection of 5' splice sites far distant from the mutated site. Although having a correct translation frame, the predicted polypeptides of such exon-skipping products were not assembled on the erythrocyte membrane probably due to the severe truncation of the signal sequence required for targeting and translocation. These observations reveal a new mechanism for antigenic diversity of human glycophorins."
