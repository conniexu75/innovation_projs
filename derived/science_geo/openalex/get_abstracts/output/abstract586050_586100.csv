https://openalex.org/W2610474809,"This study examines the effects of the dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus D2/CSL (CECT 4529) (LA) on productive performances, incidence of foot pad dermatitis and caecum microbioma in broiler chickens. A total of 1,100 one-day old male Ross 308 chicks were divided into 2 groups of 16 replicates with 25 birds each and reared from 1-41 d. One group was fed a basal diet (CON) and the other group the same diet supplemented with LA. Caecum contents were collected from 4 selected birds at day one and 5 selected birds at the end of the rearing period. Then, they were submitted to DNA extraction and whole DNA shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Overall, the LA supplementation produced a significant beneficial effect on body weight gain between 15-28 d and improved feed conversion rate in the overall period. On the contrary, litter moisture, pH and incidence of the foot pad lesions were not affected by LA. Birds treated with LA showed a lower occurrence of pasty vent at both 14 and 28 d. At the end of the rearing period, Lachanospiraceae were significantly higher in LA birds in comparison to CON (17.07 vs 14.39%; P = 0.036). Moreover, Ruminococcus obeum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Roseburia intestinalis, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 14-2T and Coprococcus eutactus were significantly higher in LA birds in comparison to CON. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus was comparable between LA and CON groups. However, a positive effect was observed in relation to the metabolic functions in the treated group, with particular reference to the higher abundance of β-glucosidase. In conclusion, the LA supplementation improved broiler productive performances and metabolic functions promoting animal health."
https://openalex.org/W2610167394,"Background During liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) can undergo activation and transform into alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-expressing contractile myofibroblast-like cells, leading to deposition of excessive scar matrix. We have recently demonstrated that depletion of adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR1) from mouse hepatocytes leads to HSC activation and induction of inflammation and hepatic fibrosis that is mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6). Our aim was to identify and characterize the molecular pathways involved in the direct, inflammation-independent activation of HSCs by IL-6. Methods Primary HSCs were isolated from mouse livers. mRNA levels of αSMA and Col1a were analyzed using qRT-PCR. Protein levels of αSMA, MAPK, p-MAPK, p38, p-p38, STAT3 and p-STAT3 were assessed by Western Blot analysis. The effect of specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors (i.e., SB203580 (P-38 inhibitor), U0126 (MAPK inhibitor), S3I-201 (STAT3 inhibitor) and Ruxolitinib (Jak1/2 inhibitor)) was also studied. Results Primary HSCs treated with IL-6 demonstrated upregulation of αSMA and Col1a mRNA levels as well as increased αSMA protein levels. Moreover, the phenotypic transition of quiescent HSCs toward myofibroblast-like cells was noted upon administration of IL-6 and not in untreated samples. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of p38, MAPK and STAT3 increased 30 minutes after treatment, and was followed by a decline in the phosphorylation levels 2–4 hours post-treatment. However, addition of specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors curbed this effect, and resulted in αSMA and Col1a expression levels similar to those measured in untreated control samples. Conclusion IL-6 can directly induce the transition of HSCs toward myofibroblast-like cells. The effect is mediated by the activation of both MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Elimination of either MAPK or JAK/STAT signaling pathways inhibits HSC stimulation. These results might pave the road toward the development of potential therapeutic interventions for hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2611526787,"Opisthorchis viverrini is endemic in the South East Asian region, especially in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Vietnam and Thailand, but there have been no previous records from Myanmar. During stool surveys of rural populations in three regions of Lower Myanmar, Opisthorchis-like eggs were found in 34 out of 364 (9.3%) participants by stool microscopy after using the modified formalin-ether concentration technique. DNA was extracted from these positive stool samples and a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. DNA sequences, successfully obtained from 18 of 34 positive samples (Bago Region, n = 13; Mon State, n = 3; Yangon Region, n = 2), confirmed that the eggs were of O. viverrini. Sequences showed 99.7% identity with O. viverrini mitochondrial cox1 (GenBank accession no. JF739555) but 95%, 88.7%, 82.6% and 81.4% identities with those of Opisthorchis lobatus from Lao People's Democratic Republic (GenBank accession nos. HQ328539-HQ328541), Metorchis orientalis from China (KT239342), Clonorchis sinensis from China (JF729303) and Opisthorchis felineus from Russia (EU921260), respectively. When alignement with other Opisthorchiidae trematodes, 81% similarity with Metorchis bilis from Czech Republic (GenBank accession nos. KT740966, KT740969, KT740970) and Slovakia (GenBank accession nos. KT740971-KT740973), 84.6% similarity with Metorchis xanthosomus from Czech Republic (GenBank accession no. KT740974), 78.6% similarity with M. xanthosomus from Poland (GenBank accession no. KT740968) and 82.2% similarity with Euamphimerus pancreaticus from Czech Republic (GenBank accession no. KT740975) were revealed. This study demonstrated, for the first time, O. viverrini from rural people in Myanmar using molecular methods and is an urgent call for surveillance and control activities against opisthorchiasis in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W2610166754,"Due to their small area and shallow depth ponds are usually treated as a single sampling unit, while various microhabitats offer different environmental conditions. Thus, we tested the effect of different habitat types typically found within small ponds on the microalgae and zooplankton communities. We found that submerged macrophytes have the strongest impact on microalgae and zooplankton communities out of all the analysed habitats. Some epontic diatoms (e.g. Fragilaria dilatata, Cymbella affinis) and littoral-associated zooplankton species (e.g. Simocephalus vetulus, Lecane bulla) were significantly related to elodeids. However, pelagic species (e.g. bosminids) preferred less complex helophytes, which suggests that the most heterogeneous elodeid habitats were not an anti-predator shelter for cladocerans. Selection of different macrophyte types by taxonomically various organisms suggests that it is not only macrophyte cover that is desired for healthy aquatic environment but that a level of habitat mosaic is required to ensure the well-being of aquatic food webs. Species-specific preferences for different types of macrophytes indicate the high ecological value of macrophyte cover in ponds and a potential direction for the management of small water bodies towards maintaining a great variation of aquatic plants. Moreover, the type of surrounding landscape, reflecting human-induced disturbance (28 field ponds) and natural catchment (26 forest ponds), significantly influenced only zooplankton, while diatoms were affected indirectly through the level of conductivity. Nutrient overload (higher content of TRP) and increased conductivity in the field landscape contributed to a rise in microalgae (e.g. Amphora pediculus, Gomphonema parvulum) and zooplankton (e.g. Thermocyclops oithonoides, Eubosmina coregoni) abundance. An awareness of the responses of both components of plankton communities to environmental factors is necessary for maintaining the good state of small water bodies in various types of landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2611961792,"To determine the genetic and epidemiological relationship of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates from commercial poultry to attenuated live IBV vaccines we conducted a phylogenetic network analysis on the full-length S1 sequence for Arkansas (Ark), Massachusetts (Mass) and Delmarva/1639 (DMV/1639) type viruses isolated in 2015 from clinical cases by 3 different diagnostic laboratories. Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection. This data supports the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2610859211,"Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder which disfigures appearance, threatens vision, and results in a pronounced loss of quality of life. The diversity and ethnic difference of the disease manifestations have made it difficult to tailor therapies for each patient. Few studies have analyzed its characteristics in Chinese populations. We therefore enrolled 354 patients with moderate-to-severe TAO from February 2015 to July 2016. A single ophthalmologist consistently performed detailed ophthalmic examinations. Orbital computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed to verify enlarged extraocular muscles. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the association between sex, age, smoking, family history of thyroid diseases, degree of proptosis and disease severity. The mean age of males (46.56±11.08 years) was significantly higher than that of females (41.39±years), with a female-to-male ratio of 1.09. The females and males between 31~40 and 41~50 years, respectively, had the highest incidence of TAO. 81.48% of the patients suffered hyperthyroidism. TAO was diagnosed either after (47.17%) or simultaneously with thyroid dysfunction (27.68%). Proptosis (91.24%), eyelid retraction (83.33%), together with eyelid swelling (79.38%) and extraocular muscle enlargement (75.42%), were the most common clinical sign. 19.77% of patients manifested lower eyelid retraction. The mean values of exophthalmos and asymmetry on proptosis were 19.94±3.45mm and 2.18±2.06mm, respectively in males, 18.58±3.31mm and 1.61±1.53mm, respectively in females. The severity of disease was significantly associated with male, older age, smoking, family history of thyroid diseases and degree of proptosis. We found several differences in Chinese compared with White. The female-to-male ratio and mean value of exophthalmos were significantly lower than the data of White. Inferior and superior rectus became the most common extraocular muscles. Lower eyelid retraction should be included in diagnostic criteria in Asian patients. Understanding these differences, may allow better identification and treatment for TAO in China."
https://openalex.org/W2610928329,"Thermal properties of tree hollows play a major role in survival and reproduction of hollow-dependent fauna. Artificial hollows (nest boxes) are increasingly being used to supplement the loss of natural hollows; however, the factors that drive nest box thermal profiles have received surprisingly little attention. We investigated how differences in surface reflectance influenced temperature profiles of nest boxes painted three different colors (dark-green, light-green, and white: total solar reflectance 5.9%, 64.4%, and 90.3% respectively) using boxes designed for three groups of mammals: insectivorous bats, marsupial gliders and brushtail possums. Across the three different box designs, dark-green (low reflectance) boxes experienced the highest average and maximum daytime temperatures, had the greatest magnitude of variation in daytime temperatures within the box, and were consistently substantially warmer than light-green boxes (medium reflectance), white boxes (high reflectance), and ambient air temperatures. Results from biophysical model simulations demonstrated that variation in diurnal temperature profiles generated by painting boxes either high or low reflectance colors could have significant ecophysiological consequences for animals occupying boxes, with animals in dark-green boxes at high risk of acute heat-stress and dehydration during extreme heat events. Conversely in cold weather, our modelling indicated that there are higher cumulative energy costs for mammals, particularly smaller animals, occupying light-green boxes. Given their widespread use as a conservation tool, we suggest that before boxes are installed, consideration should be given to the effect of color on nest box temperature profiles, and the resultant thermal suitability of boxes for wildlife, particularly during extremes in weather. Managers of nest box programs should consider using several different colors and installing boxes across a range of both orientations and shade profiles (i.e., levels of canopy cover), to ensure target animals have access to artificial hollows with a broad range of thermal profiles, and can therefore choose boxes with optimal thermal conditions across different seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2610992815,"Impaired coagulation factor synthesis in cirrhosis causes a reduction of most pro- and anticoagulant factors. Cirrhosis patients show no clear bleeding or thrombotic phenotype, although they are at risk for both types of hemostatic event. Thrombin generation (TG) is a global coagulation test and its outcome depends on underlying pro- and anticoagulant processes (prothrombin conversion and thrombin inactivation). We quantified the prothrombin conversion and thrombin inactivation during TG in 30 healthy subjects and 52 Child-Pugh (CP-) A, 15 CP-B and 6 CP-C cirrhosis patients to test the hypothesis that coagulation is rebalanced in liver cirrhosis patients. Both prothrombin conversion and thrombin inactivation are reduced in cirrhosis patients. The effect on pro- and anticoagulant processes partially cancel each other out and as a result TG is comparable at 5 pM tissue factor between healthy subjects and patients. This supports the hypothesis of rebalanced hemostasis, as TG in cirrhosis patients remains within the normal range, despite large changes in prothrombin conversion and thrombin inactivation. Nevertheless, in silico analysis shows that normalization of either prothrombin conversion or thrombin inactivation to physiological levels, by for example the administration of prothrombin complex concentrates would cause an elevation of TG, whereas the normalization of both simultaneously maintains a balanced TG. Therefore, cirrhosis patients might require adapted hemostatic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2610493982,"The fluoride export protein (FEX) in yeast and other fungi provides tolerance to fluoride (F-), an environmentally ubiquitous anion. FEX efficiently eliminates intracellular fluoride that otherwise would accumulate at toxic concentrations. The FEX homolog in bacteria, Fluc, is a ‘double-barreled’ channel formed by dimerization of two identical or similar subunits. FEX in yeast and other eukaryotes is a monomer resulting from covalent fusion of the two subunits. As a result, both potential fluoride pores are created from different parts of the same protein. Here we identify FEX proteins from two multicellular eukaryotes, a plant Arabidopsis thaliana and an animal Amphimedon queenslandica, by demonstrating significant fluoride tolerance when these proteins are heterologously expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Residues important for eukaryotic FEX function were determined by phylogenetic sequence alignment and functional analysis using a yeast growth assay. Key residues of the fluoride channel are conserved in only one of the two potential fluoride-transporting pores. FEX activity is abolished upon mutation of residues in this conserved pore, suggesting that only one of the pores is functional. The same topology is conserved for the newly identified FEX proteins from plant and animal. These data suggest that FEX family of fluoride channels in eukaryotes are ‘single-barreled’ transporters containing one functional pore and a second non-functional vestigial remnant of a homologous gene fusion event."
https://openalex.org/W2611825236,"To develop an applicable prediction for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is still a challenge in clinical practice. We apply a modern machine learning method, the support vector machine to establish a predicting model for the severity of OSA. The support vector machine was applied to build up a prediction model based on three anthropometric features (neck circumference, waist circumference, and body mass index) and age on the first database. The established model was then valided independently on the second database. The anthropometric features and age were combined to generate powerful predictors for OSA. Following the common practice, we predict if a subject has the apnea-hypopnea index greater then 15 or not as well as 30 or not. Dividing by genders and age, for the AHI threhosld 15 (respectively 30), the cross validation and testing accuracy for the prediction were 85.3% and 76.7% (respectively 83.7% and 75.5%) in young female, while the negative likelihood ratio for the AHI threhosld 15 (respectively 30) for the cross validation and testing were 0.2 and 0.32 (respectively 0.06 and 0.1) in young female. The more accurate results with lower negative likelihood ratio in the younger patients, especially the female subgroup, reflect the potential of the proposed model for the screening purpose and the importance of approaching by different genders and the effects of aging."
https://openalex.org/W2611176044,"Previous studies have indicated that the monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1 (MCP-1), also referred to as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of sepsis, and this study investigated the clinical relevance of two MCP-1 gene polymorphisms on sepsis onset and progression. The Multiplex SNaPshot genotyping method was used to detect MCP-1 gene polymorphisms in the Chinese Han population (403 sepsis patients and 400 controls). MCP-1 mRNA expression levels were measured using real-time quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to analyze MCP-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) plasma concentrations. The rs1024611 polymorphism analysis showed lower frequencies of minor homozygous genotype (AA) and allele (A) in sepsis patients compared to the healthy controls (19.4% vs. 31.5%, P = 0.0001 and 45.9% vs. 54.8%, P = 0.0004, respectively). And the frequencies of GG genotype and G allele were lower in sepsis patients compared to the controls (19.6% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.0002 and 46.0% vs. 54.5%, P = 0.0007, respectively). The rs1024611 AG/GG and rs2857656 GC/CC genotypes were both overrepresented in patients with severe sepsis (both P = 0.0005) and septic shock (P = 0.010 and P = 0.015, respectively) compared to the patients with mild sepsis. Moreover, among sepsis patients, the rs1024611 AG/GG and rs2857656 GC/CC carriers exhibited significant increases in expression levels of MCP-1 (P = 0.025), TNF-α (P = 0.034) and IL-6 (P = 0.043) compared with the rs1024611 AA or rs2857656 GG carriers. This study provides valuable clinical evidence that the MCP-1/CCL2 polymorphisms rs1024611 and rs2857656 are associated with sepsis susceptibility and development. We conclude that MCP-1/CCL2 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of sepsis, which has potentially important therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2610373051,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen of varieties of oral mucous infection. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a pro-inflammatory factor and Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is a critical enzyme of PGE2 biosynthesis. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Staphylococcus aureus can increase PGE2 production of oral epithelial cells and how PGE2 functions in the growth and adherence of Staphylococcus aureus. mRNA levels of COX-2, fnbpA and fnbpB were estimated by quantitative PCR. PGE2 production was measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The binding biomass of Staphylococcus aureus to human fibronectin was investigated by crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy and the adherent force was measured by atomic force microscope (AFM). The COX-2 mRNA level and PGE2 production were increased by Staphylococcus aureus. PGE2 promoted the growth and biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, enhanced the attachment of Staphylococcus aureus to the human fibronectin as well as to the HOK cells. The transcription of fnbpB was up-regulated by PGE2 in both early and middle exponential phase but not fnbpA. These results suggest that the activation of COX-2/PGE2 pathway in oral epithelial cell by Staphylococcus aureus can in turn facilitate the growth and the ability to adhere of the pathogen. These findings uncover a new function of PGE2 and may lead to the potential of COX-2/PGE2 targeting in the therapy of inflammation and cancer in both which the COX-2/PGE2 pathway were observed activated."
https://openalex.org/W2611925740,"We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real-world setting.Seventy consecutive patients, for whom tofacitinib was initiated between November 2013 and May 2016, were enrolled. All patients fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA. All patients received 5 mg of tofacitinib twice daily and were followed for 24 weeks. Clinical disease activity indicated by disease activity score (DAS)28-ESR, the simplified disease activity index, and the clinical disease activity index as well as adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed to determine which baseline variables influenced the efficacy of tofacitinib at 24 weeks.Fifty-eight patients (82.9%) continued tofacitinib at 24 weeks. Clinical disease activity rapidly and significantly decreased, and this efficacy continued throughout the 24 weeks: i.e., DAS28-ESR decreased from 5.04 ± 1.33 at baseline to 3.83 ± 1.11 at 4 weeks and 3.53 ± 1.17 at 24 weeks (P<0.0001, vs. baseline). 15 AEs including 5 herpes zoster infection occurred during tofacitinib treatment. The efficacy of tofacitinib was not changed in patients without concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) or patients whose treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ) failed. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that the number of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) previously used was independently associated with achievement of DAS-low disease activity.Our present study suggests that tofacitinib is effective in real-world settings even without concomitant MTX use or after switching from TCZ. Our results also suggest that its efficacy diminishes if started after use of multiple bDMARDs."
https://openalex.org/W2611937927,"Metallic nanostructures (NSs) have been widely adapted in various applications and their physical, chemical, optical and catalytic properties are strongly dependent on their surface morphologies. In this work, the morphological and optical evolution of self-assembled Pt nanostructures on c-plane sapphire (0001) is demonstrated by the control of annealing temperature and dwelling duration with the distinct thickness of Pt films. The formation of Pt NSs is led by the surface diffusion, agglomeration and surface and interface energy minimization of Pt thin films, which relies on the growth parameters such as system temperature, film thickness and annealing duration. The Pt layer of 10 nm shows the formation of overlaying NPs below 650°C and isolated Pt nanoparticles above 700°C based on the enhanced surface diffusion and Volmer-Weber growth model whereas larger wiggly nanostructures are formed with 20 nm thick Pt layers based on the coalescence growth model. The morphologies of Pt nanostructures demonstrate a sharp distinction depending on the growth parameters applied. By the control of dwelling duration, the gradual transition from dense Pt nanoparticles to networks-like and large clusters is observed as correlated to the Rayleigh instability and Ostwald ripening. The various Pt NSs show a significant distinction in the reflectance spectra depending on the morphology evolution: i.e. the enhancement in UV-visible and NIR regions and the related optical properties are discussed in conjunction with the Pt NSs morphology and the surface coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2610396311,"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is widely used in the life sciences as chelating ligand of metal ions. However, formation of supramolecular EDTA aggregates at pH > 8 has been reported, which may lead to artifactual assay results. When applied as a buffer component at pH ≈ 10 in differential scanning fluorimetry (TSA) using SYPRO Orange as fluorescent dye, we observed a sharp change in fluorescence intensity about 20°C lower than expected for the investigated protein. We hypothesized that this change results from SYPRO Orange/EDTA interactions. TSA experiments in the presence of SYPRO Orange using solutions that contain EDTA-Na+ but no protein were performed. The TSA experiments provide evidence that suggests that at pH > 9, EDTA4- interacts with SYPRO Orange in a temperature-dependent manner, leading to a fluorescence signal yielding a ""denaturation temperature"" of ~68°C. Titrating Ca2+ to SYPRO Orange and EDTA solutions quenched fluorescence. Ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) behaved similarly to EDTA. Analytical ultracentrifugation corroborated the formation of EDTA aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations of free diffusion of EDTA-Na+ and SYPRO Orange of in total 27 μs suggested the first structural model of EDTA aggregates in which U-shaped EDTA4- arrange in an inverse bilayer-like manner, exposing ethylene moieties to the solvent, with which SYPRO Orange interacts. We conclude that EDTA aggregates induce a SYPRO Orange-based fluorescence in TSA. These results make it relevant to ascertain that future TSA results are not influenced by interference between EDTA, or EDTA-related molecules, and the fluorescent dye."
https://openalex.org/W2610885077,"Teneurins are a family of highly conserved pair-rule proteins involved in morphogenesis and development of the central nervous system. Their function in adult tissues and in disease is largely unknown. Recent evidence suggests a role for dysregulated expression of Teneurins in human tumors, but systematic investigations are missing. Here, we investigated Teneurin-2 and Teneurin-4 expression in various cancer cell lines and in ovarian tumor tissues. Teneurin-2 and Teneurin-4 were expressed in most of the breast cancer cell lines tested. Teneurin-4 was also detected in ovarian cancer cell lines, and throughout ovarian tumors and normal ovary tissue. Ovarian tumors with low Teneurin-4 expression showed less differentiated phenotypes and these patients had shorter mean overall survival. Similarly, Teneurin-2 expression correlated with overall survival as well, especially in patients with serous tumors. In the various cell lines, 5-Aza-cytidine-induced changes in DNA methylation did not alter expression of Teneurin-2 and Teneurin-4, despite the existence of predicted CpG islands in both genes. Interestingly, however, we found evidence for the control of Teneurin-2 expression by the oncogenic growth factor FGF8. Furthermore, we identified multiple transcript splicing variants for Teneurin-2 and Teneurin-4, indicating complex gene expression patterns in malignant cells. Finally, downregulation of Teneurin-4 expression using siRNA caused a cell-type dependent increase in proliferation and resistance to cisplatin. Altogether, our data suggest that low Teneurin-4 expression provides a growth advantage to cancer cells and marks an undifferentiated state characterized by increased drug resistance and clinical aggressiveness. We conclude that Teneurin-2 and Teneurin-4 expression levels could be of prognostic value in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2611299525,"Until recently, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of oral anticoagulant treatment with bleeding as the most prevalent adverse effect. One to four percent of patients experience major bleeding episodes, while clinically relevant bleeding occurs in up to 20%. At this moment no laboratory assays are available to identify patients at risk for bleeding. With this study we aimed to investigate whether thrombin generation tests might identify a bleeding risk in patients taking VKAs. This prospective cohort study included 129 patients taking VKAs for more than three months. Calibrated automated thrombinography (CAT) was performed in whole blood, platelet rich and platelet poor plasma. Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentrations and the International Normalized Ratio (INR) were defined and coagulation factor levels were measured. Forty clinically relevant bleeding episodes were registered in 26 patients during follow-up. No differences were found in plasma CAT parameters or INR values. Bleeding was not associated with age, sex, hematocrit, hemoglobin levels or coagulation factor levels. In whole blood a significantly lower endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and peak were found in patients with bleeding (median ETP: 182.5 versus 256.2 nM.min, p = 0.002; peak: 23.9 versus 39.1 nM, p = 0.029). Additionally, the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC ROC) was significantly associated with bleeding (ETP: 0.700, p = 0.002; peak: 0.642, p = 0.029). HAS-BLED scores were also significantly higher in bleeding patients (3 versus 2, p = 0.003), with an AUC ROC 0.682 (p = 0.004). In conclusion, bleeding in patients taking VKAs is associated with a decreased whole blood ETP and peak as well as with an increased HAS-BLED score."
https://openalex.org/W2610715130,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs), which contain the regulation part of the retrovirus. Remaining HERVs constitute 7% to 8% of the present day human genome, and most have been identified as solo LTRs. The HERV sequences have been associated with several molecular functions as well as certain diseases in human, but their roles in human diseases are yet to be established. We designed EnHERV to make accessible the identified endogenous retrovirus repetitive sequences from Repbase Update (a database of eukaryotic repetitive elements) that are present in the human genome. Defragmentation process was done to improve the RepeatMasker annotation output. The defragmented elements were used as core database in EnHERV. EnHERV is available at http://sysbio.chula.ac.th/enherv and can be searched using either gene lists of user interest or HERV characteristics. Besides the search function, EnHERV also provides an enrichment analysis function that allows users to perform enrichment analysis between selected HERV characteristics and user-input gene lists, especially genes with the expression profile of a certain disease. EnHERV will facilitate exploratory studies of specific HERV characteristics that control gene expression patterns related to various disease conditions. Here we analyzed 25 selected HERV groups/names from all four HERV superfamilies, using the sense and anti-sense directions of the HERV and gene expression profiles from 49 specific tissue and disease conditions. We found that intragenic HERVs were associated with down-regulated genes in most cancer conditions and in psoriatic skin tissues and associated with up-regulated genes in immune cells particularly from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. EnHERV allowed the analysis of how different types of LTRs were differentially associated with specific gene expression profiles in particular disease conditions for further studies into their mechanisms and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2611016121,"The dynamics of evaporating sessile droplets on hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces is widely studied, and many models for these processes have been developed based on experimental evidence. However, few research has been explored on the evaporation of sessile droplets of surfactant or pesticide solutions on target crop leaves. Thus, in this paper the impact of surfactant concentrations on contact angle, contact diameter, droplet height, and evolution of the droplets' evaporative volume on rice leaf surfaces have been investigated. The results indicate that the evaporation kinetics of surfactant droplets on rice leaves were influenced by both the surfactant concentrations and the hydrophobicity of rice leaf surfaces. When the surfactant concentration is lower than the surfactant CMC (critical micelle concentration), the droplet evaporation time is much longer than that of the high surfactant concentration. This is due to the longer existence time of a narrow wedge region under the lower surfactant concentration, and such narrow wedge region further restricts the droplet evaporation. Besides, our experimental data are shown to roughly collapse onto theoretical curves based on the model presented by Popov. This study could supply theoretical data on the evaporation of the adjuvant or pesticide droplets for practical applications in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2610174736,"Mechanical tension is widely applied on the suture to modulate the growth of craniofacial bones. Deeply understanding the features of bone formation in expanding sutures could help us to improve the outcomes of clinical treatment and avoid some side effects. Although there are reports that have uncovered some biological characteristics, the regular pattern of sutural bone formation in response to expansion forces is still unknown. Our study was to investigate the shape, arrangement and orientation of new bone formation in expanding sutures and explore related clinical implications. The premaxillary sutures of rat, which histologically resembles the sutures of human beings, became wider progressively under stretch force. Micro-CT detected new bones at day 3. Morphologically, these bones were forming in a finger-like pattern, projecting from the maxillae into the expanded sutures. There were about 4 finger-like bones appearing on the selected micro-CT sections at day 3 and this number increased to about 18 at day 7. The average length of these projections increased from 0.14 mm at day 3 to 0.81 mm at day 7. The volume of these bony protuberances increased to the highest level of 0.12 mm3 at day 7. HE staining demonstrated that these finger-like bones had thick bases connecting with the maxillae and thin fronts stretching into the expanded suture. Nasal sections had a higher frequency of finger-like bones occuring than the oral sections at day 3 and day 5. Masson-stained sections showed stretched fibers embedding into maxillary margins. Osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts changed their shapes from cuboidal to spindle and covered the surfaces of finger-like bones continuously. Alizarin red S and calcein deposited in the inner and outer layers of finger-like bones respectively, which showed that longer and larger bones formed on the nasal side of expanded sutures compared with the oral side. Interestingly, these finger-like bones were almost paralleling with the direction of stretch force. Inclined force led to inclined finger-like bones formation and deflection of bilateral maxillae. Additionally, heavily compressive force caused fracture of finger-like bones in the sutures. These data together proposed the special finger-like pattern of bone formation in sutures guided by stretch force, providing important implications for maxillary expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2610713765,"For plant-eating insects, we still have only a nascent understanding of the genetic basis of host-use promiscuity. Here, to improve that situation, we investigated host-induced gene expression plasticity in the invasive lobate lac scale insect, Paratachardina pseudolobata (Hemiptera: Keriidae). We were particularly interested in the differential expression of detoxification and effector genes, which are thought to be critical for overcoming a plant’s chemical defenses. We collected RNA samples from P. pseudolobata on three different host plant species, assembled transcriptomes de novo, and identified transcripts with significant host-induced gene expression changes. Gene expression plasticity was pervasive, but the expression of most detoxification and effector genes was insensitive to the host environment. Nevertheless, some types of detoxification genes were more differentially expressed than expected by chance. Moreover, we found evidence of a trade-off between expression of genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism; hosts that induced lower expression of genes for detoxification induced higher expression of genes for growth. Our findings are largely consonant with those of several recently published studies of other plant-eating insect species. Thus, across plant-eating insect species, there may be a common set of gene expression changes that enable host-use promiscuity."
https://openalex.org/W2611134436,"Humans tend to perceive inanimate objects as animate based on simple motion cues. So far this perceptual bias has been studied mostly in humans by utilizing two-dimensional video and interactive displays. Considering its importance for survival, the perception of animacy is probably also widespread among animals, however two-dimensional displays are not necessarily the best approach to study the phenomenon in non-human species. Here we applied a novel method to study whether dogs recognize a dependent (chasing-like) movement pattern performed by inanimate agents in live demonstration. We found that dogs showed more interest toward the agents that demonstrated the chasing-like motion, compared to those that were involved in the independent movement. We suggest that dogs spontaneously recognized the chasing-like pattern and thus they may have considered the interacting partners as animate agents. This methodological approach may be useful to test perceptual animacy in other non-human species."
https://openalex.org/W2611838232,"Studies surveying melanomas associated with melanocytic nevi in Asia are rare. In this study, we examined whether nevus-associated melanomas differ from de novo melanomas in terms of their associations with clinical factors, histologic characteristics, and patient survival in Taiwan. Using data on cancer cases obtained from the Department of Pathology archives and the Cancer Registry of National Taiwan University Hospital, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 103 consecutive melanoma patients who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 and received follow-up through November 2016. Approximately 17.5% of the melanomas in question were associated with a nevus. In patients under 65 years of age, non-acral lentiginous melanomas were significantly associated with a higher percentage of nevus-associated melanomas. The superficial spreading subtype, younger patient age, thinner tumor, intermittent solar exposure, and early stage were significant predictors of a melanoma being histologically associated with a nevus. The appearance of a nevus associated with a melanoma predicted better recurrence-free survival compared with de novo melanomas. Although acral lentiginous melanomas (70.9%) constituted the most common histologic subtype, only 9.6% of the acral lentiginous melanomas were associated with a nevus. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference between the nevus-associated and de novo acral lentiginous melanomas with regard to clinicopathological factors and survival. In conclusion, nevus-associated melanomas were uncommon among acral lentiginous melanomas. Relatedly, because over half of all melanomas in Asians are acral lentiginous melanomas, Asians are less likely than Caucasians to have nevus-associated melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2611270920,"People reliably encode information more effectively when it is related in some way to the self—a phenomenon known as the self-reference effect. This effect has been recognized in psychological research for almost 40 years, and its scope as a tool for investigating the self-concept is still expanding. The self-reference effect has been used within a broad range of psychological research, from cultural to neuroscientific, cognitive to clinical. Traditionally, the self-reference effect has been investigated in a laboratory context, which limits its applicability in non-laboratory samples. This paper introduces an online version of the self-referential encoding paradigm that yields reliable effects in an easy-to-administer procedure. Across four studies (total N = 658), this new online tool reliably replicated the traditional self-reference effect: in all studies self-referentially encoded words were recalled significantly more than semantically encoded words (d = 0.63). Moreover, the effect sizes obtained with this online tool are similar to those obtained in laboratory samples, and are robust to experimental variations in encoding time (Studies 1 and 2) and recall procedure (Studies 3 and 4), and persist independent of primacy and recency effects (all studies)."
https://openalex.org/W2611338388,"Light scattering is a well-established experimental technique, which gains more and more popularity in the biological field because it offers the means for non-invasive imaging and detection. However, the interpretation of light-scattering signals remains challenging due to the complexity of most biological systems. Here, we investigate static and dynamic scattering properties of red blood cells (RBCs) using two mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulation methods—multi-particle collision dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics. Light scattering is studied for various membrane shear elasticities, bending rigidities, and RBC shapes (e.g., biconcave and stomatocyte). Simulation results from the two simulation methods show good agreement, and demonstrate that the static light scattering of a diffusing RBC is not very sensitive to the changes in membrane properties and moderate alterations in cell shapes. We also compute dynamic light scattering of a diffusing RBC, from which dynamic properties of RBCs such as diffusion coefficients can be accessed. In contrast to static light scattering, the dynamic measurements can be employed to differentiate between the biconcave and stomatocytic RBC shapes and generally allow the differentiation based on the membrane properties. Our simulation results can be used for better understanding of light scattering by RBCs and the development of new non-invasive methods for blood-flow monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2610708823,"In the current study, we report for the first time that grain components of barley, rice, wheat and maize can inhibit the activity of Aspergillus ficuum phytase. The phytase inhibition is dose dependent and varies significantly between cereal species, between cultivars of barley and cultivars of wheat and between Fusarium graminearum infected and non-infected wheat grains. The highest endpoint level of phytase activity inhibition was 90%, observed with grain protein extracts (GPE) from F. graminearum infected wheat. Wheat GPE from grains infected with F. graminearum inhibits phytase activity significantly more than GPE from non-infected grains. For four barley cultivars studied, the IC50 value ranged from 0.978 ± 0.271 to 3.616 ± 0.087 mg×ml-1. For two non-infected wheat cultivars investigated, the IC50 values were varying from 2.478 ± 0.114 to 3.038 ± 0.097 mg×ml-1. The maize and rice cultivars tested gaveIC50 values on 0.983 ± 0.205 and 1.972 ± 0.019 mg×ml-1, respectively. After purifying the inhibitor from barley grains via Superdex G200, an approximately 30-35 kDa protein was identified. No clear trend for the mechanism of inhibition could be identified via Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Lineweaver-Burk plots. However, testing of the purified phytase inhibitor together with the A. ficuum phytase and the specific protease inhibitors pepstatin A, E64, EDTA and PMSF revealed that pepstatin A repealed the phytase inhibition. This indicates that the observed inhibition of A. ficuum phytase by cereal grain extracts is caused by protease activity of the aspartic proteinase type."
https://openalex.org/W2611297527,"The human pathogenic amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii (A. castellanii) causes severe diseases, including acanthamoeba keratitis and encephalitis. Pathogenicity arises from the killing of target-cells by an extracellular killing mechanism, where the crucial first step is the formation of a close contact between A. castellanii and the target-cell. This process is mediated by the glycocalix of the target-cell and mannose has been identified as key mediator. The aim of the present study was to carry out a detailed biophysical investigation of mannose-mediated adhesion of A. castellanii using force spectroscopy on single trophozoites. In detail, we studied the interaction of a mannose-coated cantilever with an A. castellanii trophozoite, as mannose is the decisive part of the cellular glycocalix in mediating pathogenicity. We observed a clear increase of the force to initiate cantilever detachment from the trophozoite with increasing contact time. This increase is also associated with an increase in the work of detachment. Furthermore, we also analyzed single rupture events during the detachment process and found that single rupture processes are associated with membrane tether formation, suggesting that the cytoskeleton is not involved in mannose binding events during the first few seconds of contact. Our study provides an experimental and conceptual basis for measuring interactions between pathogens and target-cells at different levels of complexity and as a function of interaction time, thus leading to new insights into the biophysical mechanisms of parasite pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2611849660,"Osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes are shown to express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which produces high concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), particularly when stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines. NO is involved in OA cartilage degradation. On the other hand, c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway mediates the activation and transcription of c-Jun, which is required for interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induction of matrix metalloproteinases-13 (MMP-13) in OA pathogenesis. Therefore, the selective inhibition of iNOS and c-Jun is a promising target for treatment and prevention of OA. The purpose of the study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of pentosan polysulfate (PPS) on IL-1β-induced iNOS, c-Jun and HIF-α isoforms upregulation in canine articular chondrocytes (CACs). Primary (P0) chondrocytes were isolated and cultured from femoral head cartilages of three (3) dogs. First passage (P1) chondrocytes were preincubated with 0, 1, 5, 15 and 40 μg/mL of PPS for 4 hr before treatment with 10 ng/mL rhIL-1β for a further 8 hr. In addition, we evaluated the effects of single and multiple cytokine with or without LPS on iNOS protein induction. PPS significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) IL-1β-induced iNOS, c-Jun and HIF-1α mRNA upregulation in a dose-dependent pattern. iNOS mRNA was significantly inhibited at 15 and 40 μg/mL whereas c-Jun and HIF-1α were significantly downregulated at 5, 15 and 40 μg/mL of PPS compared to chondrocytes treated with only rhIL-1β. Intriguingly, CACs were recalcitrant to single IL-1β, TNF-α or LPS-induction of iNOS protein including to a combination of IL-1β+TNF-α, IL-1β+LPS except to TNF-α+LPS and IL-1β+TNF-α+LPS suggestive of a protective mechanism from iNOS detrimental effects on perpetuating OA. IL-1β+TNF-α+LPS-induced iNOS protein expression was significantly abrogated by PPS. We demonstrate for the first time that PPS is a novel inhibitor of IL-1β-induced iNOS, c-Jun, and HIF-1α mRNA upregulation and iNOS protein induction which may be beneficial for prevention and treatment OA."
https://openalex.org/W2610164598,"Culture based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is time consuming therefore rapid genotypic methods are increasingly being utilized. We previously developed and evaluated on TB isolates a rapid genotypic TaqMan array card (TAC) that detects mutations in several resistance-associated genes using dozens of primer pairs, probes, and high resolution melt analysis, with >96% accuracy versus Sanger sequencing. In this study we examined the performance of TAC on sputum, comparing results between 71 paired sputum and TB isolates of which 62 were MDR-TB. We also adapted the TAC to include wild-type probes and broadened coverage for rpoB and gyrA mutations. TAC was 89% successful at detecting wild-type or mutations within inhA, katG, rpoB, eis, gyrA, rplC, and pncA on smear positive sputa and 33% successful on smear negative sputa. The overall accuracy of these detections as compared to the TAC results of the paired isolate was 95% ± 7 (average sensitivity 98% ± 3; specificity 92% ± 14). Accuracy of sputum TAC results versus phenotypic DST for isoniazid, rifampin, ofloxacin/moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide was 85% ± 12. This was similar to that of the isolate TAC results (accuracy 88% ± 13), thus inaccuracies primarily reflected intrinsic genotypic-phenotypic discordance. The TAC is a rapid, modular, comprehensive, and accurate TB DST for the major first and second line TB drugs and could be used for supplemental testing of GeneXpert resistant smear positive sputum."
https://openalex.org/W2610205364,"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who have neurodevelopmental impairments in social communication often refuse to go to school because of difficulties in learning in class. The exact cause of maladaptation to school in such children is unknown. We hypothesized that these children have difficulty in paying attention to objects at which teachers are pointing. We performed gaze behavior analysis of children with ASD to understand their difficulties in the classroom. The subjects were 26 children with ASD (19 boys and 7 girls; mean age, 8.6 years) and 27 age-matched children with typical development (TD) (14 boys and 13 girls; mean age, 8.2 years). We measured eye movements of the children while they performed free viewing of two movies depicting actual classes: a Japanese class in which a teacher pointed at cartoon characters and an arithmetic class in which the teacher pointed at geometric figures. In the analysis, we defined the regions of interest (ROIs) as the teacher's face and finger, the cartoon characters and geometric figures at which the teacher pointed, and the classroom wall that contained no objects. We then compared total gaze time for each ROI between the children with ASD and TD by two-way ANOVA. Children with ASD spent less gaze time on the cartoon characters pointed at by the teacher; they spent more gaze time on the wall in both classroom scenes. We could differentiate children with ASD from those with TD almost perfectly by the proportion of total gaze time that children with ASD spent looking at the wall. These results suggest that children with ASD do not follow the teacher's instructions in class and persist in gazing at inappropriate visual areas such as walls. Thus, they may have difficulties in understanding content in class, leading to maladaptation to school."
https://openalex.org/W2610337300,"Importance The pain associated with vertebral compression fractures can cause significant loss of function and quality of life for older adults. Despite this, there is little consensus on how best to manage this condition. Objective To describe usual care provided by general practitioners (GPs) in Australia for the management of vertebral compression fractures. Design, setting and participants Data from the Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health (BEACH) program collected between April 2005 and March 2015 was used for this study. Each year, a random sample of approximately 1,000 GPs each recorded information on 100 consecutive encounters. We selected those encounters at which vertebral compression fracture was managed. Analyses of management options were limited to encounters with patients aged 50 years or over. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) i) patient demographics; ii) diagnoses/problems managed; iii) the management provided for vertebral compression fracture during the encounter. Robust 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for the cluster survey design, were used to assess significant differences between group means. Results Vertebral compression fractures were managed in 211 (0.022%; 95% CI: 0.018–0.025) of the 977,300 BEACH encounters recorded April 2005– March 2015. That provides a national annual estimate of 26,000 (95% CI: 22,000–29,000) encounters at which vertebral fractures were managed. At encounters with patients aged 50 years or over (those at higher risk of primary osteoporosis), prescription of analgesics was the most common management action, particularly opioids analgesics (47.1 per 100 vertebral fractures; 95% CI: 38.4–55.7). Prescriptions of paracetamol (8.2; 95% CI: 4–12.4) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (4.1; 95% CI: 1.1–7.1) were less frequent. Non-pharmacological treatment was provided at a rate of 22.4 per 100 vertebral fractures (95% CI: 14.6–30.1). At least one referral (to hospital, specialist, allied health care or other) was given for 12.3 per 100 vertebral fractures (95% CI: 7.8–16.8). Conclusions and relevance The prescription of oral opioid analgesics remains the common general practice approach for vertebral compression fractures management, despite the lack of evidence to support this. Clinical trials addressing management of these fractures are urgently needed to improve the quality of care patients receive."
https://openalex.org/W2610843212,"Zoophytophagous predators can substitute zoophagy for phytophagy to complete their development and reproduction. In such predators, variation in feeding behaviour is observed both across and within populations. This may be caused by genetic variation in diet specialization, some genotypes specializing on plant resources, whereas others rely mostly on prey to meet their energy and nutriment requirements. We tested the hypothesis that genotypes specialize either on prey or plant resources in the zoophytophagous mullein bug Campylomma verbasci. In the laboratory, we reared 11 isogroup lines of the mullein bug and recorded feeding behaviour on two diets. The first diet was composed of two-spotted spider mites and leaves, and in the second we added pollen, a high-quality vegetal resource. Overall differences in zoophagy among isogroup lines remained consistent regardless of the presence or absence of pollen. While some lines were insensitive to changes in trophic resource composition others switched from prey to pollen feeding when the pollen was available, revealing a negative genetic correlation between the probabilities of feeding on both resources. A significant line by diet interaction in the proportion of time spent feeding on prey in presence or absence of pollen indicated a genetic basis for diet preference. In absence of the preferred resource, nymphs act as generalists, but exhibited individual diet specialisation when facing the choice between high-quality animal and vegetal resources. Results suggest that zoophytophagous predators can exhibit genetic variation in diet preference, which can generate important ecological and economic differences in natural or agricultural systems."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of PD-0332991 in endometrial cancer.Four human endometrial cancer cell lines, ECC, HEC1A, HEC108 and TEN, were treated with PD-0332991 and their function was evaluated. In vivo, the therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a model of subcutaneous endometrial cancer. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed in 337 endometrial cancer specimens. A proliferation assay revealed that 2 of the 4 cell lines that expressed Rb were sensitive to PD-0332991 with an IC50 of 0.65 μM (HEC1A) and 0.58 μM (HEC108), respectively. Both cell lines had G0/G1 cell cycle arrest after treatment with PD-0332991 according to flow cytometry. In vivo, PD-0332991 had antitumoral efficacy with a reduction in the activity of Ki67 and phosphorylation of Rb. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the positive rate of Rb was 67.7%, however, there was no significant relationship between the expression levels of Rb and the tumor grade.PD-0332991 had therapeutic potential against endometrial cancer cell lines expressing Rb protein. Our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that approximately 70% of patients with endometrial cancer might have therapeutic indications for PD-0332991. Of note, the tumor grade had no impact on the indications for treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2611635389,"The purpose of this study was to compare components of cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors of 20 family caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients to those of age, gender, and race/ethnicity-matched controls. A prospective, repeated measures design was used to compare cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors in caregivers and controls at three time-points: pre-transplantation, discharge, and six weeks post-discharge. Measures included components of metabolic syndrome, Reynolds Risk Score, NMR serum lipoprotein particle analyses, and the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II). Mixed-model repeated measure analyses were used. There were no between or within group differences in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. There was a significant interaction effect between time and role in large VLDL concentration (VLDL-P) (F (2, 76) = 4.36, p = .016), with the trajectory of large VLDL-P increasing over time in caregivers while remaining stable in controls. Within caregivers, VLDL particle size (VLDL-Z) was significantly larger at time-point three compared to time-points one (p = .015) and two (p = .048), and VLDL-Z was significantly larger in caregivers than in controls at time point three (p = .012). HPLP-II scores were lower in caregivers than controls at all time-points (p < .01). These findings suggest that caregiving may have a bigger impact on triglycerides than on other lipids, and it is through this pathway that caregivers may be at increased cardiometabolic risk. More sensitive measurement methods, such as NMR lipoprotein particle analyses, may be able to detect early changes in cardiometabolic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2610751175,"The recognition of sound patterns in speech or music (e.g., a melody that is played in different keys) requires knowledge about pitch relations between successive sounds. We investigated the formation of regularity representations for sound patterns in an event-related potential (ERP) study. A pattern, which consisted of six concatenated 50 ms tone segments differing in fundamental frequency, was presented 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 times and then replaced by another pattern by randomly changing the pitch of the tonal segments (roving standard paradigm). In an absolute repetition condition, patterns were repeated identically, whereas in a transposed condition, only the pitch relations of the tonal segments of the patterns were repeated, while the entire patterns were shifted up or down in pitch. During ERP measurement participants were not informed about the pattern repetition rule, but were instructed to discriminate rarely occurring targets of lower or higher sound intensity. EPRs for pattern changes (mismatch negativity, MMN; and P3a) and for pattern repetitions (repetition positivity, RP) revealed that the auditory system is able to rapidly extract regularities from unfamiliar complex sound patterns even when absolute pitch varies. Yet, enhanced RP and P3a amplitudes, and improved behavioral performance measured in a post-hoc test, in the absolute as compared with the transposed condition suggest that it is more difficult to encode patterns without absolute pitch information. This is explained by dissociable processing of standards and deviants as well as a back propagation mechanism to early sensory processing stages, which is effective after less repetitions of a standard stimulus for absolute pitch."
https://openalex.org/W2610510293,"The stochastic nature of neuronal response has lead to conjectures about the impact of input fluctuations on the neural coding. For the most part, low pass membrane integration and spike threshold dynamics have been the primary features assumed in the transfer from synaptic input to output spiking. Phasic neurons are a common, but understudied, neuron class that are characterized by a subthreshold negative feedback that suppresses spike train responses to low frequency signals. Past work has shown that when a low frequency signal is accompanied by moderate intensity broadband noise, phasic neurons spike trains are well locked to the signal. We extend these results with a simple, reduced model of phasic activity that demonstrates that a non-Markovian spike train structure caused by the negative feedback produces a noise-enhanced coding. Further, this enhancement is sensitive to the timescales, as opposed to the intensity, of a driving signal. Reduced hazard function models show that noise-enhanced phasic codes are both novel and separate from classical stochastic resonance reported in non-phasic neurons. The general features of our theory suggest that noise-enhanced codes in excitable systems with subthreshold negative feedback are a particularly rich framework to study."

However, the genes involved in Pekin duck embryonic breast muscle development have not been explored to date. In this study, we investigated gene expression profiles in Pekin Duck embryonic breast muscle at hatched day 13 (E13), E19, and E27 using RNA-seq. In total, we produced 519,312,178 raw reads resulting in 497,348,158 high-quality reads after filtering. The mapping, distribution of reads along annotated genes, and consistency across replicates demonstrates the high quality of the RNA-seq data used in this study, allowing us to continue with the downstream analysis. Significantly fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between E13 and E19 (203 DEGs) compared to E27 and E19 (2,797 DEGs). Many DEGs highly expressed in E19 are involved in metabolic processes and cell division. KEGG analysis showed many pathways associated with fat development were significantly enriched for DEGs highly expressed in E27. These results provide a basis for the further investigation of the mechanisms involved in Pekin duck embryonic breast muscle development."

However, it is not known whether the emergence of X4 variants is the cause or result of HIV-1 disease progression. We tried to answer this question.HIV-1 env sequences around the V3 region were analyzed in serially stocked samples in order to determine whether X4 variants emerged before or after the fall in CD4+ T-cell count.The study subjects were five HIV-1-infected hemophiliac slow progressors. Deep sequencing around the HIV-1 env V3 region was conducted in duplicate. Tropism was predicted by geno2pheno [coreceptor] 2.5 with cutoff value of false positive ratio at <5%. When X4 variant was identified in the latest stocked sample before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, we checked viral genotype in previously stocked samples to determine the time of emergence of X4 variants.Emergence of X4 variants was noted in two of the five patients when their CD4+ T-cell counts were still high. The rate of decrease of CD4+ T-cell count or of rise of HIV-1 load accelerated significantly after the emergence of X4 variants in these two cases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these X4 variants emerged from CCR5-tropic HIV-1 viruses with several amino acid changes in the V3 region.The emergence of X4 variants preceded HIV-1 disease progression in two hemophiliac slow progressors."

Mutations within MYO7A can lead to either non syndromic hearing loss or to the Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B). Here, we report the results of genetic analyses performed on Moroccan families with autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss that identified two families with compound heterozygous MYO7A mutations. Five mutations (c.6025delG, c.6229T>A, c.3500T>A, c.5617C>T and c.4487C>A) were identified in these families, the latter presenting two differently affected branches. Multiple bioinformatics programs and molecular modelling predicted the pathogenic effect of these mutations. In conclusion, the absence of vestibular and retinal symptom in the affected patients suggests that these families have the isolated non-syndromic hearing loss DFNB2 (nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss) presentation, instead of USH1B."
https://openalex.org/W2611928620,"Among the adaptations of aquatic species during evolution of terrestrial tetrapods was the development of an epidermis preventing desiccation. In present day mammals, keratinocytes of the epidermis, using a membrane-bound transglutaminase (Tgm1), accomplish this function by synthesizing a scaffold of cross-linked protein to which a lipid envelope is attached. This study characterizes the abilities of two homologous transglutaminase isozymes in the teleost fish tilapia to form cross-linked protein structures and their expression in certain tissues. Results indicate they are capable of membrane localization and of generating cellular structures resistant to detergent solubilization. They are both expressed in epithelial cells of the lip, buccal cavity and tips of gill filaments. Adaptation of transglutaminase use in evolution of terrestrial keratinocytes evidently involved refinements in tissue expression, access to suitable substrate proteins and activation of cross-linking during terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2611757667,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial dysfunction induces retrograde signaling, a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus that promotes a metabolic remodeling to ensure sufficient biosynthetic precursors for replication. Rtg2p is a positive modulator of this pathway that is also required for cellular longevity. This protein belongs to the ASKHA superfamily, and contains a putative N-terminal ATP-binding domain, but there is no detailed structural and functional map of the residues in this domain that accounts for their contribution to retrograde signaling and aging. Here we use Decomposition of Residue Correlation Networks and site-directed mutagenesis to identify Rtg2p structural determinants of retrograde signaling and longevity. We found that most of the residues involved in retrograde signaling surround the ATP-binding loops, and that Rtg2p N-terminus is divided in three regions whose mutants have different aging phenotypes. We also identified E137, D158 and S163 as possible residues involved in stabilization of ATP at the active site. The mutants shown here may be used to map other Rtg2p activities that crosstalk to other pathways of the cell related to genomic stability and aging."

In the present study, the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using specific antibodies against Pho1 and Dpe1 demonstrated that these two enzymes can form a complex (the PD complex) in Ipomoea batatas storage roots. The immunohistochemistry analyses also revealed the co-localization of Pho1 and Dpe1 in the amyloplasts, and the protein levels of Pho1 and Dpe1 increased gradually throughout sweet potato storage root development. A high molecular weight PD complex was co-purified from sweet potato storage root lysates by size exclusion chromatography. Enzyme kinetic analyses showed that the PD complex can catalyze maltotriose and maltotetraose to generate glucose-1-phosphate in the presence of inorganic phosphate, and it also performs greater Dpe1 activity toward MOSs than does free form Dpe1. These data suggest that Pho1 and Dpe1 may form a metabolon complex, which provides elevated metabolic fluxes for MOS metabolism via a direct transfer of sugar intermediates, resulting in recycling of glucosyl units back into amylopectin biosynthesis more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2610890674,"Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. is an invasive species with highly allergenic pollens. Ragweed originates from North America, but it also occurs and is spreading in Europe, causing seasonal allergic rhinitis for millions of people. Recently, the herb of A. artemisiifolia has gained popularity as medicinal plant and food. The effects of its long-term intake are unknown; there are no toxicological data to support the safe use of this plant. The aim of our study was to assess the repeated dose toxicity of A. artemisiifolia on animals. Ragweed puree was administered in low dose (500 mg/kg b. w.) and high dose (1000 mg/kg b. w.) to male Wistar rats according to 407 OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals. Clinical symptoms, various blood chemical parameters, body weight and organ weights of the rats were measured. Reduced liver function enzymes (AST, ALT), reduced triglyceride level in the low dose and increased carbamide level in the high dose group were observed. The weight of the liver relative to body weight was significantly reduced in both groups, while the brain weight relative to body weight was significantly elevated in both groups. According to our results, the repeated use of ragweed resulted in toxic effects in rats and these results question the safety of long-term human consumption of common ragweed."
https://openalex.org/W2610652199,"Proximal imaging remote sensing technologies are used to phenotype and to characterize organisms based on specific external body reflectance features. These imaging technologies are gaining interest and becoming more widely used and applied in ecological, systematic, evolutionary, and physiological studies of plants and also of animals. However, important factors may impact the quality and consistency of body reflectance features and therefore the ability to use these technologies as part of non-invasive phenotyping and characterization of organisms. We acquired hyperspectral body reflectance profiles from three insect species, and we examined how preparation procedures and preservation time affected the ability to detect reflectance responses to gender, origin, and age. Different portions of the radiometric spectrum varied markedly in their sensitivity to preparation procedures and preservation time. Based on studies of three insect species, we successfully identified specific radiometric regions, in which phenotypic traits become significantly more pronounced based on either: 1) gentle cleaning of museum specimens with distilled water, or 2) killing and preserving insect specimens in 70% ethanol. Standardization of killing and preservation procedures will greatly increase the ability to use proximal imaging remote sensing technologies as part of phenotyping and also when used in ecological and evolutionary studies of invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2611058425,"Inactivating mutations of the hypothalamic transcription factor singleminded1 (SIM1) have been shown as a cause of early-onset severe obesity. However, to date, the contribution of SIM1 mutations to the obesity phenotype has only been studied in a few populations. In this study, we screened the functional regions of SIM1 in severely obese children of Slovak and Moravian descent to determine if genetic variants within SIM1 may influence the development of obesity in these populations.The SIM1 promoter region, exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced in 126 unrelated obese children and adolescents (2-18 years of age) and 41 adult lean controls of Slovak and Moravian origin. Inclusion criteria for the children and adolescents were a body mass index standard deviation score higher than 2 SD for an appropriate age and sex, and obesity onset at less than 5 years of age. The clinical phenotypes of the SIM1 variant carriers were compared with clinical phenotypes of 4 MC4R variant carriers and with 27 unrelated SIM1 and MC4R mutation negative obese controls that were matched for age and gender.Seven previously described SIM1 variants and one novel heterozygous variant p.D134N were identified. The novel variant was predicted to be pathogenic by 7 in silico software analyses and is located at a highly conserved position of the SIM1 protein. The p.D134N variant was found in an 18 year old female proband (BMI 44.2kg/m2; +7.5 SD), and in 3 obese family members. Regardless of early onset severe obesity, the proband and her brother (age 16 years) did not fulfill the criteria of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the variant carriers had significantly lower preferences for high sugar (p = 0.02) and low fat, low carbohydrate, high protein (p = 0.02) foods compared to the obese controls.We have identified a novel SIM1 variant, p.D134N, in 4 obese individuals from a single pedigree which is also associated with lower preference for certain foods."
https://openalex.org/W2610289494,"A number of chemical compounds have been shown to induce liver tumors in mice but not in other species. While several mechanisms for this species-specific tumorigenicity have been proposed, no definitive mechanism has been established. We examined the effects of the nongenotoxic rodent hepatic carcinogen, WY-14,643, in male mice from a high liver tumor susceptible strain (C3H/HeJ), and from a low tumor susceptible strain (C57BL/6). WY-14,643, a PPARα activator induced widespread increases in the expression of some endogenous retroelements, namely members of LTR and LINE elements in both strains. The expression of a number of known retroviral defense genes was also elevated. We also demonstrated that basal immune-mediated viral defense was elevated in C57BL/6 mice (the resistant strain) and that WY-14,643 further activated those immuno-defense processes. We propose that the previously reported >100X activity of retroelements in mice drives mouse-specific tumorigenicity. We also propose that C57BL/6's competent immune to retroviral activation allows it to remove cells before the activation of these elements can result in significant chromosomal insertions and mutation. Finally, we showed that WY-14,643 treatment induced gene signatures of DNA recombination in the sensitive C3H/HeJ strain."

Studies in TAFI-deficient mice have implicated a potential role for TAFI in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) disease. The role of TAFI inhibition on AAA formation in adult ApoE-/- mice is unknown. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of TAFI inhibition on AAA development and progression.Using the Angiotensin II model of AAA, male ApoE-/- mice were infused with Angiotensin II 750ng/kg/min with or without a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasmin-mediated activation of TAFI, MA-TCK26D6, or a competitive small molecule inhibitor of TAFI, UK-396082.Inhibition of TAFI in the Angiotensin II model resulted in a decrease in the mortality associated with AAA rupture (from 40.0% to 16.6% with MA-TCK26D6 (log-rank Mantel Cox test p = 0.16), and 8.3% with UK-396082 (log-rank Mantel Cox test p = 0.05)). Inhibition of plasmin-mediated TAFI activation reduced the incidence of AAA from 52.4% to 30.0%. However, late treatment with MA-TCK26D6 once AAA were already established had no effect on the progression of AAA in this model.The formation of intra-mural thrombus is responsible for the dissection and early rupture in the angiotensin II model of AAA, and this process can be prevented through inhibition of TAFI. Late treatment with a TAFI inhibitor does not prevent AAA progression. These data may indicate a role for inhibition of plasmin-mediated TAFI activation in the early stages of AAA development, but not in its progression."
https://openalex.org/W2611134738,"Adenovirus-based vectors are promising tools for genetic vaccination. However, several obstacles have to be overcome prior to a routine clinical application of adenovirus-based vectors as efficacious vectored vaccines. The linear trisaccharide epitope αGal (alpha-Gal) with the carbohydrate sequence galactose-α-1,3-galactosyl-β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine has been described as a potent adjuvant for recombinant or attenuated vaccines. Humans and α-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout mice do not express this epitope. Upon exposure of α-1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient organisms to αGal in the environment, large amounts of circulating anti-Gal antibodies are produced consistently. Immunocomplexes formed between recombinant αGal-decorated vaccines and anti-Gal antibodies exhibit superior immunogenicity. We studied the effects of the trisaccharide epitope on CD8 T cell responses that are directed specifically to vector-encoded transgenic antigens. For that, covalently αGal-decorated adenovirus vectors were delivered to anti-Gal α-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout mice. We generated replication-defective, E1-deleted adenovirus type 5 vectors that were decorated with αGal at the hexon hypervariable regions 1 or 5, at fiber knob, or at penton base. Surprisingly, none of the adenovirus immunocomplexes being formed from αGal-decorated adenovirus vectors and anti-Gal immunoglobulins improved the frequencies of CD8 T cell responses against the transgenic antigen ovalbumin. Humoral immunity directed to the adenovirus vector was neither increased. However, our data indicated that decoration of Ad vectors with the αGal epitope is a powerful tool to analyze the fate of adenovirus immunocomplexes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2610976105,"We have previously revealed that, in contrast to polymorphism of FCGR2B and FCGR3B, polymorphism of FCGR2A, FCGR2C and FCGR3A genes, encoding receptors for Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G (Fcγ receptors), play a role in increased level of circulating immune complexes with occurrence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock proteins in patients with sarcoidosis. However, this immunocomplexemia might also be caused by decreased clearance by immune cells due to a changed copy number of FCGR genes. Thus, the next step of our study was to evaluate copy number variation of FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A and FCGR3B in this disease. The analysis was carried out by real-time quantitative PCR on 104 patients and 110 healthy volunteers. Despite previously detected variation in allele/genotype frequencies of FCGR in sarcoidosis and its particular stages, there was no copy number variation of the tested genes between sarcoidosis or its stages and healthy control, as well as between stages themselves. A relevant increase in copy number of FCGR2C and FCGR3B in Stage IV of sarcoidosis vs. other stages and controls was detected, but this observation was based on a limited number of Stage IV patients. Hence, polymorphism of FCGR genes seems to be more important than their copy number variation in etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis in patients from the Polish population."
