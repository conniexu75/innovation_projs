https://openalex.org/W2132161879,"The receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIP3) is a key signaling molecule in the programmed necrosis (necroptosis) pathway. This pathway plays important roles in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, including development, tissue damage response, and antiviral immunity. Here, we report the identification of a small molecule called (E)-N-(4-(N-(3-methoxypyrazin-2-yl)sulfamoyl)phenyl)-3-(5-nitrothiophene-2-yl)acrylamide—hereafter referred to as necrosulfonamide—that specifically blocks necrosis downstream of RIP3 activation. An affinity probe derived from necrosulfonamide and coimmunoprecipitation using anti-RIP3 antibodies both identified the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) as the interacting target. MLKL was phosphorylated by RIP3 at the threonine 357 and serine 358 residues, and these phosphorylation events were critical for necrosis. Treating cells with necrosulfonamide or knocking down MLKL expression arrested necrosis at a specific step at which RIP3 formed discrete punctae in cells. These findings implicate MLKL as a key mediator of necrosis signaling downstream of the kinase RIP3.

Two CD95 (APO-1/Fas) signaling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). Two well-characterized cell death pathways lead to the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, a pair of related executioner proteases that are responsible for the morphologically distinct form of cell death known as apoptosis (Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Caspases: enemies within.Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). One pathway, known as the intrinsic pathway, is initiated through mitochondria; the other is initiated through cell surface death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines and is therefore referred to as the extrinsic pathway. The mitochondrial pathway is triggered by the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that render the outer membrane of mitochondria permeable to factors normally located within the intermembrane space, in particular cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo (Wang and Youle, 2009Wang C. Youle R.J. The role of mitochondria in apoptosis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The released cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 protein to form a caspase-9 activating protein complex that cleaves and activates caspase-3/7 (Li et al., 1997Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

Smac/Diablo removes the inhibition of caspases imposed by the X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptotic Protein (XIAP) and induces cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation (Du et al., 2000Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

The death receptors are activated after they have been occupied by their corresponding ligands. This leads to the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), within which caspase-8, another upstream caspase of caspase-3 and -7, is activated (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1999Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Apoptosis control by death and decoy receptors.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). As important as caspase activity is for apoptosis, inhibiting caspases often delays but does not prevent cell death in mammalian cells if the death is through the mitochondrial pathway (Kroemer and Martin, 2005Kroemer G. Martin S.J. Caspase-independent cell death.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In contrast, apoptosis resulting from activation of death receptors can be completely rescued by caspase inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk. However, in some cell types, the same caspase inhibitor exacerbates cell death by switching on the necrotic cell death program (Cauwels et al., 2003Cauwels A. Janssen B. Waeytens A. Cuvelier C.

The determining factor for the necrotic response is the receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIP3, also known as RIPK3). Cells expressing RIP3 are capable of undergoing necrosis in response to the TNF family of cytokines (Cho et al., 2009Cho Y.S. Challa S. Moquin D. Genga R. Ray T.D. Guildford M. Chan F.K.

These cells include mouse fibroblast L929 cells (in which TNF-induced necrosis was first observed), cells from the hematopoietic system, and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. During the necrosis induction process, RIP3 binds to the kinase RIP1 (which is also called RIPK1) through their respective RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains. Inhibition of the kinase activity of RIP1 by the chemical inhibitor necrostatin-1 prevents the RIP1/RIP3 interaction and blocks necrosis (Degterev et al., 2008Degterev A. Hitomi J. Germscheid M.

Importantly, caspase-8 is able to cleave RIP1 and RIP3, effectively terminating necrosis (Feng et al., 2007Feng S. Yang Y. Mei Y. Ma L. Zhu D.E. Hoti N. Castanares M. Wu M.

Thus, for necrosis to ensue, the inhibitory effect of caspase-8 must be overcome either by caspase inhibitors or by a substantial elevation of RIP3 levels, as occurs during tissue damage (He et al., 2009He S.

USA. 2010; 107: 21695-21700Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The importance of necrotic cell death has been illustrated by several recent findings. Breeding onto a RIP3 knockout background rescues the developmental defects of caspase-8 knockout mice. This indicates that the cardiac, vascular, and hematopoietic defects that occur during the development of caspase-8 knockout mice are caused by RIP3-mediated necrosis, unleashed by disrupting caspase-8 expression (Kaiser et al., 2011Kaiser W.J. Upton J.W. Long A.B. Livingston-Rosanoff D. Daley-Bauer L.P. Hakem R. Caspary T. Mocarski E.S.

Catalytic activity of the caspase-8-FLIP(L) complex inhibits RIPK3-dependent necrosis.Nature. 2011; 471: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). During viral infection, a lack of RIP3 allows for more rapid viral replication of both vaccinia virus and murine cytomegalovirus in mice (Cho et al., 2009Cho Y.S. Challa S. Moquin D. Genga R. Ray T.D. Guildford M. Chan F.K.

Kaiser W.J. Mocarski E.S. Virus inhibition of RIP3-dependent necrosis.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 302-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Moreover, RIP3 is markedly elevated in tissue damage models such as acute pancreatitis and retinal detachment (He et al., 2009He S. Wang L. Miao L. Wang T. Du F. Zhao L. Wang X. Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 determines cellular necrotic response to TNF-alpha.Cell. 2009; 137: 1100-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, Trichonas et al., 2010Trichonas G.

USA. 2010; 107: 21695-21700Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Abolishing RIP3 expression effectively reduces the degree of tissue damage, suggesting that RIP3-mediated necrotic death may exacerbate damage-induced inflammation, thereby aggravating the injury. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular pathway responsible for RIP3-mediated necrosis and the development of inhibitors of this pathway could serve urgent medical needs. The mechanism by which RIP3 causes programmed necrotic cell death is still poorly understood. Unlike caspase-3/7, whose specific cleavage of important cellular substrates gives rise to the morphological traits and biochemical markers of apoptosis, RIP3 could potentially initiate many cellular responses. RIP3 autophosphorylates itself and also phosphorylates its partner kinase, RIP1, within the RIP1/RIP3 complex that is called necrosome (Declercq et al., 2009Declercq W. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. RIP kinases at the crossroads of cell death and survival.Cell. 2009; 138: 229-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these phosphorylation events and their downstream substrates are still unknown. Addressing these questions will likely be the key to deciphering the molecular pathway of necrosis. We previously established a robust cell-based model of necrosis by treating human colon cancer HT-29 cells with a combination of TNF-α, a cell-permeable small molecule that mimics Smac function (Smac mimetic), and the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (He et al., 2009He S. Wang L. Miao L. Wang T. Du F. Zhao L. Wang X. Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 determines cellular necrotic response to TNF-alpha.Cell. 2009; 137: 1100-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2004Li L. Thomas R.M. Suzuki H. De Brabander J.K. Wang X. Harran P.G. A small molecule Smac mimic potentiates TRAIL- and TNFalpha-mediated cell death.Science. 2004; 305: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Using this model, we screened ∼200,000 chemical compounds for the ability to inhibit necrosis and found one compound that specifically blocked necrosis at a step downstream of RIP3 activation. A combination of chemical biology and biochemical approaches identified the biological target of the compound as the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), which is a critical substrate of RIP3 during the induction of necrosis. Taking advantage of the robustness of the necrosis that is induced by combinatorial treatment with TNF-α, Smac mimetic, and z-VAD-fmk, we screened a chemical library of ∼200,000 for compounds that blocked necrosis like necrostatin-1 (Figure 1A ). One hit (Hit #14) that drew our attention was the compound (E)-N-(4-(N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)sulfamoyl)phenyl)-3-(5-nitrothiophene-2-yl)acrylamide shown in Figure 1B. The #14 compound blocked necrosis in both human colon cancer HT-29 cells and FADD null human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells with an IC50 less than 1 μM, which is more potent than necrostatin-1 (Figures 1C and 1D). Using a medicinal chemistry approach, we further identified a 3-methoxypyrazin-2-yl derivative of the original hit as the most efficacious analog in this class of compounds, with an IC50 of less than 0.2 μM (Figure S1A available online). This compound will hereafter be referred to as necrosulfonamide (NSA). Notably, necrosulfonamide had no effect on apoptosis induced by TNF-α plus Smac mimetic in non-RIP3-expressing Panc-1 cells, even at 5 μM concentration (Figure S1B).Figure S1Necrosulfonamide Specifically Inhibits Necrosis in Multiple Human Cell Lines, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Dose-response curve (in μM) of Necrosulfonamide (NSA) in HT-29 cells treated with TNF-α/smac mimetic/z-VAD for 24 hrs.

Because FADD null Jurkat cells cannot activate caspase-8 in response to extrinsic apoptosis signals and therefore undergo necrosis when treated with TNF-α alone, they were used to eliminate the possibility that necrosulfonamide blocks necrosis by interfering with the chemical activity of Smac mimetic or caspase-inhibitor z-VAD. Indeed, necrosis in FADD null cells induced by TNF-α alone was still efficiently blocked by necrosulfonamide similar to necrostatin-1 (Figure S1C). HeLa cells normally do not express RIP3 and are unable to respond to the necrosis stimulus. However, the necrosis response in HeLa cells can be reconstituted by ectopic expression of RIP3. Consistently, in a HeLa cell line in which RIP3 was expressed and caspase-8 was knocked down, necrosis-induced by TNF-α plus Smac mimetic (no need for z-VAD) was also efficiently blocked by necrosulfonamide (Figure S1D). Interestingly, in a mouse 3T3 cell line expressing mouse RIP3, necrosis induced by either TNF-α/z-VAD or TNF-α/Smac mimetic/z-VAD was totally insensitive to necrosulfonamide inhibition even though necrostatin-1 efficiently mitigated the cell death (Figure S1E). This observation gave us a critical clue in the effort to identify the functional cellular target of necrosulfonamide later on. To explore how necrosulfonamide blocks necrosis, a series of live-cell images of a mCherry-RIP3 fusion protein in HeLa cells undergoing necrosis were taken. These images revealed that RIP3, which is usually uniformly diffused throughout the cytosol of living cells, gradually formed discrete punctae that were enlarging as necrosis progressed (Figure 1E). The mCherry-RIP3 protein functioned similarly to native RIP3 because expressing the mCherry-RIP3 fusion protein in HeLa cells rendered them necrosis responsive (Figure S1F). In the presence of necrosulfonamide, the discrete RIP3 punctae were detected but failed to enlarge (Figure 1F), indicating that the compound blocked necrosis at a specific step in the necrosis pathway. We then analyzed the immunocomplex obtained from a Flag-tagged RIP3 pull-down and found that, unlike necrostatin-1, necrosulfonamide did not block necrosis-induced RIP1 and RIP3 interactions (Figure 1G, lanes 3 and 4). Instead, the interaction between RIP1 and RIP3—and the upward shifts in their SDS-PAGE gel migration owing to their phosphorylation—was enhanced by necrosulfonamide (Figure 1G, lane 4). These results indicated that necrosulfonamide blocked necrosis at an unknown step downstream of RIP3 activation. We sought to identify proteins associated with RIP3 in cells treated with necrosis inducers in the presence of necrosulfonamide. As shown in Figure 2A , on an SDS-PAGE gel, a protein band that specifically appeared with the RIP3 immunocomplex under these conditions migrated just above the position of the IgG heavy chain. Mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as the mixed lineage kinase-domain like protein (MLKL). MLKL contains a kinase-like domain and is most closely related to the mixed lineage kinases that function as MAPKKs in the JNK and p38 kinase activating pathways (Gallo and Johnson, 2002Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Mixed-lineage kinase control of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, unlike a bona fide kinase, the kinase-like domain of MLKL lacks a phosphate-binding glycine-rich P loop, and the key aspartate 349 residue that coordinates the magnesium ion in the kinase has changed to a glycine residue in MLKL. MLKL is therefore a kinase-dead protein. To verify the specific association between RIP3 and MLKL in a different cell line, we used an anti-Flag antibody to immunoprecipitate Flag-tagged RIP3 that was expressed in HT-29 cells. RIP3 was phosphorylated, as indicated by the upward shift in the protein band under necrosis-inducing conditions (compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3 in Figure 2B). This shift was enhanced by necrosulfonamide, which is consistent with the notion that this compound blocks necrosis downstream of RIP3 kinase. MLKL was also shifted after necrosis was induced (Figure 2B, lanes 2 and 3). The MLKL/RIP3 complex was present in living cells, but the amount of MLKL that was associated with RIP3 increased upon necrosis induction (Figure 2B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). To test its role in necrosis, we knocked down MLKL with four different siRNA oligos in HT-29 cells, human gastric cancer MKN45 cells, and in mouse L929 cells (Figure S2). All four siRNA oligos (targeting either human or mouse MLKL) knocked down MLKL to different degrees, and the knockdown efficiency correlated with the degree of necrosis inhibition (Figures S2A–S2F). To eliminate the possibility of off-target effects for these siRNA oligos, we introduced silent mutations into one of the oligo-targeting sites in human MLKL and performed the rescue experiment with this cDNA in RIP3-expressing HeLa cells. As shown in Figure 2C, knockdown of MLKL blocked TNF-α/Smac mimetic/z-VAD-fmk-induced necrosis. Transfection of the cDNA restored the necrosis response, whereas a control siRNA oligo targeting luciferase (luc) had no effect on necrosis. We further analyzed the RIP1/RIP3 interaction by coimmunoprecipitation upon MLKL knockdown. As shown in Figure 2D, after necrosis induction, RIP3 associated with RIP1, and its mobility shifted regardless of the presence of MLKL (lanes 2 and 3 and 5 and 6). Interestingly, as seen with necrosulfonamide treatment, MLKL knockdown enhanced RIP1/RIP3 interactions (Figure 2D, compare lanes 2 and 5). However, this interaction was not further enhanced by necrosulfonamide treatment after MLKL knockdown (Figure 2D, compare lane 3 with lane 6). These data suggest that the knockdown of MLKL and necrosulfonamide treatment have a similar effect on RIP1/RIP3 interactions. Because treating necrotic cells with necrosulfonamide arrests necrosis at a step at which RIP3 forms discrete punctae within the cytosol, we performed a similar analysis of RIP3 distribution during necrosis after MLKL knockdown using immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Figure 3A , knocking down MLKL also arrested cellular necrosis at this step (Figure 3Af). Further treatment with necrosulfonamide did not change the RIP3 distribution pattern, which indicates that knocking down MLKL has the same effect on necrosis as necrosulfonamide treatment (Figures 3Ac and 3Ag). In contrast, treatment with necrostatin-1 prevented the formation of RIP3 punctae, regardless of MLKL expression status (Figures 3Ad and 3Ah). To test whether MLKL is the direct cellular target of necrosulfonamide, we added a biotin tag to the compound by chemical synthesis and precipitated the interacting protein with streptavidin-conjugated beads. To enhance the capacity of the affinity purification process and to allow for the isolation of low-abundance or low-affinity proteins, a polyproline-rod spacer was inserted between the biotin tag and the compound (Figure 3B) (Sato et al., 2007Sato S. Kwon Y. Kamisuki S. Srivastava N. Mao Q. Kawazoe Y. Uesugi M. Polyproline-rod approach to isolating protein targets of bioactive small molecules: isolation of a new target of indomethacin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This biotinylated necrosulfonamide (biotin-NSA) retained its ability to block necrosis, although it had to do so with ∼10-fold higher concentration (Figure S3A ). When the biotin-NSA was incubated with cell extracts prepared from the RIP3-expressing HeLa cells and pulled down with streptavidin-conjugated beads, the pellet contained endogenous MLKL as well as the RIP3 transgene product (Figure 3C, lane 2).

Using genome-wide Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End-Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), we mapped long-range chromatin interactions associated with RNA polymerase II in human cells and uncovered widespread promoter-centered intragenic, extragenic, and intergenic interactions. These interactions further aggregated into higher-order clusters, wherein proximal and distal genes were engaged through promoter-promoter interactions. Most genes with promoter-promoter interactions were active and transcribed cooperatively, and some interacting promoters could influence each other implying combinatorial complexity of transcriptional controls. Comparative analyses of different cell lines showed that cell-specific chromatin interactions could provide structural frameworks for cell-specific transcription, and suggested significant enrichment of enhancer-promoter interactions for cell-specific functions. Furthermore, genetically-identified disease-associated noncoding elements were found to be spatially engaged with corresponding genes through long-range interactions.

Promoter-centered interactions are complex and widespread Higher-order chromatin architectures facilitate active and coordinated transcription Interacting promoters possess combinatorial regulatory functions Large enhancer-promoter repertoire allows functional annotation of noncoding elements A fundamental question in biology is how genes and regulatory regions are organized and coordinated for transcription regulation. While operons, in which one promoter transcribes multiple genes in a single unit, are common in bacteria (Jacob et al., 1960Jacob F. Perrin D. Sanchez C. Monod J. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. 1960; 250: 1727-1729PubMed Google Scholar), and bicistronic transcript structures have been described in worms and flies (Pauli et al., 1988Pauli D. Tonka C.H. Ayme-Southgate A. An unusual split Drosophila heat shock gene expressed during embryogenesis, pupation and in testis.J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Zorio et al., 1994Zorio D.A. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Operons as a common form of chromosomal organization in C. elegans.Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), eukaryotic genes are thought to be individually transcribed from their own promoters. However, evidence from in situ fluorescence studies in the last decade suggests that transcription is not evenly distributed and is instead concentrated within large discrete foci in mammalian nuclei, raising the possibility that genes are organized into “transcription factories” (Cook, 1999Cook P.R. The organization of replication and transcription.Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) containing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and other components for transcription. However, this theory lacks evidence with molecular and structural details. Thus, the question of how the regulation of genes is coordinated for transcription in mammalian cells remains largely open. Mammalian genomes are known to be organized intensively into higher-order conformation inside the micron-sized nuclear space. Consequently, three-dimensional (3D) organization must have a role in the mechanisms for transcription regulation and coordination (Cremer and Cremer, 2001Cremer T. Cremer C. Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and similar techniques (van Steensel and Dekker, 2010van Steensel B. Dekker J. Genomics tools for unraveling chromosome architecture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) along with traditional in situ techniques have demonstrated that chromatin interactions can regulate transcriptional and epigenetic states (Cope et al., 2010Cope N.F. Fraser P. Eskiw C.H. The yin and yang of chromatin spatial organization.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, such analyses are either limited to certain specific domains or of low resolution and lack functional details. Therefore, a global and high-resolution map of functional chromatin interactions is likely to uncover underlying principles of the higher-order genomic architectures regulating transcription. Recently, we developed Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End-Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for genome-wide investigation of chromatin interactions bound by specific protein factors (Fullwood et al., 2009Fullwood M.J. Liu M.H. Pan Y.F. Liu J. Xu H. Mohamed Y.B. Orlov Y.L. Velkov S. Ho A. Mei P.H. et al.An oestrogen-receptor-alpha-bound human chromatin interactome.Nature. 2009; 462: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation of a factor of interest along with associated DNA fragments and followed by diluted proximity ligation of distant DNA fragments tethered together within individual chromatin complexes, we elucidated the association of regulatory information through nonlinear arrangements. We demonstrated that long-range chromatin interactions occur between the transcription factor Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) bound regions and their target promoters. To globally investigate how all active promoters dynamically interact with their corresponding regulatory regions in vivo, we used ChIA-PET to analyze genome-wide chromatin interactions associated with RNAPII. Our results provide insights into the 3D interplay of active promoters as well as regulatory regions and suggest an architectural model in which related genes in mega-base range are organized for efficient and potentially cooperative transcription. We analyzed five different human cell lines (MCF7, K562, HeLa, HCT116, and NB4) using ChIA-PET with a RNAPII antibody (8WG16) that recognizes the initiation form of the protein. The cell lines originated from a wide range of lineages, and provided a broad representation of human cells. In our pilot analysis, about 20 million uniquely mapped paired-end reads were generated for each of the ChIA-PET experiments (Table S1A available online), which resulted in two genome-wide datasets: the ChIP-enriched RNAPII binding sites and the RNAPII-bound long-range chromatin interactions. Both intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interaction data were obtained, and the vast majority of chromatin interactions identified by ChIA-PET were intrachromosomal (Table S1B). Twenty-five intrachromosomal and seven interchromosomal interactions were validated either by 3C, DNA-FISH, or both (Figure S1 and inset of Figure 1C ).Figure 1Characterization of RNAPII Binding Peaks and Chromatin InteractionsShow full caption(A) RNAPII binding profile around gene body.(B) Violin plots for intensities of RNAPII peaks involved (red, mean intensity = 281) and not involved in interactions (blue, mean intensity = 141).(C) RNAPII-associated chromatin models: basal promoter (BP) with RNAPII binding but no chromatin interaction, single-gene (SG) complex with intra- and/or extragenic interactions and multigene (MG) complex with multiple genes in the interaction clusters. p, promoter; g, gene; and e, enhancer.

To present an inclusive view of the RNAPII-associated human chromatin interactome, we combined the ChIA-PET sequence reads from the six pilot experiments into one dataset for analysis (Table S1). Using embedded nucleotide barcode controls and statistical analyses, we assessed the data quality, filtered out the technical noise, and identified high-confidence binding sites and interacting PET clusters (Experimental Procedures). From the combined pilot dataset, we identified 14,604 high-confidence (FDR < 0.05) RNAPII binding sites as well as 19,856 high-confidence intrachromosomal interaction PET clusters (Table S3). The majority (83%) of RNAPII binding sites in the combined dataset were proximal to 5′ Transcription Start Sites (TSS) of genes (Figure 1A). There were also distinct but relatively weaker enrichments of peaks at the 3′ Transcription End Sites (TES) of genes. Similar patterns were seen in all the individual experiments. Of the total RNAPII binding sites, 9,487 (65%) were involved in chromatin interactions and these sites showed higher RNAPII occupancy than those not involved in interactions (Figure 1B), indicating that most highly-enriched RNAPII binding sites are involved in looped chromatin conformations. Three basic types of interactions were identified around gene promoters in the combined pilot dataset: intragenic (promoter to gene internal regions, 938, 5%), extragenic (promoter to distal regulatory elements such as enhancer, 6,530, 33%), and intergenic (promoter-promoter of different genes, 8,282, 42%). There was also a subcategory composed of intermediate enhancer-enhancer interactions (4,106, 20%). Some interactions (2,341, 12%) were standalone duplex interactions between two interacting anchor regions, whereas most (17,515, 88%) were further aggregated into 1,544 interaction complexes. We speculated that the isolated RNAPII binding at promoter sites, which are not involved in interactions, may reflect the basal promoter function for gene transcription, and thus were termed “basal promoters.” By contrast, RNAPII-associated interactions might constitute a structural basis for complex regulatory mechanisms. These basic interactions further aggregated into complex architectures which we classified as “single-gene” or “multigene” complexes depending on the number of genes involved (Figure 1C). The single-gene models consisted of single or multiple enhancer interactions with only one gene promoter, whereas the multigene models included intergenic promoter-promoter interactions and could also include intragenic and extragenic enhancer-promoter interactions. Moreover, several such complexes, distantly separated on a chromosome or on different chromosomes, further converged to form higher-order multigene interaction complexes (Figures S1B, S1D, S1F, and S1G). Many chromatin complexes had genomic spans of 150 kb–200 kb, and a few complexes spanned several megabases. Although there were only 1,328 multigene complexes in this combined pilot dataset, 11,723 genes were engaged in these complexes for an average of 8.8 genes per interaction complex (Figure 1D), indicating that promoter-promoter interactions were widespread and may play a significant role in transcription regulation. To understand how these looping structures influence transcription, we characterized these RNAPII-associated chromatin models (basal promoters, single-gene and multigene complexes) for structural features (genomic property), functional output (transcription activity), and epigenomic marks (chromatin state). To determine the genomic characteristics of RNAPII-associated chromatin structures, we mapped several genomic descriptors that were known to associate with the expressivity of the human genome (Versteeg et al., 2003Versteeg R. van Schaik B.D. van Batenburg M.F. Roos M. Monajemi R. Caron H. Bussemaker H.J. van Kampen A.H. The human transcriptome map reveals extremes in gene density, intron length, GC content, and repeat pattern for domains of highly and weakly expressed genes.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), including GC content, gene density, SINE/LINE density, gene length, and the intron/exon ratio. In our analyses (Figure 2, Figure S2A ), the multigene complexes were significantly enriched with higher GC content, higher gene and SINE density, and lower LINE density as compared to the single-gene interaction complexes and the regions of basal promoters, suggesting that multigene complexes were located in open chromatin and highly transcribed regions. In addition, genes in the multigene complex regions were relatively shorter than other gene categories, which is yet another property of highly expressed genes (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2003Eisenberg E. Levanon E.Y. Human housekeeping genes are compact.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 362-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Conversely, genomic loci associated with the single-gene complexes lay in the regions with lower gene and SINE density. Moreover, the genes engaged in the single-gene complexes were significantly longer and had higher intron/exon ratios than the genes of other chromatin models (Figure 2B). These observations suggest that genes with enhancer-promoter interactions in single-gene complexes were more likely to be tissue-specific or developmentally regulated, in line with the previous findings that genes in gene-poor regions associated with several distant regulatory elements, tended to be longer and had a higher noncoding to coding ratio than housekeeping genes (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2003Eisenberg E.

To investigate the functional output of genes involved in the different chromatin models, as defined by transcriptional activity, we focused our analyses on MCF7 cells, as it is a well-characterized human cancer cell model with complementary datasets including RNA-Seq (Experimental Procedures), time-course microarray gene expression (Fullwood et al., 2009Fullwood M.J. Liu M.H. Pan Y.F. Liu J. Xu H. Mohamed Y.B. Orlov Y.L. Velkov S. Ho A. Mei P.H. et al.An oestrogen-receptor-alpha-bound human chromatin interactome.Nature. 2009; 462: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), and GRO-Seq datasets (Hah et al., 2011Hah N. Danko C.G. Core L. Waterfall J.J. Siepel A. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. A rapid, extensive, and transient transcriptional response to estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells.Cell. 2011; 145: 622-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Consistent with the combined pilot dataset, 90% binding sites in MCF7 cells were found proximal to known gene promoters and 97% genes with RNAPII present at their promoters had detectable transcriptional activity by RNA-Seq (Figure 3A ). The interactive RNAPII binding sites that were distal to gene promoters included intra- and extragenic regulatory elements such as enhancers. Approximately 45% of the extragenic distal regulatory sites had detectable RNA signals that could represent possible noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts. For genes associated with the three chromatin models, we analyzed the transcription levels measured by RNA-Seq reads. As shown in Figure 3B, in general, RNAPII binding at promoter sites correlated well with the expression level of the corresponding genes. Interestingly, the genes involved in the single-gene and the multigene models showed higher correlation between RNAPII binding and RNA-Seq signal (Pearson's correlation coefficient: PCC: 0.46 and 0.45 respectively) as compared to basal promoter genes (PCC: 0.24). Moreover, we observed that genes linked by complex chromatin interactions, especially those in multigene complexes, had significantly higher expression levels than basal promoter genes (Figure 3C). This high expression appeared to be limited to genes interacting at the RNAPII anchor sites, as compared to genes located in the intervening chromatin loops. These data indicated that promoter-promoter interactions in multigene complexes were associated with higher transcriptional activity, which is consistent with our observations of their associated genomic features. Next, we characterized the expression patterns of genes present in the interacting regions using microarray data derived from 84 human tissues (Su et al., 2002Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. et al.Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). We found distinct representation of tissue-specific and housekeeping genes in the three chromatin models (Figure 3D, Figures S3A and S3B ). Most genes in single-gene complexes with enhancer-promoter connectivity were tissue-specific, consistent with growing evidence that the expression levels of developmental and tissue-specific genes are largely modulated through cis-remote regulatory elements and trans-protein factors (Hou et al., 2010Hou C. Dale R. Dean A. Cell type specificity of chromatin organization mediated by CTCF and cohesin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 3651-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Schoenfelder et al., 2010Schoenfelder S. Sexton T. Chakalova L. Cope N.F. Horton A. Andrews S. Kurukuti S. Mitchell J.A.

Genet. 2010; 42: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), and consistent with their genomic features (less gene density, longer gene body and higher intron/exon ratio) as previously described. Conversely, genes involved in multigene complexes as well as the basal promoter genes were characterized as both tissue-specific and housekeeping categories. These observations were also supported by normalized CpG content and GC-skew at their promoter regions (Figures S3C and S3D). As promoter-promoter interactions cluster multiple genes, they could provide an ideal topological framework for potential transcriptional coordination of both tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. This observation agrees with the evidence that “ridges,” which are domains of highly transcribed genes, contain both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes (Versteeg et al., 2003Versteeg R. van Schaik B.D. van Batenburg M.F. Roos M. Monajemi R. Caron H. Bussemaker H.J. van Kampen A.H. The human transcriptome map reveals extremes in gene density, intron length, GC content, and repeat pattern for domains of highly and weakly expressed genes.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Since large numbers of genes are found in multigene complexes, we propose that promoter-promoter interactions could serve as a dominant mechanism for transcription regulation of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in mammalian genomes. Next, we sought to determine whether genes with promoter-promoter interactions were more likely to be transcriptionally coordinated. RNA-Seq data showed that most of the paired genes with promoter-promoter interactions were expressed together at high levels (Figure 3E; Figure S3E). To further assess the coordinated transcription of paired genes across different conditions, we performed Pearson's correlation analysis using estrogen-induced time course of GRO-Seq data (Hah et al., 2011Hah N. Danko C.G. Core L. Waterfall J.J. Siepel A. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. A rapid, extensive, and transient transcriptional response to estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells.Cell. 2011; 145: 622-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) that measured transcription initiation rates of estrogen responsive genes, and observed significant transcriptional correlation (Figure 3F; p value < 2.2E-16). Interestingly, the correlation was even greater for ERα-mediated gene pairs derived from our earlier data (Fullwood et al., 2009Fullwood M.J. Liu M.H. Pan Y.F. Liu J. Xu H. Mohamed Y.B. Orlov Y.L. Velkov S. Ho A. Mei P.H. et al.An oestrogen-receptor-alpha-bound human chromatin interactome.Nature. 2009; 462: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), suggesting stronger correlation of transcription for genes involved in multigene complexes mediated by specific transcription factors. Similar correlation was also observed from other gene expression datasets (Figures S3F–S3I). As expected, housekeeping genes and genes belonging to the same GO classes showed even higher correlation than the rest (Figures S3J and S3K). Altogether, our analyses indicated that a significant proportion of gene pairs involved in promoter-promoter interactions tended to be transcribed cooperatively. Correlated expression of interacting genes suggests that the multigene interaction complex might provide a molecular basis for the postulated “transcription factory” (Cook, 1999Cook P.R. The organization of replication and transcription.Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To elucidate the link between the multigene complexes revealed by ChIA-PET and transcription factories, we performed 3D DNA-FISH experiments using probes representing distinct multigene complexes in combination with RNAPII-IF staining in MCF7 nuclei (Experimental Procedures). All experiments on four genomic loci randomly chosen from multigene complexes revealed a significant association of the multigene complex loci with RNAPII foci (Figure 4A-B ), adding further evidence to support our view that multigene complexes could provide a structural framework for cotranscription. Furthermore, gene families were significantly over-represented (p value < 0.006) in the multigene complexes (Figure S3L), such as HIST, ZNF, KRT, HOXC, etc. (Table S4). Taking the HIST1H family as an example, the 58 genes of this family located on chromosome 6 formed three multigene complexes, and these three complexes converged into a higher-order super-complex, suggesting that all HIST1H genes were organized in a single chromatin architecture for coordinated transcription (Figure 4C). All HIST1H genes were actively transcribed in both MCF7 and K562 cells, and were highly coregulated across different tissues and cellular conditions (Figure 4D). Interestingly, HFE, a gene was not a part of the HIST1H family but was located in the middle of the first HIST1H multigene complex, was not anchored at the interaction sites and was not expressed. Similarly, the genes located in the intervening loop regions between the three HIST1H interacting complexes were relatively less active and much less coordinated for coregulation across different tissues and cellular conditions. This case exemplifies the model where multigene complexes organize genes with similar functions across genomic space for coordinated expression. To further investigate the likelihood that the multigene complex structure might provide a topological framework for transcriptional coregulation of interacting genes involved in such topology, we designed a set of perturbation experiments to test this. After comparing the RNAPII and ERα ChIA-PET data from MCF7 cells, we found that the RNAPII-bound multigene complex at the GREB1 locus partially overlaps with the ERα-bound chromatin loops, suggesting that this interaction complex, in part, is associated with ERα. Therefore, we performed siRNA experiments to knockdown the protein level of ERα in MCF7 cells, and monitored the alteration of chromatin interactions and gene transcription in the GREB1 multigene complex. Several chromatin interaction loops at this locus were disrupted by siERα transfection as tested by 3C experiments (Figure 4E). In addition to GREB1, which had a strong response to estrogen induction and reduction by siERα knockdown (Figures S4A–S4D), we observed that the other genes in this complex such as E2F6, KCNF1 and ATP6VC12 also had various levels of response to induction by estrogen and reduction by siERα knockdown (Figure 4F). Interestingly, these genes did not directly interact with ERα at their promoter regions, but indirectly associated with ERα through RNAPII-bound chromatin loops. As a control, this effect was not seen in the nearby genes such as NOL10 and HPCAL1 that were in other RNAPII interaction complexes and also did not interact with ERα (Figure 4G)."

During apoptosis, cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, Omi/HtrA2, EndoG, and AIF are released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and elicit biochemical reactions leading to apoptosis (Wang and Youle, 2009Wang C. Youle R.J. The role of mitochondria in apoptosis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to these apoptogenic factors is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, bind and antagonize the homologous proapoptotic members of the family, including Bax and Bak, and the “BH3-only” members such as Bim, Bad, and Puma (which share homology with Bcl-2 only at the BH3 region) (Youle and Strasser, 2008Youle R.J. Strasser A. The BCL-2 protein family: opposing activities that mediate cell death.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). The current hypothesis proposes that the BH3-only proteins activate Bax and Bak, leading to Bax/Bak oligomerization into protein-permeable pores. However, direct evidence for these pores is still lacking. Mitochondria are interconnecting cellular organelles that undergo dynamic changes in response to physiological and pathological changes. True to their bacterial origin, mitochondria undergo fission and fusion, which are processes controlled by a group of large GTPases. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial fusion is regulated by mitofusin-1 and -2 (MFN-1/2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), whereas mitochondrial fission is controlled by a Dynamin-related protein 1, Drp1, and its mitochondrial anchors Fis1 and Mff (Otera and Mihara, 2011Otera H.

Once bound to mitochondria, Drp1 assembles into spirals at division sites around the outer mitochondrial membrane to drive the fission process (Smirnova et al., 2001Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Dynamin-related protein Drp1 is required for mitochondrial division in mammalian cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2245-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). The activity of Drp1 is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. The phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKA) at serine 637 site of human Drp-1 inhibits its GTPase activity and prevents mitochondrial fission (Chang and Blackstone, 2007Chang C.R.

Mitochondrial fragmentation has been observed during cell death (Frank et al., 2001Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J.

Emerging evidence points to an active role for mitochondrial fragmentation in apoptosis and necrosis. For example, loss of Drp1 function has been shown to slow down apoptosis and necrosis in C. elegans (Breckenridge et al., 2008Breckenridge D.G. Kang B.H. Kokel D. Mitani S. Staehelin L.A. Xue D.

Consistent with these results, boosting mitochondrial fusion by the overexpression of MFN1 and MFN2 inhibits apoptosis (Sugioka et al., 2004Sugioka R. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y.

The receptor-interacting kinase RIP3 is a critical signaling component for the cellular necrotic response to the TNF-α family of cytokines (Declercq et al., 2009Declercq W. Vanden Berghe T.

Virus inhibition of RIP3-dependent necrosis.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 302-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The necrosis pathway downstream of RIP3 remains largely unknown, although ROS generation, calcium overload, and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore have been implicated (Vanlangenakker et al., 2008Vanlangenakker N. Vanden Berghe T. Krysko D.V. Festjens N. Vandenabeele P. Molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology of necrotic cell death.Curr. Mol. Med. 2008; 8: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of a chemical compound, necrosulfonamide (Sun et al., 2011Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase.Cell. 2011; 148 (this issue): 213-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1327) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]), which specifically inhibits TNF-α-mediated necrosis downstream of RIP3 activation and a cell line harboring a tagged version of functional RIP3 under the control of an inducible promoter, we identified multiprotein complexes that specifically formed after necrosis induction. Our results show that one of the components is the mitochondrial phosphoglycerate mutase/protein phosphatase PGAM5, which functions as a convergent point for multiple necrotic death pathways. To characterize the role of RIP3 in necrosis, we generated a HeLa stable cell line that harbored a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression construct containing RIP3 fused to a 3xFlag tag and an HA tag at its N terminus. HeLa cells normally do not express RIP3. Addition of Dox to the culture media induced expression of RIP3 that was more than 20-fold higher than the basal level (leaky) expression of RIP3 transgene, which was about four times the level of endogenous RIP3 in human colon cancer HT-29 cells (Figure 1A ). Before Dox addition, the basal expression of RIP3 transgene in HeLa cells made the cells behave similarly to HT-29 cells. The cells underwent necrosis when treated with the combination of TNF-α, the Smac mimetic and z-VAD-fmk, but remained alive when treated with TNF-α alone or TNF-α plus either Smac mimetic or z-VAD-fmk (Figure 1B; He et al., 2009He S.

Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 determines cellular necrotic response to TNF-alpha.Cell. 2009; 137: 1100-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The necrosis was inhibited by an allosteric RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 and the mixed lineage kinase-like (MLKL) protein inhibitor necrosulfonamide (Degterev et al., 2008Degterev A. Hitomi J. Germscheid M. Ch'en I.L. Korkina O. Teng X. Abbott D. Cuny G.D. Yuan C. Wagner G. et al.Identification of RIP1 kinase as a specific cellular target of necrostatins.Nat. Chem.

With the addition of Dox, the cells underwent necrosis in response to TNF-α alone as well as to TNF-α plus either z-VAD-fmk and/or the Smac mimetic (Figure 1B). This observation is consistent with the previous findings that higher levels of RIP3 may cause cells to undergo necrosis in response to TNF-α alone, bypassing the requirement of z-VAD-fmk and Smac mimetic (He et al., 2009He S.

Moreover, necrosis also proceeded faster upon Dox addition (Figure S1A available online).Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Overexpression of RIP3 accelerates necrosis.

After 48 hrs, the cells were treated with TSZ for 24 hrs, and cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay. (C) Western blotting was performed to assay the knockdown efficiency. Interestingly, the Dox-induced higher level of RIP3 expression abolished the ability of necrostatin-1 to efficiently block necrosis in these cells, although knockdown of its target RIP1 still attenuated necrosis (Figures 1B and S1B). It is likely that with higher level of RIP3, cells were able to overcome the allosteric inhibition of necrostatin-1 on RIP1. In contrast, necrosulfonamide still efficiently prevented necrosis under the same conditions (Figure 1B). Consistently, knockdown of MLKL in the Dox-treated HeLa cells also blocked necrosis (Figure S1B). To monitor the morphological changes associated with TNF-α-induced necrosis in detail, we transiently expressed RFP-ANT1, a mitochondrial marker, and YFP-HMGB1, a nuclear marker, into the Dox-induced, RIP3-expressing HeLa cells. These cells were treated by the combination of TNF-α, Smac mimetic, and zVAD-fmk and analyzed with a spinning-disk confocal microscope. As shown in Figure 1C, the shape of nuclei and tubular mitochondria was normal before the treatment. After 120 min of treatment, the mitochondria became fragmented into small dots scattered throughout the cell, whereas the nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes were intact. At 360 min, the nuclear membrane broke down and the YFP signal dispersed into the cytosol, while the mitochondria formed clumps. By 580 min, the YFP signal eventually dissipated, indicating the breakdown of the plasma membrane. Consistent with the observation that necrostatin-1 failed to block necrosis when RIP3 was overexpressed (Figure 1B), the addition of necrostatin-1 did not prevent the mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering as visualized by immunofluorescent staining of Tom20, another mitochondrial marker (Figure 1D). In contrast, in the presence of necrosulfonamide, the tubular mitochondrial morphology remained normal (Figure 1D). Consistently, knockdown of MLKL, the cellular target of necrosulfonamide, also prevented the mitochondrial morphological changes under necrosis-inducing conditions, whereas a control luciferase knockdown did not (Figure 1E). To search for RIP3 substrates that function in the necrosis pathway, we immunoprecipitated the Flag-tagged RIP3 from HeLa cells treated with the vehicle DMSO or necrosis-inducing agents (TNF-α/Smac mimetic/Z-VAD). We then performed an in vitro kinase assay by incubating γ-32P ATP with the immune complex and analyzed the protein phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Figure 2A , a phosphate-labeled protein at the expected position of RIP3 was detected before necrosis induction, indicating that there is a basal level of RIP3 activity in living cells. After necrosis induction, two additional bands that migrated slightly above the 55 and 35 kDa markers also appeared (Figure 2A). The upper band was at the expected position of MLKL, a newly discovered substrate of RIP3 (Sun et al., 2011Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase.Cell. 2011; 148 (this issue): 213-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). In order to get the molecular identity of the lower band, we first fractionated cell extracts by centrifugation. The RIP1/RIP3 complex was found to be more prominent in the heavy membrane fraction (pellet fraction after centrifugation at 15,000 × g) after necrosis induction, and the complex accumulated in the presence of necrosulfonamide (Figure 2B). We then immune-purified the RIP3-containing complex from the p15 fraction and resolved the accumulated RIP3 immunocomplex using a gradient SDS-PAGE gel. We subsequently identified all of the associated proteins by silver staining followed by mass spectrometry. As indicated in Figure 2C, the protein bands that specifically associated with RIP3 during necrosis were RIP1, RIP3, MLKL, and PGAM5, a mitochondrial phosphoglycerate mutase that uses alternative catalytic activity to function as a Ser/Thr phosphatase (Takeda et al., 2009Takeda K. Komuro Y. Hayakawa T. Oguchi H. Ishida Y. Murakami S. Noguchi T. Kinoshita H. Sekine Y. Iemura S. et al.Mitochondrial phosphoglycerate mutase 5 uses alternate catalytic activity as a protein serine/threonine phosphatase to activate ASK1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 12301-12305Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The major PGAM5 protein band ran at the same position as the ∼35 kDa phospho-protein band identified in the in vitro kinase assay, suggesting that PGAM5 might be another substrate of RIP1/RIP3 necrosome. PGAM5 has been shown to localize to the outer membrane of mitochondria with its C terminus facing the cytoplasm (Lo and Hannink, 2008Lo S.C. Hannink M. PGAM5 tethers a ternary complex containing Keap1 and Nrf2 to mitochondria.Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1789-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To verify the specific association between RIP3 and PGAM5, we probed the RIP3 immunocomplex using an anti-PGAM5 antibody. Western blotting analysis of RIP1 and MLKL was also performed as controls. As shown in Figure 2D, similar to RIP1, the PGAM5 signal appeared in the complex only under necrosis-inducing conditions and increased in the presence of necrosulfonamide (lanes 1–3). In contrast, a kinase-dead form of RIP3 (K50A) failed to precipitate PGAM5 even though it still bound to RIP1 as previously observed (He et al., 2009He S. Wang L. Miao L. Wang T. Du F. Zhao L. Wang X. Receptor interacting protein kinase-3 determines cellular necrotic response to TNF-alpha.Cell. 2009; 137: 1100-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Similarly, the kinase-dead RIP3 also failed to interact with MLKL (Sun et al., 2011Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase.Cell. 2011; 148 (this issue): 213-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The lower band of PGAM5 detected by western blotting might be a proteolytic or alternatively spliced form of PGAM5. The necrosis-specific association between PGAM5 and RIP1/RIP3 was further verified by a reciprocal pull-down experiment using an anti-PGAM5 antibody (Figure 2E). To test if the association of PGAM5 with RIP1/RIP3 regulates the phosphatase activity of PGAM5, we immunoprecipitated RIP3 under normal or necrotic conditions and incubated the pellets with purified recombinant PGAM5 in an in vitro kinase and a phosphatase assay. As shown in Figure 2F, the recombinant PGAM5 was phosphorylated by the RIP3 complex under necrotic conditions. Interestingly, the phosphatase activity of recombinant PGAM5 showed significant increase after incubation with the RIP3 complex isolated under the necrotic conditions (Figure 2G). To verify the role of PGAM5 in necrosis execution, we performed siRNA knockdown of PGAM5 using two independent siRNA oligos targeting the coding region of PGAM5. Compared to a control luciferase siRNA oligo, knockdown of PGAM5 in the RIP3-expressing HeLa cells or HT-29 cells attenuated necrosis about 2-fold, and the efficiency of knockdown correlated with the degree of necrosis rescue (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3D ). To further increase the knockdown efficiency, we also generated two HT-29 cell lines stably expressing each shRNA with the same sequences as the two siRNA oligos used for the transient knockdown. The PGAM5 was knocked down to a much lower level in these cells and nearly twice as many cells were rescued from necrosis compared to transient knockdown using siRNA oligos (Figures 3C and 3D). To rule out the off-target effects of these shRNAs, we attempted to rescue the PGAM5 knockdown by expressing an shRNA-resistant cDNA of PGAM5 (Figures 3C and 3D, last lane). To our surprise, the cells were still resistant to necrosis, although the shRNA-resistant cDNA of PGAM5 generated more PGAM5 protein than the endogenous PGAM5 (Figure 3D). The ectopically expressed PGAM5 should be functional since this form of PGAM5 in host cells accelerated necrosis and rendered them resistant to antinecrosis compounds (Figures S2A–S2C).Figure S2Overexpression of Myc-PGAM5L Accelerates Necrosis, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Stable overexpression of Myc-tagged PGAM5L in HeLa/TO-RIP3 cells.

(D) Establishment of Myc-PGAM5S expressing stable lines. SDS-sup was extracted as described in the Experimental Procedures and western blotting was performed with anti-Myc and anti-vimentin antibodies. One possible explanation for such a result was that the shRNA-resistant cDNA used in the rescue experiment expressed only one of the two splice variants of PGAM5, whereas the shRNA targeted the common region of both isoforms. The inability of this isoform of PGAM5 to rescue shRNA knockdown suggested that both forms of PGAM5 participated in necrosis execution. To investigate such a possibility, we had to find a way to unambiguously distinguish these two spliced forms. The alternative splicing made a truncation at amino acid residue 239 of the long form of PGAM5, PGAM5L, and an addition of 16 hydrophobic amino acid residues at the C terminus (Figure 3E; Lo and Hannink, 2006Lo S.C. Hannink M. PGAM5, a Bcl-XL-interacting protein, is a novel substrate for the redox-regulated Keap1-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37893-37903Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These changes potentially rendered the short form of PGAM5, PGAM5S, more hydrophobic than PGAM5L. Therefore, we suspected that the extraction buffer we used for PGAM5L (containing 1% Triton X-100) did not extract PGAM5S. Since PGAM5L was often proteolyzed into several small fragments that overlapped in size with PGAM5S (Figure 2C), we had to individually engineer a Myc-tag into PGAM5S and PGAM5L to specifically study their distributions (Figure 3F). Indeed, we found that PGAM5S was not present in the Triton X-100 extractable fraction. We subsequently lysed the Triton X-100 insoluble pellet with a buffer containing 1% SDS and then diluted the 1% SDS-extracted soluble fraction into 0.1% SDS for the coimmunoprecipitation studies. As shown in Figure 3F, PGAM5S was only present in the 1% SDS-soluble fraction. The ability to specifically probe PGAM5L and PGAM5S allowed us to dissect the roles of these two splice forms in necrosis. We designed siRNA oligos targeting the 3′-untranslated region of PGAM5 that specifically knocked down only one form of PGAM5. As shown in Figures 3E, 3G, and 3H, all of these siRNA oligos attenuated necrosis to a degree that correlated with the respective efficacy for PGAM5S or PGAM5L knockdown, confirming our hypothesis. We then tried to rescue necrosis in shRNA-expressing HT-29 cells with double expression of shRNA-resistant PGAM5L and PGAM5S. The expression of both spliced forms of PGAM5 significantly rescued necrosis compared to either form alone (Figures 3I and S2). We next analyzed the specific interaction between RIP3 and PGAM5S. As shown in Figure 4A , RIP1, RIP3 and PGAM5L were coprecipitated with the anti-Myc (PGAM5S) antibody under necrotic conditions. Interestingly, necrosulfonamide completely blocked the interaction between PGAM5S and RIP1/RIP3. Since necrosulfonamide did not affect PGAM5L interaction with RIP1/RIP3 (Figure 2D), we concluded that PGAM5S is the downstream effector of RIP1/RIP3/MLKL/PGAM5L complex and necrosulfonamide blocks necrosis by preventing PGAM5S from association with this complex. The association of both isoforms of PGAM5 with the RIP1/RIP3 kinase complex during necrosis suggested that PGAM5L/S might be the kinase substrates. To directly analyze the phosphorylation events of these proteins, we subjected the two protein-containing fractions to two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by western blot analysis. We probed the filter with anti-Flag (RIP3) antibody as a positive control because RIP3 is a known phosphoprotein and its upward shifts during necrosis could be readily shifted down by the phosphatase treatment (Figure S3). As shown in Figure 4B, an upward shift of molecular weight measured by SDS-PAGE and a leftward shift of negative charge measured by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis were observed for RIP3 after necrosis induction. Consistent with the previous notion that necrosulfonamide prevents necrosis downstream of RIP3, the presence of necrosulfonamide augmented these"
https://openalex.org/W1969665013,"Genomic rearrangements are thought to occur progressively during tumor development. Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving massive chromosome rearrangements in a one-step catastrophic event termed chromothripsis. We report the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs. Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia. These findings connect p53 status and chromothripsis in specific tumor types, providing a genetic basis for understanding particularly aggressive subtypes of cancer."

Here, we describe and analyze the transcriptional network controlling biofilm formation in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, whose biofilms are a major source of medical device-associated infections. We have combined genetic screens, genome-wide approaches, and two in vivo animal models to describe a master circuit controlling biofilm formation, composed of six transcription regulators that form a tightly woven network with ∼1,000 target genes. Evolutionary analysis indicates that the biofilm network has rapidly evolved: genes in the biofilm circuit are significantly weighted toward genes that arose relatively recently with ancient genes being underrepresented. This circuit provides a framework for understanding many aspects of biofilm formation by C. albicans in a mammalian host. It also provides insights into how complex cell behaviors can arise from the evolution of transcription circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2164318727,"Little is known about how neutrophils and other cells establish a single zone of actin assembly during migration. A widespread assumption is that the leading edge prevents formation of additional fronts by generating long-range diffusible inhibitors or by sequestering essential polarity components. We use morphological perturbations, cell-severing experiments, and computational simulations to show that diffusion-based mechanisms are not sufficient for long-range inhibition by the pseudopod. Instead, plasma membrane tension could serve as a long-range inhibitor in neutrophils. We find that membrane tension doubles during leading-edge protrusion, and increasing tension is sufficient for long-range inhibition of actin assembly and Rac activation. Furthermore, reducing membrane tension causes uniform actin assembly. We suggest that tension, rather than diffusible molecules generated or sequestered at the leading edge, is the dominant source of long-range inhibition that constrains the spread of the existing front and prevents the formation of secondary fronts."
https://openalex.org/W2037334278,"Satellite cells are adult skeletal muscle stem cells that are quiescent and constitute a poorly defined heterogeneous population. Using transgenic Tg:Pax7-nGFP mice, we show that Pax7-nGFPHi cells are less primed for commitment and have a lower metabolic status and delayed first mitosis compared to Pax7-nGFPLo cells. Pax7-nGFPHi can give rise to Pax7-nGFPLo cells after serial transplantations. Proliferating Pax7-nGFPHi cells exhibit lower metabolic activity, and the majority performs asymmetric DNA segregation during cell division, wherein daughter cells retaining template DNA strands express stem cell markers. Using chromosome orientation-fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that all chromatids segregate asymmetrically, whereas Pax7-nGFPLo cells perform random DNA segregation. Therefore, quiescent Pax7-nGFPHi cells represent a reversible dormant stem cell state, and during muscle regeneration, Pax7-nGFPHi cells generate distinct daughter cell fates by asymmetrically segregating template DNA strands to the stem cell. These findings provide major insights into the biology of stem cells that segregate DNA asymmetrically. Satellite cells are adult skeletal muscle stem cells that are quiescent and constitute a poorly defined heterogeneous population. Using transgenic Tg:Pax7-nGFP mice, we show that Pax7-nGFPHi cells are less primed for commitment and have a lower metabolic status and delayed first mitosis compared to Pax7-nGFPLo cells. Pax7-nGFPHi can give rise to Pax7-nGFPLo cells after serial transplantations. Proliferating Pax7-nGFPHi cells exhibit lower metabolic activity, and the majority performs asymmetric DNA segregation during cell division, wherein daughter cells retaining template DNA strands express stem cell markers. Using chromosome orientation-fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that all chromatids segregate asymmetrically, whereas Pax7-nGFPLo cells perform random DNA segregation. Therefore, quiescent Pax7-nGFPHi cells represent a reversible dormant stem cell state, and during muscle regeneration, Pax7-nGFPHi cells generate distinct daughter cell fates by asymmetrically segregating template DNA strands to the stem cell. These findings provide major insights into the biology of stem cells that segregate DNA asymmetrically. Pax7Hi quiescent stem cells constitute a metabolically low “dormant” subpopulation Both Pax7Hi and Pax7Lo quiescent stem cells are serially transplantable Only proliferating Pax7Hi cells segregate old DNA strands to the renewing stem cell CO-FISH demonstrates that template DNA strand cosegregation engages all chromosomes Subcellular constituents including misfolded proteins, centrosomes, and transcripts can segregate asymmetrically during cell division and also influence the fate of daughter cells (Macara and Mili, 2008Macara I.G.

Gonzalez C. Biased segregation of DNA and centrosomes: moving together or drifting apart?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Arguably the most perplexing is the asymmetric segregation of DNA. In the bacteria Escherichia coli, leading and lagging DNA strands of a replication fork were reported to segregate to different subcellular locations (White et al., 2008White M.A. Eykelenboom J.K. Lopez-Vernaza M.A. Wilson E. Leach D.R. Non-random segregation of sister chromosomes in Escherichia coli.Nature. 2008; 455: 1248-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); similarly, replication origins move toward opposite ends of the cell in Caulobacter crescentus (Bowman et al., 2008Bowman G.R.

In metazoans, studies involving a pulse with thymidine nucleotide analogs, followed by a chase, identified label-retaining cells (LRCs) in culture or in stem cells in vivo suggesting the occurrence of template DNA strand segregation (TDSS; see Rando, 2007Rando T.A.

Gonzalez C. Biased segregation of DNA and centrosomes: moving together or drifting apart?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Some of these observations led to the “immortal DNA strands” hypothesis that postulated that stem cells retain old DNA strands of all chromosomes in the longer-lasting daughter stem cell, thereby avoiding a mutation load potentially arising from DNA replication. This model presumes that stem cells perform consecutive asymmetric divisions invariantly, with little to no intervening symmetric cell divisions, that sister chromatid exchange does not occur, and that excision and repair modes of DNA repair are minimal in stem cells (Cairns, 2006Cairns J.

In addition, reports in support or against biased DNA segregation for the same tissue (Escobar et al., 2011Escobar M. Nicolas P. Sangar F. Laurent-Chabalier S. Clair P. Joubert D. Jay P.

Stem cell identity and template DNA strand segregation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Currently, it is difficult to determine when biased DNA segregation occurs and how this is related to the fate of stem cells, due largely to the lack of information on the biology of these stem cells and the inability to isolate them prospectively. The regulation of gene expression might be one consequence of TDSS, whereby individual alleles, or chromatids, would be maintained either as silent or permissive for gene expression; however, these notions also remain unproven (Klar, 1994Klar A.J. A model for specification of the left-right axis in vertebrates.Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 392-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Lansdorp, 2007Lansdorp P.M. Immortal strands? Give me a break.Cell. 2007; 129: 1244-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that not all chromatids participate in biased DNA segregation, in differentiating ES cells (Armakolas and Klar, 2006Armakolas A. Klar A.J. Cell type regulates selective segregation of mouse chromosome 7 DNA strands in mitosis.Science. 2006; 311: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and cells in the intestinal crypt (Falconer et al., 2010Falconer E. Chavez E.A. Henderson A. Poon S.S. McKinney S. Brown L. Huntsman D.G. Lansdorp P.M. Identification of sister chromatids by DNA template strand sequences.Nature. 2010; 463: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that investigation of the occurrence of nonrandom DNA segregation requires analysis of single chromatids. Satellite cells ensure muscle growth and repair during postnatal development, and after muscle damage they effect tissue repair (Tajbakhsh, 2009Tajbakhsh S. Skeletal muscle stem cells in developmental versus regenerative myogenesis.J. Intern. Med. 2009; 266: 372-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Zammit et al., 2006Zammit P.S. Partridge T.A.

After skeletal muscle injury, these quiescent stem cells in the adult enter the cell cycle and generate myoblasts that will fuse to form myofibers. Eventually, satellite cells replenish the niche as regeneration is achieved. Muscle stem cell self-renewal has been demonstrated up to several rounds after muscle injury and by the transplantation of satellite cells associated with myofibers (Collins et al., 2005Collins C.A. Olsen I. Zammit P.S. Heslop L. Petrie A. Partridge T.A. Morgan J.E.

Compelling evidence points to heterogeneity among quiescent muscle stem cells, regarding their gene expression signature and their functional properties (Biressi et al., 2007Biressi S. Molinaro M.

Satellite cells express the paired/homeodomain gene Pax7, which plays a critical role in satellite cell maintenance during perinatal life, but it is dispensable in the adult (Kuang et al., 2006Kuang S.

Rudnicki M.A. Pax7 is required for the specification of myogenic satellite cells.Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). The myogenic regulatory genes Myf5 and Myod play key roles in determining muscle cell fate; Myf5 protein is expressed in most quiescent satellite cells (Gayraud-Morel et al., 2012Gayraud-Morel B. Chrétien F. Jory A. Sambasivan R. Negroni E. Flamant P. Soubigou G. Coppée J.-Y. Di Santo J. Cumano A. Mouly V. Tajbakhsh S. Myf5 haploinsufficiency reveals distinct cell fate potentials for adult skeletal muscle stem cells.J. Cell Science. 2012; PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Myod protein is a hallmark of the activated cell state once satellite cells re-enter the cell cycle. A third myogenic regulatory factor Myogenin is expressed in cells undergoing differentiation (Tajbakhsh, 2009Tajbakhsh S. Skeletal muscle stem cells in developmental versus regenerative myogenesis.J. Intern. Med. 2009; 266: 372-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Zammit et al., 2006Zammit P.S. Partridge T.A. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. The skeletal muscle satellite cell: the stem cell that came in from the cold.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We showed previously that a subpopulation of satellite cells performs TDSS using the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), whereby cells retaining template DNA strands expressed the upstream marker Pax7 (Shinin et al., 2006Shinin V. Gayraud-Morel B. Gomès D. Tajbakhsh S. Asymmetric division and cosegregation of template DNA strands in adult muscle satellite cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Another study reported TDSS in satellite cells using the analogs CldU and IdU (Conboy et al., 2007Conboy M.J. Karasov A.O. Rando T.A. High incidence of non-random template strand segregation and asymmetric fate determination in dividing stem cells and their progeny.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e102Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, if all or only a subset of satellite cells has the potential to perform TDSS, how many chromosomes are involved in this process, and what are the properties of these cells. We used a transgenic Tg:Pax7-nGFP mouse that marks all satellite cells to identify a reversible dormant cell state in the Pax7Hi quiescent subpopulation and show by serial transplantations that these cells self-renew and give rise to myogenic cells that are more primed for commitment. Furthermore, the majority of cycling Pax7Hi cells reproducibly performs biased DNA segregation, and analysis by chromosome orientation-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CO-FISH) demonstrates that this process involves essentially all chromatids. Pulse-chase experiments using thymidine analogs have been used to identify stem cells and their niche based on the assumption that they divide more slowly than their committed daughter cells (Fuchs et al., 2004Fuchs E. Tumbar T. Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche.Cell. 2004; 116: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, Li and Clevers, 2010Li L. Clevers H. Coexistence of quiescent and active adult stem cells in mammals.Science. 2010; 327: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). We showed previously, by pulse-chase labeling, that LRCs are present in the skeletal muscle niche after 10 weeks of chase and that TDSS occurs in a subpopulation of satellite cells (Shinin et al., 2006Shinin V. Gayraud-Morel B. Gomès D. Tajbakhsh S. Asymmetric division and cosegregation of template DNA strands in adult muscle satellite cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We used a similar strategy under two different paradigms (growth and injury) to investigate further this property using Tg: Pax7-nGFP mice that identify all satellite cells in adult mice (Figures 1A –1C; Sambasivan et al., 2009Sambasivan R. Gayraud-Morel B. Dumas G. Cimper C. Paisant S. Kelly R.G. Tajbakhsh S. Distinct regulatory cascades govern extraocular and pharyngeal arch muscle progenitor cell fates.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 810-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and, thus, allow their prospective isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, Figure 1D). For postnatal day (P) growth, Tg: Pax7-nGFP mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU for 5 days (P3–P7) when the majority of myogenic cells are proliferating (Figure 1E). After the last injection (T0; P7), the majority of the cells (>95%) were saturated with BrdU, and by 11.5 weeks, 6.3% ± 1.4% of the cells continued to retain robust label (Figures 1F–1J). We reasoned that muscle stem cell heterogeneity might be correlated with the expression level of the upstream marker Pax7. Two subpopulations were isolated by FACS at opposite ends of the spectrum of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression levels. These were designated as Pax7-nGFPHi and Pax7-nGFPLo, and they each corresponded to ∼10% of the total population (Figure 1D). Interestingly, about 2-fold more LRCs were observed in the Pax7-nGFPHi subpopulation compared to Pax7-nGFPLo fraction at all time points examined (Figure 1F histograms; 11.5 weeks chase 10.41% LRC in Pax7-nGFPHi, 5.1% in Pax7-nGFPLo). To examine the commitment status of these subpopulations, quiescent muscle stem cells were isolated by FACS, and mRNA was extracted for comparative gene expression. Notably, RT-qPCR showed higher levels of Pax7 transcripts in Pax7-nGFPHi cells, indicating that GFP expression reflects endogenous Pax7 expression quantitatively (Figure 1K). This was confirmed by western blot wherein Pax7-nGFPHi cells expressed more Pax7 protein (Figure 1L). CXCR4 and CD34, which were reported to be markers of stemness (Beauchamp et al., 2000Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A. Buckingham M.E. Partridge T.A. Zammit P.S.

Rudnicki M.A. The emerging biology of satellite cells and their therapeutic potential.Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 82-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), were reduced (Figure 1K). Consistent with their commitment status, significantly lower levels of transcripts were observed for the differentiation gene Myogenin in Pax7-nGFPHi compared to Pax7-nGFPLo cells (Figure 1K). The behavior of satellite cells was then investigated by live video microscopy immediately after their isolation and culture. Pax7-nGFPHi entered the cell cycle and took a longer time to divide compared to Pax7-nGFPLo cells for the first division (mean time: 33 versus 25.5 hr, respectively, n = 200 cells for each; Figure 2A ; see Movie S1. Related to Figure 2, Movie S2. Related to Figure 2 available online). Notably, however, no differences in cell-cycle time were observed for subsequent divisions (every 10 hr, n = 200 cells; Movie S3). The delay in cell-cycle entry was confirmed in vivo using pulsed injections of the nucleotide analog EdU after muscle injury (Figure 2B). Because Pax7-nGFPHi quiescent stem cells have a higher percentage of LRCs, and they take longer to perform the first cell division after activation, we reasoned that this subpopulation was in a more dormant state (i.e., lower metabolism). Interestingly, higher levels of active mitochondria, as measured by MitoTracker fluorescence intensity (Figure 2C), and higher levels of ATP (Figure 2D) were observed in the Pax7-nGFPLo cells. Metabolic demands correlate with oxidative capacity and mitochondrial DNA (Moyes and Battersby, 1998Moyes C.D. Battersby B.J. Regulation of muscle mitochondrial design.J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 299-307Google Scholar). Accordingly, RT-qPCR of mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam; Garstka et al., 2003Garstka H.L. Schmitt W.E. Schultz J. Sogl B. Silakowski B. Pérez-Martos A. Montoya J. Wiesner R.J. Import of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) into rat liver mitochondria stimulates transcription of mitochondrial DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5039-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial-specific polymerase γ (catalytic PolG, and accessory PolG2) was upregulated in Pax7-nGFPLo cells (Figure 2E), indicating a higher energetic demand. Although both quiescent subpopulations were negative for Myod protein, which marks activated satellite cells, shortly after their isolation, Myod protein was detected in virtually all of the Pax7-nGFPLo cells after an overnight in culture, whereas only 39% of Pax7-nGFPHi cells were Myod positive (Figures 2F–2L). In agreement with these observations, 35.2% of Pax7-nGFPHi and 98.18% of Pax7-nGFPLo activated satellite cells were positive for Myod protein 18 hr postinjury of muscle in vivo (prior to the first mitosis, Figure 2L). At 48 hr postinjury, or after 2 days in culture, virtually all of the cells were positive for Myod (Figure 2L). Analysis by live video microscopy did not show cell death in these subpopulations. In keeping with these findings, clonal analysis of the two subpopulations (∼90 clones each, n = 3 mice; data not shown) showed that Myogenin (5.02% ± 0.90% Pax7-nGFPHi, 72.26% ± 3.06% Pax7-nGFPLo, day 3 in culture; n = 3 mice) and myotube formation was delayed in Pax7-nGFPHi cells. After 2 weeks in culture, both populations generated similar numbers of progeny cells (∼1,209 ± 162 cells/clone, n = 3 mice; data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicate that Pax7-nGFPHi cells represent a distinguishable phenotypic cell state, one that is more dormant and less primed for myogenic commitment than Pax7-nGFPLo cells. To assess the functional properties of satellite cells, we performed serial passages and FACS analysis of each subpopulation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, in all cases in culture, only Pax7-nGFPHi cells replenished the total GFP+ pool (total three passages), whereas Pax7-nGFPLo failed to replenish the GFP+ myogenic population (Figures 3A and 3Ba–3Bi; n = 3 mice). We then examined the differentiation and self-renewal potential of these subpopulations in transplantation and regeneration assays. Two transgenic mice were used for quantifications: Tg:CAG-hPLAP carrying the human placental alkaline phosphatase gene that is expressed ubiquitously (DePrimo et al., 1996DePrimo S.E. Stambrook P.J. Stringer J.R. Human placental alkaline phosphatase as a histochemical marker of gene expression in transgenic mice.Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and Tg:MLC3F-nlacZ-2E that marks differentiated myonuclei (Kelly et al., 1995Kelly R. Alonso S. Tajbakhsh S. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Myosin light chain 3F regulatory sequences confer regionalized cardiac and skeletal muscle expression in transgenic mice.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pax7-nGFPHi/T (“T” is the abbreviation for triple transgenic) and Pax7-nGFPLo/T were isolated by FACS, and 10,000 GFP+ cells were transplanted in cryodamaged TA muscle of immunocompromised Rag2−/−:γC−/− mice. Four weeks later, analysis by immunofluorescence showed a large area of newly generated PLAP+ myofibers and self-renewed satellite cells surrounded by a Laminin+ basement membrane, with both subpopulations (Figures 3Ca–3Cd, 3E, and 3F). The renewed satellite cells were quiescent as assessed by lack of expression of the cell-cycle marker Ki67 (Figures 3Da–3Dd). To assess the long-term regenerative capacity of the muscle stem cell subpopulations in vivo, an initial transplantation was performed with 10000 Pax7-nGFPHi and Pax7-nGFPLo quiescent satellite cells isolated by FACS (Figure 3G). Three weeks later, several thousand GFP+ satellite cells were collected, pooled for each subpopulation, and used to transplant into the preinjured Tibialis anterior muscle of secondary recipient mice. Subsequent serial transplantations were performed in a similar manner (seven rounds maximum; Figure 3G). To determine if all transplanted cells were participating actively and entered the cell cycle, 24 hr posttransplantation, BrdU was injected for 4 days, and the mice were sacrificed for analysis. All GFP+ satellite cells were BrdU+ (data not shown). A drop in cell numbers was often observed between transplanted and harvested cells, likely due to cell death immediately after transplantation (Beauchamp et al., 1999Beauchamp J.R. Morgan J.E. Pagel C.N. Partridge T.A. Dynamics of myoblast transplantation reveal a discrete minority of precursors with stem cell-like properties as the myogenic source.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, Gayraud-Morel et al., 2009Gayraud-Morel B. Chrétien F. Tajbakhsh S. Skeletal muscle as a paradigm for regenerative biology and medicine.Regen. Med. 2009; 4: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Notably, however, in some cases, up to 35 times more GFP+ cells were collected than were injected initially (e.g., fifth transplantation; Figure 3G). In some experiments, transplanted muscles were stained for X-gal or PLAP to demonstrate the regenerative capacity of the donor cells (Figure 3H). In accordance with in vitro results (Figure 3B), in two of five rounds of independent serial transplantation experiments, only the Pax7-nGFPHi/T subpopulation yielded Pax7-nGFPHi cells, whereas the Pax7-nGFPHi compartment was not replenished appreciably by Pax7-nGFPLo cells (Figures 3Ia–3Id). These observations suggest that Pax7-nGFPHi cells are more upstream and that they give rise to Pax7-nGFPLo satellite cells. To determine which subpopulation of satellite cells can perform TDSS in vivo, we employed a strategy similar to that indicated above but with regenerating muscle. The Tibialis anterior muscle of 6-week-old Tg:Pax7-nGFP mice was injured by intramuscular injection of the snake venom notexin (Gayraud-Morel et al., 2007Gayraud-Morel B. Chrétien F. Flamant P. Gomès D. Zammit P.S. Tajbakhsh S. A role for the myogenic determination gene Myf5 in adult regenerative myogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2007; 312: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; Figure 4A ). Rapid degeneration and necrosis of myofibers occur, and satellite cells are concomitantly activated to generate myoblasts that will participate in muscle regeneration, usually taking about 3–4 weeks before homeostasis is achieved. BrdU was administered intraperitoneally from the second (D2) to the fifth (D5) day postinjury, and animals were sacrificed at different times after the last injection (Figure 4A). Consistent with the growth paradigm, LRCs were enriched in the Pax7-nGFPHi subpopulation at all times examined (e.g., after 11 weeks 12% in Pax7-nGFPHi versus 3.9% in Pax7-nGFPLo satellite cells; Figure 4B). The higher frequency of LRCs observed in the Pax7-nGFPHi subpopulation might be a consequence of this subpopulation entering quiescence more rapidly than Pax7-nGFPLo cells. To investigate this possibility, satellite cells were isolated at time intervals after injury, and the mic"

The molecular mechanisms by which estrogens prevent and androgens promote liver cancer remain unclear. Here, we discover that sexually dimorphic HCC is completely reversed in Foxa1- and Foxa2-deficient mice after diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Coregulation of target genes by Foxa1/a2 and either the estrogen receptor (ERα) or the androgen receptor (AR) was increased during hepatocarcinogenesis in normal female or male mice, respectively, but was lost in Foxa1/2-deficient mice. Thus, both estrogen-dependent resistance to and androgen-mediated facilitation of HCC depend on Foxa1/2. Strikingly, single nucleotide polymorphisms at FOXA2 binding sites reduce binding of both FOXA2 and ERα to their targets in human liver and correlate with HCC development in women. Thus, Foxa factors and their targets are central for the sexual dimorphism of HCC."

Recent studies suggesting that the effects of diet can be passed on epigenetically to offspring add weight to the idea that histones act as metabolic sensors, converting changes in metabolism into stable patterns of gene expression. The challenge will now be to understand how localized fluctuations in levels of metabolites control chromatin modifiers in space and time, translating a dynamic metabolic state into a histone map. Chromatin-modifying enzymes have long been proposed to be the authors of an epigenetic language, but the origin and meaning of the messages they write in chromatin are still mysterious. Recent studies suggesting that the effects of diet can be passed on epigenetically to offspring add weight to the idea that histones act as metabolic sensors, converting changes in metabolism into stable patterns of gene expression. The challenge will now be to understand how localized fluctuations in levels of metabolites control chromatin modifiers in space and time, translating a dynamic metabolic state into a histone map. The excitement about epigenetics and chromatin remodeling that has characterized biological research during the past two decades is in large part focused on a single question: how is gene expression stably reprogrammed in response to transient external stimuli? Plasticity is at the heart of all biological functions, and, in the case of epigenetic control, it involves a large variety of mechanisms that have evolved to ensure adaptability to a multitude of signals, conditions, and organisms (Turner, 2009Turner B.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 3403-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Epigenetic mechanisms control chromatin structure through DNA methylation, RNA interference, histone variants, and posttranslational modifications. The interplay of these regulatory mechanisms suggests that the coordinate and progressive combination of these processes may “lock” the epigenome in specific states, thereby determining the fate and physiology of a given cell (Borrelli et al., 2008Borrelli E. Nestler E.J. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Neuron. 2008; 60: 961-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The molecular machines implicated in interpreting changes in the environment and translating them into ad hoc modulations of the epigenome are constructed from various interacting components, including kinases, acetyltransferases, and methyltransferases (Lee and Workman, 2007Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). These enzymes use cellular metabolites as sources of phosphate, acetyl, or methyl groups, respectively. Considering the myriad of residues on either DNA or histone tails that can potentially undergo modifications at a given time in the genome, appropriate levels of phosphate, acetyl, and methyl groups need to be available to the enzymes eliciting the modifications. This raises an interesting possibility: do changes in the levels of cellular metabolites influence the epigenome? Also, to what extent do those alterations induce inheritable effects? Here we review some recent ideas and discoveries that illustrate how the link between metabolism and epigenetics extends to previously unappreciated levels. Because histone-modifying enzymes consume key metabolites, it is conceivable that they interpret the metabolic state of a given cell by changing chromatin modification patterns (Figure 1). Consistent with this, a global reduction of nuclear acetyl-CoA levels decreases histone acetylation, whereas reduced levels of NAD+ have the opposite effect, inhibiting histone deacetylation (Nakahata et al., 2009Nakahata Y. Sahar S. Astarita G. Kaluzova M. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2009; 324: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, Wellen et al., 2009Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). However, the global level of a given metabolite is unlikely to be the sole determinant of the enzymatic activity of a specific chromatin remodeler. Indeed, rising levels of ATP do not increase the phosphorylation of all substrates equally, clearly indicating that changes in metabolite levels alone are not the only impetus for epigenetic editing. Histone-modifying enzymes can be recruited to specific chromosomal domains via their interaction with DNA-binding factors, and this can stimulate enzymatic activity locally. Alternatively, the inhomogeneous distribution of metabolites within a cell could lead to a local depletion or an excess of cofactors for histone-modifying enzymes with a similar outcome. Such spatial concentration differences could be achieved by the subcellular localization of enzymes responsible for the synthesis of individual metabolites, and hence the distribution would be different for each metabolite. Similarly, enzymes that use the same metabolite but modify different substrates, such as DNA or histone methyltransferases, may compete with each other leading to either one or the other methylation product. This raises the question of whether the affinities of enzymes for their cofactors differ from each other such that they would be able to gauge metabolite concentration. Unfortunately information on the kinetic parameters of histone-modifying enzymes is sparse, and studies of the dynamic changes in metabolite concentrations are limited. Despite this paucity of available data, it is clear that modifying enzymes vary significantly in their affinities for their cofactors and have KM values that are similar to the corresponding cofactor concentrations in vivo (Albaugh et al., 2011Albaugh B.N. Arnold K.M. Denu J.M. ChemBioChem. 2011; 12: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Sauve et al., 2006Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Global and local fluctuations of cofactor concentrations would therefore have an effect on the ability of these enzymes to fulfill their function. Such changes in concentrations may be caused by circadian rhythmicity, nutritional inputs, variation in carbon sources, or changes in oxygenation of the cell. Most of these external influences will globally change the cofactor concentration within the cell and will therefore have a global impact on histone modifications. However, as mentioned above, accumulating evidence indicates that histone-modifying enzymes could also make use of local changes in metabolite concentration to elicit domain-specific chromatin remodeling (Katoh et al., 2011Katoh Y. Ikura T. Hoshikawa Y. Tashiro S. Ito T. Ohta M. Kera Y. Noda T. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 554-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Wellen et al., 2009Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The cytosol and, even more strikingly, the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell contain a very high concentration of biological macromolecules such as proteins and DNA (200 mg/ml). This dense and very viscous medium severely restricts free diffusion of small molecules, thereby significantly slowing down biochemical reactions that are purely diffusion controlled. Intriguingly, several metabolic pathways are conveniently organized in multiprotein complexes to allow reaction channeling, which facilitates signaling. A classical example in this respect is fatty acid synthase (FAS), a large multiprotein complex that has been proposed to be constructed in a “molecular assembly line” to promote efficient channeling of substrates from one enzyme to the next (Leibundgut et al., 2008Leibundgut M. Maier T. Jenni S. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that close coupling of histone-modifying enzymes with enzymes critical for cofactor synthesis also exists in the nucleus (Katoh et al., 2011Katoh Y. Ikura T. Hoshikawa Y. Tashiro S. Ito T. Ohta M. Kera Y. Noda T. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 554-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Wellen et al., 2009Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). For example, Mat IIIa, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of SAM from methionine and ATP, interacts with a sequence-specific transcription factor in order to maintain a high SAM concentration, which is ultimately used by an H3K9-specific histone methyltransferase to repress transcription (Katoh et al., 2011Katoh Y. Ikura T. Hoshikawa Y. Tashiro S. Ito T. Ohta M. Kera Y. Noda T. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 554-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, depending on the main carbon source, ATP-citrate lyase (glucose) or the acetyl-CoA synthetase ACS1 (acetate) localize to the nuclei of LN229 cells (Wellen et al., 2009Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar) or S. cerevisiae (Takahashi et al., 2006Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) to provide a sufficient source of acetyl groups for histone acetyltransferases. Within those nuclear metabolic domains, eraser enzymes such as deacetylases might generate a local increase in acetate groups, which could be used by ACS1 to generate acetyl-CoA for the corresponding HAT enzyme. It is plausible that such a dynamic turnover of acetyl groups could be critical for transcriptional activation. The presence of “niches” or microdomains of chromatin modifications, where the substrates for histone modifiers are immediately replenished after the modification, could also help to insulate specific domains against spikes of metabolic changes (Figure 2). Importantly, the degree of insulation would not be homogenous along the chromatin. Indeed, it could very much depend on the level of molecular crowding, making constitutive heterochromatin much less sensitive to metabolic alterations than euchromatic regions (Bancaud et al., 2009Bancaud A. Huet S. Daigle N. Mozziconacci J. Beaudouin J. Ellenberg J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3785-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Histones are not the only proteins that are modified by acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, or kinases. Fluctuations in cofactor concentrations could therefore lead to alterations not only in histone modifications but also in posttranslational modifications of the enzymes that then in turn modify histones. Indeed, many of these enzymes or accessory proteins are modified, with the modification affecting their enzymatic activity (Vaquero et al., 2007Vaquero A. Scher M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Serrano L. Reinberg D. Nature. 2007; 450: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), their ability to bind chromatin (Wei et al., 2011Wei Y. Chen Y.-H. Li L.-Y. Lang J. Yeh S.-P. Shi B. Yang C.-C. Yang J.-Y. Lin C.-Y. Lai C.-C. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), or the subunit composition of a large complex (Huang et al., 2007Huang W.-C. Ju T.-K. Hung M.-C. Chen C.-C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 75-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Such modification networks result in complex feedback loops that translate physiological changes into changes within the epigenome. High glucose levels can, for example, stimulate the activity of the mammalian methyltransferase MLL5 through increased GlcNAcylation (Fujiki et al., 2009Fujiki R. Chikanishi T. Hashiba W. Ito H. Takada I. Roeder R.G. Kitagawa H. Kato S. Nature. 2009; 459: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This modification is catalyzed by the interacting O-GlcNac transferase (OGT), which is dependent on the presence of sufficient nuclear UDP-GlcNac. UDP-GlcNac is synthesized from extracellular glucose by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, thereby linking the activity of a histone-modifying enzyme directly to the extracellular concentration of glucose. This connection between glucose levels and chromatin structure seems to be evolutionarily conserved, as a mutation of the OGT gene in Drosophila leads to a polycomb-like phenotype (Sinclair et al., 2009Sinclair D.A. Syrzycka M. Macauley M.S. Rastgardani T. Komljenovic I. Vocadlo D.J. Brock H.W. Honda B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 13427-13432Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The systematic analysis of reversible lysine acetylation (Kim et al., 2006Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. et al.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, Choudhary et al., 2009Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar) has revealed a role for acetylation in directly regulating energy metabolism as most of the acetylated proteins in mitochondria are involved in various catabolic pathways. However, acetylation is not limited to the mitochondria as a large fraction of acetylated proteins are either exclusively nuclear or shuttle between cytoplasm and the nucleus (Choudhary et al., 2009Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many components within large protein assemblies that either bind or modify chromatin are heavily acetylated. Despite this wealth of information on lysine acetylation, only in very few cases have the function or the regulation of the modification been explored. For example, HATs are acetylated on lysine residues, an event that increases their activity by protecting them from degradation (as in the case of p300), modulating their nuclear transport (as for P/CAF), or increasing the binding affinity for acetyl-CoA (as for Rtt109). In contrast to most acetyltransferases, the methyltransferase SUV39H1 is inhibited by reversible lysine acetylation of a single lysine within the catalytic SET domain (Vaquero et al., 2007Vaquero A. Scher M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Serrano L. Reinberg D. Nature. 2007; 450: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In light of the known importance of acetyl-CoA levels on HAT activity, it is very likely that all of these modifications are in fact coupled to metabolism and could translate physiological states into alterations of gene expression. A large variety of enzymes depend on the coenzyme NAD+, including at least two groups of chromatin regulators, the class III HDACs (sirtuins) and the PARPs (poly-ADP ribose polymerases). Changing levels of a single metabolite may therefore impact independent groups of enzymes with different functions. Other enzymes such as HATs may also be indirectly affected by changing concentrations of NAD+. Mutual interplays are also conceivable within the sirtuin family. There are seven sirtuins, which display distinct distributions in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. All seven sirtuins are thought to require NAD+, although it is still unclear whether their affinities for the coenzyme differ (Sauve et al., 2006Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In any case, it could be envisaged that the relative activity of the three sirtuins present in the nucleus (SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7) may modulate the local concentration of NAD+, thereby resulting in reciprocal regulation of the other sirtuins that may be localized in the same or nearby chromatin microdomains. In this respect, it is essential to evaluate how the concentration of specific metabolites may vary in various physiological conditions. It has been shown that levels of NAD+ are regulated in a circadian manner, establishing a direct link between cyclic rhythms and energy metabolism in the cell (Nakahata et al., 2009Nakahata Y. Sahar S. Astarita G. Kaluzova M. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2009; 324: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, Ramsey et al., 2009Ramsey K.M. Yoshino J. Brace C.S. Abrassart D. Kobayashi Y. Marcheva B. Hong H.K. Chong J.L. Buhr E.D. Lee C. et al.Science. 2009; 324: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Although expression levels of SIRT1 are noncyclic, HDAC activity is known to fluctuate in a circadian manner (Nakahata et al., 2008Nakahata Y. Kaluzova M. Grimaldi B. Sahar S. Hirayama J. Chen D. Guarente L.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2008; 134: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that the cyclic availability of its own coenzyme, NAD+, is responsible for these oscillations in SIRT1 HDAC activity (Nakahata et al., 2009Nakahata Y. Sahar S. Astarita G. Kaluzova M. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2009; 324: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, Ramsey et al., 2009Ramsey K.M. Yoshino J. Brace C.S. Abrassart D. Kobayashi Y. Marcheva B. Hong H.K. Chong J.L. Buhr E.D. Lee C. et al.Science. 2009; 324: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). NAD+ synthesis is directly regulated by the circadian clock machinery, which controls transcription of the Nampt gene. This gene encodes an enzyme (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NAMPT) that elicits the rate-limiting step in the NAD+-salvage pathway. Thus, changes in NAMPT activity directly dictate levels of intracellular NAD+. These findings suggest that several SIRT1 targets are likely to display circadian oscillations in their acetylation. This is indeed the case for K9/K14 histone H3 sites at circadian gene promoters, as well as BMAL1, a nonhistone target of SIRT1 that operates as a transcriptional coactivator of the circadian regulator CLOCK (Nakahata et al., 2009Nakahata Y. Sahar S. Astarita G. Kaluzova M. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2009; 324: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the circadian clock and energy metabolism are directly coupled. This coupling is based on chromatin remodeling at specific genomic sites. Although the specificity of action of these events is still unclear, it is however evident that the circadian clock is directly implicated in controlling the intracellular levels of critical metabolites, locking together the transcriptional feedback loop of the clock with the enzymatic feedback loop of the NAD+ -salvage pathway. The extent to which the clock controls intracellular levels of other metabolites is not known, but the possibility is intriguing as a significant fraction of the genome is transcriptionally controlled by the circadian machinery. Many metabolites have been shown to have a direct effect on gene expression patterns through binding to nuclear receptors that in turn affect the transcription of the gene they bind to. Interestingly, even transient changes in the nutrition can have a long-lasting impact on gene expression patterns. This memory of former metabolic states may also be involved in disease progression. For example, patients suffering from diabetes mellitus are more prone to develop medical complications associated with hyperglycemia, even though their blood glucose is maintained at normal levels by standard therapies. Similar memory effects are also observed during embryonic development or cellular differentiation, where genes “remember” their activity states with the help of the epigenetic machinery. Several observations imply that variation in dietary composition can lead to increased disease susceptibility in subsequent generations, suggesting the transmission of a metabolically induced epigenetic signal to the next generation. For example, children whose mothers experienced the 1944 winter famine in the Netherlands late in their pregnancy have a smaller birth size and a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (Painter et al., 2005Painter R.C. Roseboom T.J. Bleker O.P. Reprod. Toxicol. 2005; 20: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Another study shows that the nutritional state during the slow growth phase in puberty has a fundamental effect on the mortality of the following generation (Kaati et al., 2002Kaati G. Bygren L.O. Edvinsson S. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 11: 682-688Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that direct the inheritance of such predispositions to disease are unknown, but the fact that they are induced by metabolic changes and show a high level of variability underscores their epigenetic nature. Heritable effects of metabolic disturbances have been mimicked by the ablation of key epigenetic enzymes. For example, the liver-specific ablation of the Sirt1 gene leads to impaired metabolic signaling and causes hepatic steatosis and inflammation when the animals are fed a high-fat diet (Purushotham et al., 2009Purushotham A. Schug T.T. Xu Q. Surapureddi S. Guo X. Li X. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Pharmacological activation of SIRT1, on the other hand, leads to improved insulin sensitivity under insulin-resistant conditions (Sun et al., 2007Sun C. Zhang F. Ge X. Yan T. Chen X. Shi X. Zhai Q. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These findings pave the way to the development of therapeutic strategies that would use SIRT1 activators as potential lead molecules for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The central function of HDACs in modulating metabolic circuits is also evident in mice deficient in SIRT6, a nuclear sirtuin that is activated through its association with chromatin. These animals develop lethal hypoglycemia and die soon after birth (Zhong et al., 2010Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. et al.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Finally, histone demethylation is also critical for metabolic regulation. Mice carrying an inactive allele of the gene encoding the histone H3K9-specific demethylase KDM3a become obese in adulthood and have increased levels of circulating lipids. This metabolic alteration is very likely due to an increase in the abundance of repressive H3K9me modifications and a consequent downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (Tateishi et al., 2009Tateishi K. Okada Y. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nature. 2009; 458: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Major metabolic changes are frequently observed in cancers, in which cells switch to an anaerobic metabolism even in the presence of oxygen. This so-called “Warburg Effect” is accompanied by major alterations in gene expression profile whose causes are likely to be associated with specific chromatin-remodeling events. Recently, the genes encoding isoforms of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2) have been found to be mutated in a large variety of tumors. In addition to a reduction of the central metabolite 2-oxoglutarate, the mutated alleles of the Idh1 and Idh2 genes generate the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which acts as an inhibitor for several epigenetic modifiers, including demethylases containing the jumonji domain and the TET family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases (Xu et al., 2011Xu W. Yang H. Liu Y. Yang Y. Wang P. Kim S.-H. Ito S. Yang C. Wang P. Xiao M.-T. et al.Cancer Cell. 2011; 19: 17-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Thus, a defect in genes encoding metabolic enzymes could directly influence the enzymatic function of epigenetic regulators, leading to an increase in histone and DNA methylation. Causal connections between IDH mutations, changes in epigenetic modifications, and the altered patterns of gene expression observed when cancer cells switch to an anaerobic metabolism have not yet been demonstrated. However, it is tempting to speculate that the epigenetic reprogramming induced by an aberrant metabolite plays an important role in this process. In addition to using multiple and varied cofactors, epigenetic modifiers also have vastly different kinetics (Barth and Imhof, 2010Barth T.K. Imhof A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This raises the question of the length and amplitude of the metabolic stimulus required to switch between metabolic states. As we begin to connect the threads linking epigenetic modifications and metabolic pathways, an important challenge will be to determine how plastic the epigenome is to nutritional challenges and whether epigenetic changes triggered by altered metabolic states can be reversed. Despite the fact that we are only beginning to understand this dynamic relationship, accumulating data already give the German saying “man ist was man isst” (one is what one eats) a completely new meaning."

Although these findings were consistent with the notion of formation of kinetically trapped folding intermediate(s) (Thibodeau et al., 2005Thibodeau P.H. Brautigam C.A. Machius M. Thomas P.J.

These contacts, similar to that of the NBD2-MSD1, are not detectable in nonnative, core-glycosylated WT and ΔF508 CFTR (He et al., 2010He L. Aleksandrov L.A. Cui L. Jensen T.J. Nesbitt K.L.

Jointly, these observations along with the observations on CFTR-interdependent domain folding and misfolding helped to formulate the cooperative domain-folding model that invokes energetic/kinetic conformational domain-domain coupling as part of the CFTR co- and posttranslational folding (Du and Lukacs, 2009Du K. Lukacs G.L. Cooperative assembly and misfolding of CFTR domains in vivo.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More recent results established that the ΔF508 mutation promotes the NBD1 thermal aggregation (Hoelen et al., 2010Hoelen H. Kleizen B. Schmidt A. Richardson J. Charitou P. Thomas P.J. Braakman I. The primary folding defect and rescue of ΔF508 CFTR emerge during translation of the mutant domain.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and compromises the thermodynamic stability of the NBD1 containing three solubilizing (S) mutations or deletion of the regulatory insertion (ΔRI, residues 405–436) (Protasevich et al., 2010Protasevich I. Yang Z. Wang C. Atwell S. Zhao X. Emtage S. Wetmore D. Hunt J.F. Brouillette C.G.

Protasevich I. Yang Z. Seehausen D. Skalak T. Zhao X. Atwell S. Spencer Emtage J. Wetmore D.R. Brouillette C.G. Hunt J.F. Integrated biophysical studies implicate partial unfolding of NBD1 of CFTR in the molecular pathogenesis of F508del cystic fibrosis.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1932-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ΔF508-NBD1 folding energetic defect in the absence of second-site mutations and its contribution to ΔF508 CFTR global misfolding, however, are poorly defined. We hypothesized that both NBD1 interface topology and energetics are important determinants of CFTR domain assembly. Our results show that either NBD1 energetics or the NBD1-CL4 interface defect can instigate CFTR domain misassembly. Conversely, genetic suppression of either energetic or interface defects alone is insufficient to restore ΔF508 CFTR folding, processing, and function, whereas in combination they result in mature protein with properties similar to those of WT CFTR. To determine the ΔF508-induced NBD1 energetic defect, full-length WT and ΔF508 human NBD1 variants (amino acids 389–678) with or without S and/or revertant (R) mutations were purified from E. coli as described (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis H.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both the R mutations (G550E, R553Q, and R555K) and S mutations (F409L, F429S, F433L, F494N, and H667R) could partially rescue the ΔF508 CFTR folding and functional defect (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis H.A.

The ΔF508 mutation reduced the apparent melting temperature (Tm) of the WT NBD1-1S from 41.8°C ± 0.2°C to 33.2°C ± 0.2°C (ΔTm ≈ 8.6°C ± 0.2°C) (±standard error of the mean [SEM]), based on ellipticity, as well as Trp fluorescence and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using different reporter dyes (Figures 1C–1E, S1E, and S1F) (Niesen et al., 2007Niesen F.H.

In the absence of second-site mutations, the WT and ΔF508 NBD1-0S thermal denaturation propensity was slightly increased (Tm ∼39.8°C ± 0.2°C and ∼31.7°C ± 0.1°C, respectively) relative to NBD1-1S measured at 2.5 mM ATP (Figures 1D and 1E). Because the protein yield was limited (Figure S1G), only DSF scans could be performed on NBD1-0S. The Tm difference between the WT and ΔF508 NBD1 was similar (6°C–8°C) for 0S, 1S, 3S, R, and R4S and in ΔRI (Protasevich et al., 2010Protasevich I. Yang Z. Wang C. Atwell S. Zhao X. Emtage S.

Thermal unfolding preceded domain aggregation for both WT and ΔF508-NBD1 (Extended Experimental Procedures; Figure S1J). Assuming a reversible, two-state folding mechanism with slow aggregation of the unfolded form (Protasevich et al., 2010Protasevich I. Yang Z. Wang C. Atwell S. Zhao X. Emtage S. Wetmore D. Hunt J.F. Brouillette C.G.

Decreasing the temperature from 37°C to 20°C lowered the ΔG0 of the ΔF508 and WT NBD1-0S from +1.8 to −4.2 kcal/mol and from −1.0 to −4.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Extended Results; Table S1). The ΔF508 decreased the midpoint urea denaturation concentration (D0.5) of the WT NBD1 variants by ∼0.8–1 M at 1 mM ATP (Figure S2E ). NBD1 fractional unfolding was calculated by extrapolation of the CD data due to the oligomerization/aggregation propensity of partially unfolded ΔF508-NBD1 (Figures 1F and S2A–S2D; Extended Results) (Strickland et al., 1997Strickland E. Qu B.H. Millen L. Thomas P.J. The molecular chaperone Hsc70 assists the in vitro folding of the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J.

The estimated ΔG0 between the WT- and ΔF508-NBD1-1S and -3S was decreased by ∼2.4 and ∼1.4 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the R1S and R4S mutation stabilized the ΔF508 by ∼1 and ∼1.6 kcal/mol at 20°C (Figure 1G). Thermal unfolding analysis yielded comparable ΔG0 differences between WT and ΔF508-NBD1-0S, -1S, and -3S (approximately −1.7, −1.6, and −2.3 kcal/mol, respectively; Extended Results; Table S1). Thus, thermal and chemical denaturation studies demonstrated the thermodynamic destabilization of the ΔF508 NBD1 with a single or no S mutation at 37°C (Figure 2A ).Figure 2Simplified Folding Free Energy Profile of WT and ΔF508 NBD1-1S and the Kinetic Stability Defect of the ΔF508 NBD1-1SShow full caption(A) It is assumed that the NBD1 follows a two-state folding equilibrium, predominantly populated by the unfolded (U), native (N), or native-like (N∗) state without accumulation of the transition (T or T∗) folding intermediate.

To determine the unfolding energy barrier between the native and unfolded states, the rate of NBD1 unfolding was monitored as a function of urea concentration by CD spectroscopy (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B). The NBD1-1S initial unfolding kinetics exhibited monoexponential behavior and was found to be independent of protein concentration between 3 and 14 μM (data not shown). The ΔF508-NBD1-1S extrapolated unfolding rate in water (kuH20) was >30-fold (0.73 s−1) and ∼17-fold (0.04 s−1) faster than its WT counterpart at 20°C and 37°C, respectively (Figures 2C and 2D). The kuH20 at 37°C was determined by the extrapolation of kuH20 obtained at 16°C–30°C (Figure S2F). The unfolding activation energy (ΔGu‡) of the WT NBD1-1S was reduced in the ΔF508 from ∼5.0 ± 0.11 to ∼2.9 ± 0.04 kcal/mol (n = 6) at 20°C and from ∼1.8 to ∼0.2 kcal/mol at 37°C (Figure S2G; Table S1). In contrast the R1S and R4S mutations partially restored kinetic stability of the ΔF508 NBD1-1S by reducing the kuH20 ∼3- to 4-fold at 20°C (Figure 2C). Jointly, these results showed for the first time that the ΔF508 reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic components of the ΔF508-NBD1-1S energetic defect at 37°C, which could be reversed by second-site suppressor mutations. The increased conformational flexibility of the ΔF508-NBD1-1S was verified by a modest but significant enhancement in deuterium uptake, determined by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) after 15 min incubation at 24°C, but not at 0°C (Figure S3). Due to thermodynamic stabilization, the extent of HDX for ΔF508-NBD1-1S was profoundly reduced by the R1S mutation, consistent with the increased backbone dynamics of the ΔF508-NBD1-3S, localized to residues 509–511 (Lewis et al., 2010Lewis H.A.

https://openalex.org/W2158288696,"Misfolding of ΔF508 cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) underlies pathology in most CF patients. F508 resides in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR near a predicted interface with the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4). Efforts to identify small molecules that restore function by correcting the folding defect have revealed an apparent efficacy ceiling. To understand the mechanistic basis of this obstacle, positions statistically coupled to 508, in evolved sequences, were identified and assessed for their impact on both NBD1 and CFTR folding. The results indicate that both NBD1 folding and interaction with ICL4 are altered by the ΔF508 mutation and that correction of either individual process is only partially effective. By contrast, combination of mutations that counteract both defects restores ΔF508 maturation and function to wild-type levels. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the limited efficacy of extant corrector compounds and suggest approaches for identifying compounds that correct both defective steps."
https://openalex.org/W2046374018,"Coordinated beating of cilia in the trachea generates a directional flow of mucus required to clear the airways. Each cilium originates from a barrel-shaped basal body, from the side of which protrudes a structure known as the basal foot. We generated mice in which exons 6 and 7 of Odf2, encoding a basal body and centrosome-associated protein Odf2/cenexin, are disrupted. Although Odf2(ΔEx6,7/ΔEx6,7) mice form cilia, ciliary beating is uncoordinated, and the mice display a coughing/sneezing phenotype. Whereas residual expression of the C-terminal region of Odf2 in these mice is sufficient for ciliogenesis, the resulting basal bodies lack basal feet. Loss of basal feet in ciliated epithelia disrupted the polarized organization of apical microtubule lattice without affecting planar cell polarity. The requirement for Odf2 in basal foot formation, therefore, reveals a crucial role of this structure in the polarized alignment of basal bodies and coordinated ciliary beating."
https://openalex.org/W2058070783,"The replication of eukaryotic chromosomes is organized temporally and spatially within the nucleus through epigenetic regulation of replication origin function. The characteristic initiation timing of specific origins is thought to reflect their chromatin environment or sub-nuclear positioning, however the mechanism remains obscure. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Forkhead regulation of origin timing is independent of local levels or changes of transcription. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of the epigenetic basis for differential origin regulation and its connection to chromosomal domain organization."

Unexpectedly, we have now identified a direct binding interaction between the extracellular domains of CL1 and neurexins that is regulated by alternative splicing of neurexins at splice site 4 (SS4). Using saturation binding assays, we showed that neurexins lacking an insert at SS4 bind to CL1 with nanomolar affinity, whereas neurexins containing an insert at SS4 are unable to bind. CL1 competed for neurexin binding with neuroligin-1, a well characterized neurexin ligand. The extracellular sequences of CL1 contain five domains (lectin, olfactomedin-like, serine/threonine-rich, hormone-binding, and G-protein-coupled receptor autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domains). Of these domains, the olfactomedin-like domain mediates neurexin binding as shown by deletion mapping. Cell adhesion assays using cells expressing neurexins and CL1 revealed that their interaction produces a stable intercellular adhesion complex, indicating that their interaction can be trans-cellular. Thus, our data suggest that CL1 constitutes a novel ligand for neurexins that may be localized postsynaptically based on its well characterized interaction with intracellular SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeats adaptor proteins (SHANK) and could form a trans-synaptic complex with presynaptic neurexins.

Collectively, these observations indicated a role for neurexins in synapse formation.

Cell adhesion-type GPCRs are characterized by large N-terminal extracellular sequences containing “cell adhesion”-type domains in addition to the typical GPCR sequences (36.Yona S. Lin H.H. Siu W.O.

Although the extracellular domains of cell adhesion GPCRs vary, all include a recently identified large juxtamembranous region called the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain that contains an integral “GPCR proteolysis site” at its C terminus and mediates the autoproteolysis of cell adhesion GPCRs at a single site (53.Arac D. Boucard A.A. Bolliger M.F. Nbuyen J. Soltis M. Südhof T.C. Brunger A.T.

Among multiple families of adhesion-type GPCRs found in mammals, only CLs and a second class (the cadherin, EGF-like, Laminin G-like seven-pass receptor (CELSR) class) are evolutionarily conserved (36.Yona S.

The adhesion GPCRs; gene repertoire, phylogeny and evolution.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 706: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The extracellular sequences of CLs are composed of a lectin domain, an olfactomedin-like domain, a serine/threonine-rich region that may be glycosylated, a hormone-binding domain that is highly homologous to that of the otherwise unrelated corticotropin-releasing factor receptor, and a GAIN domain that includes the GPCR proteolysis site (Fig. 1). In addition to these extracellular domains, CLs contain the typical seven transmembrane regions (TMRs) of GPCRs followed by a rather long cytoplasmic tail. Most of the alternative splicing of CLs affects its cytoplasmic tail except for splice site A (SSA) in its N-terminal sequence (Fig. 1). The discovery of neurexins and CLs as putative neuronal cell adhesion molecules and α-latrotoxin receptors triggered a search for endogenous ligands of these receptors. As mentioned above, numerous ligands for neurexins have been described, in particular GABA receptors, neuroligins, LRRTMs, cerebellins, neurexophilins, and dystroglycan (13.Ichtchenko K. Hata Y.

Despite the fact that the high α-latrotoxin binding affinity of both neurexins and CL1 suggested that they do not act as co-receptors for α-latrotoxin, knock-out studies indicated complementary roles as α-latrotoxin receptors (44.Tobaben S.

https://openalex.org/W1996217426,"CTLA-4 is one of the most important negative regulators of the T cell immune response. However, the subcellular distribution of CTLA-4 is unusual for a receptor that interacts with cell surface transmembrane ligands in that CTLA-4 is rapidly internalized from the plasma membrane. It has been proposed that T cell activation can lead to stabilization of CTLA-4 expression at the cell surface. Here we have analyzed in detail the internalization, recycling, and degradation of CTLA-4. We demonstrate that CTLA-4 is rapidly internalized from the plasma membrane in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner driven by the well characterized YVKM trafficking motif. Furthermore, we show that once internalized, CTLA-4 co-localizes with markers of recycling endosomes and is recycled to the plasma membrane. Although we observed limited co-localization of CTLA-4 with lysosomal markers, CTLA-4 was nonetheless degraded in a manner inhibited by lysosomal blockade. T cell activation stimulated mobilization of CTLA-4, as judged by an increase in cell surface expression; however, this pool of CTLA-4 continued to endocytose and was not stably retained at the cell surface. These data support a model of trafficking whereby CTLA-4 is constitutively internalized in a ligand-independent manner undergoing both recycling and degradation. Stimulation of T cells increases CTLA-4 turnover at the plasma membrane; however, CTLA-4 endocytosis continues and is not stabilized during activation of human T cells. These findings emphasize the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in regulating CTLA-4 trafficking throughout T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2158745436,"Hundreds of effector proteins of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum constitute a “secretome” carrying a host-targeting (HT) signal, which predicts their export from the intracellular pathogen into the surrounding erythrocyte. Cleavage of the HT signal by a parasite endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protease, plasmepsin V, is the proposed export mechanism. Here, we show that the HT signal facilitates export by recognition of the lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) in the ER, prior to and independent of protease action. Secretome HT signals, including those of major virulence determinants, bind PI(3)P with nanomolar affinity and amino acid specificities displayed by HT-mediated export. PI(3)P-enriched regions are detected within the parasite's ER and colocalize with endogenous HT signal on ER precursors, which also display high-affinity binding to PI(3)P. A related pathogenic oomycete's HT signal export is dependent on PI(3)P binding, without cleavage by plasmepsin V. Thus, PI(3)P in the ER functions in mechanisms of secretion and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2060026300,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia throughout the world, with high morbidity and mortality rates. A major feature of pneumococcal pneumonia is abundant neutrophil infiltration. In this study, we identified S. pneumoniae α-enolase as a neutrophil binding protein in ligand blot assay and mass spectrometry findings. Scanning electron microscopic and fluorescence microscopic analyses also revealed that S. pneumoniae α-enolase induces formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which have been reported to bind and kill microbes. In addition, cytotoxic assay results showed that α-enolase dose-dependently increased the release of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase from human neutrophils as compared with untreated neutrophils. Furthermore, an in vitro cell migration assay using Chemotaxicell culture chambers demonstrated that α-enolase possesses neutrophil migrating activity. Interestingly, bactericidal assay findings showed that α-enolase increased neutrophil extracellular trap-dependent killing of S. pneumoniae in human blood. Moreover, pulldown assay and mass spectrometry results identified myoblast antigen 24.1D5 as an α-enolase-binding protein on human neutrophils, whereas flow cytometric analysis revealed that 24.1D5 was expressed on human neutrophils, but not on human monocytes or T cells. Together, our results indicate that α-enolase from S. pneumoniae increases neutrophil migrating activity and induces cell death of human neutrophils by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps. Furthermore, we found that myoblast antigen 24.1D5, which expressed on the surface of neutrophils, bound to α-enolase of S. pneumoniae."

Here, we have investigated its mode of antimicrobial activity. We found that DCD-1L interacts preferentially with negatively charged bacterial phospholipids with a helix axis that is aligned flat on a lipid bilayer surface. Upon interaction with lipid bilayers DCD-1L forms oligomeric complexes that are stabilized by Zn(2+). DCD-1L is able to form ion channels in the bacterial membrane, and we propose that Zn(2+)-induced self-assembly of DCD-1L upon interaction with bacterial lipid bilayers is a prerequisite for ion channel formation. These data allow us for the first time to propose a molecular model for the antimicrobial mechanism of a naturally processed human anionic peptide that is active under the harsh conditions present in human sweat."

It was constructed by rational truncation of GBD-CD2, which harbors the second catalytic domain of DSR-E. Like GBD-CD2, this variant displays α-(1→2) branching activity when incubated with sucrose as glucosyl donor and (oligo-)dextran as acceptor, transferring glucosyl residues to the acceptor via a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism.

Glucansucrases from glycoside hydrolase family 70 (GH70) 5The abbreviations used are: GHglycoside hydrolaseGBDglucan-binding domainGBD-CD2GBD-catalytic domain 2Glcpglucopyranose. are transglucosidases produced by lactic acid bacteria from the genera Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Weissella, and Oenococcus (1.Henrissat B.

They naturally catalyze the polymerization of glucosyl residues with concomitant fructose release from sucrose, a cheap agroresource. Depending on the enzyme specificity, a large variety of glucans containing all types of glucosidic bonds, namely α-(1→2), α-(1→3), α-(1→4), or α-(1→6), and varying in terms of size, structure, degree of branching, and spatial arrangement are synthesized. These enzymes are also able to transfer the glucosyl unit from sucrose onto hydroxylated acceptor molecules added in the reaction medium and stand as very attractive biocatalysts for the production of novel biopolymers, prebiotic oligosaccharides, and new glucoderivatives (2.Monsan P.

GTF180-ΔN is a dextransucrase synthesizing mainly α-(1→6) glucosidic linkages, whereas GTF-SI mutansucrase is specific for α-(1→3) bond formation. In the GH70 family, the enzyme DSR-E from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 drew our attention because it was one of the rare enzymes able to synthesize dextrans with high amounts of α-(1→2) branch linkages. Sequence analysis of this very large enzyme (313 kDa) revealed the presence of two catalytic domains, CD1 and CD2, separated by a glucan-binding domain (GBD). CD1 and CD2, which share 45% identity and 65% similarity, were both classified in family GH70 (10.Bozonnet S. Dols-Laffargue M. Fabre E. Pizzut S. Remaud-Simeon M. Monsan P. Willemot R.M.

Both contain the highly conserved amino acids proposed to be involved in the formation of the glucosyl enzyme intermediate. Biochemical characterization of two recombinant truncated forms (CD1-GBD and GBD-CD2) showed that CD1-GBD acts as a polymerase, producing a glucan containing 86% α-(1→6), 11% α-(1→3), and 3% α-(1→4) glucosidic bonds. The second form (GBD-CD2) was found to be exclusively responsible for the synthesis of α-(1→2) linkages (11.Fabre E. Bozonnet S. Arcache A. Willemot R.M. Vignon M. Monsan P. Remaud-Simeon M.

Because of this unique specificity, GBD-CD2 holds a great potential for the production of novel functional foods. To further investigate structure-function relationships of this α-(1→2) branching sucrase, we performed rational truncations of GBD-CD2 to obtain a pure and crystallizable enzyme form. The specificity and kinetic properties of the variant ΔN123-GBD-CD2 were investigated, and the apo x-ray structure was solved at 1.90 Å resolution. Additionally, the x-ray structure of this enzyme was solved at 3.3 Å resolution in a different crystal form. These are the first three-dimensional structures of an α-(1→2) branching sucrase. When compared with the GTF180-ΔN glucansucrase and GTF-SI mutansucrase structures, the GBD-CD2 structure revealed common but also very distinctive features that are discussed with regard to the α-(1→2) branching properties. The gbd-cd2 gene inserted into pBAD TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) was amplified by PCR using the forward primer CACCATGGCACAAGCAGGTCACTATATCACGAAAA and reverse primer AGCTTGAGGTAATGTTGATTTATC for ΔN123-gbd-cd2. The primers used to generate other truncated mutants are listed in supplemental Table S1. The purified PCR products were cloned into a pBAD TOPO Directional 102 vector (Invitrogen). After ligation, the N-terminal thioredoxin tag was removed by NcoI restriction endonuclease digestion (supplemental Table S1). The constructs resulted in proteins with a C-terminal V5 epitope His6 tag. The Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) and all restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. DNA sequencing of the ΔN123-gbd-cd2 gene did not reveal any mutation (MilleGen, Labège, France). Transformed Escherichia coli strain TOP10 One shot (Invitrogen) was grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Induction with 0.02% (w/v) l-arabinose was performed at an A600 nm of 0.5. The cells were grown for an 8 additional hours, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with EDTA free anti-protease tablets (Roche), and disrupted by sonication. The ΔN123-GBD-CD2 enzyme was recovered as inclusion bodies in the crude cell extract. Inclusion bodies were recovered by three cycles of washing, with PBS buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. They were denaturated using 8 m urea buffer, pH 8.0. The denatured protein preparation (120 ml) was supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 25 mm imidazole, adjusted to pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was injected at a flow rate of 3 ml/min onto a 20-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), equilibrated with 8 m urea buffer, pH 8.0. Protein refolding was carried out on-column, with five column volumes of buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4). The protein was eluted with a gradient of imidazole and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. The solution was then applied to Q-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a gradient of 25–500 mm NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1% (v/v) glycerol. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 5.75. Protein purity was checked by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. See the supplemental text. Standard activities were determined as described previously (12.Brison Y. Fabre E. Moulis C. Portais J.C. Monsan P. Remaud-Siméon M.

The reaction in the presence of sucrose and maltose was performed using standard conditions for 24 h using 146 mm of maltose and 1.0 unit/ml of enzymatic activity. Branching reactions of linear dextrans were carried out using standard conditions with 292 mm sucrose and 2,470, 1,237, 463, 311, 123, 92, or 62 mm of 70-kDa dextran acceptor (dextran concentrations expressed as anhydroglucosyl unit concentrations) with 1.5 units/ml of purified enzyme. The reaction medium was analyzed by HPLC as described by Brison et al. (12.Brison Y. Fabre E. Moulis C. Portais J.C. Monsan P. Remaud-Siméon M.

Approximately 10 mg of each purified branched dextran was purified and analyzed by 1H NMR to determine its α-(1→2) linkage content (12.Brison Y. Fabre E. Moulis C. Portais J.C. Monsan P.

The ΔΝ123-GBD-CD2 kinetic mechanism was investigated by steady-state kinetics following the methodology described by Brison et al. (12.Brison Y. Fabre E. Moulis C. Portais J.C. Monsan P.

Freshly purified enzyme was concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra, 4 Ultracel, 50 kDa; Millipore) to 3–4 mg/ml estimated by spectroscopy at 280 nm with theoretical molar extinction coefficient and molecular weight calculated using the ExPASy ProtParam tool. The protein to reservoir volume ratio in the 2-μl hanging-drop was 1:1. The crystals were obtained from two crystallization conditions (I and II). In condition I, ΔΝ123-GBD-CD2 enzyme crystallized either as needles or plate clusters over several weeks at 285 K using 17% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m NH4I, 80 mm ammonium citrate, 2% (v/v) glycerol, pH 5.0, as precipitant. Streak seeding resulted in single or clustered plate crystals with a thickness of 10–20 μm. Crystals were cryo-protected in reservoir solution supplemented with 15% glycerol (w/v) and then cryo-cooled in a gaseous nitrogen flux at 100 K. The majority of the plate crystals usually diffracted to 5–8 Å resolution; a crystal (100 × 100 × 10 μm3), obtained by co-crystallization with the glucohexaose α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→4)-d-Glcp, diffracted anisotropically to 3.2 Å resolution in one direction and to 3.4 Å in the other direction. This crystal was used for data collection at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at 100 K on Beam Line ID14-2. The data were processed using iMOSFLM and SCALA (18.Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O. Powell H.R. Leslie A.G. iMOSFLM.

According to the methodology for structure determination at low resolution described by Brunger et al. (21.Brunger A.T. DeLaBarre B. Davies J.M. Weis W.I. X-ray structure determination at low resolution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we fixed the resolution limit at an I/σ(I) cutoff of 1.6 (at 3.3 Å resolution). In condition II, pyramidal crystals grew over several weeks at 285 K in 15% PEG 3350 and 0.1 m NH4NO3. They were cryo-protected in 20% PEG 3350, 0.1 m NH4NO3, and 11% (v/v) glycerol. One of these crystals was used for data collection at the Soleil synchrotron (Gif-sur-Yvette, France) at 100 K on the PROXIMA1 beam line. The resulting 1.90 Å resolution data set was indexed, integrated, and scaled using XDS (22.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar). Details of data collection, cell parameters and processing statistics are presented in Table 1. The data set at 3.3 Å resolution was the first to be collected. CHAINSAW (23.Stein N. CHAINSAW: a program for mutating pdb files used as templates in molecular replacement.J. Appl.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) was used to entirely rebuild the structure and place water molecules. The final Rwork and Rfree values for the high resolution structure were 0.157 and 0.198, respectively. The high resolution structure was in turn used to re-examine and complete the low resolution structure leading to final Rwork and Rfree values of 0.224 and 0.291, respectively. Residue numbering refers to the protein sequence of the full DSR-E dextransucrase sequence available in UniProt (accession number Q8G9Q2). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entries 3TTO and 3TTQ). Mutants A2249W, G2250W, A2249D/G2250W, and F2214N were constructed by inverse PCR using ΔN123-gbd-cd2 as template and the primers described in supplemental Table S2. E. coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) were used as hosts for gene expression and mutant production. The mutants were tested in the presence of sucrose alone or with an additional maltose acceptor or 1-kDa dextran acceptor. The reaction products were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed ampero-metric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and compared with those obtained with the WT ΔN123-GBD-CD2 enzyme. Docking of isomaltotriose in a model of the ΔN123-GBD-CD2 glucosyl enzyme intermediate is described in the supplemental text. Attempts to crystallize the full-length GBD-CD2 failed. We assumed that the length and the quite hydrophobic nature of GBD (849 amino acids) did not favor crystallization. Indeed, the N-terminal part of the protein contains 41 consecutive repeat units rich in aromatic residues and homologous to the cell wall binding units (Pfam family PF01473) of C-LytA, the C-terminal choline-binding domain of Streptococcus pneumoniae autolysin A (28.Fernández-Tornero C. López R. García E. Giménez-Gallego G. Romero A. A novel solenoid fold in the cell wall anchoring domain of the pneumococcal virulence factor LytA.Nat. Struct.

Conserved repeat motifs and glucan binding by glucansucrases of oral streptococci and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8301-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C-LytA three-dimensional structure was used to find 12 truncation sites in GBD (supplemental Fig. S1). Of the 12 constructs, the shortest active truncated form, ΔN123-GBD-CD2 (123 kDa; 1108 residues) with a glucan-binding domain reduced by 76%, was retained for further characterization. The purification procedure, which included isolation of inclusion bodies, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography yielded 14 mg of pure ΔN123-GBD-CD2 enzyme/liter of culture. Using 292 mm sucrose, ΔN123-GBD-CD2 mainly catalyzed sucrose hydrolysis. Several by-products, including leucrose (α-d-Glcp-(1→5)-d-fructopyranose), kojibiose (α-d-Glcp-(1→2)-d-Glcp), and traces of maltulose (α-d-Glcp-(1→4)-d-fructofuranose), were also obtained. They result from glucosyl transfer onto the fructose and glucose units released by hydrolysis (supplemental Fig. S2A). In the presence of sucrose and maltose, the enzyme yielded the same products as with sucrose alone, indicating that maltose is not an acceptor of ΔN123-GBD-CD2 (supplemental Fig. S2B). ΔN123-GBD-CD2 was also tested for its ability to branch dextran. 1H NMR spectra confirmed that ΔN123-GBD-CD2 catalyzes the formation of branched dextrans containing α-(1→2) glucosidic bonds (Fig. 1A). Branching amounts could be controlled by modulating the [sucrose]/[dextran] molar ratio (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, when the dextran concentration was increased, glucose and leucrose production was reduced. Indeed, at low molar [sucrose]/[dextran] ratios (0.12 and 0.24), the glucosyl units from sucrose are almost exclusively transferred onto dextran, similar to what has been observed for GBD-CD2 (11.Fabre E. Bozonnet S. Arcache A. Willemot R.M. Vignon M. Monsan P. Remaud-Simeon M.

ΔN123-GBD-CD2 displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics for sucrose hydrolysis. Km, SucH, and kcat,SucH values are 7.5 ± 1.0 mm and 76 s−1, respectively (Table 2). In the presence of dextran as acceptor, the initial velocities of the α-(1→2) glucosylation obey a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism. The catalytic constants kcat,T for ΔN123-GBD-CD2 and GDB-CD2 are not significantly different. In contrast, the apparent Km,DexT and Km,SucT are 1.6- and 4.9-fold higher than those observed for GBD-CD2, respectively, indicating that the deleted part of the GBD may favor binding of both sucrose and high molecular weight dextran. Deletion of the complete GBD (from Gln-1141 to Leu-1980) resulted in an almost inactive variant (11.Fabre E. Bozonnet S. Arcache A. Willemot R.M. Vignon M. Monsan P. Remaud-Simeon M.

The remaining part of GBD found in ΔN123-GBD-CD2 is thus necessary to maintain enzymatic activity.TABLE 2Comparison of the apparent kinetic parameters determined for sucrose hydrolysis (subscript H) and α-(1→2) dextran branching activities (subscript T) for GBD-CD2 and ΔN123-GBD-CD2Apparent kinetic parametersGBD-CD2aFrom Ref. 12.ΔN123-GBD-CD2In the presence of sucroseVmax H"

The effects of amino acid mutations on CYP21A2 activity lead to impairment of the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone and the excessive production of androgens. In order to understand the structural and molecular basis of this group of diseases, the bovine CYP21A2 crystal structure complexed with the substrate 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) was determined to 3.0 Å resolution. An intriguing result from this structure is that there are two molecules of 17OHP bound to the enzyme, the distal one being located at the entrance of the substrate access channel and the proximal one bound in the active site. The substrate binding features locate the key substrate recognition residues not only around the heme but also along the substrate access channel. In addition, orientation of the skeleton of the proximal molecule is toward the interior of the enzyme away from the substrate access channel. The 17OHP complex of CYP21A2 provides a good relationship between the crystal structure, clinical data, and genetic mutants documented in the literature, thereby enhancing our understanding of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In addition, the location of certain CYP21A2 mutations provides general understanding of structure/function relationships in P450s."
https://openalex.org/W1998174102,"We previously showed that depletion of the retinoblastoma protein (RB) induces down-regulation of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and thereby triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. To further characterize the effect of RB inactivation on the phenotype of cancer cells, we have now examined RB expression in human breast cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. We found that RB-inactive cells exhibit a mesenchymal-like morphology and are highly invasive. We also found that ZEB proteins, transcriptional repressors of the E-cadherin gene, are markedly up-regulated in these cells in a manner sensitive to the miR-200 family of microRNAs. Moreover, depletion of ZEB in RB-inactive cells suppressed cell invasiveness and proliferation and induced epithelial marker expression. These results implicate ZEB in induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as in maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype in RB-inactive cells. We also developed a screening program for inhibitors of ZEB1 expression and thereby identified several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that blocked both ZEB1 expression and RB phosphorylation. Together, our findings suggest that RB inactivation contributes to tumor progression not only through loss of cell cycle control but also through up-regulation of ZEB expression and induction of an invasive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2064802764,"Nitrogen monoxide (NO) markedly affects intracellular iron metabolism, and recent studies have shown that molecules traditionally involved in drug resistance, namely GST and MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), are critical molecular players in this process. This is mediated by interaction of these proteins with dinitrosyl-dithiol-iron complexes (Watts, R. N., Hawkins, C., Ponka, P., and Richardson, D. R. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 7670-7675; Lok, H. C., Suryo Rahmanto, Y., Hawkins, C. L., Kalinowski, D. S., Morrow, C. S., Townsend, A. J., Ponka, P., and Richardson, D. R. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 607-618). These complexes are bioavailable, have a markedly longer half-life compared with free NO, and form in cells after an interaction between iron, NO, and glutathione. The generation of dinitrosyl-dithiol-iron complexes acts as a common currency for NO transport and storage by MRP1 and GST P1-1, respectively. Understanding the biological trafficking mechanisms involved in the metabolism of NO is vital for elucidating its many roles in cellular signaling and cytotoxicity and for development of new therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2064899027,"BRCA1 is a DNA damage response protein and functions in the nucleus to stimulate DNA repair and at the centrosome to inhibit centrosome overduplication in response to DNA damage. The loss or mutation of BRCA1 causes centrosome amplification and abnormal mitotic spindle assembly in breast cancer cells. The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer binds and ubiquitinates γ-tubulin to inhibit centrosome amplification and promote microtubule nucleation; however regulation of BRCA1 targeting and function at the centrosome is poorly understood. Here we show that both N and C termini of BRCA1 are required for its centrosomal localization and that BRCA1 moves to the centrosome independently of BARD1 and γ-tubulin. Mutations in the C-terminal phosphoprotein-binding BRCT domain of BRCA1 prevented localization to centrosomes. Photobleaching experiments identified dynamic (60%) and immobilized (40%) pools of ectopic BRCA1 at the centrosome, and these are regulated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1) and BARD1. CRM1 mediates nuclear export of BRCA1, and mutation of the export sequence blocked BRCA1 regulation of centrosome amplification in irradiated cells. CRM1 binds to undimerized BRCA1 and is displaced by BARD1. Photobleaching assays implicate CRM1 in driving undimerized BRCA1 to the centrosome and revealed that when BRCA1 subsequently binds to BARD1, it is less well retained at centrosomes, suggesting a mechanism to accelerate BRCA1 release after formation of the active heterodimer. Moreover, Aurora A binding and phosphorylation of BRCA1 enhanced its centrosomal retention and regulation of centrosome amplification. Thus, CRM1, BARD1 and Aurora A promote the targeting and function of BRCA1 at centrosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1967244060,"Rtt107 (regulator of Ty1 transposition 107; Esc4) is a DNA repair protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can restore stalled replication forks following DNA damage. There are six BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domains in Rtt107 that act as binding sites for other recruited proteins during DNA repair. Several Rtt107 binding partners have been identified, including Slx4, Rtt101, Rad55, and the Smc5/6 (structural maintenance of chromosome) protein complex. Rtt107 can reportedly be recruited to chromatin in the presence of Rtt101 and Rtt109 upon DNA damage, but the chromatin-binding site of Rtt107 has not been identified. Here, we report our investigation of the interaction between phosphorylated histone H2A (γH2A) and the C-terminal tandem BRCT repeats (BRCT(5)-BRCT(6)) of Rtt107. The crystal structures of BRCT(5)-BRCT(6) alone and in a complex with γH2A reveal the molecular basis of the Rtt107-γH2A interaction. We used in vitro mutagenesis and a fluorescence polarization assay to confirm the location of the Rtt107 motif that is crucial for this interaction. In addition, these assays indicated that this interaction requires the phosphorylation of H2A. An in vivo phenotypic analysis in yeast demonstrated the critical role of BRCT(5)-BRCT(6) and its interaction with γH2A during the DNA damage response.

https://openalex.org/W1999432217,"Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the gene MCOLN1, which codes for the transient receptor potential family ion channel TRPML1. MLIV has an early onset and is characterized by developmental delays, motor and cognitive deficiencies, gastric abnormalities, retinal degeneration, and corneal cloudiness. The degenerative aspects of MLIV have been attributed to cell death, whose mechanisms remain to be delineated in MLIV and in most other storage diseases. Here we report that an acute siRNA-mediated loss of TRPML1 specifically causes a leak of lysosomal protease cathepsin B (CatB) into the cytoplasm. CatB leak is associated with apoptosis, which can be prevented by CatB inhibition. Inhibition of the proapoptotic protein Bax prevents TRPML1 KD-mediated apoptosis but does not prevent cytosolic release of CatB. This is the first evidence of a mechanistic link between acute TRPML1 loss and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2157540279,"The intriguing cell biology of apoptotic cell death results in the externalization of numerous autoantigens on the apoptotic cell surface, including protein determinants for specific recognition, linked to immune responses. Apoptotic cells are recognized by phagocytes and trigger an active immunosuppressive response (“innate apoptotic immunity” (IAI)) even in the absence of engulfment. IAI is responsible for the lack of inflammation associated normally with the clearance of apoptotic cells; its failure also has been linked to inflammatory and autoimmune pathology, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatic diseases. Apoptotic recognition determinants underlying IAI have yet to be identified definitively; we argue that these molecules are surface-exposed (during apoptotic cell death), ubiquitously expressed, protease-sensitive, evolutionarily conserved, and resident normally in viable cells (SUPER). Using independent and unbiased quantitative proteomic approaches to characterize apoptotic cell surface proteins and identify candidate SUPER determinants, we made the surprising discovery that components of the glycolytic pathway are enriched on the apoptotic cell surface. Our data demonstrate that glycolytic enzyme externalization is a common and early aspect of cell death in different cell types triggered to die with distinct suicidal stimuli. Exposed glycolytic enzyme molecules meet the criteria for IAI-associated SUPER determinants. In addition, our characterization of the apoptosis-specific externalization of glycolytic enzyme molecules may provide insight into the significance of previously reported cases of plasminogen binding to α-enolase on mammalian cells, as well as mechanisms by which commensal bacteria and pathogens maintain immune privilege.

Apoptosis is the primary mechanism by which cells die physiologically and is ongoing throughout life in multicellular organisms. A surprising array of cellular components comprising autoantigens are exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells (1Cocca B.A. Cline A.M. Radic M.Z. Blebs and apoptotic bodies are B cell autoantigens.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells are cleared rapidly in vivo; that this phagocytic clearance occurs in the absence of inflammation has long been recognized (2Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Apoptosis: a basic biological phenomenon with wide-ranging implications in tissue kinetics.Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12849) Google Scholar). The clearance of apoptotic cells is a key homeostatic process and represents a final step of the physiological cell death program (3Savill J. Dransfield I. Gregory C. Haslett C.

Innate apoptotic immunity: the calming touch of death.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The failure to promptly clear apoptotic cells even has been linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other pathologies, including atherosclerosis (5Herrmann M. Voll R.E. Zoller O.M. Hagenhofer M. Ponner B.B. Kalden J.R.

Independent of phagocytosis, specific apoptotic recognition elicits a profound repertoire of affirmative signaling and effector responses in macrophages and neighboring cells associated generally with the suppression of inflammation and immune responsiveness; we have termed this “innate apoptotic immunity” (4Birge R.B.

Innate immune discrimination of apoptotic cells: repression of proinflammatory macrophage transcription is coupled directly to specific recognition.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It may be that the autoimmune pathologies observed in association with the persistence of apoptotic corpses are consequences of deficits in recognition-specific non-phagocytic responses (11Patel V.A. Longacre-Antoni A. Cvetanovic M. Lee D.J. Feng L. Fan H. Rauch J. Ucker D.S. Levine J.S. The affirmative response of the innate immune system to apoptotic cells.Autoimmunity. 2007; 40: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory effects elicited upon the specific recognition of apoptotic cells (12Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Distinct modes of macrophage recognition for apoptotic and necrotic cells are not specified exclusively by phosphatidylserine exposure.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) result primarily from the triggering of transcriptional responses (especially the repression of inflammatory cytokine gene expression) in cells (both professional and non-professional phagocytes) that interact with them (10Cvetanovic M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 20055-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Subsequent responses, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TGF-β and IL-10), extend and may enhance the anti-inflammatory state (14Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. Macrophages that have ingested apoptotic cells in vitro inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms involving TGF-β, PGE2, and PAF.J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Although numerous molecules have been implicated in the process of apoptotic cell clearance (15Savill J. Apoptosis. Phagocytic docking without shocking.Nature. 1998; 392: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the critical determinants involved in the recognition of apoptotic cells and in the triggering of functional responses to them remain undefined. Our studies have demonstrated that these determinants are evolutionarily conserved and become membrane-exposed during the process of apoptotic cell death without a requirement for ensuing new gene expression (10Cvetanovic M.

We note that determinants for apoptotic immune recognition and for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells may not be identical; for example, phosphatidylserine has been implicated functionally in engulfment (16Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic lymphocytes triggers specific recognition and removal by macrophages.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 20055-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the molecular basis for innate immune responses to apoptotic cells, we have taken a comprehensive approach toward the identification of the determinants of apoptotic recognition. We have employed two distinct proteomic approaches based on two-dimensional electrophoretic separations and on isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), 3The abbreviations used are: iTRAQisobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantificationPEphycoerythrin7-AAD7-aminoactinomycin DMFImean fluorescence intensityEnoAα-enolaseTPItriose-phosphate isomerase. and we have exploited apoptotic membrane vesicles as an enriched source of apoptotic recognition determinants. From our analyses, we identified a large number of over- and underrepresented proteins in apoptotic vesicles. We categorized the identified molecules according to previously assigned molecular functions. Notably, these independent approaches both led to the novel observation that numerous components of the glycolytic pathway are enriched on the apoptotic cell surface. Through cytofluorometric analyses, we have confirmed the apoptosis-associated surface exposure of glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, we have extended these findings to reveal that externalization of glycolytic enzymes is a common attribute of apoptotic cell death, occurring independently of the particular suicidal stimulus and in a variety of cells of different tissue types and species of origin. isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification phycoerythrin 7-aminoactinomycin D mean fluorescence intensity α-enolase triose-phosphate isomerase. Although we have not completed our evaluation of all externalized glycolytic enzyme molecules as determinants of innate apoptotic responses, it is clear that surface-exposed glycolytic enzyme molecules represent novel, early, and unambiguous markers (biomarkers) of the apoptotic cell death process. Surface exposure of glycolytic enzymes has been noted previously in a variety of enteric bacteria and pathogens and is responsible for specific plasminogen binding (17Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A.

This striking commonality of glycolytic enzyme externalization raises the possibility that the exposure of glycolytic enzymes on microorganisms reflects a subversion of innate apoptotic immunity though apoptotic mimicry that facilitates commensalism or pathogenesis. In this light, it may be appropriate to reevaluate the significance of reported plasminogen-binding activities of glycolytic enzymes. Primary murine splenocytes (from C57BL/6 mice), S49 murine thymoma cells, DO11.10 murine T cell hybridomas, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, Jurkat human T leukemia cells, and U937 human monocytic (histiocytic) leukemia cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% (v/v) FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells and B2 cells, a transfectant reporter clone of 293T human transformed kidney epithelial cells (13Cvetanovic M. Mitchell J.E. Patel V. Avner B.S.

Physiological cell death (apoptosis) was induced by treatment of cells with the macromolecular synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (200 ng/ml, 12 h) (28Chang S.H. Cvetanovic M. Harvey K.J. Komoriya A.

Autophagy was induced by serum starvation with l-canavanine (1 mm) in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor quinolyl-valyl-aspartyl-difluorophenoxy methyl ketone (10 μm; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and was confirmed by the development of LC3-GFP puncta in transfected cells (29Kabeya Y.

Pathological cell death (necrosis) was triggered by incubation of cells at 56 °C for 10–20 min (until trypan blue uptake indicated compromise of membrane integrity). Iron-depleted medium was prepared by treatment with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) as described (30Raje C.I. Kumar S. Harle A. Nanda J.S. Raje M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 3252-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In some experiments, apoptotic and viable target cells were digested with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma) in PBS at 37 °C for 15 min and/or fixed by incubation with 125 mm formaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) in PBS at 25 °C for 20 min as described previously (13Cvetanovic M. Mitchell J.E. Patel V. Avner B.S. Su Y. van der Saag P.T. Witte P.L. Fiore S. Levine J.S. Ucker D.S. Specific recognition of apoptotic cells reveals a ubiquitous and unconventional innate immunity.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20055-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (13Cvetanovic M.

Monolayers of cells, either untreated or induced to die for 4 h with actinomycin D (and still adherent), were stimulated to vesiculate by incubation at 37 °C in vesiculation buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 25 mm formaldehyde). Supernatants were collected after ∼2.5 h (when abundant small membrane vesicles were apparent in the culture fluid). Non-adherent cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and vesicles were pelleted from the cleared supernatant by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Cytofluorometric analysis indicated that vesicles were ∼0.8 μm in diameter and that the level of contaminating intact cells was less than one cell/100 vesicles. Viable vesicles are comparable in size. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad); phospholipid content was quantified by the method of Rouser et al. (31Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic separation of polar lipids and determination of phospholipids by phosphorus analysis of spots.Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). For staining with primary antibodies conjugated to FITC or phycoerythrin (PE) or for staining with FITC-conjugated plasminogen (BioMac, Leipzig, German), cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing FBS (1%) before resuspension and staining in the same buffer for 40 min at 4 °C in the dark prior to washing and cytofluorometric analysis. Staining involving unconjugated primary antibodies followed the same procedure and was followed by a second incubation with an appropriate FITC- or PE-conjugated secondary antibody. The vendors of the antibodies and staining reagents used are Abcam (Cambridge, MA), BD Biosciences, Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY), Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The accessibility of phosphatidylserine was revealed by the binding of FITC- or PE-conjugated annexin V (BD Biosciences). Cells that had been washed twice with PBS were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 5 μl of the conjugated annexin V for 40 min in the dark at 25 °C. Propidium iodide and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) were employed to assess plasma membrane integrity. Propidium iodide (λex = 488 nm and λem = 610 nm) or 7-AAD (λex = 488 nm and λem = 647 nm) was added to cells (at final concentrations of 1 or 4 μg/ml, respectively) immediately before cytofluorometric analysis. For intracellular staining, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed and permeabilized in a solution of 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% and saponin in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. After fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS buffer containing 0.1% saponin and 1% FBS and stained in this same buffer. Cells were analyzed cytofluorometrically on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). The excitation wavelength (λex) in all cases was at 488 nm. The fluorescence emission wavelength (λem) from fluorescein was collected at 530 ± 15 nm, from propidium iodide and PE at 610 ± 15 nm, and from 7-AAD at 650 ± 20 nm. Cytofluorometric data were processed with WinMDI software (Joe Trotter, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) or Summit version 4.3 software (Dako, Carpentaria, CA). Where appropriate, fluorescence data are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Attributes of cell death, including changes in forward-angle and side-angle light scatter, were also evaluated as described previously (12Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Distinct modes of macrophage recognition for apoptotic and necrotic cells are not specified exclusively by phosphatidylserine exposure.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Apoptotic immunosuppressive activity was assessed with respect to NF-κB-dependent transcription utilizing a clone of the B2 reporter cell line (B2.1) as described previously (13Cvetanovic M. Mitchell J.E. Patel V. Avner B.S. Su Y. van der Saag P.T. Witte P.L. Fiore S. Levine J.S. Ucker D.S. Specific recognition of apoptotic cells reveals a ubiquitous and unconventional innate immunity.J.

Vesicles were lysed by sonication in isoelectric focusing rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 100 mm DTT, 0.2% Bio-Lyte (pH 5–8), 0.01% bromphenol blue, and protease inhibitor). Seventy-five μg of protein in a total of 185 μl of rehydration buffer was applied to 11-cm Bio-Rad ReadyStrip immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 5–8) for overnight rehydration. First-dimension isoelectric focusing was carried out on a Bio-Rad PROTEAN isoelectric focusing system for a total focusing time of 75,000 V-h. After focusing, strips were equilibrated with equilibration buffer I (6 m urea, 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 2% (w/v) DTT) for 15 min. The strips were further equilibrated with equilibration buffer II (6 m urea, 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide) for 15 min and directly applied to a 12.5% isocratic SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension. The resulting gel was then fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol for 30 min and stained overnight with SYPRO Ruby. Gels were destained with 10% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid for 60 min. After washing with water, gels were scanned on a 9400 Typhoon variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) using a green laser (532 nm) and 610BP30 emission filter. Quantitative analysis of spots on gels was performed using PDQuest (Bio-Rad) and visually confirmed. Protein spots from SYPRO Ruby-stained gels were picked for protein identification. The gel spots were diced into 1-mm3 pieces and washed with 30% acetonitrile in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate prior to DTT reduction and iodoacetamide alkylation. Trypsin was used for overnight digestion at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted with 30 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by desalting with ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For MS analysis, the peptides were mixed with 7 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (in 60% acetonitrile) in a 1:1 ratio and spotted onto a MALDI plate. The peptides were analyzed on a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Mass spectra (m/z 880–3200) were acquired in positive ion reflector mode. The 15 most intense ions were selected for subsequent MS/MS sequencing analysis in 1-keV mode. Protein identification was performed by searching the combined MS and MS/MS spectra against the human NCBI database using a local MASCOT search engine (version 1.9) on a GPS server (version 3.5, Applied Biosystems). Proteins containing at least two peptides identified with confidence interval values of no less than 95% were considered as being identified. For iTRAQ labeling, proteins from vesicles were extracted in iTRAQ lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, and 500 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer) using probe sonication at 50% duty for three cycles of 15 s with a 60-s incubation in ice-cold water between cycles. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 15 min. The pH of samples was adjusted to 8.0 with 1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer. The iTRAQ labeling procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions as further described (32Jain M.R. Bian S. Liu T. Hu J. Elkabes S. Li H. Altered proteolytic events in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis discovered by iTRAQ shotgun proteomics analysis of spinal cord.Proteome Sci. 2009; 7: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, after reduction with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and alkylation with methyl methanethiosulfonate, tryptic digestion of each sample (100 μg) was initiated by the addition of 10 μg of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), and each sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides derived from viable samples were labeled with iTRAQ tags 114 and 115, whereas peptides derived from apoptotic samples were labeled with iTRAQ tags 116 and 117. The labeled samples were then mixed together and fractionated via strong cation exchange and reverse phase chromatography according to a procedure described previously (33Jain M.R. Liu T. Hu J.

The HPLC eluate was mixed with a matrix solution (7 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 5 mm ammonium monobasic phosphate, and internal mass calibrants (50 fmol/μl each [Glu1]fibrinopeptide B and ACTH(18–39)) through a 30-nl mixing tee and directly spotted onto the MALDI plates. The peptides were analyzed on a 4800 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in a data-dependent fashion using job-wide interpretation. MS spectra (m/z 800–3600) were acquired in positive ion reflectron mode with internal mass calibration. A maximum of the 15 most intense ions (signal-to-noise ratio > 50) per spot were selected for subsequent MS/MS analysis in 1.0-keV mode. Each spectrum was averaged over 2000 laser shots. TS2Mascot (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA) was used to generate peak lists in Mascot generic file format from the MS/MS spectra using the following parameters: mass range from 20 to 60 Da below precursor and signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 10. The peak lists was submitted for automated search using a local Mascot server (version 2.2) against 20,244 proteins in the Swiss-Prot human protein sequence database.

https://openalex.org/W2039774074,"Mitochondrial carriers are a large family of proteins that transport specific metabolites across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Sequence and structure analysis has indicated that these transporters have substrate binding sites in a similar location of the central cavity consisting of three major contact points. Here we have characterized mutations of the proposed substrate binding site in the human ornithine carriers ORC1 and ORC2 by carrying out transport assays with a set of different substrates. The different substrate specificities of the two isoforms, which share 87% identical amino acids, were essentially swapped by exchanging a single residue located at position 179 that is arginine in ORC1 and glutamine in ORC2. Altogether the substrate specificity changes demonstrate that Arg-179 and Glu-180 of contact point II bind the C(α) carboxylate and amino group of the substrates, respectively. Residue Glu-77 of contact point I most likely interacts with the terminal amino group of the substrate side chain. Furthermore, it is likely that all three contact points are involved in the substrate-induced conformational changes required for substrate translocation because Arg-179 is probably connected with Arg-275 of contact point III through Trp-224 by cation-π interactions. Mutations at position 179 also affected the turnover number of the ornithine carrier severely, implying that substrate binding to residue 179 is a rate-limiting step of the catalytic transport cycle. Given that Arg-179 is located in the vicinity of the matrix gate, it is concluded that it is a key residue in the opening of the carrier to the matrix side."

DHCA also suppressed the mitotic clonal expansion of preadipocytes (an early event of adipogenesis), probably by suppressing the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ, and lowered the production level of cyclinA and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), coinciding with the decrease in DNA synthesis and cell division. In addition, DHCA directly inhibited the expression of SREBP-1c and SCD-1. Similar observations were made, using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2032893709,"The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, more commonly known as the prion diseases, are associated with the production and aggregation of disease-related isoforms of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)). The mechanisms by which PrP(Sc) accumulation causes neurodegeneration in these diseases are poorly understood. In cultured neurons, the addition of PrP(Sc) alters cell membranes, increasing cholesterol, activating cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), and triggering synapse damage. These effects of PrP(Sc) are dependent upon its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, suggesting that it is the increased density of GPIs that occurs following the aggregation of PrP(Sc) molecules that triggers neurodegeneration. This hypothesis was supported by observations that cross-linkage of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) also increased membrane cholesterol, activated cPLA(2), and triggered synapse damage. These effects were not seen after cross-linkage of Thy-1, another GPI-anchored protein, and were dependent on the GPI anchor attached to PrP(C) containing two acyl chains and sialic acid. We propose that the aggregation of PrP(Sc), or the cross-linkage of PrP(C), causes the clustering of sialic acid-containing GPI anchors at high densities, resulting in altered membrane composition, the pathological activation of cPLA(2), and synapse damage."

https://openalex.org/W2005056115,"The biological effects of bilirubin, still poorly understood, are concentration-dependent ranging from cell protection to toxicity. Here we present data that at high nontoxic physiological concentrations, bilirubin inhibits growth of proliferating human coronary artery smooth muscle cells by three events.

Moreover, altered calcium influx and calpain II protease activation leads to proteolytical degradation of transcription factor YY1.

Early studies established that mitochondria might be a major target of bilirubin, leading to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (1Mustafa M.G. Cowger M.L. King T.E. Effects of bilirubin on mitochondrial reactions.J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6403-6414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that bilirubin could inhibit DNA and protein synthesis in some tissues, as well as cell lines, and induce apoptosis (2Hahm J.S. Sung I.K. Yang S.C. Rhee J.C. Lee M.H. Kee C.S. Park K.N. Biliary proteins in patients with and without gallstones.Korean J. Intern Med. 1992; 7: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 3Grojean S. Koziel V. Vert P. Daval J.L. Bilirubin induces apoptosis via activation of NMDA receptors in developing rat brain neurons.Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Apart from its toxic effect at high concentrations, bilirubin also seems to play an important role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by acting as a scavenger of peroxyl, hydroperoxyl, and hydroxyl radicals (4Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Bilirubin is an antioxidant of possible physiological importance.Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). The extended system of conjugated bilirubin double bonds and the presence of a reactive hydrogen atom underlie its functions as a powerful biological chain-breaking antioxidant, supporting the idea of a beneficial role (4Stocker R.

Indeed, recent clinical data associate the increased total serum bilirubin level with lessened susceptibility to peripheral arterial disease (5Perlstein T.S. Pande R.L. Beckman J.A. Creager M.A. Serum total bilirubin level and prevalent lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Cardiovasc Prev. Rehabil. 2007; 14: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is also accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies showing that individuals with high normal plasma bilirubin levels, including individuals with Gilbert syndrome, have a lesser incidence of coronary artery disease and carotid vascular plaque formation (7Vítek L. Jirsa M. Brodanová M. Kalab M. Marecek Z. Danzig V. Novotný L. Kotal P. Gilbert syndrome and ischemic heart disease.

Thus, there is considerable clinical evidence that an elevated serum bilirubin level is associated with a diminished susceptibility to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Studies in rats demonstrate a salutary bilirubin effect through its suppression of vascular neointimal formation in the carotid artery because of impaired activation of MAPKs.

However, an exact molecular mechanism of bilirubin action on human VSMC remains to be established. retinoblastoma protein human vascular smooth muscle primary cell(s) ribosomal RNA quantitative PCR mammalian target of rapamycin polymerase human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Thus, we set out to investigate the mechanisms underlying bilirubin action in primary cell cultures of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. By treating growth-stimulated primary cell culture with physiologically relevant concentrations of bilirubin in a complex with FBS, we were able to detect an effect of bilirubin on the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. We report for specific effect on cyclin D1 content and the Rb profile of amino acids phosphorylation. Altered influx of calcium, resulting in calpain II protease circuit activation occurs as well. This culminates in protein cleavage of the transcription factor YY1 by calpain II. Furthermore, we observed alterations in the YY1-regulated expression of 5 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 45 S rRNA. We suggest that this, together with the proteolitically lowered YY1 levels, altered Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, cyclin D1 content, and Rb profile of hypophosphorylation, could explain the growth arrest effect of bilirubin on hVSMC. These observations provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying the switch of hVSMC from proliferative to contractile phenotype and the role of bilirubin in this transition. These novel observations may provide opportunities for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases by providing the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target these pathways. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (hCASMC) from different donors, a female Caucasian 46 years old, a male Caucasian 21 years old, and a male Caucasian 49 years old, from Cambrex were cultivated in SmGM-2 (Cambrex) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All of the experiments were performed at passages 5–8 of the cells under continuous subconfluent conditions. For bilirubin treatment, the cells were cultivated up to 70% confluence. The cells were first starved for 12 h in medium with 0.5% FBS and for another 24 h in the absence of FBS. After starvation, the cells were cultivated in medium with 10% FBS and with or without 100 μm bilirubin. The bilirubin stock solution was prepared in 20 μm NaOH and 10 mg/ml BSA. The cells were harvested for RNA and protein after 0 h (starved cells), 8, 16, and 24 h upon cultivation with or without bilirubin. In some experiments, 0.5 mm EGTA-AM (Molecular Probes) or 1 mm EGTA were added to the cell medium 20 min prior to harvesting. The intracellular calcium content was compared by treating the cells with 100 nm of fura red for 20 min as recommended by the supplier (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope) images of fura red fluorescence at 514-nm excitation and 550-nm emission were collected, and the staining intensity was measured in pixels with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe PhotoShop. Cell culture without bilirubin served as a negative control. Measurements were performed in triplicate. The cells were prepared for immunofluorescent microscopy as previously described (8Petkova V.

Total RNA is isolated from the cells with the RNeasy Mini kit from (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For RT-qPCR experiments, 600 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with random oligonucleotide primers. For cellular RT-qPCR, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the same conditions as above; 1/10 dilutions were used in triplicate with 0.2 μm gene-specific primers and 5 μl of LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Stratagene) in 20-μl reactions. Gene-specific primers were selected (PRIMER BLAST, National Institutes of Health), synthesized, and gel-purified. The sequences of the primers are: 5 S RNA, CCT CCA GTG GTT GTC GAC TT (forward) and GAA CGA CAC ACC ACC GTT C (reverse); 45 S RNA, CCT CCA GTG GTT GTC GAC TT (forward) and GAA CGA CAC ACC ACC GTT C (reverse); β-actin, AAC TGG AAC GGT GAA GGT GAC AGC (forward) and TGG CTT TTA GGA TGG CAA GGG ACT (reverse); and α-smooth muscle actin, AAT GAG ATG GCC ACT GCC GC (forward) and CAG AGT ATT TGC GCT CCG GA (reverse). The relative level of gene expression was normalized to the β-actin gene. For thymidine incorporation, hCASMC were cultivated in 24-well plates. 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added per well to measure de novo DNA synthesis by determining the level of cellular [3H]thymidine incorporation. The results of the individual treatments were obtained in duplicate using a scintillation counter (Beckmann). FITC-labeled annexin V (PromoKine) was used to identify early apoptotic cells following the protocol of the supplier. The number of annexin V-positive cells was counted by fluorescence microscopy in four independent experiments. Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously reported (9Ollinger R. Bilban M. Erat A.

DNA content analysis of samples was performed in duplicate using a FACS scan (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson). Total cell lysates were prepared by resuspending the cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Boston Bioproducts) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared with the NE-PER kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a BSA standard curve. Routinely 40 μg of protein/lane was used for Western blot with mouse anti-YY1 antibody (Santa Cruz), chicken polyclonal anti-YY1 antibody (Cell Code, MA), anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz), the antibodies to total Rb, hypophosphorylated Rb (D20), phospho-Rb (S608), phospho-Rb (S612), pPhospho-Rb (S780), ERK (p42/44 MAPK), phospho-ERK (Y202/204), MEK, phospho-MEK (S217/221), mTOR, and cyclin D1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with a SuperSignal West Femto kit (Pierce). The scanned x-ray films were then analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe PhotoShop. The comparative CT method (Applied Biosystems) was used to analyze the data resulting from the RT-qPCR experiments. Student's t test for unpaired results was performed to evaluate differences between two groups. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. All of the figures are assembled in FreeHand and Adobe PhotoShop. Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is known to be the key event in vascular response to injury. We examined the impact of bilirubin on cultured primary hVSMC from the coronary artery. Cellular proliferation was measured with the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cells cultivated with increasing concentrations of bilirubin exhibited lower thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 1These authors contributed equally to this work.A, lanes 3–5), in a dose-dependent manner, than cells cultivated without bilirubin (lane 2). The lowest thymidine incorporation was observed in FBS-starved cells (lane 1). To assess whether cellular apoptosis contributes to the observed low rate of thymidine incorporation, we performed an annexin V apoptosis assay. The results indicate that the same amounts of cells were undergoing apoptosis when cultivated in the presence or absence of bilirubin (Fig. 1B, first lane). Tested bilirubin concentrations up to 100 μm did not exhibit a significant increase in apoptosis. Less than 13% of the cells were stained positively for annexin V. In the positive control, significantly more cells were positively stained for annexin V in response to the apoptosis-inducing treatment with TNFα and IL-1β. To further investigate the mechanism of the underlying bilirubin-induced inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis was performed with propidium iodine DNA staining and subsequent FACS analysis (Fig. 1C). The assay illustrated that the majority (>70%) of the cells that were cultured for 24 h in complete medium, FBS, and 100 μm bilirubin were growth arrested at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In the absence of bilirubin, however, significantly fewer cells (<60%) were found in the G0/G1 phase. In serum-starved cells, over 80% of the cells were found in the G0/G1 compartment of the cell cycle. Thus, the sole mechanism by which bilirubin inhibits hVSMC proliferation is likely to be through growth arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. More importantly, the anti-proliferative effect is not due to cell death. It is known that cell cycle transition from the G0/G1 to S phase is controlled by Rb phosphorylation (10Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Coordinated regulation of life and death by RB.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). At least 16 different Rb amino acids are known to be differentially phosphorylated, which leads to altered Rb-protein transcription factor interactions and regulatory functions in gene transcription (11Sherr C.J. G1 phase progression. Cycling on cue.Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar, 12Zhu L. Tumour suppressor retinoblastoma protein Rb. A transcriptional regulator.Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2415-2427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether bilirubin would change the amino acids phosphorylation profile of the cellular Rb. We performed Western blot experiments of total cell lysates from bilirubin-treated and untreated cells, with antibodies that recognize individual phospho-Rb variants (Fig. 2). We observed hypophosphorylation of Rb at S780 (Fig. 2A) and S608 in cells cultivated in the presence of FBS and 100 μm bilirubin compared with cells cultivated in solely FBS-supplemented medium. These changes are consistent throughout 8, 16, and 24 h of bilirubin treatment. The hypophosphorylation pattern for S608 and S780 resembles the serum-starved cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In contrary, the level of the phospho S612 variant does not change significantly in response to bilirubin. Hence, the variant serves as an internal control for equal protein loading. The hypophosphorylated Rb binds YY1 and holds the protein in the cytosol (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the Rb hypophosphorylation on S608 and S780 in bilirubin-treated cells will be sufficient to bind and prevent the YY1 migration to the nuclei. We verified the Rb-YY1 binding and cellular localization by immunofluorescence and antibodies to Rb (S612) and YY1. Following treatment with FBS together with bilirubin (Fig. 2B), most of the cells stained positively for the YY1-Rb complex in the cytosol (orange). In contrast, YY1 stained green in the nuclei of cells that received only FBS. In our second assay for the YY1-hypophosphorylated Rb binding in bilirubin-treated VSMC, we tested the ability of antibody to YY1 to capture the hypophosphorylated Rb (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the immunofluorescence results (Fig. 2B), YY1-specific antibody captured ∼35% of the hypophosphorylated Rb (Fig. 2C, lane 2) in the cytosolic extract from 16-h bilirubin-treated cells (Fig. 2C, lane 1). Preimmune mouse antibody served as a negative control (Fig. 2C, lane 3). Our experiments argue that treatment with 100 μm bilirubin in serum-stimulated hVSMC leads to hypophosphorylation of Rb at Ser-608 and Ser-780. The phosphorylation level at position Ser-612, however, remains high and is seemingly independent of the treatment. Importantly, the hypophosphorylated Rb variant in the bilirubin-treated cells is active to bind YY1 impeding the release to the nuclei. The Raf/MEK/ERK kinase pathway is a major pathway that has been shown to influence Rb phosphorylation, as well as cell cycle transitions. We assayed whether this pathway is influenced by treatment of hVSMC with bilirubin. Western blot experiments were performed with cell lysates from bilirubin-treated and untreated cells using antibodies that are specific to various total and phospho-forms of the kinases Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 proteins (Fig. 3). We observed that although total protein levels were constant, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were less phosphorylated 8 h after bilirubin treatment when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). The inhibitory effect of bilirubin on phosphorylation was most pronounced in ERK1/2 throughout the tested 24 h (Fig. 3, lanes 1–7). Bilirubin also showed an inhibitory effect on the cellular cyclin D1 level through the tested 24 h. In addition, less total Raf protein was detectable in the 24-h bilirubin fraction (lanes 6). The protein level of β-actin seems not to be altered by bilirubin treatment remaining nearly similar to the levels in the growth-arrested control cells before serum stimulation (Fig. 3, lanes 2–7). This protein serves as a control for equal protein loading. The data argue for a specific inhibitory effect of bilirubin on Raf (S338), MEK (S217/221), and ERK (T202/Y204) phosphorylation. In addition, bilirubin-treated hVSMC have significantly less cyclin D1 protein, as well as Raf. The observed changes coincide with the bilirubin-specific profile of Rb hypophosphorylation (11Sherr C.J. G1 phase progression. Cycling on cue.Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and cellular growth arrest (Fig. 1). Previously we reported that YY1 is a direct Rb target in VSMC (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated Rb is known to restrain YY1 in the cytosol, preventing its migration into the nucleus to regulate genes that are directly involved in the hVSMC transition from growth arrest to the S phase (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In Western blot experiments, we compared the nuclear YY1 content in nuclear extracts from cell cultures after serum stimulation for 8 and 24 h in the presence or absence of bilirubin (Fig. 4A). The results consistently revealed the presence of >2 times less immunologically reactive full-length YY1 in bilirubin-treated cells (lanes 3 and 5) when compared with the serum-stimulated control cells (lanes 2 and 4). The low YY1 protein content could reflect altered YY1 mRNA content in response to bilirubin treatment. Accordingly, we measured the YY1 mRNA content by RT-qPCR in bilirubin-treated and untreated cells. The YY1 mRNA content was found to remain relatively constant (Fig. 4B). Thus, the bilirubin-related alteration in YY1 protein content is likely to be post-translationally regulated. To assay for degradation of the protein upon bilirubin treatment, we performed Western blots with polyclonal anti-YY1 antibodies (Fig. 4C) and total cell extract. The blots indicate the presence of faster migrating YY1 ∼35-kDa fragments (13Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. Proteolytic regulation of the zinc finger transcription factor YY1, a repressor of muscle-restricted gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in the bilirubin cell culture lysates, suggesting an intracellular proteolysis of YY1 (Fig. 4C, lane 1). The cleavage is YY1-specific because two other assayed zinc finger transcription factors, Sp1 and mTOR, remain intact (Fig. 4C, lanes 5–8). The proteolytical YY1 cleavage is likely to be caused by the activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain II, which cleaves YY1 in other cell types (13Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. Proteolytic regulation of the zinc finger transcription factor YY1, a repressor of muscle-restricted gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We carried out 8-h bilirubin treatment in the presence of the potent membrane-permeable calcium chelator EGTA-AM and EGTA that does not enter the cells. We observed that YY1 cleavage was diminished when the EGTA-AM was added to the medium (Fig. 4C, lane 3). The extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA, however, has little effect on reducing the suggested calpain II-YY1 cleavage (Fig. 4C, lane 4) (14Sen C.K. Roy S. Packer L. Involvement of intracellular Ca2+ in oxidant-induced NF-κB activation.FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Changes in the intracellular Ca2+ content in response to bilirubin could activate calpain II and potentially account for the observed YY1 cleavage. We measured and compared the intracellular Ca2+ level in serum-stimulated cells that are cultivated in the presence of 100 μm bilirubin (Fig. 4D) for 1 and 8 h. The data clearly demonstrate that 1 h of treatment with bilirubin results in more than two times Ca2+ level elevation when compared with the control cells. The Ca2+ level remains high 8 h after adding bilirubin to the cell culture medium. Collectively, our data document the ability of bilirubin to alter the Ca2+ influx and possibly induce the activation of the Ca2+-calpain II circuit in hCASMC. We suggest that these cellular events ultimately manifest in the cleavage of YY1. We observed alterations in cell growth, the Raf/ERK/MAP kinase pathway, and the pattern of Rb phosphorylation, together with the reduced cellular YY1 content in bilirubin-treated cells. This could result in altered transcription of genes with cell cycle transition functions that are known to be regulated by YY1 and Rb-YY1 interaction. YY1 participates in the regulation of all three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase (pol) I, pol II, and pol III (15Grummt I. Life on a planet of its own.

RNA polymerase III dependence of the human L1 promoter and possible participation of the RNA polymerase II factor YY1 in the RNA polymerase III transcription system.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is also known that ribosome biogenesis is tightly regulated during the cell cycle and differentiation processes (19Leicht D.T. Balan V. Kaplun A. Singh-Gupta V. Kaplun L. Dobson M. Tzivion G. Raf kinases. Function, regulation and role in human cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1196-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether cells treated with bilirubin exhibit an altered transcript levels of 45 S rRNA and 5 S rRNA (Fig. 5) by RT-qPCR analysis. The 45 S rRNA that is transcribed by pol I does not decrease within the initial 8 h of treatment. However, a decrease is observed 16 and 24 h after adding bilirubin to the growth medium. The pol III transcribed 5 S rRNA significantly decreased earlier after the first 8 h. Importantly, bilirubin treatment coincides with a time-dependent elevation in mRNA content of the pol II transcribed VSMC differentiation marker, the smooth muscle α-actin. This suggests that bilirubin could arrest hVSMC cell growth by inhibiting the expression of pol I- and pol III-transcribed 5 S rRNA and 45 S rRNA. Although the rRNAs content goes down, bilirubin has a positive effect on the mRNA content of the pol II transcribed marker of VSMC differentiation, the smooth muscle α-actin, which is known to be repressed by YY1 (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There is considerable clinical evidence that elevated serum bilirubin levels are associated with a diminished susceptibility to atherosclerotic vascular disease (5Perlstein T.S. Pande R.L.

A protective effect of elevated bilirubin levels.Atherosclerosis. 2002; 160: 449-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, these findings do not necessarily implicate bilirubin as the protective agent at the cellular level. Because vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a key event in the vascular response to injury and bilirubin is known to inhibit the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, we examined the impact of bilirubin on hVSMC proliferation in primary human cell cultures. Treating the cells with bilirubin inhibited the cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas extensive proliferation was found in the control cells (no bilirubin). In addition, although FBS-stimulated control cells began to progress throughout the cell cycle upon serum starvation, as seen by FACS analysis, the bilirubin treatment retained the cells in the G0/G1 arrest. More importantly, the hVSMC response to bilirubin at the tested high physiological concentration does not cause apoptosis as shown by annexin V staining. This absence of apoptosis is significant given recent reports that apoptosis of VSMCs can trigger the development of neointima formation (20Beohar N. Flaherty J.D. Davidson C.J. Maynard R.C. Robbins J.D. Shah A.P. Choi J.W. MacDonald L.A. Jorgensen J.P. Pinto J.V. Chandra S. Klaus H.M. Wang N.C. Harris K.R. Decker R. Bonow R.O. Antirestenotic effects of a locally delivered caspase inhibitor in a balloon injury model.Circulation. 2004; 109: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that at certain concentrations bilirubin triggers a nontoxic cascade of molecular events that block hVSMC proliferation. Bilirubin clearly alters the phosphorylation status of Rb, a protein with crucial G1/S checkpoint functions that are essential for the cell cycle transitions (10Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Coordinated regulation of life and death by RB.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The bilirubin treatment coincides with specific dephosphorylation of Rb at Ser-780 and Ser-608 while preserving the phospho S612. Such a profile of Rb phosphorylation is likely to be essential for keeping the hVSMC in a growth-arrested state. Importantly, it facilitates Rb interactions with specific transcription factors, including YY1 (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and its cytoplasmic retention with direct consequences on gene transcription (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One of the major cell signaling pathways known to alter the phosphorylation status of Rb at S780 and S608 is the Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway (21Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Vlasova T.M. Grewal J.S. Ullian M.E. Tholanikunnel B.G. Raymond J.R. Mitogen-induced rapid phosphorylation of serine 795 of the retinoblastoma gene product in vascular smooth muscle cells involves ERK activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24899-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We observed that a significant portion of ERK1/2 is hypophosphorylated in bilirubin-treated cells. Similarly, Raf and MEK are also hypophosphorylated, albeit to a lesser extent. It remains unclear how bilirubin promotes the accumulation of the nonphosphorylated protein forms. Bilirubin could, for example, inhibit Raf phosphorylation by inhibiting pathways upstream of Ras in a smooth muscle cell-specific manner (22Dumaz N. Marais R. Raf phosphorylation one step forward and two steps back.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 164-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is known that Ras directly interacts with and activates Raf by phosphorylation. Raf next phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERKs. Therefore, the observed low cellular Raf protein content and hypophosphorylation in response to bilirubin could trigger low levels of MEK and ERK phosphorylation and pathway inactivation. Through Raf, bilirubin could also act in a cascade-independent fashion, for example by inactivating transcription factor NF-κB. Such a scenario could explain, at least in part, the lower level of apoptosis in bilirubin-treated hVSMC. Taillé et al. (23Taillé C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Mégret J. Berger P. Lesèche G. Fadel E. Yamaguchi T. Marthan R. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Heme oxygenase inhibits human airway smooth muscle proliferation via a bilirubin-dependent modulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27160-27168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggested that bilirubin in airway smooth muscle cells could also modulate the phosphorylation of ERK by a redox mechanism. Furthermore, bilirubin could also modulate other cell signaling pathways that are cross-talking with the ERK/MAPK pathway. The p38 pathway, for instance, could interact with the ERK pathway to alter phosphorylation of up- and downstream proteins. Such a hypothesis is supported by our previous observation that bilirubin treatment coincides with accumulation of underphosphorylated p38, a major kinase in the MAPK signaling pathway in mouse and rat SMCs (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The observation that the cellular cyclin D1 protein content is highly reduced in response to bilirubin treatment is significant. Cyclin D1 is one of the major cellular cyclins in terms of its functional importance for the cell cycle transitions. The cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex partially phosphorylates Rb to trigger S phase progression (24Musgrove E.A. Caldon C.E. Barraclough J. Stone A. Sutherland R.L. Cyclin D as a therapeutic target in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 558-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The observed low level of cyclin D1 together with the accumulation of underphosphorylated ERK could explain the appearance of hypophosphorylated Rb and the growth arrest in the bilirubin-treated cell cultures. The effect of bilirubin on cell signaling pathways is most likely a complex event including redox and other mechanisms that control the cell cycle status. The exact mechanisms that control the low cellular Raf and cyclin D1 levels in response to bilirubin, however, are important and remain to be determined. Bilirubin treatment coincides with a reduced YY1 protein level. In this study, we did not witness changes in YY1 mRNA levels. The lower YY1 protein content is a result of a bilirubin-triggered specific YY1 proteolytic cleavage. No proteolysis of other zinc finger transcription factors including Sp1 and mTOR could be observed. The increase in YY1-specific cleavage is likely to be a consequence of activated calcium influx and calpain II protease activation. Supporting evidence corroborating the idea that bilirubin could have an effect on the calcium influx, on calpain II activation in hVSMC, and YY1 degradation, was previously reported for neuronal cell cultures (3Grojean S. Koziel V. Vert P. Daval J.L. Bilirubin induces apoptosis via activation of NMDA receptors in developing rat brain neurons.Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cleavage of YY1 by calpain II is likely to play important regulatory functions in the myogenic differentiation (13Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. Proteolytic regulation of the zinc finger transcription factor YY1, a repressor of muscle-restricted gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The calcium influx activation together with the involvement of YY1 cleavage mechanism in the hVSMC growth arrest response to bilirubin is novel. Targeting proteases to a transcriptional machinery may represent a unique feature in the vascular gene regulation and the response to injury. Bilirubin significantly inhibited the expression of the pol I and pol III transcribed 45 S rRNA and 5 S rRNAs. The availability of these RNAs ultimately determines the ribosomal assembly and the cellular potential for growth and proliferation (15Grummt I. Life on a planet of its own. Regulation of RNA polymerase I transcription in the nucleolus.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 16Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. At the center of eukaryotic life.Cell. 2002; 109: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because YY1 and Rb are both implicated in the regulation of pol I and pol III transcribed genes (17Felton-Edkins Z.A. Kenneth N.S. Brown T.R. Daly N.L. Gomez-Roman N. Grandori C. Eisenman R.N. White R.J. Direct regulation of RNA polymerase III transcription by RB, p53 and c-Myc.Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Kurose K. Hata K. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. RNA polymerase III dependence of the human L1 promoter and possible participation of the RNA polymerase II factor YY1 in the RNA polymerase III transcription system.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), changes in the status of Rb phosphorylation together with the decreased protein level of YY1 most likely underlie the reduced 45 S and 5 S rRNA level of expression. It is possible that the bilirubin-related Rb profile of amino acids hypophosphorylation retains YY1 in the cytosol, forming a Rb-YY1 complex that prevents YY1 migration to the nuclei and subsequent activation of 5 S and 45 S rRNA transcription. Such a notion is directly supported by our previous data showing that a direct correlation exists between levels of cellular hypophosphorylated Rb, cytosolic Rb-YY1 content, and the hCASMC cell cycle phase (8Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. Interaction between YY1 and the retinoblastoma protein. Regulation of cell cycle progression in differentiated cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, proteolytic cleavage also contributes to the functional nuclear YY1 deficiency, as shown in this study. Taken together, our data suggest that bilirubin treatment inhibits hVSMC growth through two mechanisms. First, the impaired activation of Raf/ERK/MAPKs together with the reduced content of cellular cyclin D1 and Raf proteins results in inhibited Rb phosphorylation on serines S608 and S780. These events impede the release of transcription factors that are important for VSMC growth, such as YY1. Second, there is an increase in specific YY1 protein cleavage as a result of possible bilirubin-related change in the calcium influx and calpain II protease activation. The reduced cellular protein level of the transcription factor YY1 itself results in a suppressed capacity to induce ribosomal RNA synthesis and cell proliferation (Fig. 6 1These authors contributed equally to this work.). Our observations suggest that at high normal levels, bilirubin does not cause human VSMC cell death. As we have shown in this study, there are candidate molecules and pathways that could explain the association of high normal bilirubin levels and the maintenance of human vascular homeostasis. These observations provide new mechanistic insights into the molecular players and pathways underlying the transition of hVSMC from proliferative to contractile phenotype and the response to bilirubin. They may provide opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target vascular response to injury and neointimal formations."
https://openalex.org/W2131589372,"The inner mitochondrial membrane protein 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (3βHSD2) synthesizes progesterone and androstenedione through its dehydrogenase and isomerase activities. This bifunctionality requires 3βHSD2 to undergo a conformational change. Given its proximity to the proton pump, we hypothesized that pH influences 3βHSD2 conformation and thus activity. Circular dichroism (CD) showed that between pH 7.4 and 4.5, 3βHSD2 retained its primarily α-helical character with a decrease in α-helical content at lower pH values, whereas the β-sheet content remained unchanged throughout. Titrating the pH back to 7.4 restored the original conformation within 25 min. Metabolic conversion assays indicated peak 3βHSD2 activity at pH 4.5 with ~2-fold more progesterone synthesized at pH 4.5 than at pH 3.5 and 7.4. Increasing the 3βHSD2 concentration from 1 to 40 μg resulted in a 7-fold increase in progesterone at pH 4.5, but no change at pH 7.4. Incubation with guanidinum hydrochloride (GdmHCl) showed a three-step cooperative unfolding of 3βHSD2 from pH 7.4 to 4.5, possibly due to the native state unfolding to the intermediate ion core state. With further decreases in pH, increasing concentrations of GdmHCl led to rapid two-step unfolding that may represent complete loss of structure. Between pH 4 and 5, the two intermediate states appeared stable. Stopped-flow kinetics showed slower unfolding at around pH 4, where the protein is in a pseudostable state. Based on our data, we conclude that at pH 4-5, 3βHSD2 takes on a molten globule conformation that promotes the dual functionality of the enzyme."

There is evidence from other species that cellular water channels, aquaporins (AQP), are central to both processes. Yet, data on D. discoideum AQPs is almost absent. Despite cloning of two putative D. discoideum AQPs, WacA, and AqpA, water permeability has not been shown. Further, WacA and AqpA are expressed at the late multicellular stage and in spores but not in amoebae. We cloned a novel AQP, AqpB, from amoeboidal D. discoideum cells. Wild-type AqpB was impermeable to water, glycerol, and urea when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Neither stepwise truncation of the N terminus nor selected point mutations activated the water channel. However, mutational truncation by 12 amino acids of an extraordinary long intracellular loop induced water permeability of AqpB, hinting at a novel gating mechanism. This AqpB mutant was inhibited by mercuric chloride, confirming the presence of a cysteine residue in the selectivity filter as predicted by our structure model. We detected AqpB by Western blot analysis in a glycosylated and a non-glycosylated form throughout all developmental stages. When expressed in D. discoideum amoebae, AqpB-GFP fusion constructs localized to vacuolar structures, to the plasma membrane, and to lamellipodia-like membrane protrusions. We conclude that the localization pattern in conjunction with channel gating may be indicative of AqpB functions in osmoregulation as well as cell motility of D. discoideum."

RasGRP4 is highly expressed in mast cells. Although previous data suggest that it is important in mast cell development and function, the role of RasGRP4 in mast cells and allergic responses has not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we generated RasGRP4(-/-) mice to examine the function of RasGRP4. Analyses of these mice showed that mast cells were able to develop normally in vivo and in vitro. Despite high levels of RasGRP4 expression in mast cells, RasGRP4 deficiency led to only a modest reduction in FcεRI-mediated degranulation and cytokine production. Interestingly, mast cells deficient in both RasGRP1 and RasGRP4 had a much more severe block in FcεRI-mediated signaling and mast cell function. We also made the unexpected finding that RasGRP4 functions during thymocyte development. Our data suggest that after the engagement of immunoreceptors, immune cells likely employ multiple members of the RasGRP family to transduce critical signals."

HGF-Met signaling promotes scatter and an invasive morphogenic response in epithelial cells in cell culture (5.Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. Branching tubulogenesis but not scatter of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells requires a functional Grb2 binding site in the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.J. Biol.

CXCR4 and Gab1 cooperate to control the development of migrating muscle progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the adult, the HGF-Met signaling axis is involved in wound healing and liver regeneration (7.Huh C.G. Factor V.M. Sánchez A. Uchida K. Conner E.A. Thorgeirsson S.S.

Met provides essential signals for liver regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Tight regulation of Met signaling is required for many of these processes, and dysregulation of the Met signaling axis has been implicated in various human cancers. Several mechanisms leading to dysregulation of Met in cancer have been identified. These include autocrine/paracrine activation, Met overexpression, genomic amplification, point mutation, and alternative splicing (9.Peschard P. Park M. From Tpr-Met to Met, tumorigenesis and tubes.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). MET amplification occurs frequently in gastric cancers (10.Smolen G.A.

The loss of negative regulation represents an additional mechanism through which oncogenic activation of Met can occur (15.Peschard P. Park M. Escape from Cbl-mediated down-regulation: a recurrent theme for oncogenic deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of Met is primarily mediated through the Cbl E3 ligase. The Cbl family of E3 ligases consists of three mammalian homologues: c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3 (16.Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse 3rd, H.C. v-cbl, an oncogene from a dual recombinant murine retrovirus that induces early B-lineage lymphomas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Cbl-3: a new mammalian Cbl family protein.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These cytoplasmic proteins are conserved in their N-terminal halves and consist of a tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, a linker region, and a RING domain, the latter of which is required for functional E3 ligase activity (reviewed in Ref. 19.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Cbl: many adaptations to regulate protein tyrosine kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portions are less well conserved and include a proline-rich region and a UBA domain (c-Cbl and Cbl-b) (19.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Cbl: many adaptations to regulate protein tyrosine kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The UBA domains of both c-Cbl and Cbl-b facilitate dimerization, but only the Cbl-b UBA domain is able to bind ubiquitin (20.Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. Leucine zipper-mediated homodimerization of the adaptor protein c-Cbl. A role in c-Cbl's tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 27: 474-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The presence of key tyrosine residues as well as proline-rich regions allows Cbl proteins to function also as scaffolds capable of recruiting a number of SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins (19.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Cbl: many adaptations to regulate protein tyrosine kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Both c-Cbl and Cbl-b act as E3 ligases and ubiquitinate their target substrates (reviewed in Ref. 23.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitin ligases: substrate diversity and the negative regulation of signalling responses.Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The overlap of c-Cbl and Cbl-b function is evident, as CBL−/− or CBLB−/− mice are both viable, but mice deficient in both are embryonic lethal (23.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitin ligases: substrate diversity and the negative regulation of signalling responses.Biochem.

Gu H. c-Cbl and Cbl-b regulate T cell responsiveness by promoting ligand-induced TCR down-modulation.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Similarly, in osteoclasts, the depletion of both proteins is required to disrupt the microtubule network and induce apoptosis (25.Purev E. Neff L. Horne W.C. Baron R. c-Cbl and Cbl-b act redundantly to protect osteoclasts from apoptosis and to displace HDAC6 from beta-tubulin, stabilizing microtubules, and podosomes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4021-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, differences in c-Cbl and Cbl-b function exist. c-Cbl and Cbl-b are recruited to EGFR at temporally distinct periods subsequent to EGF stimulation, where c-Cbl is recruited early (5–15 min) and Cbl-b is recruited by 1 h post-stimulation (26.Pennock S. Wang Z. A tale of two Cbls: interplay of c-Cbl and Cbl-b in epidermal growth factor receptor down-regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3020-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas c-Cbl or Cbl-b ubiquitination of its substrates, such as RTKs, primarily promotes degradation, Cbl-b-targeted ubiquitination of some substrates, such as the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, impinges on protein-protein interactions but leaves overall protein levels unchanged (reviewed in Ref. 23.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitin ligases: substrate diversity and the negative regulation of signalling responses.Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), highlighting the potentially distinct roles of Cbl proteins. Upon Met kinase activation, intracellular tyrosine residues are phosphorylated, creating docking sites for a number of downstream signaling molecules. Phosphorylation of Tyr-1003 in the Met juxtamembrane domain allows for direct recruitment of Cbl through the Cbl TKB domain (27.Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mutation of the c-Cbl TKB domain binding site on the Met receptor tyrosine kinase converts it into a transforming protein.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Cbl recruitment to Met is also mediated indirectly through Grb2 (5.Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. Branching tubulogenesis but not scatter of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells requires a functional Grb2 binding site in the Met receptor tyrosine kinase.J. Biol.

Beyond the RING: CBL proteins as multivalent adapters.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6382-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Upon Cbl recruitment, Met is ubiquitinated (27.Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mutation of the c-Cbl TKB domain binding site on the Met receptor tyrosine kinase converts it into a transforming protein.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This is required for efficient recognition of Met during trafficking and subsequent degradation in the lysosome (29.Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbé S. Park M. Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor ubiquitination suppresses transformation and is required for Hrs phosphorylation.Mol. Cell.

Down-regulation of MET, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The uncoupling of Met from Cbl, through substitution of the Cbl binding site Tyr-1003 with a phenylalanine residue, results in a Met receptor that is poorly ubiquitinated, exhibits enhanced stability and prolonged phosphorylation, and is transforming in vitro and in vivo (29.Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbé S. Park M. Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor ubiquitination suppresses transformation and is required for Hrs phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9632-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tpr-Met, a truncated, constitutively active, cytoplasmic variant of Met, lacks the juxtamembrane region containing Tyr-1003, does not recruit the Cbl TKB domain, is not ubiquitinated, and fails to enter the endocytic degradative pathway (31.Mak H.H. Peschard P. Lin T. Naujokas M.A. Zuo D. Park M. Oncogenic activation of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase fusion protein, Tpr-Met, involves exclusion from the endocytic degradative pathway.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7213-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This escape from entry into the degradative pathway may represent a common mechanism that contributes to the oncogenic activation of many RTKs following chromosomal reorganization (15.Peschard P. Park M. Escape from Cbl-mediated down-regulation: a recurrent theme for oncogenic deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The importance of Cbl-mediated negative regulation of Met as a mechanism counteracting tumorigenesis is further emphasized by the identification of naturally occurring Met variants in cancers that lack the Cbl binding site. Alternatively spliced mutants of Met that result in the excision of exon 14 containing the Cbl TKB domain binding site (Tyr-1003) have been identified in both non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and adenocarcinoma lung tumors (32.Onozato R. Kosaka T. Kuwano H. Sekido Y. Yatabe Y. Mitsudomi T. Activation of MET by gene amplification or by splice mutations deleting the juxtamembrane domain in primary resected lung cancers.J. Thorac.

These Met variants show enhanced stability and prolonged signaling and oncogenic capacity (33.Kong-Beltran M. Seshagiri S. Zha J. Zhu W. Bhawe K. Mendoza N. Holcomb T. Pujara K. Stinson J. Fu L. Severin C. Rangell L. Schwall R. Amler L. Wickramasinghe D. Yauch R. Somatic mutations lead to an oncogenic deletion of Met in lung cancer.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In addition, the gastric cancer cell line Hs746T amplifies MET with a mutation that results in the loss of exon 14 (35.Asaoka Y. Tada M. Ikenoue T. Seto M. Imai M. Miyabayashi K. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto S. Kudo Y. Mohri D. Isomura Y. Ijichi H. Tateishi K. Kanai F. Ogawa S. Omata M. Koike K. Gastric cancer cell line Hs746T harbors a splice site mutation of c-Met causing juxtamembrane domain deletion.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hence, the loss of negative regulation by Cbl may be selected for even when MET is amplified. Here, we show that conditions in which MET is amplified in human gastric cancers leads to the loss of Cbl protein. This reflects another mechanism through which Met is able to uncouple from Cbl-dependent negative regulation. Moreover, a loss of Cbl would not only enhance signaling by Met but has the capability of dysregulating the signaling by other Cbl targets such as EGFR. This represents a mechanism of RTK cross-talk in human tumors whereby Cbl loss is dependent on Met kinase activity. Antibody 148 was raised in rabbit against a C-terminal peptide of human Met (36.Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Alternative splicing generates isoforms of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase which undergo differential processing.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

HA.11 monoclonal and phospho-Src tyrosine 418 antibodies were obtained from Covance (Berkeley, CA) and Invitrogen, respectively. β-Catenin antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. HGF was a generous gift from Genentech (San Francisco, CA), and EGF was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Concanamycin, lactacystin, and PP2 were purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ) and utilized at final concentrations of 0.1, 10, and 10 μm, respectively. The Met inhibitor PHA-665752 was a kind gift from Pfizer (final concentration 0.1 μm). HEK 293, Okajima, and MKN45 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Snu-5 and KATO II cell lines (a kind gift from Dr. Daniel Haber) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Transient transfections with HEK 293 cells were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). HEK 293, Okajima, MKN45, Snu-5, and KATO II cells were harvested in TGH lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). HEK 293 transfections were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Lysates were incubated with antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads. Captured proteins were collected by washing three times in TGH lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies in TBST for 1 h. After three washes with TBST, the bound proteins were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot analysis of c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitination, cells were harvested in 150 μl of denaturing TSD lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 5 mm DTT, 50 μm MG132, 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were boiled at 99 °C for 5 min and then pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. One hundred microliters of supernatant was then diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS with TNESV buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above but with TNESV buffer used in place of TGH lysis buffer. For blots that required quantitation, membranes were blocked with Li-COR blocking buffer (Li-COR Biosciences) and incubated with primary antibodies as described above followed by incubation with infrared (IR)-conjugated secondary antibodies prior to detection and analysis on the Odyssey IR imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions to create the Cbl-b constructs with the following primers (and their complementary primers): Cbl-b-(1–483) (5′-CACCAGTCACATCACCAGGATAGTCTCCCCTTGCCCAGAGAAG-3′); -(1–541) (5′-GTGAGAAAACAAGATTAACCACTCCCAGCACCAC-3′); -(1–603) (5′-GTTTGGGACTAATCAGTAAGTGGGATGTCGACTC-3′); -(1–664) (5′-GATGCCCTCCCTCCATCTCTCTGACCTAGGCCACCTCCTGCAAGGCATAGTC-3′); and -(1–821) (5′-CACCTTGGAAGTGAAGAATAAGATCTTCCTCCCCGGCTTTCTCCTCCTCC-3′). Cbl-b 9PA and Cbl-b-(1–664) 9PA constructs were made with the QuikChangeTM multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions with the following primers: 5′-GACCCACTCCAGATCCCACATCTAAGCCTGGCACCCGTGGCTCCTGCCCTGGATCTAATTCAGAAAGGCATAGTTAG-3′; 5′-GTGAGAAAACAAGATAAACCACTCCCAGCAGCACCTCCTGCCTTAGCAGATCCTCCTCCACCGCCACCTGAAAGACCTCC-3′; and 5′-GCAGCACCTCCTGCCTTAGCAGATCCTCCTGCACCGCCGGCTGAAGCACCTCCACCAATCCCACCAGACAATAGACTG-3′. MKN45 or KATO II cells were plated at a confluency of 3 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish and transiently transfected in suspension with 20 nm human MET ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA, 50 nm human CBL siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA, 50 nm human CBLB siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA, or an equal concentration of scrambled control siRNA purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) with polyethylenimine (PEI) (Sigma-Aldrich). PEI was utilized at a final concentration of 3.75 μg/ml. 48 h after initial transfection, cells were retransfected as described previously. Cells were then lysed 72 h after the initial transfection. Quantitative analysis of knockdown was assessed using the Li-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system as described previously. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 800 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified as described previously (29.Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbé S. Park M. Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor ubiquitination suppresses transformation and is required for Hrs phosphorylation.Mol. Cell.

The genes 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0), TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 4 (SFRS4), and actin (ACTB) were used with geNorm software (37.Vandesompele J.

Accurate normalization of real-time quantitative RT-PCR data by geometric averaging of multiple internal control genes.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0034)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the normalization factors for c-Cbl and Cbl-b mRNA levels. The primer sequences were as follows: RPLP0 (sense, 5′-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GACTCGTTTGTACCCGTTGA-3′); TBP (sense, 5′-TCAGGAAGACGACGTAATGG-3′; antisense, 5′-TTACAGAAGGGCATCACCTG-3′); SFRS4 (sense, 5′-GTTTGGTAGCCGTAGCACAA-3′; antisense, 5′-TGTGGTCATTCCAGCCTTAG-3′); ACTB (sense, 5′-ATCCCCCAAAGTTCACAATG-3′; antisense, 5′-GTGGCTTTTAGGATGGCAAG-3′); CBL (sense, 5′-TCGGCTCCAGAAATTCATTC-3′; antisense, 5′-CCCTGAAGCCATCAATCAGT-3′); and CBLB (sense, 5′-CCAAGAGATGAAGGCTCCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGGTGAGTTCTGCCTGTCA-3′). Real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 and LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were taken in duplicate, three times for each set of samples, and three sets of samples (biological replicates) were measured. The level of c-Cbl or Cbl-b mRNA is expressed as the mean -fold difference normalized to the level of c-Cbl or Cbl-b mRNA in the DMSO control. MKN45 cells were seeded at 1.6 × 105 on glass coverslips (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ) in 24-well plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY). Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 20 min followed by washing three times in PBS. Residual paraformaldehyde was removed with three 5-min washes with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, and PBS). Coverslips were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and 40 min, respectively, at room temperature, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted with Immu-Mount (Thermo Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, PA).

https://openalex.org/W2002372165,"This investigation illustrates an important property of eukaryote-type serine/threonine phosphatase (SP-STP) of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in causing programmed cell death of human pharyngeal cells. The secretory nature of SP-STP, its elevated expression in the intracellular GAS, and the ability of wild-type GAS but not the GAS mutant devoid of SP-STP to cause apoptosis of the host cell both in vitro and in vivo suggest that GAS deploys SP-STP as an important virulence determinant to exploit host cell machinery for its own advantage during infection. The exogenously added SP-STP is able to enter the cytoplasm and subsequently traverses into the nucleus in a temporal fashion to cause apoptosis of the pharyngeal cells. The programmed cell death induced by SP-STP, which requires active transcription and de novo protein synthesis, is also caspase-dependent. Furthermore, the entry of SP-STP into the cytoplasm is dependent on its secondary structure as the catalytically inactive SP-STP with an altered structure is unable to internalize and cause apoptosis. The ectopically expressed wild-type SP-STP was found to be in the nucleus and conferred apoptosis of Detroit 562 pharyngeal cells. However, the catalytically inactive SP-STP was unable to cause apoptosis even when intracellularly expressed. The ability of SP-STP to activate pro-apoptotic signaling cascades both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus resulted in mitochondrial dysfunctioning and perturbation in the phosphorylation status of histones in the nucleus. SP-STP thus not only functions as a virulence regulator but also as an important factor responsible for host-related pathogenesis."

The proteins Get4 and Get5 form an obligate complex that catalyzes the transfer of tail-anchored proteins destined to the endoplasmic reticulum from Sgt2 to the cytosolic targeting factor Get3. Get5 forms a homodimer mediated by its carboxyl domain. We show here that a conserved motif exists within the carboxyl domain. A high resolution crystal structure and solution NMR structures of this motif reveal a novel and stable helical dimerization domain. We additionally determined a solution NMR structure of a divergent fungal homolog, and comparison of these structures allows annotation of specific stabilizing interactions. Using solution x-ray scattering and the structures of all folded domains, we present a model of the full-length Get4/Get5 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1972559261,"Inflammatory responses are controlled through members of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)/Toll-like receptor superfamily. Our earlier work demonstrates that the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1RI) co-receptor, Toll-like and IL-1 receptor regulator (TILRR), amplifies IL-1 activation of NF-κB and inflammatory genes. Here we show that TILRR similarly promotes IL-1-induced anti-apoptotic signals and reduces caspase-3 activity. Further, the TILRR-induced effects on cell survival and inflammatory responses are controlled through distinct parts of the IL-1RI regulatory Toll IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified a functional TILRR mutant (R425A), which blocked increases in cell survival and upstream activation of Akt but had no effect on amplification of MyD88-dependent inflammatory responses. A second mutant (D448A) blocked TILRR potentiation of MyD88-dependent signals and inflammatory activation but had no impact on cell survival. Secondary structure predictions suggested that the mutations induce distinct alterations in the α-helical structure of the TILRR core protein. The results indicate a role for TILRR in selective amplification of NF-κB responses through IL-1RI and suggest that the specificity is determined by changes in receptor conformation and adapter protein recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W1987799803,"C-to-T mutations are a hallmark of UV light and, in humans, occur preferentially at methylated Py(m)CG sites, which are also sites of preferential cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation. In response, cells have evolved DNA damage bypass polymerases, of which polymerase η (pol η) appears to be specifically adapted to synthesize past cis-syn CPDs. Although T=T CPDs are stable, CPDs containing C or 5-methylcytosine ((m)C) are not and spontaneously deaminate to U or T at pH 7 and 37 °C over a period of hours or days, making their preparation and study difficult. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that, depending on solvent polarity, a C or an (m)C in a CPD can adopt three tautomeric forms, one of which could code as T. Although many in vitro studies have established that synthesis past T or U in a CPD by pol η occurs in a highly error-free manner, the only in vitro evidence that synthesis past C or (m)C in a CPD also occurs in an error-free manner is for an (m)C in the 5'-position of an (m)C=T CPD. Herein, we describe the preparation and characterization of an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a CPD of a T(m)CG site, one of the major sites of C methylation and C-to-T mutations found in the p53 gene of basal and squamous cell cancers. We also demonstrate that both yeast and human pol η synthesize past the 3'-(m)C CPD in a >99% error-free manner, consistent with the highly water-exposed nature of the active site."

However, the high resolution x-ray structures for both by themselves do not reveal why one is a receptor and the other an enzyme. It is documented herein that a single amino acid change at position 439 of the BlaR1 protein is sufficient to endow the receptor/sensor protein with modest turnover ability for cephalosporins as substrates. The x-ray structure for this mutant protein and the dynamics simulations revealed how a hydrolytic water molecule may sequester itself in the antibiotic-binding site to enable hydrolysis of the acylated species.

https://openalex.org/W2058666342,"Human tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) exists in its functional state as a homotrimeric protein and is involved in inflammation processes and immune response of a human organism. Overproduction of TNF-α results in the development of chronic autoimmune diseases that can be successfully treated by inhibitors such as monoclonal antibodies. However, the nature of antibody-TNF-α recognition remains elusive due to insufficient understanding of its molecular driving forces. Therefore, we studied the energetics of binding of a therapeutic antibody fragment (Fab) to the native and non-native forms of TNF-α by employing calorimetric and spectroscopic methods. Global thermodynamic analysis of data obtained from the corresponding binding and urea-induced denaturation experiments has been supported by structural modeling. We demonstrate that the observed high affinity binding of Fab to TNF-α is an enthalpy-driven process due mainly to specific noncovalent interactions taking place at the TNF-α-Fab binding interface. It is coupled to entropically unfavorable conformational changes and accompanied by entropically favorable solvation contributions. Moreover, the three-state model analysis of TNF-α unfolding shows that at physiological concentrations, TNF-α may exist not only as a biologically active trimer but also as an inactive monomer. It further suggests that even small changes of TNF-α concentration could have a considerable effect on the TNF-α activity. We believe that this study sets the energetic basis for understanding of TNF-α inhibition by antibodies and its unfolding linked with the concentration-dependent activity regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2054801987,"Neph1 is present in podocytes, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the filtration function of the glomerulus, in part through signaling events mediated by its cytoplasmic domain that are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization. To understand the function of this protein, a detailed knowledge of the structure of the Neph1 cytoplasmic domain (Neph1-CD) is required. In this study, the solution structure of this domain was determined by small/wide angle x-ray scattering (SWAXS). Analysis of Neph1-CD by SWAXS suggested that this protein adopts a global shape with a radius of gyration and a maximum linear dimension of 21.3 and 70 Å, respectively. These parameters and the data from circular dichroism experiments were used to construct a structural model of this protein. The His-ZO-1-PDZ1 (first PDZ domain of zonula occludens) domain that binds Neph1-CD was also analyzed by SWAXS, to confirm that it adopts a global structure similar to its crystal structure. We used the SWAXS intensity profile, the structural model of Neph1-CD, and the crystal structure of ZO-1-PDZ1 to construct a structural model of the Neph1-CD·ZO-1-PDZ1 complex. Mapping of the intermolecular interactions suggested that in addition to the C-terminal residues Thr-His-Val, residues Lys-761 and Tyr-762 in Neph1 are also critical for stabilizing the complex. Estimated intensity values from the SWAXS data and in vivo and in vitro pull-down experiments demonstrated loss of binding to ZO-1 when these residues were individually mutated to alanines. Our findings present a structural model that provides novel insights into the molecular structure and function of Neph1-CD."
https://openalex.org/W1986170324,"Latent TGF-β1 was one of the first non-lysosomal glycoproteins reported to bear mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues on its N-glycans. Prior studies have suggested that this sugar modification regulates the activation of latent TGF-β1 by allowing it to bind cell surface-localized Man-6-P receptors. Man-6-P has also been proposed as an anti-scarring therapy based on its ability to directly block the activation of latent TGF-β1. A complete understanding of the physiological relevance of latent TGF-β1 mannose phosphorylation, however, is still lacking. Here we investigate the degree of mannose phosphorylation on secreted latent TGF-β1 and examine its Man-6-P-dependent activation in primary human corneal stromal fibroblasts. Contrary to earlier reports, minimal to no Man-6-P modification was found on secreted and cell-associated latent TGF-β1 produced from multiple primary and transformed cell types. Results showed that the inability to detect Man-6-P residues was not due to masking by the latent TGF-β1-binding protein (LTBP). Moreover, the efficient processing of glycans on latent TGF-β1 to complex type structures was consistent with the lack of mannose phosphorylation during biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the conversion of corneal stromal fibroblast to myofibroblasts, a well known TGF-β1-dependent process, was not altered by Man-6-P addition when latent forms of this growth factor were present. Collectively, these findings indicate that Man-6-P-dependent effects on latent TGF-β1 activation are not mediated by direct modification of its latency-associated peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2013401886,"In yeast, the membrane-bound HMG-CoA reductase degradation (HRD) ubiquitin-ligase complex is a key player of the ER-associated protein degradation pathway that targets misfolded proteins for proteolysis. Yos9, a component of the luminal submodule of the ligase, scans proteins for specific oligosaccharide modifications, which constitute a critical determinant of the degradation signal. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Yos9 domain that was previously suggested to confer binding to Hrd3, another component of the HRD complex. We observe an αβ-roll domain architecture and a dimeric assembly which are confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation of both the crystallized domain and full-length Yos9. Our binding studies indicate that, instead of this domain, the N-terminal part of Yos9 including the mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain mediates the association with Hrd3 in vitro. Our results support the model of a dimeric state of the HRD complex and provide first-time evidence of self-association on its luminal side."
https://openalex.org/W1979923099,"Icsbp is an interferon regulatory transcription factor with leukemia suppressor activity. In previous studies, we identified the gene encoding Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1; the PTPN13 gene) as an Icsbp target. In the current study, we determine that repression of PTPN13 by Icsbp requires cooperation with Tel and histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3). These factors form a multiprotein complex that requires pre-binding of Tel to the PTPN13 cis element with subsequent recruitment of Icsbp and Hdac3. We found that knockdown of Tel or Hdac3 in myeloid cells increases Fap1 expression and results in Fap1-dependent resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. The TEL gene was initially identified due to involvement in leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations. The first identified TEL translocation partner was the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PdgfRβ). The resulting Tel-PdgfRβ fusion protein exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and influences cellular proliferation. In the current studies, we find that Tel-PdgfRβ influences apoptosis in a manner that is independent of tyrosine kinase activity. We found that Tel-PdgfRβ expressing myeloid cells have increased Fap1 expression and Fap1-dependent Fas resistance. We determined that interaction between Tel and Tel-PdgfRβ decreases Tel/Icsbp/Hdac3 binding to the PTPN13 cis element, resulting in increased transcription. Therefore, these studies identify a novel mechanism by which the Tel-PdgfRβ oncoprotein may contribute to leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2039724192,"Biomedical research budgets are frozen or falling in developed countries. Can expansion in developing nations continue as economic contagion spreads? Biomedical research budgets are frozen or falling in developed countries. Can expansion in developing nations continue as economic contagion spreads? This time last year, global spending on biomedical research was holding up reasonably well (Macilwain, 2011Macilwain C. Cell. 2011; 144: 167-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), especially considering the forlorn state of the world's economy. But as 2012 dawns, the full impact of the great recession is about to be felt in the laboratory, according to an informal Cell survey of research spending trends in 15 leading nations. It is tricky to compare biomedical research spending across nations. Annual budgets are at different stages of development, and the best published data, which is collated by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is usually 2–3 years out of date. Although inflation should also be taken into account, salaries account for the bulk of research costs, and given that they are now frozen for publicly employed researchers in most Western nations, agencies do not need inflation-linked increases to maintain levels of activity. Accordingly, the anticipated changes in spending noted here do not allow for national inflation rates. Nonetheless, by trawling through published documents and interviewing researchers, officials, and analysts in 15 nations, it is possible to estimate how global funding for biomedical research is evolving at the beginning of 2012. A cold wind was set in motion when Lehman Brothers went bust in October 2008, leading to an economic slowdown across Western nations. Now in 2012, this economic cooling will hit laboratories, and it will be felt most fully by life scientists in the United States, which spends more on biomedical research than the rest of the world combined, according to most assessments. The $30 billion budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has basically remained flat over the past 3 years, but it has maintained its spending power through a temporary $10 billion supplement for NIH in the stimulus bill signed by President Barack Obama in February 2009. Money from that package, which peaked in 2010 and 2011, will now rapidly fade away. “You're going to go from $3 billion in stimulus funds to a few hundred million, between 2011 and 2013,” says Howard Garrison, head of policy at the Federation of American Scientists for Experimental Biology (FASEB), which lobbies for biomedical research funding. At the same time, massive pressure on overall federal spending will virtually freeze NIH's core funding. On December 15, Congress passed a core NIH budget for 2012 of $30.7 billion, ∼1% more than it received in 2011. This is clearly better than the 1.5% decrease applied to most other federal spending. However, with ∼$1.5 billion less in stimulus funds and inflation slowly eroding spending power, US biomedical research faces an unprecedented cut of more than 5%, in real terms, during 2012. And 2013 is likely to be worse. After tortuous negotiations this October, a Congressional “supercommittee” failed to specify cuts in US government spending. This led Congress to implement a “sequestration” program that will automatically trim all government programs in 2013 and would cut NIH by another 8%–10%, according to FASEB. It will be hard for either this Congress or the one elected in November to muster majorities to overturn the sequestration. Commentators believe that Democrats, in particular, may well block any changes to it, leaving NIH and other agencies to bite the bullet. “Everyone says that across-the-board cuts are a crude way of doing things,” asserts FASEB's legislative director, Jennifer Zeitzer. “But there would be political fall-out from tampering with the sequestration plan.” “Whether Democrats or Republicans are in charge, they are going to have to get to grips with the deficit. Nobody sees science as exempt, but what the magnitude of the cuts will be [in future years] is anyone's guess,” says Jim Siedow, a plant biologist and vice-provost for research at Duke University in North Carolina. Before the budget deal was struck, Siedow was planning for either a decrease or a very small increase in the 57% “overhead” payments that Duke receives on each NIH grant, which pay for its laboratories and services, such as libraries. The general situation in the United States is being echoed all around the world as the recession bites. Biomedical research remains popular, both with the general public and with fiscal conservatives, who see it as a prudent investment. But after an initial rally to protect or even increase spending on it, the argument for sustaining biomedical research spending can get consumed by the general pressure to cut funding (see map). In Canada, researchers were pleased that last year's budget brought CN $100 million (US $100 million 1All currency conversions are based on Yahoo Finance rates quoted on December 15, 2011.) in extra funding for brain research, but they expect little good news in 2012. An austerity budget will be introduced in March, and finance minister Jim Flaherty has asked all agencies, including the Canadian Institute of Health Research and Health Canada, to plan for cuts of at least 5%. “They still say science is important, but it isn't ring-fenced,” says Paul Dufour, a longtime adviser on Canadian science programs based in Quebec. In Britain, the UK Medical Research Council is better off than other agencies. “We're not in a bad place,” says its chief executive, John Savill. Though funds for all other fields of science in the UK have been frozen from 2011 to 2013, the MRC has been allocated small increases. On December 5, Prime Minister David Cameron gave his first speech devoted to science. He laid out a life sciences strategy for the UK, which included various regulatory measures—and no new money for science. But Savill is not discouraged: “The government is listening to the case we've made.” The picture is mixed in mainland Europe. Germany powers ahead while the other major scientific nations retrench. The 2012 health research budget of BMBF, the German research and education ministry, will grow from E1.27 billion to E1.38 billion (US $1.8 billion), a rise of almost 9%. Even there, however, budgetary pressures are expected to slow the recent spurt in research spending by 2013. France has announced a tiny increase of 0.4% in the 2012 budget of INSERM, the main biomedical research agency. But critics assert that the extra funding will be entirely consumed by the agency's growing pension commitment to its former staff. “It's really a decrease, and more and more researchers are suffering because they don't get support,” says Bertrand Monthubert, a mathematician at the University of Toulouse and former head of the grass roots scientists' group Sauvons La Recherche. When economist Mario Monti took over as Prime Minister of Italy this past November, his first act was to pass a searing austerity budget, in outline. But the plan hasn't said yet where spending cuts will fall, researchers in the country say. In Spain, researchers are cautiously optimistic that the new conservative government will try to protect science, says Enric Banda, director of the Catalan Research and Innovation Foundation in Barcelona. Australia's economy has fared better than most developed countries in the recession. Under the current 3 year spending plan, funds for its National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) will grow modestly from AU $850 million to AU $877 million (US $877 million) in the financial year that begins on April 1. While most of these old imperial powers struggle to maintain their spending, emerging powers are doing much better. Brazil has a unique tradition of constitutionally tying research spending to a fixed percentage of the economy. This strategy has paid handsome dividends for researchers as their economy has boomed. The strongest agency, FAPESP in Sao Paulo State, will increase its total budget next year by 12%, from BR $886 million to BR $993 million (US $540 million), according to its scientific director, Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz. He also says that federal agencies are growing at a similar pace. Figures from the federal government suggest that total annual spending on health research in Brazil has doubled since 2005, to ∼BR $1.5 billion (US $810 million) last year. Biomedical research remains weak in Russia by any measure, but there have been promising developments lately, says Konstantin Severinov, a molecular biologist with posts at both the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) in Moscow and Rutgers University in New Jersey. For instance, a nanotechnology initiative of US $6 billion offered some support for life sciences; the Russian government introduced US $5 million “megagrants” to lure back émigrés; and some high-quality programs, such the Molecular and Cell Biology program run by Georgii Georgiev, have evolved within RAS itself. Nonetheless, budgets next year will be flat at best, reckons Serverinov. That certainly won't be the case in India. A new 5 year plan, which will be published in February and takes effect in April, is set to incorporate far bigger budgets for the two main health research agencies, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The government in Delhi wants its own investments to catch up with the explosive growth of private sector pharmaceutical research by both Indian and foreign firms since patent reform in 2005. So DBT and ICMR are seriously pitching for increases of 40% each from their 2011 budgets of 14 billion (US $280 million) and 6 billion rupees (US $120 million), respectively—although some observers think they'll settle for a 20% increase. China appears to be equally dynamic, but its budget process is so opaque that OECD and other international bodies decline to estimate its R&D budgets. Nevertheless, the Institute of Policy and Management at the Chinese Academy of Sciences compiled an exhaustive survey of Chinese research compiled for UNESCO. It indicated that total Chinese public spending on health research was about 3 billion Yuan in 2008, which would have doubled to 6 billion Yuan (US $1 billion) last year. Observers believe that this spending will grow by about 20% again this year. Other nations in East Asia continue to press ahead with expansion of their health research efforts. Programs in South Korea achieved spectacular growth rates for much of the last decade, but their expansion has slowed over the past 2 years. The 2012 budget has still to be set; it is expected to grow modestly. Health research spending in Japan, which stood at about Y340 billion (US $4.4 billion) in 2011, has been stagnant for several years. But analysts say that it could increase by as much as 10% in 2012, as the government takes stimulus measures in response to last March's tragic earthquake at Fukashima. The outlook has also improved somewhat in Singapore. Laboratory scientists are growing accustomed to new mechanisms that support research performed in collaboration with industry, according to George Radda, chair of its BioMedical Research Council. “The worry that people had about how to access these funds is no longer there,” he says. Total BMRC will grow only slowly, he adds, but at least it is assured for the next 4 years. All of these Eastern efforts should be seen, however, in the context of the huge slowdown in the dominant biomedical research power: the United States. Talking to researchers and officials around the globe, it is notable that expectations in North America have deteriorated sharply over the last year. They are dire in Europe, too, but actual research spending there is holding up better than many feared, at least in the short term. And bold, medium-term expansion plans in Brazil, India, and the Far East must now be qualified by the fact that the overall economic slowdown is spreading into the developing world. Overall, the picture last year was bleak, but it has darkened considerably since then. The word heard most frequently in interviews for this article was “grim.” By the start of 2013, it will become clearer if this is just a severe, cyclical setback—as most scientists, busying themselves in the lab, prefer to think—or if the great recession will shake the concept of large-scale, publicly funded biomedical research funding to its very core.
